Although she had multiple trauma, she's out of mortal danger.
Although the wounds weren't life-threatening, it was urgent to bring him directly into ambulance.
Although visual acuity was not significantly worse in older patients in the group (chi2=3.20, df=4, P>.50), it did deteriorate with age in one third of the families.
Among 758 first-degree relatives, a significant cancer excess was observed (34:20.68), attributable largely to cancer of soft tissue and bone (6:0.44) and breast (9:3.39) and to cancers occurring before age 35 years (12:4.14).
Among these loci, we identified variants in 3p21.31, NKX2-3 and CCNY as susceptibility factors for both diseases, whereas variants in PTPN2, HERC2 and STAT3 were associated only with ulcerative colitis in our sample collection.

One propositus was found to have a heterozygous deletion of 213 kb at locus 7q21.11, confirmed by real-time qPCR, deleting 11 of the 17 SEMA3A exons.
Only four regions of the genome outside IDDM1/MHC, which was still the only major locus detected, were not excluded at lambda(s)=3 and lod=-2, of which two showed evidence of linkage: chromosome 10p13-p11 (maximum lod score (MLS)=4.7, P=3x10(-6), lambda(s)=1.56) and chromosome 16q22-16q24 (MLS=3.4, P=6.5x10(-5), lambda(s)=1.6).
Only PGE2 levels (normal range: 2.0-16.4 ng/h per 1.73 m2) are elevated in Bartter syndrome (median: 43.4, range: 6.7-166.3), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (46.2, 12.1-1290), Fanconi syndrome (96.6, 19.3-135.5), and in a complex tubular disorder in premature infants (40.7, 22.3-132.1), for which the term hyperprostaglandin E syndrome has been introduced.
Our business company was founded in 1912 by the singer and entertainer Michel Seile.
Our patient has a deletion of 4q34.2 to 4qter and has palate and cardiac involvement and minor learning difficulties, which implies that genes involved in heart and palate development lie distal to 4q34.2, and that the critical region for more severe mental retardation on 4q may reside proximal to 4q34.2.
Our results permit further regional assignment for the following five genes on human chromosome 19: GPI in the region cen-q12, MANB in p13.2-q12, E11S and RDRC in q13.1-qter, and EF2 in pter-q12.
Our study found no significant difference between frequencies for PTPRC C77G by either genotype (Chi(2)=0.65, P=0.72) or allele (Chi(2)=0.48, P=0.49). 
Overall, persons with Down syndrome had higher mortality than the reference cohort but to a lesser degree for persons with mosaic trisomy 21 than for persons with standard trisomy 21 or with Robertsonian translocations (hazard ratio 4.98 (95% confidence interval 3.51-7.08), 8.94 (8.32-9.60), and 10.23 (7.50-13.97), respectively).

Polymorphisms that mapped to the YACs in this contig were genotyped in this family and used to provide statistical support for narrowing of the critical genetic interval to 3 cM, corresponding to a maximum possible physical distance of 4.0 Mb.
Recently a quantitative Southern blotting procedure was found to improve this frequency (C. Stolle et al., Hum. Mutat., 12: 417-423, 1998).
Recently we constructed a 2.4-Mb, P1-derived artificial chromosome contig spanning the DD candidate region on chromosome 12q23-24.1.
Repeatedly, the plasmas of the two sisters have contained 27.1 and 17.7 mg/100 ml of beta-sitosterol, 9.7 and 8.2 mg/100 ml of campesterol, and 0.5 and 0.5 mg/100 ml of stigmasterol, respectively.

She told me that he lived in 23213 Edinburgh, Worcesterstreet 12.
She wanted me to show her some famous sights, like the Brandenburger Tor and the Reichstag. 
Similarly, we did not find evidence to suggest an association between PTPRC C772T by genotype (Chi(2)=1.06, P=0.59) or allele (Chi(2)=0.20, P=0.66).
Since then, our guests have to ring at Veilchenstra�e 11 if they want to visit us, Luise and George Bauer.
Six extended dyslexic families with at least four affected individuals were genotyped with markers in three chromosomal regions: 6p23-p21.3, 15pter-qter, and 16pter-qter.

The main characters that unite them are 11-segmented antennae, the spatulate sting appendage, and the approximately rectangular nodiform shape of the petiolar node. Other group characters of less diagnostic value are the comparatively large body size, an armed propodeum, sculptured mandibles, and generally sculptured waist segments. 
The most common mutations were as follows: large scale deletions/conversions (45% of the affected chromosomes), the intron 2 splice mutation (30.3%), R357W (9.8%), and I172N (7.0%).
The most likely locus order and map distances (in centimorgans) are Xpter-DXS16-(3.4)-(DXS207, DXS43, DXS1053)-(2.0)-(DXS999, DXS257)-(1.7)-AFM291 wf5-(1.4) - DXS443 - (2.0) - (DXS1229, DXS365) - (2.1) - (DXS1052, DXS274, DXS41)-Xcen.
The most species-poor is the T. jedi species complex with just the three species Tetramorium avaratra sp. n., Tetramorium jedi sp. n., and Tetramorium pleganon Bolton. 
The name Tetramorium robustior Forel is proposed as junior synonym of T. andrei. 
The party starts at  9 p.m.
The police arrived ten minutes later and brought the woman into hospital.
The QT variability index was higher in HCM patients than in controls (-1.24+/-0.17 versus -1. 58+/-0.38, P<0.01), and the greatest abnormality was detected in patients with the Arg(403)Gln mutation (-0.99+/-0.49 versus -1. 46+/-0.43 in controls, P<0.05).

They look amazing, I love the colour.
This genetic risk factor is present on a segment of a highly conserved ancestral A1-B8-DRB1*03 ( 8 . 1 ) haplotype .
This identified 13 BACs that were further characterized by PCR amplification of seven contiguous regions of the entire cDNA sequence .
This information increases our ability to predict IDDM by genetic typing: in the population studied, heterozygotes DR3/[DQ3.2, Dw4] or DR3/[DQ3.2, Dw10] had a relative risk of 38.0 and an absolute risk of 1 in 15.
This mapping region overlaps that of XLMR with IGHD, recently reported by Hamel et al. [1996: Am J Med Genet 64:35-41] (Xq24-q27.3), and that of agammaglobulinemia with IGHD (Xq21.33-q22.2).
This syndrome conforms to that first described by Cumming et al. [Am. J. Med. Genet. 25:783-790, 1986].
Three disease-genes were found in three different cases: KAL1 in dupXp22.31, STS in another dupXp22.31 and TCF2 in dup17q12.
Thus, two distinct types of mutations can produce male pseudohermaphroditism due to deficient dihydrotestosterone formation.
TITLE : 
Twenty-four species are recognised of which 18 are described as new and six re-described. This raises the species richness for the genus Tetramorium in the Malagasy region to 84 species. 
Using a genomewide search strategy, we identified genetic linkage (Zmax=5.05, straight theta=.00) for the HGF phenotype to polymorphic markers in the genetic region of chromosome 2p21 bounded by the loci D2S1788 and D2S441.
Valvar heart disease was investigated by cardiac ultrasound and left heart catheterisation . 
von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominantly inherited cancer syndrome predisposing to a variety of tumor types that include retinal hemangioblastomas, hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, renal cell carcinomas, pancreatic cysts and tumors, pheochromocytomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, and epididymal cystadenomas [W. M. Linehan et al., J. Am. Med. Assoc., 273: 564-570, 1995; E. A. Maher and W. G. Kaelin, Jr., Medicine (Baltimore), 76: 381-391, 1997; W. M. Linehan and R. D. Klausner, In: B. Vogelstein and K. Kinzler (eds.), The Genetic Basis of Human Cancer, pp. 455-473, McGraw-Hill, 1998].
We addressed the metabolic basis of this inherited disorder by studying the in vivo metabolism of LDL in 3 probands from these 2 families.
We conclude that the mutations in the Dallas and Dominican Republic families are similar and result in low activity of the enzyme as the result of a decreased affinity for testosterone.
We describe three families segregating different reciprocal chromosome translocations, t(7;18)(p21.2;q23), t(2;7)(q21.1;p21.2), and t(5;7)(p15.3;p21.2).
We find that (a) IDDM is approximately equally associated with alleles of the DRB1 locus (Dw4 and Dw10, combined relative risk, RR = 6.4) and the DQB1 locus (DQ3.2, RR = 5.9); and (b) there is significant interaction, in a statistical sense, between these DR and DQ alleles in IDDM.
We got married on March 11, 1995. 
We have performed in situ hybridization of meiotic pachytene bivalents with 3H-labeled cloned genomic probes of PTH, beta-globin, and insulin genes and find their germ-line positions to be the following: PTH at 11p11.21, beta-globin at 11p11.22, and insulin at 11p14.1.
We have previously shown (K. Kas et al, Nat. Genet., 15: 170-174, 1997) that the developmentally regulated zinc finger gene pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) is the target gene in 8q12 in pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary glands with t(3;8)(p21;q12) translocations.
We have shown that in pairwise linkage analysis the strongest support for linkage to the A-T gene was with the STMY/CJ52.75 locus (Z = 5.59, theta = 0.0).
We have studied the linkage disequilibrium between four polymorphic markers from this locus (KM.19, CS.7, XV-2c, and PT-3) and the CF mutation (CF) in 127 Italian families.
We live in B�rgerstra�e 2 in 63737 Heidelberg.
We obtained an MLS of 5 . 1 ( IBD 67 . 3% ) at 3q13 .
We previously mapped the MGA1 locus by linkage analysis in Finnish and Norwegian families to a 6-cM region on chromosome 10p12.1 (ref. 8).
We replicated the previously reported association with interleukin 23 receptor and interleukin 12B ( IL12B ) polymorphisms in PS and PSA cohorts ( IL23R : rs11209026 , U . S . PS , P = 1 . 4�10 −4 ; U . K . PSA : P = 8 . 0�10 −4 ; IL12B : rs6887695 , U . S . PS , P = 5�10 −5 and U . K . PSA , P = 1 . 3�10 −3 ) and detected an independent association in the IL23R region with a SNP 4 kb upstream from IL12RB2 ( P = 0 . 001 ) .
We report on 2 cases with different de novo unbalanced mosaic karyotypes in which each cell line had a different structural abnormality involving a common chromosome region: 46,XX,del(11)(q23.3)/46,XX.-11, + der(11)t(11;?)(q23.3;?) and 46,X,idic(Xq)/46,X,idic(Xq),-12, + der(12)t(X;12)(p11.2;p13.3).
We report on a child with congenital heart disease (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, pulmonic stenosis), submucosal cleft palate, hypernasal speech, learning difficulties, and right fifth finger anomaly manifestations, consistent with velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS); however, cytogenetic analysis demonstrated a small terminal deletion of the segment 4q34.2 to 4qter.
We report on a family in which SVAS is cosegregating with a balanced reciprocal translocation, t(6:7) (p21.1;q11.23), providing further evidence that SVAS is the result of a mutation of elastin at 7q11.23 region.
We report significant evidence for linkage to chromosome 3q13 . 31 for rhinitis ( MLS 5 . 55 , identity by descent ( IBD ) 63 . 9% ) and atopy ( increased specific immunoglobulin E ) ( MLS 3 . 71 , IBD 61 . 7% ) .
When George Miller, a tourist from England, came to Munich, he had no idea how to read the city maps.
When I was 21, I moved out from my parents' home into my first own appartment in order to study in a bigger city.
When taken together with previous studies, our results suggest the following physical gene map: pter-LDLR-C3-p13.2-PEPD-centromere-(APOE, APOC1, APOC2, GPI)-qter.
Where did you get those great shoes? 
Women with PKD2 had a significantly longer median survival than men (71.0 [67.4-74.8] vs 67.3 [64.9-69.7] years), but no sex influence was apparent in PKD1.
Yaron Tomer for sharing his results with us prior to publication and to Drs . D . Carr , D . M . Large , and D . Trump , The British Thyroid Foundation , and Thyroid Eye Disease for help with recruitment of patients .
Yeah for sure.
Yeah she's my best friend.
Yes, it definitely is.
Yesterday, she arrived in Berlin and we met up spontaneously.
