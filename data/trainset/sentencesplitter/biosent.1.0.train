Last September, I tried to find out the address of an old school friend whom I hadnt't seen for 15 years.
I just knew his name, Alan McKennedy, and I'd heard the rumour that he'd moved to Scotland, the country of his ancestors.
So I called Julie, a friend who's still in contact with him.
She told me that he lived in 23213 Edinburgh, Worcesterstreet 12.
I wrote him a letter right away and he answered soon, sounding very happy and delighted.
Last year, I wanted to write a letter to my grandaunt.
Her 86th birthday was on October 6, and I no longer wanted to be hesitant to get in touch with her.
I didn`t know her face-to-face, and so it wasn't easy for me to find out her address. 
As she had two apartments in different countries, I decided to write to both. 
The first was in 12424 Paris in Rue-de-Grandes-Illusions 5. 
But Marie Clara, as my aunt is called, prefered her apartment in Berlin. 
It's postcode is 30202.
She lived there, in beautiful Kaiserstra�e 13, particulary in summer.
Hi my name is Michael Graf, how much is a taxi from Ostbahnhof to Hauptbahnhof?
About 10 Euro, I reckon.
That sounds good.
So please call a driver to Leonardstra�e 112, near the Ostbahnhof in 56473 Hamburg.
I'd like to be at Silberhornstra�e 12 as soon as possible.
Thank you very much!
Hi Mike, it's Stefanie Schmidt. 
I'm in N�rnberg at the moment and I've got the problem that my bike has broken.
Could you please pick me up from Seidlstra�e 56, I'm in the Caf� "Mondnacht" at the moment.
Please hurry up, I need to be back in Ulm at 8 p.m.!
My husband George and me recently celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary.
We got married on March 11, 1995. 
Therefore, we found a photo album with pictures of our first own apartment, which was in 81234 Munich.
As a young married couple, we didn't have enough money to afford a bigger lodge than this one in Blumenweg 1.
But only five years later, my husband was offered a well-payed job in 17818 Hamburg, so we moved there.
Since then, our guests have to ring at Veilchenstra�e 11 if they want to visit us, Luise and George Bauer.
I read your help-wanted ad with great attention. 
I'm a student of informatics, 6th semester, and I'm very interested in your part-time job offer. 
I have a competent knowledge of programming and foreign languages, like French and Italian.
I'm looking forward to your reply.
Alisa Fernandes, a tourist from Spain, went to the reception desk of the famous Highfly-Hotel in 30303 Berlin.
As she felt quite homesick, she asked the staff if they knew a good Spanish restaurant in Berlin.
The concierge told her to go to the "Tapasbar" in Chesterstr. 2. 
Alisa appreciated the hint and enjoyed a delicious traditional meal.
An old friend from France is currently travelling around Europe.
Yesterday, she arrived in Berlin and we met up spontaneously.
She wanted me to show her some famous sights, like the Brandenburger Tor and the Reichstag. 
But it wasn't easy to meet up in the city because she hardly knows any streetname or building. 
So I proposed to meet at a quite local point: the caf� "Daily's" in Unter-den-Linden 18, 30291 Berlin.
It is five minutes away from the underground station "Westbad". 
She found it instantly and we spent a great day in the capital.
Where did you get those great shoes? 
They look amazing, I love the colour.
Are they made of leather?
No, that's faked. 
But anyway, I like them too. 
I got them from Hamburg.
Don't you know the famous shop in Veilchenstra�e?
It's called "Twentytwo".
I've never heard of that before.
Could you give me the complete address?
Sure, it's in Veilchenstra�e 12, in 78181 Hamburg.
I deem it best to write a letter to the owner if the shoes are still available.
His name is Gerhard Fritsch.
Hi, am I talking to the inquiries?
My name is Mike Sander and I'd like to know if it is possible to get information about an address if I merely know the name and the phone number of a person!
How is he or she called?
His name is Stefan Miller and his number is the 030/827234.
I'll have a look in the computer. 
I found a Stefan Miller who lives in Leipzig. 
Is that right?
Yes, it definitely is.
So Stefan Miller lives in Heinrich-Heine-Stra�e 112, in 20193 Leipzig.
Thank you very much for the information. 
Bye!
On July 14, the father of a family got painfully injured after he had tried to start a barbecue.
The flaring flames burnt instantly through his jacket, which he managed to pull off last-minute.
Although the wounds weren't life-threatening, it was urgent to bring him directly into ambulance.
But the only hospital that had opened that Sunday was the Paracelsus Hospital in 83939 Weilheim, which was 2 hours away.
Convulsed with pain, the man finally arrived in Stifterstra�e 15, where the personal immediately took care of him.
Last year, I worked as a delivery boy for a small local magazine.
I worked in the area of 83454 Ottobrunn.
I had a list with the home addresses of our costumers whom I brought their papers once a week.
An elderly lady, who was called Elenor Meier, lived in G�rtnerweg 6, and I always drove there first, because I liked her the most.
Afterwards, I went to a student, Gina Schneider, who lived still in her parent's house in G�rtnerweg 25.
The last in line was the retired teacher Bruno Schulz in Dramenstra�e 15.
He was friendly enough to tip sometimes.
Our business company was founded in 1912 by the singer and entertainer Michel Seile.
He opened the first agency in Erding, a small town near Munich.
Now, more than 90 years of turbulent ups and downs later, we finally decided to situate our company in a more central and frequented area.
Last year, we moved into an empty factory building in 30303 Berlin. 
It is located in Barmerstr. 
When George Miller, a tourist from England, came to Munich, he had no idea how to read the city maps.
He depended completely on the help and information of German pedestrians.
One day, he simply could not find the famous Lenbachhaus. 
So he asked a young woman for help.
She pointed at a street sign and explained to him that he'd find the Lenbachhaus in Luisenstra�e 33, which is in 80333 Munich.
Miller was very grateful and could finally enjoy the exhibition.
On March 15, there was an accident near Munich.
The driver got badly injured.
Driving alone not far from her home, the middle-aged woman crashed at high speed into a tree. 
A resident, who lives near the street where the accident took place, called instantly the police. 
He reported what had happened and gave his name and address to the officer.
He's called Peter Schubert and he lives at Max-L�w-Stra�e 13 in 84630 Gauting.
The police arrived ten minutes later and brought the woman into hospital.
Although she had multiple trauma, she's out of mortal danger.
Hi, how are you? 
Arent't you a friend of Natalie?
Yeah for sure.
How did you know that?
I saw you sitting next to her at uni.
Yeah she's my best friend.
Are you going to her party next friday?
Oh yes, I'd really like to.
But in fact I don't know yet where it takes place.
I can tell you: ring at Baumann, Meisenstra�e 5, in 81737 Munich.
The party starts at  9 p.m.
I hope you'll find it.
Thank you very much, see you next friday!
My name is Michael Hinterhofer. 
When I was 21, I moved out from my parents' home into my first own appartment in order to study in a bigger city.
My new home was in Lilienstra�e 1 in 25334 Hamburg.
But I realized quickly that life in a metropolis wasn't relaxed enough for me.
So I decided to move into a smaller town.
Now I'm a tenant with an elderly widow. 
We live in B�rgerstra�e 2 in 63737 Heidelberg.
I really like the smalltown flair and my studies at Heidelberg's notable university.
The stock rose by 3.5% yesterday in heavy trading.
Many cases of so-called achondroplasia with clubfoot are examples of diastrophic dwarfism (e.g., Kite, 1964).
Around 230 species are found in the Afrotropical region (Bolton, 1976, 1980, 1985; Hita Garcia et al. 2010a, 2010b, 2010c).
Nevertheless, we are not sure if all the species currently placed in the T. tortuosum group represent a natural group that shares common ancestry or if they are convergent lineages within the species-rich genus Tetramorium. 
The main characters that unite them are 11-segmented antennae, the spatulate sting appendage, and the approximately rectangular nodiform shape of the petiolar node. Other group characters of less diagnostic value are the comparatively large body size, an armed propodeum, sculptured mandibles, and generally sculptured waist segments. 
Taking into consideration the large number of species and species groups worldwide, the above-listed characters might not be sufficient to justify a natural group.
Twenty-four species are recognised of which 18 are described as new and six re-described. This raises the species richness for the genus Tetramorium in the Malagasy region to 84 species. 
The T. kelleri group is endemic to the Malagasy region, and contains the two species T. ankarana sp. n. and T. kelleri Forel. 
The T. tortuosum group is distributed in most zoogeographical regions, but reaches its highest species richness in the Malagasy region with the 22 species treated herein. 
All species are endemic to the island of Madagascar. 
Based on morphological key characters, the group was divided into four species complexes. 
The largest species complex is the T. andrei complex with the nine species: Tetramorium ala sp. n., Tetramorium andohahela sp. n., Tetramorium andrei Forel, Tetramorium electrum Bolton, Tetramorium elf sp. n., Tetramorium isectum Bolton, Tetramorium isoelectrum sp. n., Tetramorium nify sp. n., and Tetramorium voasary sp. n. 
The name Tetramorium robustior Forel is proposed as junior synonym of T. andrei. 
The most species-poor is the T. jedi species complex with just the three species Tetramorium avaratra sp. n., Tetramorium jedi sp. n., and Tetramorium pleganon Bolton. 
The T. noeli species complex holds four species: Tetramorium aherni sp. n., Tetramorium ambanizana sp. n., Tetramorium noeli sp. n., and Tetramorium singletonae sp. n. 
The T. smaug species complex includes the six species: Tetramorium adamsi sp. n., Tetramorium marojejy sp. n., Tetramorium latreillei Forel, Tetramorium nazgul sp. n., Tetramorium sabatra sp. n., and Tetramorium smaug sp. n. 
Furthermore, lectotypes and paralectotypes are designated for T. andrei and T. latreillei. 
Both species groups are fully revised with illustrated identification keys to species level. 
All descriptions/re-descriptions are illustrated with high-quality multifocused montage images, and distribution maps are provided for all treated species. 
In addition, the taxonomic validity, species composition, and biogeography of the entire T. tortuosum species group is discussed on a global basis..
This genetic risk factor is present on a segment of a highly conserved ancestral A1-B8-DRB1*03 ( 8 . 1 ) haplotype .
We obtained an MLS of 5 . 1 ( IBD 67 . 3% ) at 3q13 .
We report significant evidence for linkage to chromosome 3q13 . 31 for rhinitis ( MLS 5 . 55 , identity by descent ( IBD ) 63 . 9% ) and atopy ( increased specific immunoglobulin E ) ( MLS 3 . 71 , IBD 61 . 7% ) .
Following genome‐wide scans on multiple phenotypes , we previously suggested that chromosome 3q13 . 12 -q21 . 2 harbours an allergy locus .
Novel associations replicated in the U . S . PS cohort included the region harboring lipoma HMGIC fusion partner ( LHFP ) and conserved oligomeric golgi complex component 6 ( COG6 ) genes on chromosome 13q13 ( combined P = 2�10 −6 for rs7993214 ; OR = 0 . 71 ) , the late cornified envelope gene cluster ( LCE ) from the Epidermal Differentiation Complex ( PSORS4 ) ( combined P = 6 . 2�10 −5 for rs6701216 ; OR 1 . 45 ) and a region of LD at 15q21 ( combined P = 2 . 9�10 −5 for rs3803369 ; OR = 1 . 43 ) .
We replicated the previously reported association with interleukin 23 receptor and interleukin 12B ( IL12B ) polymorphisms in PS and PSA cohorts ( IL23R : rs11209026 , U . S . PS , P = 1 . 4�10 −4 ; U . K . PSA : P = 8 . 0�10 −4 ; IL12B : rs6887695 , U . S . PS , P = 5�10 −5 and U . K . PSA , P = 1 . 3�10 −3 ) and detected an independent association in the IL23R region with a SNP 4 kb upstream from IL12RB2 ( P = 0 . 001 ) .
ABSTRACT : 
The genetic mucopolysaccharidosis syndromes ( MPS ) are autosomal recessive inborn errors of metabolism . 
Heart valve involvement in MPS is not uncommon but only a few case reports of successful cardiac surgery are available . 
In particular , reports of combined aortic and mitral stenosis associated with MPS type I-S are very rare . 
Both type I and type VI MPS are associated with significant left sided valvar heart disease that requires surgical valve replacement because of irregular valve thickening , fibrosis , and calcification . 
A 35 year old man had severe mitral valve stenosis after successful surgical replacement of a stenotic aortic valve . 
Valvar heart disease was investigated by cardiac ultrasound and left heart catheterisation . 
Histomorphological characterisation of the affected mitral valve was performed .

Combined aortic and mitral stenosis in mucopolysaccharidosis type I-S ( Ullrich-Scheie syndrome ) .
ABSTRACT : 
Diverse cardiac abnormalities have been reported in patients with the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome ( SGBS ) , and it is suspected that they are related to the apparently high incidence of early death .
The case illustrates typically associated clinical features of cardiac and extracardiac abnormalities found in MPS type I-S . 
PMID : PM10232747
TITLE : 
Cardiac anomalies in the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome .
In order to characterize the CAR gene , we screened a bacterial artificial chromosomal ( BAC ) library ( RPCI11 ) using a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) product derived from the 3 end of the CAR cDNA sequence . 
This identified 13 BACs that were further characterized by PCR amplification of seven contiguous regions of the entire cDNA sequence .

TITLE : 
Further Evidence for a Susceptibility Locus on Chromosome 20q13 . 11 in Families with Dominant Transmission of Graves Disease ABSTRACT : We are grateful to Dr .
Yaron Tomer for sharing his results with us prior to publication and to Drs . D . Carr , D . M . Large , and D . Trump , The British Thyroid Foundation , and Thyroid Eye Disease for help with recruitment of patients .
Associated abnormalities in our series of 58 patients included cardiomyopathy (51.7%), diabetes mellitus (19.0%), optic atrophy (5.2%), nerve deafness (5.2%) and congenital malformations (6.9%).
Median age at death or onset of end-stage renal disease was 53.0 years (95% CI 51.2-54.8) in individuals with PKD1, 69.1 years (66.9-71.3) in those with PKD2, and 78.0 years (73.8-82.2) in controls.
Women with PKD2 had a significantly longer median survival than men (71.0 [67.4-74.8] vs 67.3 [64.9-69.7] years), but no sex influence was apparent in PKD1.
Age at presentation with kidney failure was later in PKD2 than in PKD1 (median age 74.0 [67.2-80.8] vs 54.3 [52.7-55.9] years).
Polymorphisms that mapped to the YACs in this contig were genotyped in this family and used to provide statistical support for narrowing of the critical genetic interval to 3 cM, corresponding to a maximum possible physical distance of 4.0 Mb.
The most common mutations were as follows: large scale deletions/conversions (45% of the affected chromosomes), the intron 2 splice mutation (30.3%), R357W (9.8%), and I172N (7.0%).
Child with velocardiofacial syndrome and del (4)(q34.2): another critical region associated with a velocardiofacial syndrome-like phenotype.
We report on a child with congenital heart disease (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, pulmonic stenosis), submucosal cleft palate, hypernasal speech, learning difficulties, and right fifth finger anomaly manifestations, consistent with velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS); however, cytogenetic analysis demonstrated a small terminal deletion of the segment 4q34.2 to 4qter.
In previously reported 4q deletions with a breakpoint distal to 4q34.2, no cardiac defects or cleft of palate were reported.
Our patient has a deletion of 4q34.2 to 4qter and has palate and cardiac involvement and minor learning difficulties, which implies that genes involved in heart and palate development lie distal to 4q34.2, and that the critical region for more severe mental retardation on 4q may reside proximal to 4q34.2.
We have previously shown (K. Kas et al, Nat. Genet., 15: 170-174, 1997) that the developmentally regulated zinc finger gene pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) is the target gene in 8q12 in pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary glands with t(3;8)(p21;q12) translocations.
This syndrome conforms to that first described by Cumming et al. [Am. J. Med. Genet. 25:783-790, 1986].
We addressed the metabolic basis of this inherited disorder by studying the in vivo metabolism of LDL in 3 probands from these 2 families.
125I-LDL turnover studies disclosed a marked reduction in the fractional catabolic rate (0.19+/-0.01 versus 0.36+/-0.03 pools per day, respectively; P<0.001) and a significant increase in the production rate [20.7+/-4.4 versus 14. 0+/-2.4 mg. kg-1. d-1, respectively; P<0.01] of LDL apoB in the probands compared with normolipidemic controls.
Recently we constructed a 2.4-Mb, P1-derived artificial chromosome contig spanning the DD candidate region on chromosome 12q23-24.1.
We previously mapped the MGA1 locus by linkage analysis in Finnish and Norwegian families to a 6-cM region on chromosome 10p12.1 (ref. 8).
All had controlled acid hypersecretion and were assessed yearly, with a mean follow-up period of 13.8+/-0.6 years (range, 0.1 to 31 years).
At the cell surface, HFE complexes with transferrin receptor (TfR), increasing the dissociation constant of transferrin (Tf) for its receptor 10-fold (Gross, C. N., Irrinki, A., Feder, J. N., and Enns, C. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 22068-22074; Feder, J. N., Penny, D. M., Irrinki, A., Lee, V. K., Lebron, J. A., Watson, N. , Tsuchihashi, Z., Sigal, E., Bjorkman, P. J., and Schatzman, R. C. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A 95, 1472-1477).
In four of these tumors, the translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) was reciprocal.
The two other tumors had complex translocations: t(X;18;21)(p11.2;q11.2;p13) and t(X;15;18)(p11.2;q23;q11.2).
Our results permit further regional assignment for the following five genes on human chromosome 19: GPI in the region cen-q12, MANB in p13.2-q12, E11S and RDRC in q13.1-qter, and EF2 in pter-q12.
Only PGE2 levels (normal range: 2.0-16.4 ng/h per 1.73 m2) are elevated in Bartter syndrome (median: 43.4, range: 6.7-166.3), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (46.2, 12.1-1290), Fanconi syndrome (96.6, 19.3-135.5), and in a complex tubular disorder in premature infants (40.7, 22.3-132.1), for which the term hyperprostaglandin E syndrome has been introduced.
All of the group E fibroblast strains were twice as sensitive to 254 nm UV killing [n (extrapolation number) = 1.3-1.8, Do (mean lethal dose) = 2.2-2.8 J/m2)] as normal fibroblasts (n = 1.5, Do = 5.0 J/m2).
When taken together with previous studies, our results suggest the following physical gene map: pter-LDLR-C3-p13.2-PEPD-centromere-(APOE, APOC1, APOC2, GPI)-qter.
Among 758 first-degree relatives, a significant cancer excess was observed (34:20.68), attributable largely to cancer of soft tissue and bone (6:0.44) and breast (9:3.39) and to cancers occurring before age 35 years (12:4.14).
The following clonal structural aberrations were recognized: del(1)(p22), del(1)(q23), t(7;?)(p22;?), i(17q), and t(19;?)(q13;?).
We have performed in situ hybridization of meiotic pachytene bivalents with 3H-labeled cloned genomic probes of PTH, beta-globin, and insulin genes and find their germ-line positions to be the following: PTH at 11p11.21, beta-globin at 11p11.22, and insulin at 11p14.1.
Besides beta-sitosterolemia and xanthomatosis, no other physical, mental, or biochemical abnormalities were detected.
Repeatedly, the plasmas of the two sisters have contained 27.1 and 17.7 mg/100 ml of beta-sitosterol, 9.7 and 8.2 mg/100 ml of campesterol, and 0.5 and 0.5 mg/100 ml of stigmasterol, respectively.
Association of del(11)(p15.1p12), aniridia, catalase deficiency, and cardiomyopathy.
The differences between these two common familial forms of hypertriglyceridemia provide further support that they are distinct entities.-Brunzell, J. D., J. J. Albers, A. Chait, S. M. Grundy, E. Groszek, and G. B. McDonald.
As a group these individuals, particularly the males, show a tendency to express type III HLP, but clearly genetic or environmental factors other than the apoE phenotype E2/2 are required for the full phenotypic expression of this disease.-Breslow, J. L., V. I. Zannis, T. R. SanGiacomo, J. L. H. C. Third, T. Tracy, and C. J. Glueck.
Lysates of individual colonies of E.coli, containing full-length PCR-amplification products in the expression vector, pKK388.1, were tested for CBS activity.
We describe three families segregating different reciprocal chromosome translocations, t(7;18)(p21.2;q23), t(2;7)(q21.1;p21.2), and t(5;7)(p15.3;p21.2).
Fifteen patients aged 11-25 years (mean 15.37, SD 3.89) suffering from juvenile absence epilepsy are presented.
The most likely locus order and map distances (in centimorgans) are Xpter-DXS16-(3.4)-(DXS207, DXS43, DXS1053)-(2.0)-(DXS999, DXS257)-(1.7)-AFM291 wf5-(1.4) - DXS443 - (2.0) - (DXS1229, DXS365) - (2.1) - (DXS1052, DXS274, DXS41)-Xcen.
We report on a family in which SVAS is cosegregating with a balanced reciprocal translocation, t(6:7) (p21.1;q11.23), providing further evidence that SVAS is the result of a mutation of elastin at 7q11.23 region.
We report on 2 cases with different de novo unbalanced mosaic karyotypes in which each cell line had a different structural abnormality involving a common chromosome region: 46,XX,del(11)(q23.3)/46,XX.-11, + der(11)t(11;?)(q23.3;?) and 46,X,idic(Xq)/46,X,idic(Xq),-12, + der(12)t(X;12)(p11.2;p13.3).
Six extended dyslexic families with at least four affected individuals were genotyped with markers in three chromosomal regions: 6p23-p21.3, 15pter-qter, and 16pter-qter.
The El-1 locus in the mouse is homologous to human chromosomes 3p23-p21.2, 3p11.2-q11.2, 3q21-q25.3, 6p12-q12 and 15q24.
There were highly significant differences in plasma concentrations and activities of paraoxonase between genotypes defined by the 54 polymorphism: MMAA, MLAA, LLAA; protein, 65.3+/-18.0, 77.9+/-18.0, 93.5+/-26.0 microg/ml; P < 0.0001: activity (phenylacetate), 48.6+/-13.5, 64.1+/-14.5, 68.1+/-13.0 U/ml; P < 0.0001.
Homozygosity for the L allele was an independent risk factor for CVD (odds ratio 1.98 (1.07-3.83); P = 0.031).
The genotype frequencies were similar in cases and control subjects in the high-risk population of Belfast and in France; however, the TNF-alpha/-308A allele was more frequent in Belfast than in France (0.242 vs. 0.157; P < 0.0001), and carriers of this allele were more frequently obese than non-carriers [1.52 (1.15-1.99), P < 0.004].
This mapping region overlaps that of XLMR with IGHD, recently reported by Hamel et al. [1996: Am J Med Genet 64:35-41] (Xq24-q27.3), and that of agammaglobulinemia with IGHD (Xq21.33-q22.2).
Although visual acuity was not significantly worse in older patients in the group (chi2=3.20, df=4, P>.50), it did deteriorate with age in one third of the families.
Using a genomewide search strategy, we identified genetic linkage (Zmax=5.05, straight theta=.00) for the HGF phenotype to polymorphic markers in the genetic region of chromosome 2p21 bounded by the loci D2S1788 and D2S441.
Only four regions of the genome outside IDDM1/MHC, which was still the only major locus detected, were not excluded at lambda(s)=3 and lod=-2, of which two showed evidence of linkage: chromosome 10p13-p11 (maximum lod score (MLS)=4.7, P=3x10(-6), lambda(s)=1.56) and chromosome 16q22-16q24 (MLS=3.4, P=6.5x10(-5), lambda(s)=1.6).
Besides beta-sitosterolemia and xanthomatosis, no other physical, mental, or biochemical abnormalities were detected.
Repeatedly, the plasmas of the two sisters have contained 27.1 and 17.7 mg/100 ml of beta-sitosterol, 9.7 and 8.2 mg/100 ml of campesterol, and 0.5 and 0.5 mg/100 ml of stigmasterol, respectively.
