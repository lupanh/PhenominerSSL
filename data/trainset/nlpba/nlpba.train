<START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> expression and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation through <START:ggp> CD28 <END> requires reactive oxygen production by <START:ggp> 5-lipoxygenase <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> CD28 surface receptor <END> provides a major costimulatory signal for T cell activation resulting in enhanced production of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) and cell proliferation . 
In <START:ana> primary T lymphocytes <END> we show that <START:ggp> CD28 <END> ligation leads to the rapid intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) which are required for <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -mediated activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> / <START:ggp> CD28-responsive complex <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression . 
Delineation of the <START:ggp> CD28 <END> signaling cascade was found to involve <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase <END> activity , followed by the activation of <START:ggp> phospholipase A2 <END> and <START:ggp> 5-lipoxygenase <END> . 
Our data suggest that <START:ggp> lipoxygenase metabolites <END> activate ROI formation which then induce <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression via <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
These findings should be useful for therapeutic strategies and the development of immunosuppressants targeting the <START:ggp> CD28 <END> costimulatory pathway . 
The <START:ggp> peri-kappa B site <END> mediates <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 2 enhancer <END> activation in <START:ana> monocytes <END> but not in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 ( HIV-2 ) , like HIV-1 , causes AIDS and is associated with AIDS cases primarily in West Africa . 
HIV-1 and HIV-2 display significant differences in nucleic acid sequence and in the natural history of clinical disease . 
Consistent with these differences , we have previously demonstrated that the <START:ggp> enhancer/promoter region <END> of HIV-2 functions quite differently from that of HIV-1 . 
Whereas activation of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 enhancer <END> following T-cell stimulation is mediated largely through binding of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> to two adjacent <START:ggp> kappa B sites <END> in the <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> , activation of the <START:ggp> HIV-2 enhancer <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> is dependent on four <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> : a single <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> , two <START:ggp> purine-rich binding sites <END> , <START:ggp> PuB1 <END> and <START:ggp> PuB2 <END> , and a <START:ggp> pets site <END> . 
We have now identified a novel <START:ggp> cis-acting element <END> within the <START:ggp> HIV-2 enhancer <END> , immediately upstream of the <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> , designated <START:ggp> peri-kappa B <END> . 
This site is conserved among isolates of HIV-2 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus , and transfection assays show this site to mediate <START:ggp> HIV-2 enhancer <END> activation following stimulation of <START:ana> monocytic <END> but not <START:ana> T-cell lines <END> . 
This is the first description of an <START:ggp> HIV-2 enhancer element <END> which displays such monocyte specificity , and no comparable <START:ggp> enhancer element <END> has been clearly defined for HIV-1 . 
While a <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> ( s ) from both <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> binds the <START:ggp> peri-kappa B site <END> , electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that either a different protein binds to this site in <START:ana> monocytes <END> versus <START:ana> T cells <END> or that the protein recognizing this <START:ggp> enhancer element <END> undergoes differential modification in <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> , thus supporting the transfection data . 
Further , while specific constitutive binding to the <START:ggp> peri-kappa B site <END> is seen in <START:ana> monocytes <END> , stimulation with phorbol esters induces additional , specific binding . 
Understanding the monocyte-specific function of the <START:ggp> peri-kappa B factor <END> may ultimately provide insight into the different role <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> play in HIV pathogenesis . 
<START:ggp> E1A gene <END> expression induces susceptibility to killing by <START:ana> NK cells <END> following immortalization but not adenovirus infection of <START:ana> human cells <END> . 
Adenovirus ( Ad ) infection and <START:ggp> E1A <END> transfection were used to model changes in susceptibility to NK cell killing caused by transient vs stable <START:ggp> E1A <END> expression in <START:ana> human cells <END> . 
Only stably <START:ana> transfected target cells <END> exhibited cytolytic susceptibility , despite expression of equivalent levels of <START:ggp> E1A proteins <END> in <START:ana> Ad-infected targets <END> . 
The inability of <START:ggp> E1A gene <END> products to induce cytolytic susceptibility during infection was not explained by an inhibitory effect of viral infection on otherwise susceptible <START:ana> target cells <END> or by <START:ggp> viral gene <END> effects on <START:ggp> class I MHC antigen <END> expression on <START:ana> target cells <END> . 
This differential effect of <START:ggp> E1A <END> expression on the cytolytic phenotypes of infected and stably transfected <START:ana> human cells <END> suggests that <START:ana> human NK cells <END> provide an effective immunologic barrier against the in vivo survival and neoplastic progression of <START:ana> E1A-immortalized cells <END> that may emerge from the reservoir of <START:ana> persistently infected cells <END> in the human host . 
Distinct signaling properties identify functionally different <START:ggp> CD4 epitopes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> CD4 coreceptor <END> interacts with <START:ggp> non-polymorphic regions <END> of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex class II molecules <END> on <START:ana> antigen-presenting cells <END> and contributes to T cell activation . 
We have investigated the effect of <START:ggp> CD4 <END> triggering on T cell activating signals in a lymphoma model using <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> ( <START:ggp> mAb <END> ) which recognize different <START:ggp> CD4 epitopes <END> . 
We demonstrate that <START:ggp> CD4 <END> triggering delivers signals capable of activating the <START:ggp> NF-AT transcription factor <END> which is required for <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> gene expression . 
Whereas different <START:ggp> anti-CD4 mAb <END> or <START:ggp> HIV-1 gp120 <END> could all trigger activation of the <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinases <END> <START:ggp> p56lck <END> and <START:ggp> p59fyn <END> and phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> Shc adaptor protein <END> , which mediates signals to <START:ggp> Ras <END> , they differed significantly in their ability to activate <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
Lack of full activation of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> could be correlated to a dramatically reduced capacity to induce calcium flux and could be complemented with a calcium ionophore . 
The results identify functionally distinct <START:ggp> epitopes <END> on the <START:ggp> CD4 coreceptor <END> involved in activation of the <START:ggp> Ras/protein kinase C <END> and calcium pathways . 
Ligand-dependent repression of the <START:ggp> erythroid transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> by the <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> . 
High-dose estrogen administration induces anemia in mammals . 
In chickens , estrogens stimulate outgrowth of <START:ana> bone marrow-derived erythroid progenitor cells <END> and delay their maturation . 
This delay is associated with down-regulation of many <START:ggp> erythroid cell-specific genes <END> , including <START:ggp> alpha- and beta-globin <END> , band 3 , band 4.1 , and the <START:ggp> erythroid cell-specific histone <END> <START:ggp> H5 <END> . 
We show here that estrogens also reduce the number of <START:ana> erythroid progenitor cells <END> in <START:ana> primary human bone marrow cultures <END> . 
To address potential mechanisms by which estrogens suppress erythropoiesis , we have examined their effects on <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , an <START:ggp> erythroid transcription factor <END> that participates in the regulation of the majority of <START:ggp> erythroid cell-specific genes <END> and is necessary for full maturation of <START:ana> erythrocytes <END> . 
We demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> is strongly repressed by the <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) in a ligand-dependent manner and that this repression is reversible in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen . 
<START:ggp> ER <END> -mediated repression of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> activity occurs on an <START:ggp> artificial promoter <END> containing a single <START:ggp> GATA-binding site <END> , as well as in the context of an <START:ggp> intact promoter <END> which is normally regulated by <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> ER <END> bind to each other in vitro in the absence of DNA . 
In coimmunoprecipitation experiments using transfected <START:ana> COS cells <END> , <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> ER <END> associate in a ligand-dependent manner . 
Mapping experiments indicate that <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and the <START:ggp> ER <END> form at least two contacts , which involve the finger region and the <START:ggp> N-terminal activation domain <END> of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> . 
We speculate that estrogens exert effects on erythropoiesis by modulating <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> activity through protein-protein interaction with the <START:ggp> ER <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
<START:ggp> Mouse interleukin-2 receptor alpha gene <END> expression . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-1 <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> control transcription via distinct <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> . 
We have shown that <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> control <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor alpha ( IL-2R alpha ) gene <END> transcription in <START:ana> CD4-CD8- murine T lymphocyte precursors <END> . 
Here we map the <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> that mediate interleukin responsiveness of the <START:ggp> mouse IL-2R alpha gene <END> using a <START:ana> thymic lymphoma-derived hybridoma <END> ( <START:ana> PC60 <END> ) . 
The transcriptional response of the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha gene <END> to stimulation by <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> + <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> is biphasic . 
<START:ggp> IL-1 <END> induces a rapid , protein synthesis-independent appearance of <START:ana> IL-2R alpha mRNA <END> that is blocked by inhibitors of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
It also primes cells to become <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> responsive and thereby prepares the second phase , in which <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induces a 100-fold further increase in <START:ana> IL-2R alpha transcripts <END> . 
Transient transfection experiments show that several elements in the <START:ggp> promoter-proximal region <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha gene <END> contribute to <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> responsiveness , most importantly an <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> conserved in the <START:ggp> human and mouse gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> responsiveness , on the other hand , depends on a <START:ggp> 78-nucleotide segment <END> 1.3 kilobases upstream of the <START:ggp> major transcription start site <END> . 
This segment functions as an <START:ggp> IL-2-inducible enhancer <END> and lies within a region that becomes <START:ggp> DNase I <END> hypersensitive in normal <START:ana> T cells <END> in which <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> expression has been induced . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> responsiveness requires three distinct <START:ggp> elements <END> within the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> . 
Two of these are potential binding sites for <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> . 
<START:ana> Hematopoietic lineage <END> commitment : role of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
This review focuses on the roles of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in hematopoietic lineage commitment . 
A brief introduction to lineage commitment and asymmetric cell division is followed by a discussion of several methods used to identify <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> important in specifying <START:ana> hematopoietic cell types <END> . 
Next is presented a discussion of the use of <START:ana> embryonic stem cells <END> in the analysis of <START:ggp> hematopoietic gene <END> expression and the use of targeted gene disruption to analyze the role of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in hematopoiesis . 
Finally , the status of our current knowledge concerning the roles of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in the commitment to <START:ana> erythroid , myeloid and lymphoid cell types <END> is summarized . 
Epstein-Barr virus replicative gene transcription during de novo infection of <START:ana> human thymocytes <END> : simultaneous early expression of <START:ggp> BZLF-1 <END> and its repressor <START:ggp> RAZ <END> . 
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is known to infect <START:ana> B cells <END> and <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> . 
We and others have shown that EBV can also infect a subset of <START:ana> thymocytes <END> . 
Infection of <START:ana> thymocytes <END> was accompanied by the appearance of <START:ggp> linear EBV genome <END> within 8 hr of infection . 
Circularization of the <START:ggp> EBV genome <END> was not detected . 
This is in contrast to the infection in <START:ana> B cells <END> where the genome can circularize within 24 hr of infection . 
The appearance of the <START:ggp> BamHI ZLF-1 gene product <END> , <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> , by RT-PCR , was observed within 8 hr of infection . 
The appearance of a novel <START:ggp> fusion transcript <END> ( <START:ggp> RAZ <END> ) , which comprised regions of the <START:ggp> BZLF-1 locus <END> and the adjacent <START:ggp> BRLF-1 locus <END> , was detected by RT-PCR . 
<START:ggp> ZEBRA protein <END> was also identified in infected <START:ana> thymocytes <END> by immunoprecipitation . 
In addition , we demonstrated that the <START:ggp> EBNA-1 gene <END> in infected <START:ana> thymocytes <END> was transcribed from the <START:ggp> Fp promoter <END> , rather than from the <START:ggp> Cp/Wp promoter <END> which is used in <START:ana> latently infected B cells <END> . 
Transcripts encoding <START:ggp> gp350/220 <END> , the <START:ggp> major coat protein <END> of EBV , were identified , but we did not find any evidence of transcription from the <START:ggp> LMP-2A <END> or <START:ggp> EBER-1 loci <END> in infected <START:ana> thymocytes <END> . 
These observations suggest that de novo EBV infection of <START:ana> thymocytes <END> differs from infection of <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
The main difference is that with <START:ana> thymocytes <END> , no evidence could be found that the virus ever circularizes . 
Rather , EBV remains in a linear configuration from which <START:ggp> replicative genes <END> are transcribed . 
Identification and purification of <START:ggp> human Stat proteins <END> activated in response to <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> . 
A key <START:ggp> cytokine <END> induced during the immune response is <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
Following T cell activation , the genes encoding <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and the various chains of its receptor are transcriptionally induced . 
In turn , secreted <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> serves to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Several recent studies have implicated Jak kinases in the signaling pathway induced by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
Following this lead , we set out to identify <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> induced in response to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
<START:ana> Human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> were observed to contain several <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -inducible DNA binding activities . 
Similar activities were also observed in a <START:ana> transformed human lymphocyte line <END> , termed <START:ana> YT <END> . 
We have purified these activities and found that the principal <START:ggp> IL-2-inducible component <END> bears significant relatedness to a <START:ggp> prolactin-induced transcription factor <END> first identified in <START:ana> sheep mammary gland tissue <END> . 
We hypothesize that activation of this protein , designated <START:ggp> hStat5 <END> , helps govern the biological effects of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> during the immune response . 
<START:ggp> E2F-1 <END> and a <START:ggp> cyclin-like DNA repair enzyme <END> , <START:ggp> uracil-DNA glycosylase <END> , provide evidence for an autoregulatory mechanism for transcription . 
The <START:ggp> cell cycle-dependent transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> E2F-1 <END> , regulates the <START:ggp> cyclin <END> -like species of the <START:ggp> DNA repair enzyme <END> <START:ggp> uracil-DNA glycosylase ( UDG ) gene <END> in <START:ana> human osteosarcoma ( Saos-2 ) cells <END> . 
We demonstrate , through the deletion of the <START:ggp> human UDG promoter sequences <END> , that expression of <START:ggp> E2F-1 <END> activates the <START:ggp> UDG promoter <END> through several <START:ggp> E2F sites <END> . 
The <START:ggp> major putative downstream site <END> for <START:ggp> E2F <END> , located in the <START:ggp> first exon <END> , serves as a target for <START:ggp> E2F-1/DP1 complex <END> binding in vitro . 
We also provide evidence for the functional relationship between the <START:ggp> cyclin-like UDG gene product <END> and <START:ggp> E2F <END> . 
High levels of <START:ggp> UDG <END> expression in a transient transfection assay result in the down-regulation of transcriptional activity through <START:ggp> elements <END> specific for <START:ggp> E2F <END> -mediated transcription . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> UDG <END> in <START:ana> Saos 2 cells <END> was observed to delay growth late in G1 phase and transiently arrest these cells from progressing into the S phase . 
This hypothetical model integrates one mechanism of DNA repair with the cell cycle control of gene transcription , likely through <START:ggp> E2F <END> . 
This implicates <START:ggp> E2F <END> as a multifunctional target for proteins and enzymes , possibly , responsive to DNA damage through the negative effect of <START:ggp> UDG <END> on <START:ggp> E2F <END> -mediated transcriptional activity . 
Cellular and molecular mechanisms of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> production induced by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> in a <START:ana> human NK cell line <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) is an important <START:ggp> immunoregulatory protein <END> produced predominantly by <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> large granular lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> LGL <END> ) in response to different extracellular signals . 
In particular , two <START:ggp> interleukins <END> ( <START:ggp> ILs <END> ) , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , have been shown to be potent inducers of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> gene expression in both <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> LGL <END> . 
Although it has been reported that there are some <START:ana> T cell lines <END> that produce <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> in response to IL-2 and IL-12 stimulation , there has as yet been no report of a <START:ana> natural killer ( NK ) cell line <END> that responds in a similar manner . 
In this report we present evidence that the <START:ana> cell line NK3.3 <END> derived from <START:ana> human NK cells <END> , responds to both <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , as measured by increases in <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) cytoplasmic mRNA and protein expression . 
In addition , when used together <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> synergized in the induction of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> and this synergy was attributed to an increased accumulation and stability of the <START:ana> IFN-gamma and GM-CSF mRNAs <END> . 
To investigate the signaling pathways involved in the gene induction , five inhibitors , cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , <START:ggp> transforming growth factor-beta <END> , cycloheximide , genistein , and staurosporine A , were used in analyzing the effects of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> on <START:ana> NK3.3 cells <END> . 
The results suggest that activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> , but not new protein synthesis , is required for <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induction of <START:ana> IFN-gamma and GM-CSF cytoplasmic mRNA <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> induction of <START:ana> IFN-gamma cytoplasmic mRNA <END> appears to only partially depend on activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> . 
Furthermore , both <START:ggp> transforming growth factor-beta <END> and genistein , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , could suppress <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> signaling but CsA was generally inactive . 
It also was observed that suppression of <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> expression by these agents was independent of the inhibition of proliferation . 
In addition , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> but not <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> induced <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP1 <END> , and regulation of the nuclear levels of these two <START:ggp> DNA binding protein complexes <END> is correlated with IFN-gamma and GM-CSF gene expression . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> may have distinct signaling pathways leading to the induction of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> gene expression , and that the <START:ana> NK3.3 cell line <END> may serve as a novel model for dissecting the biochemical and molecular events involved in these pathways . 
A functional <START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> signaling pathway is required for <START:ggp> p95vav <END> activity . 
Stimulation of the <START:ggp> T-cell antigen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) induces activation of multiple <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> , resulting in phosphorylation of numerous intracellular substrates . 
One substrate is <START:ggp> p95vav <END> , which is expressed exclusively in <START:ana> hematopoietic and trophoblast cells <END> . 
It contains a number of <START:ggp> structural motifs <END> , including <START:ggp> Src homology 2 , Src homology 3 , and pleckstrin homology domains <END> and a <START:ggp> putative guanine nucleotide exchange domain <END> . 
The role of <START:ggp> p95vav <END> in <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated signaling processes is unclear . 
Here , we show that overexpression of <START:ggp> p95vav <END> alone in Jurkat <START:ana> T cells <END> leads to activation of the <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> , including <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , involved in <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> expression . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> p95vav <END> synergizes with <START:ggp> TCR <END> stimulation in inducing NFAT- and interleukin-2-dependent transcription . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation by a <START:ggp> G-protein-coupled receptor <END> is not modulated by <START:ggp> p95vav <END> overexpression , suggesting that the effect is specific to the <START:ggp> TCR <END> signaling pathways . 
Although removal of the <START:ggp> first 67 amino acids <END> of <START:ggp> p95vav <END> activates its transforming potential in <START:ana> NIH 3T3 cells <END> , this region appears to be required for its function in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
We further demonstrate that the <START:ggp> p95vav <END> -induced <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation is not mimicked by <START:ggp> Ras <END> activation , though its function is dependent upon <START:ggp> Ras <END> and <START:ggp> Raf <END> . 
Furthermore , the activating function of <START:ggp> p95vav <END> is blocked by FK506 , suggesting that its activity also depends on <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
To further dissect <START:ggp> p95vav <END> involvement in <START:ggp> TCR <END> signaling , we analyzed various <START:ana> Jurkat mutants <END> deficient in <START:ggp> TCR <END> signaling function or <START:ggp> TCR <END> expression and showed that an intact <START:ggp> TCR <END> signaling pathway is required for <START:ggp> p95vav <END> to function . 
However , overexpression of <START:ggp> p95vav <END> does not appear to influence <START:ggp> TCR <END> -induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation or increases in cytoplasmic free calcium . 
Taken together , our data suggest that <START:ggp> p95vav <END> plays an important role at an yet unidentified proximal position in the <START:ggp> TCR <END> signaling cascade . 
Positive and negative regulation of <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> promoter activity by <START:ggp> AML1-related transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> PEBP2 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene promoter <END> contains a consensus sequence for the <START:ggp> polyomavirus enhancer binding-protein 2 ( PEBP2 ) transcription factor <END> , which consists of <START:ggp> alpha and beta subunits <END> . 
There are at least two genes , <START:ggp> alpha A <END> and <START:ggp> alpha B <END> , encoding the <START:ggp> alpha subunit <END> . 
<START:ggp> alpha B <END> is the <START:ggp> mouse homologue <END> of <START:ggp> human AML1 gene <END> detected at the breakpoints of t ( 8 ; 21 ) and t ( 3 ; 21 ) myeloid leukemias . 
We examined <START:ggp> alpha A1 <END> ( an <START:ggp> alpha A-gene product <END> ) and <START:ggp> alpha B1 <END> and <START:ggp> alpha B2 <END> ( two <START:ggp> alpha B-encoded isomers <END> ) for their effects on the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> PEBP2 alpha A1 <END> , <START:ggp> alpha B1 <END> , and <START:ggp> alpha B2 proteins <END> bound the <START:ggp> PEBP2 site <END> within the <START:ggp> mouse GM-CSF promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> PEBP2 alpha A1 <END> and <START:ggp> alpha B1 <END> enhanced the expression of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter-driven reporter plasmid <END> in <START:ana> unstimulated and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate/phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human Jurkat T cells <END> . 
In contrast , the promoter activity was suppressed by <START:ggp> alpha B2 <END> . 
Coexpression of <START:ggp> alpha B1 <END> and <START:ggp> alpha B2 <END> showed that the promoter activity could be determined by the <START:ggp> alpha B1 <END> <START:ggp> /alpha B2 <END> ratio . 
Jurkat cell extract contained <START:ggp> PEBP2 site-binding protein <END> ( s ) that cross-reacted with <START:ggp> antimouse alpha A1 antibodies <END> . 
Northern blot analysis indicated the expression of human <START:ggp> PEBP2 alpha A <END> , <START:ggp> alpha B <END> ( <START:ggp> AML1 <END> ) , and <START:ggp> beta genes <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
Although further studies are required to determine the precise role of <START:ggp> PEBP2 <END> in the <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> promoter activity , the present findings suggested the importance of the relative ratio of different <START:ggp> PEBP2 isoforms <END> in regulating the levels of the promoter activity . 
<START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> priming of <START:ana> monocytes <END> enhances LPS-induced <START:ggp> TNF <END> production by augmenting both transcription and MRNA stability . 
The induction of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression in <START:ana> monocytes <END> / <START:ana> macrophages <END> by <START:ggp> bacterial endotoxin <END> or lipopolysaccharide is a critical , highly regulated host defence response . 
The augmentation of LPS responses by <START:ggp> interferon gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) , referred to as priming , is well established . 
However , the mechanism ( s ) by which priming occurs is poorly defined . 
Using <START:ggp> tumour necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) induction as a model , experiments were designed to analyse in detail the priming effect on the LPS response in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Priming by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> was primarily manifested at the level of <START:ana> TNF mRNA <END> accumulation . 
<START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> pre-treatment affected the magnitude rather than the sensitivity of the LPS response . 
Priming occurred after several hours of treatment , and the primed state was induced by either <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> or <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> , but not <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> . 
Primed <START:ana> monocytes <END> transcribed <START:ana> TNF mRNA <END> at a higher rate than freshly isolated <START:ana> monocytes <END> upon activation with LPS . 
The increased transcriptional rate correlated with a marked increase in <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> activity in these cells as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a <START:ggp> consensus NF-kappa B oligonucleotide <END> . 
An additional significant finding was than <START:ana> TNF mRNA <END> induced in <START:ana> primed cells <END> was much more stable than in <START:ana> unprimed cells <END> ( T1/2 increased 6-8-fold ) . 
Consistent with the increased <START:ana> mRNA <END> stability , the duration of <START:ana> mRNA <END> accumulation was longer following LPS stimulation in primed <START:ana> monocytes <END> , in addition to being of greater magnitude . 
Finally , primed and unprimed cells possessed a differential sensitivity to the kinase inhibitor H-89 . 
H-89 substantially suppressed LPS-induced <START:ana> TNF mRNA <END> accumulation in <START:ana> unprimed cells <END> , but had no effect on <START:ana> primed monocytes <END> following LPS stimulation . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
A <START:ggp> Myc-associated zinc finger protein binding site <END> is one of four important <START:ggp> functional regions <END> in the <START:ggp> CD4 promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> CD4 promoter <END> plays an important role in the developmental control of <START:ggp> CD4 <END> transcription . 
In this report , we show that the minimal <START:ggp> CD4 promoter <END> has four <START:ggp> factor binding sites <END> , each of which is required for full function . 
Using biochemical and mutagenesis analyses , we determined that multiple <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> bind to these independent sites . 
We determined that an <START:ggp> initiator-like sequence <END> present at the <START:ggp> cap site <END> and an <START:ggp> Ets consensus sequence <END> are required for full <START:ggp> promoter <END> function . 
We also demonstrate that the <START:ggp> Myc-associated zinc finger protein <END> ( <START:ggp> MAZ <END> ) appears to be the <START:ggp> predominant factor <END> binding to one of these sites . 
This last site closely resembles the <START:ggp> ME1a1 G3AG4AG3 motif <END> previously shown to be a critical element in the <START:ggp> P2 promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> c-myc gene <END> . 
We therefore believe that the <START:ggp> MAZ transcription factor <END> is also likely to play an important role in the control of developmental expression of the <START:ggp> CD4 gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> Erythropoietin <END> stimulates transcription of the <START:ggp> TAL1/SCL gene <END> and phosphorylation of its <START:ggp> protein products <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> TAL1 ( or SCL ) gene <END> , originally identified through its involvement by a recurrent chromosomal translocation , is the most frequent molecular lesion recognized in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia . 
The <START:ggp> protein products <END> of this gene contain the <START:ggp> basic-helix-loop-helix motif <END> characteristic of a large family of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that bind to the <START:ggp> canonical DNA sequence CANNTG <END> as <START:ggp> protein heterodimers <END> . 
<START:ggp> TAL1 <END> expression by <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> in vivo and in <START:ana> chemical-induced erythroleukemia cell lines <END> in vivo suggested the gene might regulate aspects of erythroid differentiation . 
Since the terminal events of erythropoiesis are controlled by the <START:ggp> glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> Epo <END> ) , we investigated whether the expression or activity of the <START:ggp> TAL1 gene <END> and its <START:ggp> protein products <END> were affected by <START:ggp> Epo <END> in <START:ana> splenic erythroblasts <END> from mice infected with an anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus ( FVA cells ) . 
<START:ggp> Epo <END> elicited a rapid , dose-related increase in <START:ana> TAL1 mRNA <END> by increasing transcription of the gene and stabilizing one of its <START:ana> mRNAs <END> . 
An <START:ggp> Epo <END> -inducible <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> DNA binding activity was identified in FVA cell nuclear extracts that subsequently decayed despite accumulating <START:ana> mRNA <END> and protein . 
Induction of DNA binding activity was associated temporally with <START:ggp> Epo <END> -induced phosphorylation of <START:ggp> nuclear TAL1 protein <END> . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> Epo <END> acts at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels on the <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> locus in <START:ana> Friend virus-induced erythroblasts <END> and establish a link between <START:ggp> Epo <END> signaling mechanisms and a member of a family of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> involved in the differentiation of <START:ana> diverse cell lineages <END> . 
Nonradioactive quantification of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> expression during differentiation of human <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> ( <START:ana> U937 <END> ) . 
We describe a method for relative quantification of specific <START:ana> mRNA <END> using a nonradioactive assay based on DNA strand competition between identical sequences of biotin- and fluorescein-labeled amplicon ( probe ) and unlabeled amplicon ( target ) during hybridization . 
As the target quantity increased , that of the double-labeled probe decreased in accordance with the mass action law . 
This technique was successfully applied to evaluate differences in <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> expression in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> before and after the addition of potent differentiation inducers : 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) and a combination of all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) and 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 ( VD ) . 
We observed that TPA treatment was associated with an increase in specific binding of [ 3H ] dexamethasone and up-regulation of <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> while no enhanced <START:ggp> GR <END> expression was perceived with RA/VD treatment . 
Induction of <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> phosphorylation and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-independent HIV promoter <END> domain activity in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> stimulated by okadaic acid . 
In contrast to the purely enhancer-dependent effect of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> such as <START:ggp> TNF <END> on the activity of the <START:ggp> HIV regulatory region <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) , we observed that okadaic acid ( OKA ) activates HIV transcription through both the enhancer , responding to the factor <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , and the <START:ggp> promoter domain <END> of the <START:ggp> LTR <END> . 
The inducibility of <START:ggp> HIV LTR-driven luciferase expression constructs <END> in <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cells <END> stimulated by OKA depended on both <START:ggp> functional Sp1 binding elements <END> and the ability of the <START:ggp> TATA box <END> to bind the protein <START:ggp> TBP <END> . 
In both <START:ana> transformed and normal lymphocytes <END> , OKA stimulation induced intense phosphorylation of the constitutively expressed <START:ggp> Sp1 protein <END> in the nucleus , a property of OKA not shared by <START:ggp> TNF <END> , phorbol ester , or <START:ggp> PHA <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> . 
Responsiveness of <START:ggp> LTR constructs <END> deleted of <START:ggp> kappa B elements <END> to <START:ggp> HIV Tat <END> expression was increased upon OKA but not <START:ggp> TNF <END> stimulation . 
Our results suggest that <START:ggp> SP1 <END> phosphorylation induced by OKA , a selective inhibitor of the <START:ggp> serine-threonine phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> PP2A <END> , facilitates the formation of a <START:ggp> transcription complex <END> involving general <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> HIV Tat <END> , and <START:ggp> Sp1 proteins <END> . 
The formation of this complex would increase , independently of an in synergy with <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , the low basal activity of the <START:ggp> HIV LTR <END> observed in <START:ana> normal T lymphocytes <END> . 
The role of <START:ggp> shared receptor motifs <END> and <START:ggp> common Stat proteins <END> in the generation of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> pleiotropy and redundancy by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> . 
To understand the molecular bases for cytokine redundancy and pleiotropy , we have compared the <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> activated in <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBLs <END> ) by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> with shared and distinct actions . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) rapidly activated <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> in fresh <START:ana> PBL <END> , and <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> in <START:ana> preactivated PBL <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-7 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> induced the same complexes as <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , a feature explained by the existence of similar <START:ggp> tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs <END> in the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domains <END> of <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> and <START:ggp> IL-7R <END> that can serve as docking sites for <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-13 <END> Induced the same complexes as <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , a finding explained by our studies implicating <START:ggp> IL-4R <END> as a shared component of the <START:ggp> receptors <END> . 
These studies demonstrate that a single <START:ggp> cytokine <END> can activate different combinations of <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> under different physiological conditions , and also indicate two mechanisms by which distinct <START:ggp> cytokines <END> can activate the same <START:ggp> Stat protein <END> . 
Control of <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> proteolysis by site-specific , signal-induced phosphorylation . 
<START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> inhibits <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by retaining it in the cytoplasm . 
Various stimuli , typically those associated with stress or pathogens , rapidly inactivate <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> . 
This liberates <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of <START:ggp> genes <END> important for the defense of the organism . 
Activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> correlates with phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> and requires the proteolysis of this inhibitor . 
When either serine-32 or serine-36 of <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> was mutated , the protein did not undergo signal-induced phosphorylation or degradation , and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> could not be activated . 
These results suggest that phosphorylation at one or both of these residues is critical for activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Regulation of transcription of the <START:ggp> human erythropoietin receptor gene <END> by proteins binding to <START:ggp> GATA-1 and Sp1 motifs <END> . 
<START:ggp> Erythropoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> Epo <END> ) , the primary regulator of the production of <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> , acts by binding to a <START:ggp> cell surface receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> EpoR <END> ) on <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> . 
We used deletion analysis and transfection assays with <START:ggp> reporter gene constructs <END> to examine the <START:ggp> transcription control elements <END> in the <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking region <END> of the <START:ggp> human EpoR gene <END> . 
In <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> most of the transcription activity was contained in a <START:ggp> 150 bp promoter <END> fragment with <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> AP2 <END> , <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and the <START:ggp> erythroid-specific GATA-1 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> 150 bp hEpoR promoter <END> exhibited high and low activity in erythroid <START:ana> OCIM1 <END> and <START:ana> K562 cells <END> , respectively , reflecting the high and low levels of constitutive <START:ggp> hEpoR <END> expression . 
The <START:ggp> GATA-1 and Sp1 binding sites <END> in this promoter lacking a <START:ggp> TATA sequence <END> were necessary for a high level of transcription activation . 
Protein-DNA binding studies suggested that <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and two other <START:ggp> CCGCCC binding proteins <END> from <START:ana> erythroid and non-erythroid cells <END> could bind to the <START:ggp> Sp1 binding motif <END> . 
By increasing <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> levels via co-transfection , we were able to transactivate the <START:ggp> hEpoR promoter <END> in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> and <START:ana> non-erythroid cells <END> , but not in the highly active <START:ana> OCIM1 cells <END> , although <START:ana> GATA-1 mRNA <END> levels were comparable in <START:ana> OCIM1 <END> and <START:ana> K562 <END> . 
Interestingly , when we mutated the <START:ggp> Sp1 site <END> , resulting in a marked decrease in <START:ggp> hEpoR promoter <END> activity , we could restore transactivation by increasing <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> levels in <START:ana> OCIM1 cells <END> . 
These data suggest that while <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> can transactivate the <START:ggp> EpoR promoter <END> , the level of <START:ggp> hEpoR gene <END> expression does not depend on <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> alone . 
Rather , <START:ggp> hEpoR <END> transcription activity depends on coordination between <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> with other <START:ggp> cell-specific factors <END> , including possibly other <START:ggp> Sp1-like binding proteins <END> , to provide high level , tissue-specific expression . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> DR-nm23 <END> , a protein encoded by a member of the <START:ggp> nm23 gene family <END> , inhibits <START:ana> granulocyte <END> differentiation and induces apoptosis in <START:ana> 32Dc13 myeloid cells <END> . 
Chronic myelogenous leukemia evolves in two clinically distinct stages : a chronic and a blast crisis phase . 
The molecular changes associated with chronic phase to blast crisis transition are largely unknown . 
We have identified a <START:ggp> cDNA clone <END> , <START:ggp> DR-nm23 <END> , differentially expressed in a <START:ggp> blast-crisis cDNA library , <END> which has approximately 70 % sequence similarity to the <START:ggp> putative metastatic suppressor genes <END> , <START:ggp> nm23-H1 <END> and <START:ggp> nm23-H2 <END> . 
The deduced amino acid sequence similarity to the proteins encoded by these two latter genes is approximately 65 % and includes domains and amino acid residues ( the <START:ggp> leucine zipper-like <END> and the <START:ggp> RGD domain <END> , a serine and a histidine residue in the <START:ggp> NH2- <END> and in the <START:ggp> COOH-terminal portion <END> of the protein , respectively ) postulated to be important for <START:ggp> nm23 <END> function . 
<START:ana> DR-nm23 mRNA <END> is preferentially expressed at early stages of myeloid differentiation of <START:ana> highly purified CD34+ cells <END> . 
Its constitutive expression in the <START:ana> myeloid precursor 32Dc13 cell line <END> , which is growth-factor dependent for both proliferation and differentiation , results in inhibition of granulocytic differentiation induced by <START:ggp> granulocyte colony-stimulating factor <END> and causes apoptotic cell death . 
These results are consistent with a role for <START:ggp> DR-nm23 <END> in normal hematopoiesis and raise the possibility that its overexpression contributes to differentiation arrest , a feature of blastic transformation in chronic myelogenous leukemia . 
An <START:ggp> interferon-gamma activation sequence <END> mediates the transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> IgG Fc receptor type IC gene <END> by <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> IgG Fc receptor type I <END> ( <START:ggp> Fc gamma RI <END> ) on <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> is dramatically increased by treatment with <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) . 
We observed that <START:ggp> Fc gamma RI <END> transcript levels in <START:ana> monoblast-like U937 cells <END> were elevated within 3 hr and peaked 12 hr after exposure to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
Treatment of <START:ana> U937 <END> with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> for 9 hr in the presence of cycloheximide led to super-induction of <START:ggp> Fc gamma RI <END> expression . 
Nuclear run-on analysis revealed that the rate of <START:ggp> Fc gamma RI <END> transcription was increased by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
Genomic sequence upstream of the <START:ggp> Fc gamma RIC gene <END> was cloned and subjected to primer extension analysis , which demonstrated a single <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> without a <START:ggp> TATA box <END> . 
Transient transfections of <START:ggp> CAT reporter gene constructs <END> containing various <START:ggp> Fc gamma RIC promoter sequences <END> into <START:ana> U937 cells <END> revealed that a <START:ggp> 20-bp region <END> surrounding the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> ( -7 to +13 ) was capable of mediating transcription initiation and that an <START:ggp> IFN-gamma responsive element <END> ( <START:ggp> GIRE <END> ) was present within <START:ggp> 74 bp upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> . 
A <START:ggp> 17-bp sequence <END> between positions -51 and -35 conferred <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> responsiveness on a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> Double-stranded GIRE sequence <END> , but not a <START:ggp> scrambled sequence <END> , was specifically bound by <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> from <START:ana> IFN-gamma treated U937 cells <END> . 
Gel shift experiments further showed that the <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha protein <END> bound to the <START:ggp> Fc gamma RIC GIRE <END> in response to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> treatment of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Fc gamma RIC GIRE <END> is homologous to the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma activation sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> GAS <END> ) of the <START:ggp> guanylate binding protein <END> and to <START:ggp> X box elements <END> of <START:ggp> class II MHC genes <END> . 
Our results demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> Fc gamma RIC gene <END> by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> involves the binding of <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> to a <START:ggp> 17-bp GAS homology <END> in the <START:ggp> proximal promoter <END> . 
Constitutively activated <START:ggp> Jak <END> <START:ggp> -STAT <END> pathway in <START:ana> T cells <END> transformed with HTLV-I . 
Human T cell lymphotropic virus I ( HTLV-I ) is the etiological agent for adult T cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis ( also termed HTLV-I-associated myelopathy ) . 
<START:ana> HTLV-I-infected peripheral blood T cells <END> exhibit an initial phase of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) -dependent growth ; over time , by an unknown mechanism , the cells become <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -independent . 
Whereas the <START:ggp> Jak kinases <END> <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> and <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> and the signal transducer and activator of <START:ggp> transcription proteins <END> <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> are activated in <START:ana> normal T cells <END> in response to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , this signaling pathway was constitutively activated in <START:ana> HTLV-I-transformed cells <END> . 
In <START:ana> HTLV-I-infected cord blood lymphocytes <END> , the transition from <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -dependent to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -independent growth correlated with the acquisition of a constitutively activated <START:ggp> Jak <END> <START:ggp> -STAT <END> pathway , which suggests that this pathway participates in HTLV-I-mediated T cell transformation . 
Nitric oxide decreases <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -induced endothelial activation . 
Nitric oxide selectively reduces endothelial expression of <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> and <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> . 
To test the hypothesis that nitric oxide ( NO ) limits endothelial activation , we treated <START:ana> cytokine-stimulated human saphenous vein endothelial cells <END> with several NO donors and assessed their effects on the inducible expression of <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) . 
In a concentration-dependent manner , NO inhibited <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -1 <END> alpha-stimulated <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression by 35-55 % as determined by cell surface enzyme immunoassays and flow cytometry . 
This inhibition was paralleled by reduced monocyte adhesion to endothelial monolayers in nonstatic assays , was unaffected by cGMP analogues , and was quantitatively similar after stimulation by either <START:ggp> IL-1 alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> ) , or bacterial lipopolysaccharide . 
NO also decreased the endothelial expression of other <START:ggp> leukocyte adhesion molecules <END> ( <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> and to a lesser extent , <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> ) and secretable <START:ggp> cytokines <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> ) . 
Inhibition of endogenous NO production by L-N-monomethyl-arginine also induced the expression of <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> , but did not augment cytokine-induced <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression . 
Nuclear run-on assays , transfection studies using various <START:ggp> VCAM-1 promoter reporter gene constructs <END> , and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that NO represses <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> gene transcription , in part , by inhibiting <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
We propose that NO 's ability to limit endothelial activation and inhibit monocyte adhesion may contribute to some of its antiatherogenic and antiinflammatory properties within the vessel wall . 
<START:ggp> MIP1 alpha nuclear protein <END> ( <START:ggp> MNP <END> ) , a novel <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> expressed in hematopoietic cells that is crucial for transcription of the <START:ggp> human MIP-1 alpha gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> Murine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> MIP-1 alpha <END> ) and its <START:ggp> human equivalent <END> ( <START:ggp> GOS19 <END> , <START:ggp> LD78 <END> , or <START:ggp> AT464 <END> ) are members of the <START:ggp> -C-C family <END> of <START:ggp> low-molecular-weight chemokines <END> . 
Secreted from <START:ana> activated T cells <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> , bone <START:ggp> marrow-derived MIP-1 alpha/GOS19 <END> inhibits <START:ana> primitive hematopoietic stem cells <END> and appears to be involved in the homeostatic control of <START:ana> stem cell <END> proliferation . 
It also induces chemotaxis and inflammatory responses in <START:ana> mature cell types <END> . 
Therefore , it is important to understand the mechanisms which control the expression of <START:ggp> MIP-1 alpha <END> <START:ggp> /GOS19 <END> . 
Previous work has shown that in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> , a set of widely expressed <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> ( the <START:ggp> ICK-1 family <END> ) affect the <START:ggp> GOS19 promoter <END> . 
One member , <START:ggp> ICK-1A <END> , behaves as a <START:ggp> strong negative regulator <END> . 
In this communication , we provide evidence that the pathway of induction in the <START:ana> macrophage cell line <END> <START:ana> U937 <END> is different from that in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
Furthermore , we show that the <START:ggp> ICK-1 binding site <END> does not confer negative regulation in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
We provide evidence for an additional <START:ggp> binding site <END> , the <START:ggp> MIP-1 alpha nuclear protein ( MNP ) site <END> , which overlaps the <START:ggp> ICK-1 site <END> . 
Interaction of nuclear extracts from <START:ana> various cell lines <END> and tissue with the <START:ggp> MNP site <END> leads to the formation of <START:ggp> fast-migrating protein-DNA complexes <END> with similar but distinct electrophoretic mobilities . 
A mutation of the <START:ggp> MNP site <END> which does not abrogate ICK-1 binding inactivates the <START:ggp> GOS19.1 promoter <END> in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> and reduces its activity by fourfold in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
We propose that the <START:ggp> MNP protein <END> ( s ) binding at the <START:ggp> MNP site <END> constitutes a novel <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> ( s ) expressed in <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> . 
The effect of Toremifene on the expression of some genes in <START:ana> human mononuclear cells <END> . 
Toremifene exerts multiple and varied effects on the gene expression of <START:ana> human peripheral mononuclear cells <END> . 
After short-term , in vitro exposure to therapeutical levels , distinct changes in P-glycoprotein , steroid receptors , p53 and Bcl-2 expression take place . 
In view of the increasing use of antiestrogens in cancer therapy and prevention , there is obvious merit in long-term in vivo studies to be conducted . 
The <START:ggp> interleukin-5 <END> /receptor interaction activates <START:ggp> Lyn and Jak2 tyrosine kinases <END> and propagates signals via the <START:ggp> Ras-Raf-1-MAP kinase <END> and the <START:ggp> Jak <END> <START:ggp> -STAT <END> pathways in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
We have shown that the interaction of <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -5 <END> with the receptor activates <START:ggp> Lyn tyrosine kinase <END> within 1 min and <START:ggp> Jak2 tyrosine kinase <END> within 1-3 min . 
<START:ggp> IL-5 <END> also stimulates GTP binding to <START:ggp> p21ras <END> . 
The signal is subsequently propagated through the activation of <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> , <START:ggp> MEK <END> , and <START:ggp> MAP kinases <END> as shown by their increased autophosphorylation in vitro and phosphorylation in situ . 
<START:ggp> Jak2 kinase <END> has been shown to phosphorylate <START:ggp> STAT nuclear proteins <END> . 
The activation of <START:ggp> STAT nuclear factors <END> was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a <START:ggp> gamma activation site <END> ( <START:ggp> GAS <END> ) probe . 
We found that <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> induces two <START:ggp> GAS-binding proteins <END> in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> , one of which is <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> . 
We conclude that <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> induced signals are propagated through two distinct pathways : ( 1 ) <START:ggp> Lyn <END> -- > <START:ggp> Ras <END> -- > <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> -- > <START:ggp> MEK <END> -- > <START:ggp> MAP kinase <END> and ( 2 ) <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> -- > <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> retinoblastoma gene product <END> negatively regulates transcriptional activation mediated by the <START:ggp> human cytomegalovirus IE2 protein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> IE2 gene product <END> of human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is one of a few <START:ggp> viral regulatory proteins <END> expressed immediately upon infection of the <START:ana> host cell <END> . 
It is a potent <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> of many <START:ggp> viral and cellular promoters <END> . 
We found that the <START:ggp> retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product <END> ( <START:ggp> Rb <END> ) dramatically suppressed this <START:ggp> IE2 <END> transactivation of <START:ggp> various promoters <END> . 
However , unlike another <START:ggp> tumor suppressor protein <END> , <START:ggp> p53 <END> , <START:ggp> Rb <END> did not have any significant effect on basal levels of transcription , suggesting that <START:ggp> Rb <END> specifically interacts with <START:ggp> IE2 <END> rather than other <START:ggp> cellular factors <END> involved in the general transcription machinery . 
We found by protein-affinity chromatography that <START:ggp> Rb <END> in nuclear extracts or produced by in vitro translation directly bound to <START:ggp> IE2 <END> . 
Our results suggest that <START:ggp> Rb <END> may regulate the life cycle of HCMV , which is endemic in the human population . 
Furthermore , these data may provide new insights into the slow rate of HCMV DNA replication in cells and the possible involvement of HCMV in tumorigenesis . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> nucleoside diphosphate kinase <END> in human skin cancers : an immunohistochemical study . 
Expression of <START:ggp> nucleoside diphosphate ( NDP ) kinase <END> , which is homologous to the <START:ggp> nm23 gene product <END> in a variety of species , has been found to be inversely associated with metastatic potential . 
However , the relationship remains controversial according to the <START:ana> tumor cell types <END> and experimental system , with conflicting results from different research groups . 
In order to determine whether <START:ggp> NDP kinase <END> expression serves as a marker for metastatic potential in human skin cancer , we assessed the levels of <START:ggp> NDP kinase <END> expression in 9 keratoacanthomas ( KAs ) , 26 squamous cell carcinomas ( SCCs ) , and 25 basal cell carcinomas ( BCCs ) using immunohistochemistry . 
The expression of <START:ggp> NDP kinase <END> was intense in KA and SCC compared with BCC . 
However , the difference of <START:ggp> NDP kinase <END> expression between KA and SCC was not statistically significant . 
And there was no statistically significant difference in <START:ggp> NDP kinase <END> expression between SCC with metastasis and SCC without metastasis . 
Our results contradict the hypothesis concerning the possible role of <START:ggp> nm23 gene <END> as a metastatic suppressor gene in human skin cancer . 
The mechanism of overexpression in various <START:ana> tumor cell types <END> and its biological significance in cutaneous carcinogenesis remain to be determined . 
<START:ggp> RB <END> and a novel <START:ggp> E2F-1 binding protein <END> in <START:ana> MHC class II deficient B-cell lines <END> and normal <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induction of the <START:ggp> class IL transactivator <END> <START:ggp> CIITA <END> in <START:ana> class II non-inducible RB-defective tumor lines <END> . 
The <START:ggp> major histocompatibility ( MHC ) class II genes <END> encode <START:ggp> cell surface proteins <END> that bind antigenic peptide for presentation to <START:ana> T-cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> class II proteins <END> are expressed constitutively on <START:ana> B-cells <END> and <START:ana> EBV-transformed B-cells , <END> and are inducible by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> on a wide variety of <START:ana> cell types <END> . 
<START:ggp> Retinoblastoma protein <END> ( <START:ggp> RB <END> ) is a tumor suppressor and functions as a <START:ggp> transcriptional repressor <END> by binding and inactivating the <START:ggp> transactivator E2F-I <END> . 
<START:ana> RB-defective tumor lines <END> are non-inducible for <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , or very weakly inducible , but transfection of 2 different lines with <START:ggp> RB expression vectors <END> re-establishes or substantially enhances class II inducibility . 
Therefore , we examined the <START:ggp> RB <END> status of a series of B-cell mutants that are defective in class II expression , generated either in vitro or derived from Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome ( BLS ) patients . 
Nuclear matrix-bound <START:ggp> RB <END> was detectable in all cases , indicating that loss of <START:ggp> RB <END> is not responsible for decreased class II expression in these lines . 
A second E2F-I binding protein , most likely DP-I , was also apparently normal in both class II-positive and -negative B-cell lines . 
We also examined the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induction of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> in <START:ggp> RB <END> -defective lines . 
<START:ggp> CIITA <END> is a <START:ggp> class II gene transactivator <END> known to be defective in one form of BLS and to be required for the induction of <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
<START:ana> CIITA mRNA <END> is normally inducible by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> in <START:ana> class II non-inducible , RB-defective lines <END> , and in one line , re-expression of <START:ggp> RB <END> has no effect on <START:ana> CIITA mRNA <END> induction levels . 
Thus , the block in MHC class II inducibility in <START:ana> RB-defective cells <END> is not due to a block in <START:ggp> CIITA <END> inducibility . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin 12 <END> induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> in <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin 12 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> ) is an important <START:ggp> immunoregulatory cytokine <END> whose receptor is a member of the <START:ggp> hematopoietin receptor superfamily <END> . 
We have recently demonstrated that stimulation of <START:ana> human T and natural killer cells <END> with <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> Janus family tyrosine kinase <END> <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> and <START:ggp> Tyk2 <END> , implicating these <START:ggp> kinases <END> in the immediate biochemical response to <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> . 
Recently , <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> known as <START:ggp> STATs <END> ( <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription <END> ) have been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated and activated in response to a number of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> that bind <START:ggp> hematopoietin receptors <END> and activate <START:ggp> JAK kinases <END> . 
In this report we demonstrate that <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a recently identified <START:ggp> STAT family member <END> , <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> , and show that <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> expression is regulated by T-cell activation . 
Furthermore , we show that <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> stimulates formation of a <START:ggp> DNA-binding complex <END> that recognizes a DNA sequence previously shown to bind <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> and that this complex contains <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> . 
These data , and the recent demonstration of <START:ggp> JAK <END> phosphorylation by <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , identify a rapid signal-transduction pathway likely to mediate <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> -induced gene expression . 
Temperature-induced down-regulation of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear leucocyte <END> in patients with sepsis or septic shock . 
OBJECTIVE : Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is of vital importance during critical illness . 
We have studied the adaptive mechanisms which occur at the level of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> in glucocorticoid target tissues in patients with sepsis or septic shock . 
DESIGN : The effects of hypercortisolaemia , hyperthermia and cellular composition on number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> per cell and their affinity were evaluated , both in vitro and in vivo , in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes <END> of control subjects and in patients with sepsis or septic shock . 
SUBJECTS : Fifteen patients ( age 25-79 ) with sepsis or septic shock who were admitted to an intensive care unit were studied . 
The control group consisted of 24 healthy laboratory employees . 
MEASUREMENTS : The binding capacity and affinity of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> were measured and compared to clinical data and the plasma cortisol concentrations . 
RESULTS : Hypercortisolaemia , in vitro , resulted in a decreased affinity and a decreased binding capacity of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
In vitro , hyperthermia as well as variations in the cellular composition did not influence the glucocorticoid receptor . 
In vivo , there was no change in the number of receptors per cell in patients with sepsis or septic shock as compared to healthy controls . 
However , a decreased affinity of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> was observed . 
There was a weak but significant negative correlation between body temperature and the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in the patient group . 
There was no relation between circulating cortisol concentrations and <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> affinity and number . 
CONCLUSIONS : There is no obvious regulation of the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> by plasma cortisol concentrations in vivo . 
The decreased affinity of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> together with the negative correlation between hyperthermia and the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in patients with sepsis or septic shock suggest that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation during critical illness is accompanied by peripheral adaptation in <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> number and affinity . 
Integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> message induction in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
A possible signaling role for the <START:ggp> Syk tyrosine kinase <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases <END> is an important aspect of signal transduction mediated by <START:ggp> integrins <END> . 
In the <START:ana> human monocytic cell line THP-1 <END> , either <START:ggp> integrin <END> -dependent cell adhesion to <START:ggp> fibronectin <END> or ligation of beta 1 integrins with <START:ggp> antibodies <END> causes a rapid and intense tyrosine phosphorylation of two sets of proteins of about <START:ggp> 65-75 and 120-125 kDa <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> integrin <END> ligation leads to nuclear translocation of the <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 subunits <END> of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B transcription factor <END> , to activation of a <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> driven by a <START:ggp> promoter <END> containing <START:ggp> NF-kappa B sites <END> , and to increased levels of <START:ana> mRNAs <END> for <START:ggp> immediate-early genes <END> , including the <START:ggp> cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -1 beta <END> . 
The tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A block both <START:ggp> integrin <END> -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and increases in <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> message levels , indicating a causal relationship between the two events . 
The components tyrosine phosphorylated subsequent to cell adhesion include <START:ggp> paxillin <END> , <START:ggp> pp125FAK <END> , and the <START:ggp> SH2 domain containing tyrosine kinase Syk <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> integrin <END> ligation with <START:ggp> antibodies <END> induces tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Syk <END> but not of <START:ggp> FAK <END> or <START:ggp> paxillin <END> . 
In <START:ana> adhering cells <END> , pre-treatment with cytochalasin D suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> FAK <END> and <START:ggp> paxillin <END> but not of <START:ggp> Syk <END> , while <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> message induction is unaffected . 
These observations indicate that the <START:ggp> Syk <END> tyrosine kinase may be an important component of an <START:ggp> integrin <END> signaling pathway in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> , leading to activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and to increased levels of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> messages . 
Inhibition of dexamethasone binding to <START:ggp> human glucocorticoid receptor <END> by New World primate cell extracts . 
To determine if New World primates express an inhibitor that influences <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) binding characteristics , we examined [ 3H ] dexamethasone binding in cytosol prepared from <START:ana> B95-8 lymphoid cells <END> , derived from the cotton top tamarin ( Saguinus oedipus ) , in combination with cytosol prepared from human or rat tissues . 
B95-8 cytosol inhibited specific binding of [ 3H ] dexamethasone ( P < 0.01 ) when mixed with cytosol prepared from either a <START:ana> human lymphoid cell line <END> ( <START:ana> HL <END> ) or rat thymus . 
The inhibitory activity was heat labile and <START:ggp> trypsin <END> sensitive . 
Peak inhibitory activity was found in the 150-200 kd fractions after Sephacryl G-200 ultrafiltration . 
Scatchard analysis of [ 3H ] dexamethasone binding using mixed cytosol showed a diminished <START:ggp> GR <END> apparent binding affinity when compared to HL cytosol . 
Kinetic studies using mixed cytosol indicated that B95-8 cytosol did not affect the apparent dissociation rate of [ 3H ] dexamethasone . 
These data demonstrate that <START:ana> B95-8 cells <END> contain a competitive inhibitor that prevents binding of dexamethasone to its <START:ggp> cognate receptor <END> . 
Disruption of a <START:ggp> GATA motif <END> in the <START:ggp> Duffy gene promoter <END> abolishes <START:ggp> erythroid gene <END> expression in Duffy-negative individuals . 
The <START:ana> mRNA <END> for the <START:ggp> Duffy blood group antigen <END> , the <START:ggp> erythrocyte receptor <END> for the Plasmodium vivax malaria parasite , has recently been cloned and shown to encode a widely expressed <START:ggp> chemokine receptor <END> . 
Here , we show that the <START:ggp> Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor gene <END> ( <START:ggp> DARC <END> ) is composed of a single <START:ggp> exon <END> and that most Duffy-negative blacks carry a <START:ggp> silent FY*B allele <END> with a single T to C substitution at nucleotide -46 . 
This mutation impairs the promoter activity in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> by disrupting a <START:ggp> binding site <END> for the <START:ggp> GATA1 erythroid transcription factor <END> . 
With the recent characterization of the <START:ggp> FY*A and FY*B alleles <END> , these findings provide the molecular basis of the Duffy blood group system and an explanation for the erythroid-specific repression of the <START:ggp> DARC gene <END> in Duffy-negative individuals . 
Activation of <START:ggp> pp90rsk <END> and <START:ggp> early growth response-1 gene <END> expression by <START:ggp> pokeweed mitogen <END> in <START:ana> human B cells <END> . 
The present studies have examined the effects of <START:ggp> pokeweed mitogen <END> ( <START:ggp> PWM <END> ) on the induction of <START:ggp> early growth response-1 gene <END> ( <START:ggp> EGR-1 <END> ) in <START:ana> normal human B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> PWM <END> regulates <START:ggp> EGR-1 <END> gene expression by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms . 
Transient transfection assays with <START:ggp> EGR-1 promoter fragments <END> linked to the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene <END> demonstrated that <START:ggp> PWM <END> induced <START:ggp> EGR-1 <END> transcription is conferred by the <START:ggp> CArG motif <END> ( <START:ggp> C C [ AT ] 6GG <END> ) in the <START:ggp> EGR-1 promoter <END> . 
The results further demonstrated the activation of <START:ggp> S6 kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> pp90rsk <END> ) , evidenced by phosphorylation of <START:ggp> S6 <END> and serum response factor ( SRF ) peptides , in <START:ana> PWM treated B cells <END> . 
Taken together , these findings suggest that <START:ggp> PWM <END> is able to initiate an intracytoplasmic signalling cascade and <START:ggp> EGR-1 <END> induction in <START:ana> normal human B cells <END> . 
A <START:ggp> conserved motif <END> in the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of several <START:ggp> cytokines <END> expressed by <START:ana> human Th2-type lymphocytes <END> . 
We have recently found a novel <START:ggp> conserved motif <END> in the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of several <START:ggp> T-cell-expressed cytokines <END> [ <START:ggp> human interleukin-2 , -4 , -5 and -13 <END> and <START:ggp> human and mouse granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) ] . 
It contains a <START:ggp> core sequence <END> CTTGG ... CCAAG which is present as part of larger <START:ggp> palindromic sequences <END> in each gene . 
This suggest that they may interact with a new family of <START:ggp> trans-acting factors <END> . 
In transfection assays , the <START:ggp> human GM-CSF element <END> has a strong positive effect on the expression of a <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> by the <START:ana> human T cell line <END> <START:ana> Jurkat J6 <END> upon stimulation . 
In DNA mobility shift assays , this sequence can give either six different specific bands which are competed out by different parts of the sequence or one specific band which is competed out by each of the inverted repeats , depending on the reconstitution conditions . 
In different <START:ggp> genes <END> , the <START:ggp> core sequences <END> are separated by integer numbers of helical turns . 
Considering the strong positive regulatory effect of this <START:ggp> element <END> and its presence in several <START:ggp> T-cell-expressed cytokine genes <END> , it may be crucial to the coordinated expression of these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> in <START:ana> T helper cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> cDNA <END> cloning of a <START:ggp> NGFI-B/nur77-related transcription factor <END> from an <START:ana> apoptotic human T cell line <END> . 
A <START:ana> human T lymphoid cell line <END> , <START:ana> PEER <END> , dies by apoptosis in the presence of PMA and calcium ionophore . 
A new <START:ggp> gene <END> , <START:ggp> TINUR <END> , was cloned from <START:ana> apoptotic PEER cells <END> . 
The expression of the <START:ggp> TINUR gene <END> is induced within 1 h after the cross-linking of the <START:ggp> T cell Ag receptor complex <END> . 
<START:ggp> TINUR <END> belongs to the <START:ggp> NGFI-B/nur77 family <END> of the <START:ggp> steroid receptor superfamily <END> and is an <START:ggp> orphan receptor <END> . 
<START:ggp> TINUR <END> binds to the same <START:ggp> DNA sequence <END> as <START:ggp> NGFI-B/nur77 <END> . 
We also propose that the <START:ggp> NGFI-B/nur77 family <END> can be classified into two subtypes . 
Aspirin inhibits <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> mobilization and monocyte adhesion in <START:ana> stimulated human endothelial cells <END> . 
BACKGROUND : The induction of <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) is mediated by mobilization of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) . 
Since salicylates have been reported to inhibit <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation by preventing the degradation of its inhibitor <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> , we studied a potential inhibition of this pathway by acetylsalicylate ( aspirin ) in <START:ana> human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> HUVECs <END> ) . 
METHODS AND RESULTS : Gel-shift analyses demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of <START:ggp> TNF <END> -induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> mobilization by aspirin at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mmol/L . 
Induction of <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> surface expression by <START:ggp> TNF <END> was dose-dependently reduced by aspirin over the same range , while induction of <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ) was hardly affected . 
Aspirin appeared to prevent <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> transcription , since it dose-dependently inhibited induction of <START:ana> VCAM-1 mRNA <END> by <START:ggp> TNF <END> . 
As a functional consequence , adhesion of <START:ana> U937 monocytes <END> to <START:ana> TNF-stimulated HUVECs <END> was markedly reduced by aspirin due to suppression of <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> upregulation . 
These effects of aspirin were not related to the inhibition of <START:ggp> cyclooxygenase <END> activity , since indomethacin was ineffective . 
CONCLUSIONS : Our data suggest that aspirin inhibits <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> mobilization , induction of <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> , and subsequent monocyte adhesion in <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> stimulated by <START:ggp> TNF <END> , thereby providing an additional mechanism for therapeutic effects of aspirin . 
Activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> inhibitors involves the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> at <START:ggp> phosphatase 2A-sensitive sites <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by various cellular stimuli involves the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of its inhibitor , <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> , although the underlying mechanism remains unclear . 
In the present study , the role of <START:ggp> serine/threonine phosphatases <END> in the regulation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> phosphorylation was investigated . 
Our studies demonstrate that incubation of <START:ana> human T cells <END> with low concentrations ( approximately 1-5 nM ) of calyculin A or okadaic acid , potent inhibitors of <START:ggp> protein phosphatase type 1 ( PP-1 ) and type 2A <END> ( <START:ggp> PP-2A <END> ) , induces the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> even in the absence of any cellular stimulus . 
This action of the phosphatase inhibitors , which is associated with the activation of the <START:ggp> RelA.p50 NF-kappa B heterodimer <END> , is not affected by agents that block the induction of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> phosphorylation by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) . 
Furthermore , the <START:ggp> phosphorylated I kappa B alpha <END> from <START:ana> calyculin A-treated cells <END> , but not that from <START:ana> TNF-alpha-stimulated cells <END> , is sensitive to <START:ggp> PP-2A <END> in vitro , suggesting the existence of fundamental differences in the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> induced by the two different <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> inducers . 
However , induction of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> phosphorylation by both <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and the phosphatase inhibitors is associated with the subsequent degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
We further demonstrate that TNF-alpha- and calyculin A-induced I kappa B alpha degradation exhibits similar but not identical sensitivities to a proteasome inhibitor . 
Together , these results suggest that phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> , mediated through both the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -inducible and the <START:ggp> PP-2A-opposing kinases <END> , may serve to target <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> for <START:ggp> proteasome <END> -mediated degradation . 
<START:ggp> Sp1 <END> functions in a <START:ggp> chromatin <END> -dependent manner to augment <START:ggp> human alpha-globin promoter <END> activity . 
The <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking region <END> of the <START:ggp> human alpha-globin gene <END> is highly G + C rich and contains multiple copies of the <START:ggp> consensus sequence <END> for the <START:ggp> Sp1 binding site <END> . 
We investigated the role of this <START:ggp> G + C-rich region <END> in augmenting <START:ggp> alpha-globin promoter <END> activity in the presence of the <START:ggp> far-upstream alpha-globin enhancer <END> , <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> . 
We show that in <START:ana> transiently transfected erythroid cells <END> , deletion of the <START:ggp> alpha-globin G + C-rich 5 ' flanking region <END> has no effect on <START:ggp> alpha-globin promoter <END> activity . 
However , upon stable integration into <START:ggp> chromatin <END> , deletion of this region causes a nearly 90 % decrease in promoter activity compared with expression from an <START:ggp> alpha-globin promoter <END> retaining this region . 
These results suggest that the <START:ggp> alpha-globin G + C-rich 5 ' flanking region <END> augments <START:ggp> alpha-globin promoter <END> activity in a <START:ggp> chromatin <END> -dependent manner . 
We further show that this <START:ggp> G + C-rich region <END> is required for the activation of <START:ggp> alpha-globin gene <END> expression during erythroid differentiation . 
Finally , we show by both footprint analysis and functional assays that the ability of the <START:ggp> G + C-rich region <END> to increase <START:ggp> alpha-globin promoter <END> activity from a stably integrated <START:ggp> alpha-globin gene <END> is mediated by its <START:ggp> multiple binding sites <END> for the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> . 
Costimulation of <START:ana> human CD4+ T cells <END> with <START:ggp> LFA-3 <END> and <START:ggp> B7 <END> induce distinct effects on AP-1 and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
We have earlier shown that stimulation of <START:ana> human CD4+ T cells <END> with SEA presented on <START:ana> Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) -DR transfectants <END> coexpressing either <START:ggp> B7 <END> or <START:ggp> LFA-3 <END> resulted in distinct <START:ggp> cytokine <END> profiles . 
We now demonstrate that <START:ggp> B7 <END> , but not <START:ggp> LFA-3 <END> , strongly costimulated <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcription and mRNA expression in <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> . 
Maximal increase in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcription was recorded with <START:ggp> CHO-DR/B7/LFA-3 <END> , suggesting a cooperative effect of <START:ggp> B7 <END> and <START:ggp> LFA-3 <END> at the transcriptional level . 
Gel-shift analysis demonstrated that stimulation of <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> with <START:ggp> CHO-DR <END> and staphylococcal enterotoxin A was sufficient to induce significant amounts of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding proteins , whereas induction of <START:ggp> AP-1 binding proteins <END> required costimulation . 
<START:ggp> LFA-3 <END> induced moderate levels of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , but did not influence the levels of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , while <START:ggp> B7 <END> costimulation strongly induced both <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and substantially enhanced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B binding proteins <END> . 
The <START:ana> CHO-DR/B7/LFA-3 triple transfectant <END> induced a further increase in <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> binding proteins <END> compared with the <START:ana> double transfectants <END> . 
The level of <START:ggp> Oct-1 binding proteins <END> remained similar in all samples . 
Super-shift analysis revealed that the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> of <START:ana> costimulated CD4+ T cells <END> contained large amounts of <START:ggp> p50 <END> , substantial amounts of <START:ggp> p65 <END> , and marginal levels of <START:ggp> c-Rel proteins <END> . 
The <START:ggp> AP-1 binding proteins <END> contained <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> , <START:ggp> Jun-D <END> , and <START:ggp> Fra-1 <END> , but marginal amounts of <START:ggp> Jun-B <END> and <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> . 
Our results indicate distinct effects of <START:ggp> B7 <END> and <START:ggp> LFA-3 <END> costimulation on the activity of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
These may partly account for the differential effects of <START:ggp> B7 <END> and <START:ggp> LFA-3 <END> costimulation on <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression . 
The <START:ggp> Ah receptor <END> recognizes <START:ggp> DNA binding sites <END> for the <START:ggp> B cell transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> BSAP <END> : a possible mechanism for dioxin-mediated alteration of <START:ggp> CD19 gene <END> expression in <START:ana> human B lymphocytes <END> . 
2 , 3 , 7 , 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) inhibits murine and human B lymphocyte immunoglobulin production through an unknown mechanism . 
This study investigated the effect of TCDD on expression of the <START:ggp> CD19 gene <END> in a <START:ana> human B lymphocyte cell line <END> . 
Northern blot analysis showed that TCDD treatment decreased steady state levels of <START:ana> CD19 mRNA <END> by 67 % in the <START:ana> IM-9 cell line <END> . 
Using a gel mobility shift assay , we identified a <START:ggp> DNA-binding complex <END> in IM-9 nuclear extracts that by several criteria appears to be the <START:ggp> Ah receptor <END> . 
In addition , the <START:ggp> Ah receptor complex <END> recognized a <START:ggp> DNA binding site <END> for <START:ggp> B cell lineage-specific activator protein <END> ( <START:ggp> BSAP <END> ) in the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> of the human <START:ggp> CD19 gene <END> which is similar to the <START:ggp> consensus Ah receptor DNA binding site <END> . 
These results suggest that the <START:ggp> AhR <END> could interfere with <START:ggp> BSAP <END> -stimulated <START:ggp> CD19 gene <END> transcription by competition for a common <START:ggp> DNA binding site <END> . 
Inhibitory action of <START:ggp> nm23 proteins <END> on induction of erythroid differentiation of <START:ana> human leukemia cells <END> . 
We recently identified a <START:ggp> differentiation inhibitory factor <END> ( <START:ggp> I-factor <END> ) in <START:ana> mouse myeloid leukemia M1 cells <END> as a <START:ggp> murine homolog <END> of the <START:ggp> human nm23-H2 gene product <END> . 
<START:ggp> nm23 genes <END> encode proteins that participate in tumor metastasis regulation and in various fundamental cellular processes , although their mechanisms of action are still unknown . 
Although all <START:ggp> nm23 proteins <END> contain <START:ggp> nucleoside diphosphate ( NDP ) kinase <END> activity , it has not been established that the enzyme activity mediated the various functions of <START:ggp> nm23 proteins <END> . 
In the present experiment , we examined the effect of <START:ggp> nm23 proteins <END> on various differentiation induction systems of <START:ana> human leukemic cells <END> including <START:ana> HL-60 , U937 , HEL/S , KU812F , K562 , and HEL cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Native human erythrocyte NDP kinase protein <END> inhibited the induction of erythroid differentiation of <START:ana> HEL , KU812 and K562 cells <END> , but not the induction of monocytic or granulocytic differentiation of <START:ana> HL-60 , U937 and HEL/S cells <END> . 
The erythroid differentiation of <START:ana> HEL cells <END> was inhibited by <START:ggp> recombinant human nm23-H1 , -H2 , mouse nm23-M1 , and -M2 proteins <END> . 
Moreover , both the <START:ggp> mutant nm23-H2His protein <END> and <START:ggp> truncated nm23-H2 protein <END> containing <START:ggp> N-terminal ( 1-60 ) peptide <END> , which do not have <START:ggp> NDP kinase <END> activity , also inhibited erythroid differentiation of <START:ana> HEL cells <END> . 
These results suggest that ( 1 ) the differentiation inhibitory activity of <START:ggp> I-factor/nm23 protein <END> is not restricted to monocytic differentiation of <START:ana> M1 cells <END> , ( 2 ) the inhibitory activity is exhibited without species specificity , and ( 3 ) the differentiation inhibitory activity of the <START:ggp> nm23/NDP kinase protein <END> is independent of its enzyme activity and requires the presence of N-terminal peptides . 
Lipopolysaccharide-induced <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> expression requires continuous presence of LPS and is inhibited by <START:ggp> bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein <END> . 
<START:ana> Endothelial cells <END> stimulated by LPS express <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> , which plays an important role in mediating <START:ana> neutrophil <END> adhesion during inflammation . 
<START:ggp> E-selectin <END> is induced within 1-2 h , peaks at 4-6 h , and gradually returns to basal level by 24 h . 
<START:ggp> rBPI21 <END> , a <START:ggp> recombinant N-terminal fragment <END> of <START:ggp> human bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein <END> ( <START:ggp> BPI <END> ) , inhibited LPS-induced <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> expression when added at the same time as , and up to 6 h after , LPS . 
Delayed administration of <START:ggp> rBPI21 <END> also affected LPS-mediated activation of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Two to 4 h following LPS addition to <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> , when <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was already activated , addition of <START:ggp> rBPI21 <END> resulted in marked reduction of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> detectable at 4 or 6 h . 
These results indicate that endothelial activation requires continuous presence of LPS , and <START:ggp> rBPI21 <END> acts to reverse LPS-mediated endothelial activation by interrupting the on-going LPS signal . 
<START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> share common control mechanisms in response to costimulatory signals in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Antigen complexed with <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex class I or II molecules <END> on the surface of <START:ana> antigen presenting cells <END> interacts with the <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) on the surface of <START:ana> T cells <END> and initiates an activation cascade . 
So called costimulatory signals , mediated by other cell surface interactions or <START:ggp> soluble cytokines <END> produced by <START:ana> antigen presenting cells <END> , are also required for complete T cell activation . 
High levels of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> gene expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> also required both <START:ggp> TCR <END> and costimulatory signals . 
The <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> requires sequences in the <START:ggp> promoter <END> as well as a powerful <START:ggp> enhancer <END> located 3kb upstream to respond to <START:ggp> TCR <END> -like signals . 
These <START:ggp> promoter and enhancer regions <END> are mainly activated by the <START:ggp> transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) . 
The activation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> by <START:ggp> TCR <END> signals has been well described for interleukin-2 ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) and IL-4 gene transcription in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Costimulatory signals , such as activation of the <START:ggp> CD28 cell surface molecule <END> on <START:ana> T cells <END> , lead to activation through a distinct region of the <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) promoter <END> . 
This region is termed the <START:ggp> CK-1 <END> or <START:ggp> CD28RE <END> and appears to bind specific members of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Human T leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) infects <START:ana> T cells <END> and can lead to increase <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> expression . 
We have found that the <START:ggp> HTLV-1 transactivator protein <END> , <START:ggp> tax <END> , acts as a costimulatory signal for GM-CSF and IL-2 gene transcription , in that it can cooperate with <START:ggp> TCR <END> signals to mediate high level gene expression . 
Tax activates the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> through the <START:ggp> CK-1 <END> <START:ggp> /CD28RE <END> region and also activates <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> binding to this region . 
However , other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> or coactivators of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> are required for <START:ggp> tax <END> activation but these remain to be identified . 
The <START:ggp> CK-1 <END> <START:ggp> /CD28RE <END> of <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> shows a high degree of similarity to the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> <START:ggp> CD28RE <END> and the <START:ggp> IL-3 gene <END> also contains a related region . 
This observation , together with the fact that both <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> respond to <START:ggp> TCR <END> signals via <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , implies a high degree of conservation in the regulation of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> gene expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Danazol decreases transcription of <START:ggp> estrogen receptor gene <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
1. Administration of danazol for over one month reduced the levels of <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) and its <START:ana> mRNA <END> to approximately 50 and 20 % , respectively in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
2. Danazol did not alter the degradation rate of <START:ana> ER mRNA <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
3. Danazol decreased the transcription rate of <START:ggp> ER gene <END> to approximately 50 % in <START:ana> monocytes <END> in a run-on assay . 
4. Danazol may release estrogen predominance via the reduction of transcription for <START:ggp> ER gene <END> , which leads to the reduction of <START:ana> ER mRNA <END> and <START:ggp> ER <END> expressions in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Functional characterization of novel <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcriptional inhibitors . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -mediated <START:ana> T cell <END> proliferation is a critical early event in the inflammatory process . 
Formation of the <START:ggp> NFAT-1 transcriptional complex <END> on the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> is essential for <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcription . 
Using a cell line that is stably transfected with a trimer of the <START:ggp> NFAT-1 regulatory element <END> linked to a <START:ggp> lac-Z reporter gene <END> , we screened for inhibitors of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> -1-mediated <START:ggp> beta-galactosidase <END> activity . 
WIN 61058 and WIN 53071 were identified as microM inhibitors . 
These compounds also inhibited <START:ana> beta-galactosidase mRNA <END> levels . 
Similar inhibition of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> -1-mediated gene expression was observed in a second <START:ana> cell line <END> , which is stably transfected with <START:ggp> NFAT-1 regulatory elements <END> linked to the <START:ggp> reporter gene for sCD8 <END> . 
At 10 microM , both compounds inhibited IL-2 mRNA and protein levels in the <START:ana> NFAT-1-linked lac-Z transfectants <END> , and in <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> . 
Both compounds inhibited the mixed lymphocyte reaction , and this inhibition was reversed by exogenous <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
WIN 53071 inhibited <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production induced in the calcium-dependent PMA and ionomycin pathway . 
Conversely , <START:ggp> calcium-independent anti-CD28 Ab <END> and PMA-induced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production was resistant . 
Both compounds altered the <START:ggp> NFAT-1 transcriptional complex <END> , causing its retarded mobility on gels . 
By these functional criteria , we believe we have identified two structurally distinct , novel inhibitors of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> -1-mediated transcription . 
Transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> vacuolar H ( + ) -ATPase B2 subunit gene <END> in <START:ana> differentiating THP-1 cells <END> . 
Monocyte-macrophage differentiation was used as a model system for studying gene regulation of the <START:ggp> human vacuolar H ( + ) -ATPase <END> ( <START:ggp> V-ATPase <END> ) . 
We examined <START:ana> mRNA <END> levels of various <START:ggp> V-ATPase <END> subunits during differentiation of both <START:ana> native monocytes <END> and the <START:ana> cell line <END> <START:ana> THP-1 <END> , and found that transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms could account for increases in cell <START:ggp> V-ATPase <END> content . 
From nuclear runoff experiments , we found that one subunit in particular , the <START:ggp> B2 isoform <END> ( Mr = 56 , 000 ) , was amplified primarily by transcriptional means . 
We have begun to examine the structure of the <START:ggp> B2 subunit promoter region <END> . 
Isolation and sequencing of the <START:ggp> first exon <END> and <START:ggp> 5'-flanking region <END> of this gene reveal a <START:ggp> TATA-less promoter <END> with a high G + C content . 
Primer extension and <START:ggp> ribonuclease <END> protection analyses indicate a single <START:ggp> major transcriptional start site <END> . 
We transfected <START:ggp> promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids <END> into <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> to define sequences that mediate transcriptional control during monocyte differentiation . 
We found that sequences downstream from the transcriptional start site were sufficient to confer increased expression during <START:ana> THP-1 <END> differentiation . 
<START:ggp> DNase I <END> footprinting and sequence analysis revealed the existence of multiple <START:ggp> AP2 and Sp1 binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> 5'-untranslated and proximal coding regions <END> . 
Synergy between signal transduction pathways is obligatory for expression of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> in <START:ana> B and T cell lines <END> : implication for <START:ggp> c-fos <END> control via <START:ggp> surface immunoglobulin <END> and <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptors <END> . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> protooncogene c-fos <END> is controlled by three main regulatory pathways involving <START:ggp> kinase C <END> , cAMP , and calcium . 
<START:ggp> Kinase C <END> mediates its effects via phosphorylation of <START:ggp> serum response factor <END> ( <START:ggp> SRF <END> ) which interacts with the <START:ggp> serum response element <END> ( <START:ggp> SRE <END> ) ; cAMP and calcium mediate their effects via phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CREB <END> ( <START:ggp> cAMP regulatory element binding protein <END> ) presumably by activation of a <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> or <START:ggp> calmodulin-regulated kinase <END> . 
We have examined the function of these elements in <START:ana> Burkitt 's lymphoma cells <END> ( <START:ana> Ramos <END> and <START:ana> Daudi <END> ) as well as a <START:ana> T lymphocytic cell line <END> ( <START:ana> Jurkat <END> ) . 
We have found that stimulation of any one of these pathways alone has little or no effect on <START:ggp> c-fos <END> induction . 
However , <START:ggp> kinase C <END> activation ( PMA stimulation ) combined with either cAMP ( forskolin plus MIX ) or calcium stimulation ( ionophore ) leads to greatly enhanced <START:ggp> c-fos <END> induction . 
By contrast , cAMP in the presence of calcium shows no synergy in <START:ggp> c-fos <END> induction . 
Okadaic acid augments PMA- as well as calcium-mediated activation of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> , and has little or no effect when combined with cAMP . 
The main difference between <START:ana> Ramos <END> ( <START:ana> B cells <END> ) and <START:ana> Jurkat <END> ( <START:ana> T cells <END> ) in the regulation of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> is that cAMP plus calcium is strongly synergistic in <START:ana> Jurkat <END> and is without effect in <START:ana> Ramos <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity using gel mobility shift assays confirms that the requirements for synergy in <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> induction are paralleled by requirements for synergy in induction of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity . 
Signaling in <START:ana> B cells <END> due to <START:ggp> anti-Ig <END> stimulation involves both <START:ggp> kinase C <END> activation and release of intracellular calcium , and results in <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> induction . 
Our results indicate that synergy between the <START:ggp> kinase C <END> activation and calcium is needed for efficient <START:ggp> c-fos <END> induction since neither of these two alone induces <START:ggp> c-fos <END> well . 
That synergy of signaling pathways is relevant for the <START:ggp> anti-Ig <END> induction of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> is supported by the fact that cAMP-inducing agents and okadaic acid further enhance <START:ggp> anti-Ig <END> induction of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> . 
These results suggest that cell-specific patterns of synergy are an essential feature for <START:ggp> c-fos <END> induction and may be relevant for <START:ggp> c-fos <END> control through <START:ggp> B and T cell antigen receptors <END> . 
Multiple signals are required for function of the <START:ggp> human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene promoter <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human granulocyte-macrophage CSF ( GM-CSF ) gene <END> is expressed in <START:ana> T cells <END> in response to <START:ggp> TCR <END> activation that can be mimicked by treatment of the cells with PMA and Ca2+ ionophore . 
The gene contains a <START:ggp> proximal functional promoter region <END> ( <START:ggp> -620 to +34 <END> ) , as well as a powerful <START:ggp> enhancer <END> located 3 kb upstream , both of which are involved in the response of the gene to <START:ggp> TCR <END> activation . 
The <START:ggp> proximal promoter <END> contains a region termed <START:ggp> CLEO <END> ( <START:ggp> -54 to -31 <END> ) that consists of a <START:ggp> purine-rich element <END> abutting an <START:ggp> activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) -like site <END> , as well as an <START:ggp> upstream nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) site <END> ( <START:ggp> -85 to -76 <END> ) and a <START:ggp> CK-1 element <END> ( <START:ggp> -101 to -92 <END> ) . 
We show in this work that mutations in either the <START:ggp> purine-rich region <END> of the <START:ggp> CLEO element <END> or the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> result in reduced PMA/Ca2+ activation of a <START:ggp> 620-bp human GM-CSF promoter-luciferase reporter construct <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> by 65 % and 50 % , respectively . 
The major <START:ggp> inducible protein complex <END> that binds to the <START:ggp> human CLEO ( hCLEO ) element <END> is an <START:ggp> AP-1-like complex <END> that is inducible by PMA alone , but shows increased binding in response to PMA together with Ca2+ ionophore . 
Although the binding of this complex is not cyclosporin-sensitive , promoter induction is inhibited by cyclosporin treatment . 
A second weak inducible complex resembling <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) was also observed binding to the <START:ggp> hCLEO region <END> . 
By using <START:ggp> recombinant proteins <END> , we confirmed that <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> , and a higher order <START:ggp> NF-ATp/AP-1 complex <END> could all form with the <START:ggp> hCLEO element <END> , and we have also defined the sequence requirements for binding of each of these complexes . 
We found that expression of a constitutively active form of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> could substitute for Ca2+ ionophore and synergize with PMA to activate the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> , and conversely that <START:ggp> mutant-activated Ras <END> could substitute for PMA and cooperate with Ca2+ ionophore . 
Co-expression of <START:ggp> Ras <END> and <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , however , did not activate the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> , but required the additional expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 <END> . 
These results imply that at least three signals are required to activate the <START:ggp> GM-CSF proximal promoter <END> , and that the signals impinge on distinct <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that bind to the <START:ggp> hCLEO and NF-kappa B regions <END> of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> . 
IL-10 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> tyk2 <END> and <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> and the differential assembly of <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 complexes <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> affects <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> by driving the progression of immune responsiveness such that Th2 lymphocyte-mediated effects predominate . 
In this report , we show that in <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> signal transducers <END> and <START:ggp> activators of transcription <END> , <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> , in a differential manner such that the relative formation of <START:ggp> homo- and heterodimers <END> varies between the two cell types . 
Moreover , <START:ana> monocytes <END> express a novel <START:ggp> IL-10-stimulated STAT protein <END> with an M ( r ) of <START:ggp> 70 kDa <END> that is recognized by the <START:ggp> anti-STAT3 Ab <END> but is not observed in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> treatment of both <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> results in the ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> tyk2 <END> and <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> , but not <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> or <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> . 
Selective modulation of immune responsiveness by <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> in cells such as <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> may result in part from the differential activation of <START:ggp> STAT protein pairs <END> . 
Use of new biologic markers in the ovulation induction . 
Biological markers of ovulation , after a great in the past , have been fallen into disuse for the large diffusion of biochemical and biophysical ones . 
However , the real effect of hormones involved in ovulation is expressed by biological modifications on <START:ana> target tissues <END> . 
To explore the modifications of not reproductive target tissues as ovulation markers we studied the behaviour of Albuminemia , <START:ggp> Platelet Factor IV <END> ( as indicator of Platelet Aggregation ) , <START:ggp> Type II estrogenic receptors <END> in 42 ovulation induced women , undergoing our observation . 
33 of them had ovulation and 9 developed a LUF syndrome , constituting two biological models of an opposite situation for the three markers observed . 
All the markers considered were sufficiently sensitive , but among them , <START:ggp> Platelet Factor IV <END> was the most reliable to the hormonal ovulatory situation . 
Abnormal regulation of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> in lpr <START:ana> CD4-CD8- T lymphocytes <END> results in constitutive expression of a <START:ggp> novel nuclear factor of activated T cells-binding factor <END> . 
The inert quality of <START:ana> MRL-Ipr/Ipr ( Ipr ) peripheral CD4-CD8- ( CD4-8- ) T cells <END> manifests primarily as an inability to proliferate or produce <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in response to <START:ggp> TCR <END> or mitogenic stimulation . 
Yet these same cells do initiate early <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated signaling events , such as generation of inositol phosphates and increased intracellular calcium . 
They also display constitutively high levels of <START:ggp> p59fyn <END> and <START:ggp> CD3 zeta <END> tyrosine phosphorylation . 
The generation of second messengers in <START:ana> T cells <END> normally leads to downstream signaling that results in transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> . 
We , therefore , compared the activation state of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene promoter region <END> in freshly isolated and stimulated <START:ana> Ipr CD4-8- T cells <END> with that of <START:ana> normal T lymphocytes <END> . 
Levels of the octamer , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> p50-p65 heterodimer <END> ) , and <START:ggp> AP-1 transcriptional factors <END> are constitutively elevated in freshly isolated <START:ana> Ipr CD4-8- T cells <END> , consistent with the activated phenotype of these cells . 
Upon stimulation with mitogens , formation of the transactivating complex , <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) , occurs with normal kinetics in <START:ana> Ipr CD4-8- T cells <END> . 
Yet , the levels of the activating <START:ggp> NF-AT complex <END> never reach those observed in similarly stimulated normal <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Furthermore , nuclear extracts from <START:ana> Ipr CD4-8- T cells <END> display high levels of a novel specific binding activity at the <START:ggp> NF-AT site <END> , which is present at much lower levels in freshly isolated <START:ana> normal T lymphocytes <END> . 
Upon mitogenic stimulation , the binding activity of the novel <START:ggp> NF-AT-binding factor <END> is rapidly down-regulated in normal <START:ana> T cells <END> , but persists at high levels in <START:ana> Ipr CD4-8- T cells <END> . 
These two abnormalities at the <START:ggp> NF-AT site <END> provide a potential mechanism to account for the defect in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production from <START:ana> Ipr CD4-8- T cells <END> . 
Cross-linking of <START:ggp> CD30 <END> induces HIV expression in chronically infected <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD30 <END> , a member of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor family , is expressed constitutively on the surface of the human T cell line ACH-2 , which is chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV ) -1 . 
We demonstrate that cross-linking <START:ggp> CD30 <END> with an anti- <START:ggp> CD30 <END> -specific monoclonal antibody , which mimics the described biological activities of the <START:ggp> CD30 ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> CD30L <END> ) , results in HIV expression . 
<START:ggp> CD30 <END> cross-linking does not alter proliferation of <START:ana> ACH-2 cells <END> and the induction of HIV expression is not mediated by endogenous <START:ggp> TNF alpha/beta <END> . 
Furthermore , cross-linking of <START:ggp> CD30 <END> leads to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation and enhanced HIV transcription . 
Thus , <START:ggp> CD30 <END> <START:ggp> -CD30L <END> interactions mediate the induction of HIV expression by a kappa B-dependent pathway that is independent of <START:ggp> TNF <END> . 
This mechanism may be important in the activation of HIV expression from latently infected <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> , especially in lymphoid organs where cell to cell contact is conducive to receptor-ligand interactions . 
Human <START:ggp> MHC class II gene <END> transcription directed by the <START:ggp> carboxyl terminus <END> of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> , one of the <START:ggp> defective genes <END> in type II <START:ggp> MHC <END> combined immune deficiency . 
<START:ggp> Type II major histocompatibility complex <END> combined immune deficiency ( type II <START:ggp> MHC <END> CID or bare lymphocyte syndrome ) is a congenital immunodeficiency disease characterized by absent <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> expression . 
Four distinct complementation groups have been identified . 
Recently , the <START:ggp> defective gene <END> in group II type II <START:ggp> MHC <END> CID has been isolated and termed <START:ggp> CIITA <END> . 
Here , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> CIITA <END> is an <START:ggp> MHC class II gene-specific transcription activator <END> . 
The transcription activation function is provided by the <START:ggp> N-terminal acidic domain <END> ( <START:ggp> amino acids 26-137 <END> ) , which is experimentally exchangeable with a <START:ggp> heterologous viral transcription-activating domain <END> . 
The specificity of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> for three major <START:ggp> MHC class II genes <END> , <START:ggp> DR <END> , <START:ggp> DQ <END> and <START:ggp> DP <END> , is mediated by its remaining <START:ggp> C-terminal residues <END> ( <START:ggp> amino acids 317-1130 <END> ) . 
The transactivation of <START:ggp> multiple cis elements <END> , especially <START:ggp> S <END> and <START:ggp> X2 <END> , of the <START:ggp> DR alpha proximal promoter <END> in <START:ana> group II CID cells <END> is <START:ggp> CIITA <END> dependent . 
Since <START:ggp> CIITA <END> overexpression in <START:ana> normal cells <END> did not increase class II expression , we propose that initiation of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> expression serves as the on-off switch , while availability of downstream interactor ( s ) limits transcription . 
Monocyte tethering by <START:ggp> P-selectin <END> regulates <START:ggp> monocyte chemotactic protein-1 <END> and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> secretion . 
Signal integration and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation [ see comments ] 
<START:ggp> Adhesion molecules <END> that tether <START:ana> circulating leukocytes <END> to <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> may also transduce or modulate outside-in signals for cellular activation , providing an initial regulatory point in the inflammatory response . 
Adhesion of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> to <START:ggp> P-selectin <END> , the most rapidly expressed <START:ggp> endothelial tethering factor <END> , increased the secretion of <START:ggp> monocyte chemotactic protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) by the <START:ana> leukocytes <END> when they were stimulated with <START:ggp> platelet-activating factor <END> . 
Increased cytokine secretion was specifically inhibited by <START:ggp> G1 <END> , an <START:ggp> anti-P-selectin mAb <END> that prevents <START:ggp> P-selectin <END> from binding to its ligand ( <START:ggp> P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 <END> ) on <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> . 
Moreover , tethering by <START:ggp> P-selectin <END> specifically enhanced nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> required for expression of <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , and other <START:ggp> immediate-early genes <END> . 
These results demonstrate that <START:ggp> P-selectin <END> , through its ligands on <START:ana> monocytes <END> , may locally regulate <START:ggp> cytokine <END> secretion in inflamed tissues . 
Functional roles of <START:ggp> in vivo footprinted DNA motifs <END> within an <START:ggp> alpha-globin enhancer <END> . 
Erythroid lineage and developmental stage specificities . 
Transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> human alpha-like globin genes <END> , <START:ggp> embryonic zeta 2 <END> and <START:ggp> adult alpha <END> , during erythroid development is mediated by a <START:ggp> distal enhancer <END> , <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> . 
Previous protein-DNA binding studies have shown that <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> consists of multiple <START:ggp> nuclear factor binding motifs <END> that are occupied in vivo in an erythroid lineage- and developmental stage-specific manner . 
We have systematically analyzed the functional roles of these <START:ggp> factor binding motifs <END> of <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> by site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assay in <START:ana> erythroid cell cultures <END> . 
Three of these <START:ggp> HS-40 enhancer motifs <END> , <START:ggp> 5'NF-E2/AP1 <END> , <START:ggp> GT II <END> , and <START:ggp> GATA-1 ( c ) <END> , positively regulate the <START:ggp> zeta 2-globin promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> embryonic/fetal erythroid K562 cells <END> and the <START:ggp> adult alpha-globin promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> adult erythroid MEL cells <END> . 
On the other hand , the <START:ggp> 3'NF-E2/AP1 motif <END> is able to exert both positive and negative regulatory effects on the <START:ggp> zeta 2-globin promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> , and this dual function appears to be modulated through differential binding of the <START:ggp> ubiquitous AP1 factors <END> and the <START:ggp> erythroid-enriched NF-E2 factor <END> . 
Mutation in the <START:ggp> GATA-1 ( d ) motif <END> , which exhibits an <START:ggp> adult erythroid-specific genomic footprint <END> , decreases the <START:ggp> HS-40 enhancer <END> function in <START:ana> dimethyl sulfoxide-induced MEL cells <END> but not in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
These studies have defined the regulatory roles of the different <START:ggp> HS-40 motifs <END> . 
The remarkable correlation between genomic footprinting data and the mutagenesis results also suggests that the erythroid lineage- and developmental stage-specific regulation of <START:ggp> human alpha-like globin promoters <END> is indeed modulated by stable binding of <START:ggp> specific nuclear factors <END> in vivo . 
Nitric oxide-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on <START:ggp> p21ras <END> . 
The <START:ggp> protooncogene p21ras <END> , a <START:ggp> monomeric G protein family member <END> , plays a critical role in converting extracellular signals into intracellular biochemical events . 
Here , we report that nitric oxide ( NO ) activates <START:ggp> p21ras <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> as evidenced by an increase in <START:ggp> GTP-bound p21ras <END> . 
In vitro studies using <START:ggp> pure recombinant p21ras <END> demonstrate that the activation is direct and reversible . 
Circular dichroism analysis reveals that NO induces a profound conformational change in <START:ggp> p21ras <END> in association with GDP/GTP exchange . 
The mechanism of activation is due to S-nitrosylation of a critical cysteine residue which stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange . 
Furthermore , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> p21ras <END> is essential for NO-induced downstream signaling , such as <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation , and that endogenous NO can activate <START:ggp> p21ras <END> in the same cell . 
These studies identify <START:ggp> p21ras <END> as a target of the same cell . 
These studies identify <START:ggp> p21ras <END> as a target of NO in <START:ana> T cells <END> and suggest that NO activates <START:ggp> p21ras <END> by an action which mimics that of <START:ggp> guanine nucleotide exchange factors <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-2 promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes <END> is controlled by <START:ggp> nuclear factor-chi B <END> . 
The regulation of <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2 gene <END> expression has been investigated mainly in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , the predominant producers of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
However , <START:ana> B cells <END> can also synthesize <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
In the present study we analyzed the control of <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -transformed B cell clones <END> which are capable of secreting <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> at a low level after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin . 
Transient transfections using <START:ggp> reporter constructs <END> with multiples of <START:ggp> transcription factor binding sites <END> from the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> [ <START:ggp> distal nuclear factor ( NF ) -AT <END> , <START:ggp> proximal NF-AT <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1/Octamer <END> ( <START:ggp> UPS <END> ) or <START:ggp> NF-chi B <END> ( <START:ggp> TCEd <END> ) sites ] were performed . 
In <START:ana> EBV-transformed B clones <END> , the <START:ggp> chi B site <END> exerted the strongest inducible activity ; the <START:ggp> NF-AT binding sites <END> showed either no or only weak activity compared to <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
An <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> bearing a defective <START:ggp> NF-chi B site <END> was completely inactive in <START:ana> EBV-transformed B cells <END> , while it still had activity in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
In seven <START:ana> EBV-B cell clones <END> or lines differing in their capacity to secrete <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , the activity of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> correlated well with the status of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion . 
Similarly , a <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus promoter <END> , whose activity is controlled through <START:ggp> chi B factors <END> , was found to be active in the <START:ana> IL-2 producing EBV-B cells <END> , but inactive in the <START:ana> non-IL-2-producing cells <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using protein extracts from <START:ana> EBV-B cells <END> and the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> <START:ggp> NF-chi B <END> probe revealed the constitutive generation of <START:ggp> chi B complexes <END> in <START:ana> IL-2-secreting cells <END> consisting mainly of <START:ggp> heterodimeric p50/p65 complexes <END> . 
A weaker <START:ggp> chi B <END> complex formation and faster-migrating complexes were detected in <START:ana> non-IL-2-secreting cells <END> . 
These results demonstrate that the <START:ggp> IL-2 NF-chi B site <END> is indispensable for the activity of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> in <START:ana> EBV-transformed B cells <END> , whereas other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> appear to be less important for <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression in these cells . 
<START:ggp> Latent membrane protein-1 <END> induces <START:ggp> cyclin D2 <END> expression , <START:ggp> pRb <END> hyperphosphorylation , and loss of <START:ggp> TGF-beta 1 <END> -mediated growth inhibition in <START:ana> EBV-positive B cells <END> . 
The normal cell cycle is regulated by several molecules , such as the <START:ggp> tumor-suppressor protein pRb <END> , the <START:ggp> G1 cyclins <END> , the <START:ggp> cyclin-dependent kinases <END> , and their inhibitors . 
These regulators are targeted by negative growth regulatory signals , such as that provided by <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> . 
Here , we show that the presence of either wild-type EBV or its <START:ggp> transforming latent membrane protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> ) results in the loss of <START:ggp> TGF-beta 1 <END> -mediated growth inhibition in <START:ana> human B cells <END> . 
Chemical cross-linking with <START:ggp> 125I-labeled TGF-beta 1 <END> showed an essentially normal <START:ggp> TGF-beta receptor <END> profile in <START:ana> EBV-positive and EBV-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines <END> , and these receptors were shown to be functional in transducing signals , as evidenced by the <START:ggp> TGF-beta 1 <END> -mediated modulation of <START:ggp> junB gene <END> expression . 
However , <START:ggp> TGF-beta 1 <END> did not induce dephosphorylation of <START:ggp> pRb <END> in <START:ana> EBV ( or LMP-1 ) -positive cells <END> as opposed to <START:ana> EBV-negative cells <END> , suggesting a dichotomy in the <START:ggp> TGF-beta 1 <END> signaling pathway leading to separable gene regulatory and growth inhibitory responses . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> was found to induce the expression of <START:ggp> cyclin D2 <END> ; normal <START:ana> B cells <END> or <START:ana> EBV-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cells <END> do not express <START:ggp> D-type cyclins <END> . 
Taken together , these data point to a potential mechanism underlying EBV-mediated B cell transformation whereby constitutive induction of <START:ggp> key cell cycle regulators <END> by <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> can lead to <START:ggp> pRb <END> hyperphosphorylation and uncontrolled cell proliferation . 
Does thyroidectomy , radioactive iodine therapy , or antithyroid drug treatment alter reactivity of patients ' <START:ana> T cells <END> to epitopes of <START:ggp> thyrotropin receptor <END> in autoimmune thyroid diseases ? 
The effect of treatment on thyroid antibody production and T cell reactivity to thyroid antigens was studied in 15 patients with Graves ' disease ( GD ) before and after thyroidectomy , 19 patients with GD before and after radioactive iodine ( RAI ) therapy , and 9 patients maintained euthyroid on antithyroid drugs ( ATD ) . 
Twenty subjects matched for age and sex without known thyroid disease served as controls . 
In GD patients , the responses of <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) and <START:ana> TSH receptor ( TSHR ) -specific T cell lines <END> to <START:ggp> recombinant human TSHR extracellular domain <END> , <START:ggp> thyroglobulin <END> , and <START:ggp> TSHR <END> peptides were examined on the day of surgery or RAI therapy ( day 0 ) and also 6-8 weeks and 3-6 months thereafter . 
Reactivity to <START:ggp> TSHR <END> peptides before surgery was heterogeneous and spanned the entire <START:ggp> extracellular domain <END> . 
Six to 8 weeks after subtotal thyroidectomy , the number of patients ' <START:ana> PBMC <END> responding to any peptide and the average number of recognized peptides decreased . 
A further decrease in the T cell reactivity to <START:ggp> TSHR <END> peptides was observed 3-6 months after surgery . 
The responses of <START:ana> PBMC <END> from Graves ' patients before RAI therapy were less than those in the presurgical group . 
Six to 8 weeks after RAI therapy , the number of patients responding to any peptide and the average number of recognized peptides increased . 
Three to 6 months after RAI , T cell responses to <START:ggp> TSHR <END> peptides were less than those 6-8 weeks after RAI therapy , but still higher than the values on day 0 . 
Responses of <START:ana> PBMC <END> from patients with GD , maintained euthyroid on ATD , were lower than those before surgery or RAI therapy . 
The reactivity of <START:ana> T cell lines <END> in different groups reflected a pattern similar to <START:ana> PBMC <END> after treatment . 
<START:ggp> TSHR antibody <END> and <START:ggp> microsomal antibody <END> levels decreased after surgery , but increased after RAI therapy . 
The difference in the number of recognized peptides by patients ' <START:ana> PBMC <END> before RAI and surgery may reflect the effect of long term therapy with ATD in the patients before RAI vs. the shorter period in patients before surgery . 
The decreased T cell reactivity to <START:ggp> thyroid antigens <END> after thyroidectomy could be the result of removal of a major part of the thyroid gland or redistribution of suppressor-inducer <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The increased T cell response after RAI therapy is probably epitope specific , rather than a response to the whole <START:ggp> TSHR <END> molecule . 
Synchronous recognition of peptides 158-176 and 248-263 is important for the development of GD , and the loss of recognition of one of these <START:ggp> epitopes <END> may be an early sign of immune remission and a predictor of euthyroidism . 
Circumvention of tolerance for the <START:ggp> nuclear T cell protein <END> <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> by immunization of <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> knock-out mice . 
Molecular events that underlie the well-defined phenotypic changes of the <START:ana> differentiating thymocyte <END> are poorly understood . 
A candidate gene to control <START:ana> thymocyte <END> differentiation , <START:ggp> T cell factor-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> ) * encodes a <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> . 
Its mRNA expression pattern is complex during embryogenesis , yet restricted to <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> postnatally . 
Expression studies on <START:ggp> TCF-1 protein <END> have been hampered by the difficulty to raise <START:ggp> antibodies <END> due to extreme evolutionary conservation . 
<START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> knock-out mice , generated recently in our laboratory , have strongly decreased numbers of <START:ana> thymocytes <END> , but are otherwise normal . 
We have used these mice to generate <START:ggp> anti-TCF-1 antibodies <END> . 
By immunization with a <START:ggp> recombinant fusion protein <END> , we show that <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> knock-out mice readily yield antiserum titers against human and mouse TCF-1 protein . 
Wild-type littermates remain unresponsive to <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> while they mount a high-titer antibody response to the <START:ggp> fusion protein <END> , <START:ggp> Maltose Binding Protein <END> ( <START:ggp> MBP <END> ) . 
Subsequently , <START:ana> TCF-1-specific hybridomas <END> could be prepared from the spleens of immunized knock-out mice . 
This study illustrates the almost complete tolerance of mice for <START:ggp> human TCF-1 <END> and demonstrates that this tolerance is readily broken by gene knock-out . 
Furthermore , the usefulness of knock-out mice for the generation of <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> against the gene product of interest is underscored . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> Nm23H2 <END> , binds to and activates the translocated <START:ggp> c-myc allele <END> in Burkitt 's lymphoma . 
We have identified an in vivo footprint over the <START:ggp> PuF site <END> on the translocated <START:ggp> c-myc allele <END> in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells . 
The <START:ggp> PuF site <END> on the <START:ggp> silent normal c-myc allele <END> was unoccupied . 
We demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay , electrophoretic mobility shift assay with antibody , UV cross-linking followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis , and Western analysis that <START:ggp> Nm23H2 <END> in B cell nuclear extracts bound to the c-myc <START:ggp> PuF site <END> . 
Transfection experiments with <START:ggp> c-myc promoter constructs <END> in both <START:ana> DHL-9 <END> and <START:ana> Raji cells <END> revealed that the <START:ggp> PuF site <END> functioned as a <START:ggp> positive regulatory element <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> with a drop in activity with mutation of this site . 
Access to this site is blocked in the <START:ggp> normal silent c-myc allele <END> ; these data suggest that the <START:ggp> Nm23H2 <END> protein is involved in deregulation of the translocated <START:ggp> c-myc allele <END> in <START:ana> Burkitt 's lymphoma cells <END> . 
Identification of two novel <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> within the <START:ggp> 5'-untranslated region <END> of the <START:ggp> human A gamma-globin gene <END> . 
Interaction between the <START:ggp> stage selector element <END> ( SSE ) in the <START:ggp> proximal gamma-globin promoter <END> and <START:ggp> hypersensitivity site 2 <END> in the <START:ggp> locus control region <END> partly mediates the competitive silencing of the <START:ggp> beta-globin promoter <END> in the fetal developmental stage . 
We have now demonstrated that a second <START:ggp> SSE-like element <END> in the <START:ggp> 5'-untranslated region <END> of the <START:ggp> gamma-gene <END> also contributes to this competitive silencing of the <START:ggp> beta-gene <END> . 
Utilizing transient transfection assays in the <START:ana> fetal erythroid cell line <END> , <START:ana> K562 <END> , we have shown that the <START:ggp> core enhancer <END> of <START:ggp> hypersensitivity site 2 <END> can preferentially interact with the <START:ggp> proximal gamma-promoter <END> in the absence of the <START:ggp> SSE <END> , completely silencing a <START:ggp> linked beta-promoter <END> . 
Mutation of a 20-base pair sequence of the <START:ggp> gamma-gene 5'-untranslated region <END> ( <START:ggp> UTR <END> ) led to derepression of <START:ggp> beta-promoter <END> activity . 
A marked activation of <START:ggp> gamma-promoter <END> activity was also observed with this mutation , suggesting the presence of a repressor . 
Fine mutagenesis dissected these activities to different regions of the <START:ggp> 5'-UTR <END> . 
The stage selector activity was localized to a region centered on <START:ggp> nucleotides +13 to +15 <END> . 
Electromobility shift assays utilizing this sequence demonstrated binding of a <START:ggp> fetal and erythroid-specific protein <END> . 
The repressor activity of the <START:ggp> 5'-UTR <END> was localized to tandem <START:ggp> GATA-like sites <END> , which appear to bind a complex of two proteins , one of which is the <START:ggp> erythroid transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> . 
These results indicate that the <START:ggp> 5'-UTR <END> of the <START:ggp> gamma-gene <END> contains sequences that may be important for its transcriptional and developmental regulation . 
Coupling of a <START:ggp> signal response domain <END> in <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> to multiple pathways for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
The <START:ggp> eukaryotic transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> plays a central role in the induced expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and in many aspects of the genetic program mediating normal T-cell activation and growth . 
The nuclear activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is tightly regulated from the cytoplasmic compartment by an <START:ggp> inhibitory subunit <END> called <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
This cytoplasmic inhibitor is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded in response to a diverse set of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-inducing agents <END> , including <START:ggp> T-cell mitogens , <END> <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> , and <START:ggp> viral transactivators <END> such as the <START:ggp> Tax protein <END> of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 . 
To explore these <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> -dependent mechanisms for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> induction , we identified novel mutants of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> that uncouple its inhibitory and signal-transducing functions in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> . 
Specifically , removal of the <START:ggp> N-terminal 36 amino acids <END> of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> failed to disrupt its ability to form latent complexes with <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in the cytoplasm . 
However , this deletion mutation prevented the induced phosphorylation , degradative loss , and functional release of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> from <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> Tax-expressing cells <END> . 
Alanine substitutions introduced at two serine residues positioned within this <START:ggp> N-terminal regulatory region <END> of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> also yielded constitutive repressors that escaped from <START:ggp> Tax <END> -induced turnover and that potently inhibited immune activation pathways for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> induction , including those initiated from <START:ggp> antigen and cytokine receptors <END> . 
In contrast , introduction of a phosphoserine mimetic at these sites rectified this functional defect , a finding consistent with a causal linkage between the phosphorylation status and proteolytic stability of this <START:ggp> cytoplasmic inhibitor <END> . 
Together , these in vivo studies define a critical signal response domain in <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> that coordinately controls the biologic activities of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in response to viral and immune stimuli . 
Growth regulation and cellular changes during differentiation of <START:ana> human prostatic cancer LNCaP cells <END> as induced by T lymphocyte-conditioned medium . 
<START:ana> Human prostatic epithelial cells <END> from an <START:ana> androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line <END> were examined in response to conditioned medium ( CM ) derived from <START:ana> phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) -stimulated lymphocytes <END> . 
Addition of CM caused a greater than 70 % reduction of cell proliferation by cell counting and cell cycle . 
These cells showed G1 phase arrest and the clonogenicity was reduced . 
The growth-modulating effect was dose-dependent and not due to cell lysis or apoptosis . 
The binding of androgen to <START:ggp> androgen receptor <END> on these cells showed approximately 50 % reduction , underlining a proliferation reduction mechanism . 
The <START:ggp> prostate-specific antigen <END> ( <START:ggp> PSA <END> ) was downregulated to approximately 75 % during the process . 
Cell morphology showed dendritic processes extending from cytoplasm and other <START:ana> neuroendocrine cell <END> characteristics . 
The expression of several <START:ggp> cytoskeleton and intracellular proteins <END> increased as determined by immunostaining on slides and by ELISA procedures . 
These included <START:ggp> vimentin <END> , correlating to cell shape changes , <START:ggp> cytokeratins 8 and 18 <END> , associated with <START:ana> differentiated cell types <END> of prostate epithelia , and <START:ggp> neuron-specific enolase <END> and serotonin , associated with <START:ana> neuroendocrine cells <END> . 
From these cellular changes , we can infer that the cell growth was modulated along with induction of terminal differentiation . 
Activated <START:ana> T cells <END> were demonstrated to be important in providing the modulating activity . 
This <START:ggp> growth modulator <END> was semipurified and had an estimated molecular weight 13 , 000 to 24 , 000 Da . 
The activity was determined to be distinct from <START:ggp> TGF <END> , <START:ggp> TNF <END> , and some commonly known <START:ggp> lymphokines <END> . 
The interaction between <START:ana> lymphoid and prostatic cells <END> in growth and development is described . 
<START:ggp> Platelet-activating factor <END> stimulates transcription of the <START:ggp> heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Correlation with an increased kappa B binding activity . 
Human peripheral blood <START:ana> monocytes <END> responded to stimulation of <START:ggp> platelet-activating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> PAF <END> ) with up-regulation of the transcript for <START:ggp> heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor <END> ( <START:ggp> HB-EGF <END> ) , a <START:ggp> potent mitogen <END> for <START:ana> vascular smooth muscle cells <END> . 
This function of <START:ggp> PAF <END> was observed at nanomolar concentrations of the ligand , starting at 30 min after stimulation . 
The <START:ggp> PAF <END> -induced up-regulation of <START:ana> HB-EGF mRNA <END> was accompanied by an increase in kappa B binding activity . 
These functions of <START:ggp> PAF <END> appeared to be mediated through the <START:ggp> cell surface PAF receptors <END> , as two <START:ggp> PAF <END> receptor antagonists , WEB 2086 and L-659 , 989 , blocked both the up-regulation of <START:ana> HB-EGF mRNA <END> and kappa B binding activity induced by <START:ggp> PAF <END> . 
The antagonists , however , had no effect on phorbol ester-induced up-regulation of <START:ana> HB-EGF mRNA <END> and kappa B binding activity . 
Pretreatment of <START:ana> monocytes <END> with pertussis toxin inhibited these functions of <START:ggp> PAF <END> , whereas cholera toxin had no inhibitory effect . 
Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , an inhibitor for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation , markedly reduced <START:ggp> PAF <END> -stimulated kappa B binding activity as well as up-regulation of <START:ana> HB-EGF mRNA <END> . 
These results suggest a potential role of <START:ggp> PAF <END> in <START:ggp> HB-EGF <END> expression and provide evidence that this stimulation may occur through increased kappa B binding activity . 
Mapping of the <START:ggp> interaction site <END> of the <START:ggp> defective transcription factor <END> in the <START:ana> class II major histocompatibility complex mutant cell line clone-13 <END> to the <START:ggp> divergent X2-box <END> . 
We have previously described a <START:ana> mutant B lymphoblastoid cell line <END> , <START:ana> Clone-13 , <END> that expresses <START:ggp> HLA-DQ <END> in the absence of <START:ggp> HLA-DR and -DP <END> . 
Several criteria indicated that the defect in this cell line influences the activity of an <START:ggp> isotype-specific transcription factor <END> . 
Indeed , transient transfection of <START:ggp> HLA-DRA and DQB reporter constructs <END> indicated that the affected factor operates via <START:ggp> cis-elements <END> located between <START:ggp> -141 base pairs <END> and the <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> . 
A series of <START:ggp> hybrid DRA/DQB reporter constructs <END> was generated to further map the relevant <START:ggp> cis-elements <END> in this system . 
Insertion of oligonucleotides spanning the <START:ggp> DQB X-box <END> ( but not the <START:ggp> DQB-W region <END> or the <START:ggp> DQB Y-box <END> ) <START:ggp> upstream of -141 <END> in a <START:ggp> DRA reporter plasmid <END> rescued expression to nearly wild-type levels . 
Substitution promoters were then generated where the entire <START:ggp> X-box <END> , or only the <START:ggp> X1- or X2-boxes <END> of <START:ggp> HLA-DRA <END> were replaced with the analogous regions of <START:ggp> HLA-DQB <END> . 
The <START:ggp> DQB X2-box <END> was able to restore expression to the <START:ggp> silent DRA reporter construct <END> . 
Moreover , replacement of the <START:ggp> DQB X2-box <END> with the <START:ggp> DRA X2-box <END> markedly diminished the activity of the <START:ggp> DQB promoter <END> in the <START:ana> mutant cell <END> . 
None of the <START:ggp> hybrid reporter constructs <END> were defective when transfected into the <START:ggp> wild-type <END> , <START:ana> HLA-DR/-DQ positive parental cell line <END> , <START:ana> Jijoye <END> . 
These studies suggest that the <START:ggp> divergent X2-box <END> of the <START:ggp> class II major histocompatibility complex promoters <END> plays an important role in influencing differential expression of the <START:ggp> human class II isotypes <END> . 
Restoration of the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ZEBRA protein <END> 's capacity to disrupt latency by the addition of <START:ggp> heterologous activation regions <END> . 
The <START:ggp> ZEBRA protein <END> has a unique biological function among <START:ggp> herpesviral proteins <END> . 
It is responsible for the disruption of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) latency and the induction of the lytic cycle . 
<START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> is a <START:ggp> bZIP transcriptional activator <END> which binds as a dimer to <START:ggp> 7-bp response elements <END> within <START:ggp> EBV promoters <END> and is directly involved in the stimulation of virus replication at the <START:ggp> EBV lytic origin <END> . 
We have employed the <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> /EBV biological system to test whether a <START:ggp> heterologous activation domain <END> can substitute for another activation domain ( the <START:ggp> ZEBRA domain <END> ) . 
The <START:ggp> ZEBRA activation region <END> was replaced with the potent <START:ggp> acid activation region <END> from the <START:ggp> herpes simplex virus VP16 protein <END> or with the <START:ggp> activation region <END> of the <START:ggp> EBV R protein <END> . 
Both chimeras were found to transactivate model and native promoters at equivalent or better levels than <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> itself . 
Activation was not target- or cell-type dependent , nor was it dependent on the presence of virus . 
These activation domains restored <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> 's ability to induce <START:ggp> early antigen <END> and to stimulate origin replication to levels that were equal to or greater than those of wild type . 
These studies suggest that the specificities of some of the known biological functions of <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> are not dependent upon the nature of the <START:ggp> activation domain present <END> within <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin 4 <END> activates a signal transducer and activator of <START:ggp> transcription ( Stat ) protein <END> which interacts with an <START:ggp> interferon-gamma activation site-like sequence <END> upstream of the <START:ggp> I epsilon exon <END> in a <START:ana> human B cell line <END> . 
Evidence for the involvement of <START:ggp> Janus kinase 3 <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin-4 Stat <END> . 
<START:ana> Germ line C transcripts <END> can be induced by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> in the <START:ana> human B cell line <END> , <START:ana> BL-2 <END> . 
Utilizing a <START:ggp> IFN-gamma activation site-like DNA sequence element <END> located upstream of the <START:ggp> I epsilon exon <END> , we demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays that <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> induced a binding activity in the cytosol and nucleus of <START:ana> BL-2 cells <END> . 
This factor was designated <START:ggp> IL-4 NAF <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4-induced nuclear-activating factors <END> ) and was identified as a <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphoprotein <END> , which translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus upon <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> treatment . 
Because these are the characteristics of a <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) protein <END> , we determined whether <START:ggp> antibodies to Stat proteins <END> will interfere with gel mobility shift and found that <START:ggp> antibodies to IL-4 Stat <END> , also known as <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> , but not <START:ggp> antibodies <END> to other <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> , interfere with the formation of the <START:ggp> IL-4 NAF complex <END> . 
Congruous with the involvement of a <START:ggp> Stat protein <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> induced robust <START:ggp> Janus kinase 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> ) activity in <START:ana> BL-2 cells <END> . 
Cotransfection of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> with <START:ggp> IL-4 Stat <END> into <START:ana> COS-7 cells <END> produced an intracellular activity which bound the same <START:ggp> IFN-gamma activation site-like sequence <END> and comigrated with <START:ggp> IL-4 NAF <END> in electrophoretic mobility shift assay . 
These results show that <START:ggp> IL-4 NAF <END> is <START:ggp> IL-4 Stat <END> , which is activated by <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> in response to <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> receptor engagement . 
Does activation of the <START:ggp> TAL1 gene <END> occur in a majority of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ? A pediatric oncology group study . 
Almost 25 % of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) have tumor-specific rearrangements of the <START:ggp> TAL1 gene <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> expression has not been observed in <START:ana> normal lymphocytes <END> , <START:ggp> TAL1 gene products <END> are readily detected in <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> that harbor a <START:ggp> rearranged TAL1 allele <END> . 
Hence , it has been proposed that ectopic expression of <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> promotes the development of T-ALL . 
In this report , we show that <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> is expressed in the <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> of most patients with T-ALL , including many that do not display an apparent <START:ggp> TAL1 gene <END> alteration . 
A polymorphic dinucleotide repeat in the transcribed sequences of <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> was used to determine the allele specificity of <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> transcription in <START:ana> primary T-ALL cells <END> . 
Monoallelic expression of <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> was observed in the <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> of all patients ( 8 of 8 ) bearing a <START:ggp> TAL1 gene <END> rearrangement . 
In the <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> of patients without detectable <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> rearrangements , <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> transcription occurred in either a monoallelic ( 3 of 7 patients ) or a biallelic ( 4 of 7 patients ) fashion . 
Thus , <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> activation in these patients may result from subtle alterations in <START:ggp> cis-acting regulatory sequences <END> ( affecting expression of a <START:ggp> single TAL1 allele <END> ) or changes in trans-acting factors that control <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> transcription ( affecting expression of both <START:ggp> TAL1 alleles <END> ) . 
Expression of <START:ggp> erythroid-specific genes <END> in acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down 's syndrome . 
Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia ( M7 ) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down 's syndrome ( TMD ) are characterized by rapid growth of <START:ana> abnormal blast cells <END> which express <START:ggp> megakaryocytic markers <END> . 
To clarify properties of the <START:ana> blast cells <END> in M7 and TMD cases , we examined erythroid markers expression in <START:ana> blasts <END> from six cases with M7 and seven cases with TMD in this study . 
<START:ana> Erythroid-specific mRNAs <END> encoding <START:ggp> gamma-globin <END> and <START:ggp> erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase <END> were found to be expressed in <START:ana> blasts <END> from most of these cases , indicating that majorities of the <START:ana> blasts <END> in M7 and TMD cases have erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes . 
We also found that <START:ana> mRNAs <END> encoding <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> are expressed in all these cases . 
These results suggest that <START:ana> M7 blasts <END> and <START:ana> TMD blasts <END> correspond to the <START:ana> erythroid/megakaryocytic bipotential progenitor cells <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> Ah receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCDD receptor <END> ) during human monocytic differentiation . 
We have previously found a high expression of <START:ana> human Ah receptor ( TCDD receptor ) mRNA <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood cells <END> of individuals . 
In this paper , the expression of this gene in <START:ana> blood cells <END> was first investigated in fractions of <START:ana> nucleated cells <END> , revealing predominant expression of the <START:ggp> Ah receptor gene <END> in the <START:ana> monocyte fraction <END> . 
Then the expression levels of <START:ana> AhR mRNA <END> in various <START:ana> hematopoietic cell lines <END> were examined together with those of <START:ggp> Arnt <END> and <START:ggp> P450IA1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> AhR <END> was expressed at high levels in <START:ana> monocytoid U937 <END> , <START:ana> THP1 <END> , and <START:ana> HEL/S cells <END> , and at moderate levels in <START:ana> promyelocytic HL60 cells <END> and <START:ana> erythroblastic HEL cells <END> . 
However , it was not detected in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> <START:ana> MOLT4 <END> ( <START:ana> T cell <END> ) and <START:ana> BALL1 <END> ( <START:ana> B cell <END> ) , nor in <START:ana> K562 erythroblasts <END> . 
Furthermore , a specific induction of <START:ggp> AhR <END> during monocytic differentiation was investigated in <START:ana> HL60 <END> and <START:ana> HEL cells <END> . 
<START:ana> HL60 cells <END> were induced to differentiate toward <START:ana> monocytes-macrophages <END> by incubation with phorbol ester , showing a 5- to 2-fold increase of <START:ana> AhR mRNA <END> . 
The incubation with <START:ggp> transforming growth factor beta 1 <END> and 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 resulted in a 5- to 7-fold increase of <START:ana> AhR mRNA <END> . 
The <START:ana> HEL cells <END> also exhibited a similar elevation of <START:ana> AhR mRNA <END> level , when they had differentiated toward <START:ana> monocyte-macrophage cells <END> by these combined inducers , but little change in the mRNA level was observed when the cells were induced to differentiate into other cell types . 
Treatment of the <START:ana> differentiated HL60 cells <END> with 3-methylcholanthrene , a ligand of <START:ggp> AhR <END> , induced the expression of the <START:ggp> P450IA1 <END> gene . 
These results indicated that expression of <START:ana> AhR mRNA <END> was significantly induced during monocytic differentiation and that the <START:ana> differentiated cells <END> were responsive to xenobiotics . 
Our results suggest that <START:ggp> AhR <END> may play an important role in the function of <START:ana> monocytes <END> and also in the eventual activation of environmental carcinogens . 
<START:ana> Neutrophils <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> express high levels of <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> ( <START:ggp> Spi-1 <END> ) but not <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> . 
<START:ggp> PU.1 <END> ( the <START:ggp> Spi-1 oncogene <END> ) and <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> are closely related members of the <START:ggp> ets transcription factor family <END> , sharing similar DNA binding specificities mediated by similar <START:ggp> DNA binding domains <END> . 
<START:ggp> PU.1 <END> and <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> have been previously described as being predominantly expressed coordinately in <START:ana> macrophages <END> and <START:ana> B cells <END> , but their expression in early hematopoietic stages and during the course of myeloid differentiation to <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> or to <START:ana> neutrophils <END> has not been extensively investigated . 
Here , we report that <START:ana> PU.1 mRNA <END> is upregulated during myeloid differentiation of <START:ana> human purified CD34+ cells <END> and <START:ana> murine multipotential FDCP-mix A4 cells <END> , suggesting that <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> is upregulated as an early event during differentiation of <START:ana> multipotential progenitor cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> PU.1 <END> expression is maintained at stable levels during differentiation of <START:ana> myeloid cell lines <END> <START:ana> U937 <END> and <START:ana> HL-60 <END> to <START:ana> monocytic and neutrophilic cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> PU.1 <END> is expressed at highest levels in <START:ana> mature human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> human peripheral blood neutrophils <END> . 
In contrast to <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , significant levels of <START:ana> Spi-B mRNA <END> and protein are found only in some <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> and spleen but are not found in <START:ana> myeloid cell lines <END> , <START:ana> neutrophils <END> , or <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
In vitro translated <START:ggp> Spi-B protein <END> can bind to <START:ggp> PU.1 binding sites <END> in <START:ggp> myeloid promoters <END> and transactivate these <START:ggp> promoters <END> in <START:ana> nonmyeloid cells <END> . 
Therefore , although <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> and <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> may bind to similar DNA control elements and have redundancy of transactivation function in vitro , the lack of significant levels of <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> makes it unlikely that <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> plays a significant role in myeloid lineage development and gene expression . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> is expressed at high levels not only in <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> but also in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> , indicating that <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> can activate gene expression in both <START:ana> major myeloid lineages <END> . 
Identification of a major <START:ggp> positive regulatory element <END> located 5 ' to the <START:ggp> human zeta-globin gene <END> . 
The function of the <START:ggp> zeta-globin promoter <END> was studied using a series of <START:ggp> zeta-globin promoter deletion constructs <END> to drive <START:ggp> luciferase <END> expression in <START:ana> transiently transfected human erythroleukemia cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> promoters <END> were used without <START:ggp> enhancers <END> , or with <START:ggp> enhancers <END> derived from the <START:ggp> beta-globin locus control region <END> and the <START:ggp> alpha-globin HS-40 enhancer <END> . 
When transfected into <START:ana> K562 cells <END> , which express <START:ggp> zeta-globin <END> , comparable amounts of activity were obtained from the <START:ggp> -557 and -417 zeta-luciferase constructs <END> and the <START:ggp> alpha-luciferase constructs <END> when no <START:ggp> enhancers <END> or the <START:ggp> alpha-globin locus enhancers <END> were used . 
When the constructs were transfected into <START:ana> OCIM1 cells <END> , which do not express <START:ggp> zeta-globin <END> , the <START:ggp> zeta-globin promoters <END> were at best 20 % as active as the <START:ggp> alpha-globin promoters <END> . 
When <START:ggp> sequences from -417 to -207 5 ' <END> to the <START:ana> zeta-globin mRNA cap site <END> were deleted , up to 95 % of the <START:ggp> zeta-globin promoter <END> activity was lost in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
Reinsertion of these sequences into <START:ggp> zeta-luciferase constructs <END> missing the -417 to -207 region showed that the sequences lack classical enhancer activity . 
Point mutation of a <START:ggp> GATA-1 site <END> at -230 reduced promoter activity by 37 % . 
Point mutation of a <START:ggp> CCACC site <END> at -240 had no effect . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the <START:ggp> -230 GATA-1 site <END> has a relatively low affinity for <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> . 
These experiments show the presence of a strong <START:ggp> positive-acting element <END> , located between <START:ggp> -417 and -207 bp 5 ' <END> to the <START:ggp> zeta-globin mRNA cap site <END> , is necessary for high-level promoter activity in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
This element requires <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> additional unknown factors <END> for maximal activity . 
Analysis of the role of <START:ggp> protein kinase C-alpha , -epsilon , and -zeta <END> in T cell activation . 
<START:ana> T cells <END> express multiple isotypes of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) and although it is well accepted that <START:ggp> PKCs <END> have an important role in T cell activation , little is known about the function of individual <START:ggp> PKC isotypes <END> . 
To address this issue , mutationally active <START:ggp> PKC-alpha , -epsilon , or -zeta <END> have been transfected into <START:ana> T cells <END> and the consequences for T cell activation determined . 
<START:ggp> p21ras <END> plays an essential role in T cell activation . 
Accordingly , the effects of the <START:ggp> constitutively active PKCs <END> were compared to the effects of mutationally activated <START:ggp> p21ras <END> . 
The data indicate that <START:ggp> PKC-epsilon <END> and , to a lesser extent <START:ggp> PKC-alpha <END> but not <START:ggp> -zeta <END> , can regulate the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and nuclear <START:ggp> factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT-1 <END> ) . 
The ability of <START:ggp> PKC-epsilon <END> to induce transactivation of <START:ggp> NF-AT-1 <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> was similar to the stimulatory effect of a <START:ggp> constitutively activated p21ras <END> . 
<START:ggp> PKC-epsilon <END> , but not <START:ggp> PKC-alpha <END> nor activated <START:ggp> p21ras <END> , was able to induce <START:ggp> NF-KB <END> activity . 
Phorbol esters induce expression of <START:ggp> CD69 <END> whereas none of the <START:ggp> activated PKC isotypes <END> tested were able to have this effect . 
Activated <START:ggp> Src <END> and <START:ggp> p21ras <END> were able to induce <START:ggp> CD69 <END> expression . 
These results indicate selective functions for different <START:ggp> PKC isotypes <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Moreover , the data comparing the effects of <START:ggp> activated Ras <END> and <START:ggp> PKC mutants <END> suggest that <START:ggp> PKC-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> p21ras <END> , and <START:ggp> PKC-epsilon <END> are not positioned linearly on a single signal transduction pathway . 
Differences in binding of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> to DNA in steroid-resistant asthma . 
Although glucocorticosteroids are a very effective treatment for asthma and other chronic inflammatory diseases , a small proportion of patients are resistant to their therapeutic effects . 
The molecular mechanism for this steroid resistance is unclear . 
Steroid resistance can not be explained by pharmacokinetic mechanisms , by a defect in the binding of steroids to <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> , nor by defective nuclear translocation of this receptor , thereby suggesting that the molecular abnormality lies distal to nuclear translocation . 
We examined the ability of nuclear translocated <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> to bind to their <START:ggp> DNA binding sites <END> ( <START:ggp> GRE <END> ) using electrophoretic mobility shift assays in <START:ana> PBMC <END> from patients with steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant asthma . 
The binding of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> to DNA in these patients was also studied using Scatchard analysis . 
Dexamethasone induced a significant rapid and sustained twofold increase in <START:ggp> GRE <END> binding in <START:ana> PBMCs <END> from steroid-sensitive asthmatic patients and nonasthmatic individuals , but this was markedly reduced in steroid-resistant asthmatic patients . 
Scatchard analysis of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> - <START:ggp> GRE <END> binding showed no change in binding affinity but did show a reduced number of <START:ggp> receptors <END> available for DNA binding in the steroid-resistant patients . 
These results suggest that the ability of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> to bind to <START:ggp> GRE <END> is impaired in steroid-resistant patients because of a reduced number of <START:ggp> receptors <END> available for binding to DNA . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-5 <END> signaling in <START:ana> human eosinophils <END> involves <START:ggp> JAK2 tyrosine kinase <END> and <START:ggp> Stat1 alpha <END> . 
Signaling by a wide variety of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , including <START:ggp> interferons <END> , <START:ggp> interleukins <END> , and <START:ggp> growth factors <END> , involves activation of <START:ggp> JAK kinases <END> and <START:ggp> Stat ( Signal transducers and activators of transcription ) proteins <END> . 
At present , not much is known about the molecular mechanisms by which <START:ggp> interleukin-5 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> ) exerts its diverse biologic effects . 
<START:ana> Human eosinophils <END> are one of the most important <START:ana> target cells <END> for <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> and were used here to study <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> signaling in a <START:ana> primary human cell <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-5 <END> induced rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> induced at least two <START:ggp> DNA-binding complexes <END> , using nuclear extracts from normal <START:ana> human eosinophils <END> and the <START:ggp> IL-6/interferon-gamma response element <END> of the <START:ggp> ICAM-1 promoter <END> ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 pIRE <END> ) in an electromobility shift assay . 
From supershift experiments it was concluded that one <START:ggp> DNA-binding complex <END> contained <START:ggp> Stat1 alpha <END> , probably as a homodimer . 
Both <START:ggp> DNA-binding complexes <END> were inhibited by a <START:ggp> phosphotyrosine antibody <END> ( <START:ggp> 4G10 <END> ) , suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for complex formation . 
<START:ggp> IL-3 <END> and <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> induced , similar to <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> , two <START:ggp> DNA-binding complexes <END> in <START:ana> human eosinophils <END> , including <START:ggp> Stat1 alpha <END> . 
These data show for the first time that molecular mechanisms of <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> signaling in <START:ana> human eosinophils <END> involve members of the <START:ggp> JAK kinase family <END> as well as members of the <START:ggp> Stat family <END> . 
Infection and replication of Tat- human immunodeficiency viruses : genetic analyses of <START:ggp> LTR <END> and <START:ggp> tat mutations <END> in <START:ana> primary and long-term human lymphoid cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tat <END> is an essential <START:ggp> regulatory protein <END> for the replication of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 
Mutations in the <START:ggp> tat gene <END> have been shown to block HIV replication in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
Several studies have established that <START:ggp> Tat <END> releases an <START:ggp> elongation block <END> to the transcription of <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) ; however , it is not known whether this mechanism alone is sufficient to explain the block to HIV replication in <START:ana> human T cells <END> when <START:ggp> Tat <END> is absent . 
It is possible that <START:ggp> Tat <END> is also needed for other functions during HIV replication . 
To test these hypotheses , we studied several <START:ggp> tat mutants <END> , including two <START:ggp> stop codon mutants <END> and one <START:ggp> deletion mutant <END> using <START:ggp> replication-competent HIV-1 constructs <END> carrying <START:ggp> wild-type or mutant LTRs <END> with modifications in the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B and/or Sp1 binding sites <END> . 
In this study , we show that Tat- HIV-1 with <START:ggp> wild-type LTRs <END> can replicate in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , and the virus produced from <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> can infect primary <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
It was found that the propagation of the <START:ggp> Tat mutants <END> containing <START:ggp> wild-type LTRs <END> was less efficient than that of the <START:ggp> LTR-modified Tat mutants <END> . 
Large amounts of <START:ana> viral RNA <END> and particles were synthesized in infections established using the <START:ggp> tat mutants <END> that contain <START:ggp> modified LTRs <END> . 
However , this efficient propagation of the <START:ggp> LTR-modified tat mutants <END> was restricted to some <START:ana> lymphoid cell lines <END> that have been transformed with other viruses . 
Thus , despite its essential role for releasing an <START:ggp> elongation block <END> , <START:ggp> Tat <END> is not otherwise absolutely required for synthesis of <START:ana> full-length HIV transcripts <END> and assembly of virus particles . 
Direct sequencing of the <START:ggp> viral genomes <END> and reinfection kinetics showed no evidence of wild-type reversion even after prolonged infection with the <START:ggp> Tat <END> -virus . 
The implications for in vivo HIV-1 replication and potential application of this system to the study of alternative <START:ggp> Tat <END> function are discussed . 
Functional roles of the <START:ggp> transcription factor Oct-2A <END> and the <START:ggp> high mobility group protein <END> <START:ggp> I/Y <END> in <START:ggp> HLA-DRA gene <END> expression . 
The <START:ggp> class II major histocompatibility complex gene <END> <START:ggp> HLA-DRA <END> is expressed in <START:ana> B cells <END> , activated <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , and in <START:ana> antigen-presenting cells <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> HLA-DRA gene <END> expression is inducible in a variety of cell types by <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) . 
Here we show that the <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct-2A <END> plays a critical role in <START:ggp> HLA-DRA gene <END> expression in <START:ana> class II-positive B cell lines <END> , and that the <START:ggp> high mobility group protein <END> ( <START:ggp> HMG <END> ) <START:ggp> I/Y <END> binds to multiple sites within the <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> , including the <START:ggp> Oct-2A binding site <END> . 
Coexpression of <START:ggp> HMG I/Y <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> in <START:ana> cell lines <END> lacking <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> results in high levels of <START:ggp> HLA-DRA gene <END> expression , and in vitro DNA-binding studies reveal that HMG <START:ggp> I/Y <END> stimulates <START:ggp> Oct-2A <END> binding to the <START:ggp> HLA-DRA promoter <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> Oct-2A <END> and <START:ggp> HMG I/Y <END> may synergize to activate <START:ggp> HLA-DRA <END> expression in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
By contrast , <START:ggp> Oct-2A <END> is not involved in the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induction of the <START:ggp> HLA-DRA gene <END> in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , but <START:ggp> antisense HMG I/Y <END> dramatically decreases the level of induction . 
We conclude that distinct sets of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are involved in the two modes of <START:ggp> HLA-DRA <END> expression , and that <START:ggp> HMG I/Y <END> may be important for B cell-specific expression , and is essential for <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induction . 
Heterogeneous expression of <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus latent proteins <END> in endemic Burkitt 's lymphoma . 
<START:ana> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -infected cells <END> may sustain three distinct forms of virus latency . 
In <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> , six <START:ggp> EBV-encoded nuclear antigens <END> ( <START:ggp> EBNA1 , 2 , 3A , 3B , 3C , -LP <END> ) , three <START:ggp> latent membrane proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> , <START:ggp> 2A <END> , <START:ggp> 2B <END> ) , and two <START:ana> nuclear RNAs <END> ( <START:ana> EBERs <END> ) are expressed . 
This form of latency , termed latency III , is also encountered in some posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders . 
In EBV-positive cases of Hodgkin 's disease , the <START:ana> EBERs <END> , <START:ggp> EBNA1 <END> , and the <START:ggp> LMPs <END> are expressed ( latency II ) , whereas in Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) only the <START:ana> EBERs <END> and <START:ggp> EBNA1 <END> have been detected ( latency I ) . 
We have studied the expression of <START:ggp> EBV proteins <END> in 17 cases of EBV-positive endemic BL by immunohistology . 
Expression of <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> was seen in variable proportions of <START:ana> tumor cells <END> in two cases and <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> was detected in some <START:ana> tumor cells <END> in three other cases . 
Also , the <START:ggp> BZLF1 trans-activator protein <END> was expressed in a few <START:ana> tumor cells <END> in 6 cases , indicating entry into the lytic cycle . 
A phenotypic drift from latency I to latency III has been observed previously in some <START:ana> BL cell lines <END> . 
Our results suggest that a similar phenomenon may occur in BL in vivo and indicate that the operational definition of EBV latencies is not easily applied to human tumors . 
The activation of the <START:ggp> Jak <END> <START:ggp> -STAT 1 <END> signaling pathway by <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
The intracellular signal transduction of <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> is unknown . 
The objective of this study was to investigate the involvement of the newly discovered <START:ggp> Jak <END> <START:ggp> -STAT <END> pathway in the <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> signal transduction mechanism . 
<START:ana> Eosinophils <END> were purified from peripheral blood by discontinuous Percoll gradients and stimulated with <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> . 
The involvement of <START:ggp> Jak 2 <END> was investigated by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting for tyrosine phosphorylation . 
The activation of <START:ggp> Jak 2 <END> was studied by autophosphorylation of the <START:ggp> immunoprecipitated kinase <END> . 
<START:ggp> Jak 2 <END> was tyrosine phosphorylated within 1 to 3 min after stimulation of <START:ana> eosinophils <END> with <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> . 
Further , the <START:ggp> immunoprecipitated Jak 2 <END> obtained from <START:ana> IL-5-stimulated cells <END> underwent autophosphorylation . 
<START:ggp> Jak 2 <END> coprecipitated with the beta-subunit of the <START:ggp> IL-5 receptor <END> , suggesting a physical association of the <START:ggp> kinase <END> with the receptor . 
The <START:ggp> nuclear factor STAT-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> p91 <END> ) was investigated by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting for tyrosine phosphorylation . 
<START:ggp> STAT-1 <END> was tyrosine phosphorylated within 15 min of <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> stimulation . 
The presence of <START:ggp> STAT-1 <END> in the nuclear extract was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . 
<START:ggp> IL-5 <END> induced two proteins that bound to the <START:ggp> gamma-activating sequence <END> . 
In the presence of an <START:ggp> anti-STAT-1 Ab <END> , the band was supershifted . 
Thus , we demonstrated that <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> activated the <START:ggp> Jak 2 <END> <START:ggp> -STAT 1 <END> signaling pathway in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
We speculate that the <START:ggp> Jak 2 <END> <START:ggp> -STAT 1 <END> pathway may be involved in the activation of <START:ggp> IL-5-inducible genes <END> in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
Reduced mitogenic stimulation of <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> as a prognostic parameter for the course of breast cancer : a prospective longitudinal study . 
Immunosuppression has been often associated with the course of malignant diseases . 
In the present study , the proliferation of <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMCs <END> ) in response to mitogenic stimulation with <START:ggp> phytohaemagglutinin <END> ( <START:ggp> PHA <END> ) was assessed prospectively in 90 patients with stage I-III breast cancer . 
Whereas <START:ggp> PHA <END> -induced proliferation of <START:ana> PBMCs <END> derived from patients with breast cancer preoperatively was significantly decreased when compared with data obtained in healthy control individuals ( P < 0.001 ) , the degree of the defect in <START:ggp> PHA <END> -induced proliferation of <START:ana> PBMCs <END> depended upon the tumour burden as manifested by tumour size and axillary lymph node involvement ( P < 0.003 in each case ) . 
<START:ggp> PHA <END> -induced proliferation of <START:ana> PBMCs <END> dropped significantly in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide , methotrexate and fluorouracil ( CMF ) after an observation period of 6 months ( P < 0.01 ) , but not in patients under adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen only . 
After an additional 6 months ( i.e. 12 months after surgery ) , <START:ggp> PHA <END> -induced proliferation of <START:ana> PBMCs <END> was similar in patients after adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF and in those receiving continued adjuvant tamoxifen treatment ( P > 0.1 ) , but in all patients still significantly decreased as compared with healthy controls ( P < 0.001 ) . 
When data obtained preoperatively and after 12 months were compared , it was found that out of 23 patients whose <START:ana> PBMCs <END> had experienced a drop in their <START:ggp> PHA <END> -induced proliferation , 14 ( 61 % ) had developed metastatic disease within the subsequent 24 months ( i.e. 36 months after surgery ) . 
In contrast , out of 59 patients whose <START:ana> PBMCs <END> showed an increase in their <START:ggp> PHA <END> -induced proliferation within the first 12 months after surgery , only one ( 2 % ) presented with disease progression . 
We thus conclude that <START:ggp> PHA <END> -induced proliferation of <START:ana> PBMCs <END> derived from patients with breast cancer depends upon the tumour load and is a good clinical predictor for the further course of the disease . 
Activation of transcription by binding of <START:ggp> NF-E1 <END> ( <START:ggp> YY1 <END> ) to a newly identified element in the first exon of the <START:ggp> human DR alpha gene <END> . 
A previously unrecognized element , located downstream of the <START:ggp> start site of transcription <END> in the first <START:ggp> exon <END> of the <START:ggp> DR alpha gene <END> , has been defined that enhances promoter activity up to eightfold in a position-dependent manner . 
Mutations in this <START:ggp> DNA-binding site <END> abolished binding of a <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> in human B cell nuclear extract and decreased the activity of the <START:ggp> DR alpha promoter <END> to a basal level . 
Significant sequence homology of this <START:ggp> element <END> was found in the DNA of the <START:ggp> DR beta , DP alpha and -beta , and DQ alpha genes <END> , always located downstream of the <START:ggp> transcriptional start site <END> . 
The nuclear factor binds to the <START:ggp> DR alpha and DP alpha element <END> but not to the element in the <START:ggp> DQ alpha gene <END> . 
It was identified as <START:ggp> NF-E1 <END> ( <START:ggp> YY1 <END> ) . 
This protein , previously identified by its binding to the <START:ggp> Ig kappa 3 ' enhancer <END> and the <START:ggp> Ig heavy chain mu E1 site <END> , thus also appears to be quite important in the regulation of <START:ggp> MHC class II gene <END> expression . 
Transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> core binding factor-alpha ( AML1 ) and beta <END> subunits on <START:ggp> murine leukemia virus enhancer cores <END> . 
<START:ggp> Core binding factor <END> ( <START:ggp> CBF <END> ) , also known as <START:ggp> polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2 <END> and <START:ggp> SL3 enhancer factor 1 <END> , is a <START:ggp> mammalian transcription factor <END> that binds to an element termed the core within the <START:ggp> enhancers <END> of the murine leukemia virus family of retroviruses . 
The <START:ggp> core elements <END> of the SL3 virus are important genetic determinants of the ability of this virus to induce T-cell lymphomas and the transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> viral long terminal repeat <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> CBF <END> consists of two subunits , a <START:ggp> DNA binding subunit <END> , <START:ggp> CBF alpha <END> , and a second subunit , <START:ggp> CBF beta <END> , that stimulates the DNA binding activity of <START:ggp> CBF alpha <END> . 
One of the genes that encodes a <START:ggp> CBF alpha subunit <END> is <START:ggp> AML1 <END> , also called <START:ggp> Cbf alpha 2 <END> . 
This locus is rearranged by chromosomal translocations in human myeloproliferative disorders and leukemias . 
An exogenously expressed <START:ggp> Cbf alpha 2-encoded subunit <END> ( <START:ggp> CBF alpha 2-451 <END> ) stimulated transcription from the <START:ggp> SL3 enhancer <END> in <START:ggp> P19 <END> and <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
Activity was mediated through the <START:ggp> core elements <END> . 
Three different isoforms of <START:ggp> CBF beta <END> were also tested for transcriptional activity on the <START:ggp> SL3 enhancer <END> . 
The longest form , <START:ggp> CBF beta-187 <END> , increased the transcriptional stimulation by <START:ggp> CBF alpha 2-451 <END> twofold in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , although it had no effect in <START:ana> P19 cells <END> . 
Transcriptional activation by <START:ggp> CBF beta <END> required binding to the <START:ggp> CBF alpha subunit <END> , as a form of <START:ggp> CBF beta <END> that lacked binding ability , <START:ggp> CBF beta-148 <END> , failed to increase activity . 
These results indicated that at least in certain cell types , the maximum activity of <START:ggp> CBF <END> required both subunits . 
They also provided support for the hypothesis that <START:ggp> CBF <END> is a factor in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> that is responsible for recognition of the <START:ggp> SL3 cores <END> . 
We also examined whether <START:ggp> CBF <END> could distinguish a 1-bp difference between the enhancer core of SL3 and the core of the nonleukemogenic virus , Akv . 
This difference strongly affects transcription in T cells and leukemogenicity of <START:ggp> SL3 <END> . 
However , no combination of <START:ggp> CBF alpha <END> and <START:ggp> CBF beta <END> subunits that we tested was able to distinguish the 1-bp difference in transcription assays . 
Thus , a complete understanding of how <START:ana> T cells <END> recognize the <START:ggp> SL3 core <END> remains to be elucidated . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin ( IL ) -10 <END> inhibits <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> ) activation in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> suppress <START:ggp> cytokine <END> synthesis by different mechanisms . 
Our previous studies in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> have demonstrated that <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -10 <END> inhibits lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated production of <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha <END> by blocking gene transcription . 
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) , we now show that , in monocytes stimulated with LPS or <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibits nuclear stimulation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> ) , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> involved in the expression of <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokine genes <END> . Several other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> including NF- <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> , <START:ggp> GR <END> , <START:ggp> CREB <END> , <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> Sp-1 <END> are not affected by <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> . 
This selective inhibition by <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> activation occurs rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner and correlates well with <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> 's <START:ggp> cytokine <END> synthesis inhibitory activity in terms of both kinetics and dose responsiveness . 
Furthermore , compounds such as tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate that are known to selectively inhibit <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> activation block cytokine gene transcription in <START:ana> LPS-stimulated monocytes <END> . 
Taken together , these results suggest that inhibition of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> activation may be an important mechanism for <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> suppression of cytokine gene transcription in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , another <START:ggp> cytokine <END> that inhibits <START:ana> cytokine mRNA <END> accumulation in <START:ana> monocytes <END> , shows little inhibitory effect on LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> activation . 
Further examination reveals that , unlike <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> enhances <START:ana> mRNA <END> degradation and does not suppress cytokine gene transcription . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> inhibit <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production by different mechanisms . 
<START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> activates <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by targeting the <START:ggp> inhibitory molecule I kappa B alpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> , an <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus membrane protein <END> expressed during latent infection , has oncogenic properties , as judged from its ability to transform B <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> rodent fibroblasts <END> . 
<START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> induces the expression of <START:ggp> bcl2 <END> , an <START:ggp> oncogene <END> which protects cells from apoptosis , as well as of genes encoding other proteins involved in cell regulation and growth control . 
The mechanisms by which <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> upregulates these proteins is unknown , but it is plausible that <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> modifies signal transduction pathways that result in the activation of one or more <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that ultimately regulate transcription of <START:ggp> oncogenic genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> controlling the expression of <START:ggp> genes <END> involved in cell activation and growth control , has been shown to be activated by <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> . 
The mechanism ( s ) regulating this activation remains unknown . 
Our data indicate that increased <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA binding and functional activity are present in <START:ana> B-lymphoid cells <END> stably or transiently expressing <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> is selectively modified in <START:ana> LMP-1-expressing B cells <END> . 
A phosphorylated form of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and increased protein turnover-degradation correlate with increased <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> nuclear translocation . 
This results in increased transcription of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-dependent-genes <END> , including those encoding <START:ggp> p105 <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> MAD3 <END> ) . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> activates <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> by targeting <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
Identification of the pathways activated by <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> to result in posttranslational modifications of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> will aid in determining the role of this virus-host cell protein interaction in Epstein-Barr virus-mediated oncogenesis . 
Identification of <START:ggp> human TR2 orphan receptor response element <END> in the <START:ggp> transcriptional initiation site <END> of the <START:ggp> simian virus 40 major late promoter <END> [ published erratum appears in J Biol Chem 1995 Nov 3 ; 270 ( 44 ) : 26721 ] 
A <START:ggp> DNA response element <END> ( <START:ggp> TR2RE-SV40 <END> ) for the <START:ggp> TR2 orphan receptor <END> , a member of the <START:ggp> steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily <END> , has been identified in the <START:ggp> simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) +55 region <END> ( <START:ggp> nucleotide numbers 368-389 <END> , 5'-GTTAAGGTTCGTAGGTCATGGA-3 ' ) . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay , using in vitro translated <START:ggp> TR2 orphan receptor <END> with a molecular mass of <START:ggp> 67 kilodaltons <END> , showed a specific binding with high affinity ( dissociation constant = 9 nM ) for this DNA sequence . 
DNA-swap experiments using <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase <END> assay demonstrated that androgen can suppress the transcriptional activities of <START:ggp> SV40 early promoter <END> via the interaction between this <START:ggp> TR2RE-SV40 <END> and the <START:ggp> chimeric receptor AR/TR2/AR <END> with the <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> of the <START:ggp> TR2 orphan receptor <END> flanked by the <START:ggp> N-terminal and androgen-binding domains <END> of the <START:ggp> androgen receptor <END> . 
In addition , this <START:ggp> TR2RE-SV40 <END> can function as a repressor to suppress the transcriptional activities of both <START:ggp> SV40 early and late promoters <END> . 
Together , these data suggest the <START:ggp> TR2RE-SV40 <END> may represent the first identified natural <START:ggp> DNA response element <END> for the <START:ggp> TR2 orphan receptor <END> that may function as a repressor for the SV40 gene expression . 
Detection of the <START:ana> chromosome 16 CBF beta-MYH11 fusion transcript <END> in myelomonocytic leukemias . 
Karyotypic detection of chromosomal 16 abnormalities classically associated with AML M4Eo can be difficult . 
Characterization of the two genes involved in the inv ( 16 ) ( p13q22 ) , <START:ggp> CBF beta <END> and <START:ggp> MYH11 <END> , has allowed the detection of <START:ana> fusion transcripts <END> by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . 
We have analyzed <START:ana> CBF beta-MYH11 fusion transcripts <END> by RT-PCR in myelomonocytic leukemias , with or without eosinophilia , to determine whether their presence correlates with morphology . 
Fifty-three cases ( 11 AML M4Eo ; 1 AML M4 with <START:ana> atypical abnormal eosinophils <END> ( AML M4 `` Eo '' ) ; 29 AML M4 ; 8 AML M5 ; 3 CMML ; and 1 AML M2 with eosinophilia ) were analyzed . 
All 11 typical AML M4Eo were <START:ggp> CBF beta <END> <START:ggp> -MYH11 <END> positive . 
The single case of AML M4 with distinctive eosinophil abnormalities was negative by karyotype , RT-PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . 
Three of 29 ( 10 % ) AML M4 without <START:ana> abnormal eosinophils <END> were <START:ggp> CBF beta <END> <START:ggp> -MYH11 <END> positive , 1 of which did not show any apparent <START:ggp> chromosome 16 <END> abnormalities by classical metaphase analysis ( 2 not tested ) . 
Both cases tested also showed <START:ggp> MYH11 <END> genomic rearrangement . 
None of the other leukemias were RT-PCR positive . 
Follow-up of three patient showed residual positivity in apparent complete remission . 
These data show that <START:ana> CBF beta-MYH11 fusion transcripts <END> occur not only in the vast majority of typical AML M4Eo , but also in approximately 10 % of AML M4 without eosinophilic abnormalities , a much higher incidence than the sporadic reports of <START:ggp> chromosome 16 <END> abnormalities in AML M4 would suggest . 
Taken together with the detection of <START:ggp> CBF beta <END> - <START:ana> MYH11 transcripts <END> in the absence of apparent <START:ggp> chromosome 16 <END> abnormalities by classical banding techniques , these data show that additional screening by either RT-PCR or FISH should be performed in all AML M4 , regardless of morphologic features , to allow accurate evaluation of the prognostic importance of this <START:ana> fusion transcript <END> . 
<START:ggp> HIV-1 Tat <END> potentiates <START:ggp> TNF <END> -induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation and cytotoxicity by altering the cellular redox state . 
This study demonstrates that <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) Tat protein <END> amplifies the activity of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) , a cytokine that stimulates HIV-1 replication through activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
In <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> stably transfected with the <START:ggp> HIV-1 tat gene <END> ( <START:ana> HeLa-tat cells <END> ) , expression of the <START:ggp> Tat protein <END> enhanced both <START:ggp> TNF <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> TNF <END> -mediated cytotoxicity . 
A similar potentiation of <START:ggp> TNF <END> effects was observed in Jurkat T cells and <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> treated with soluble <START:ggp> Tat protein <END> . 
<START:ggp> TNF <END> -mediated activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and cytotoxicity involves the intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates . 
Therefore , <START:ggp> Tat <END> -mediated effects on the cellular redox state were analyzed . 
In both <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> <START:ggp> HIV-1 Tat <END> suppressed the expression of <START:ggp> Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase <END> ( <START:ggp> Mn-SOD <END> ) , a <START:ggp> mitochondrial enzyme <END> that is part of the cellular defense system against oxidative stress . 
Thus , <START:ggp> Mn-SOD <END> RNA protein levels and activity were markedly reduced in the presence of <START:ggp> Tat <END> . 
Decreased <START:ggp> Mn-SOD <END> expression was associated with decreased levels of glutathione and a lower ratio of reduced : oxidized glutathione . 
A truncated <START:ggp> Tat protein <END> ( <START:ggp> Tat1-72 <END> ) , known to transactivate the <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) , no longer affected <START:ggp> Mn-SOD <END> expression , the cellular redox state or <START:ggp> TNF <END> -mediated cytotoxicity . 
Thus , our experiments demonstrate that the <START:ggp> C-terminal region <END> of <START:ggp> HIV-1 Tat <END> is required to suppress <START:ggp> Mn-SOD <END> expression and to induce pro-oxidative conditions reflected by a drop in reduced glutathione ( <START:ggp> GSH <END> ) and the GSH : oxidized GSH ( GSSG ) ratio . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
The use of glucocorticoids in acute lymphoblastic leukemia of childhood . 
Molecular , cellular , and clinical considerations . 
Glucocorticoids have been included in almost all treatment regimens for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia for decades . 
However , optimal agents , doses , and/or schedules have yet to be defined despite extensive clinical application . 
New data on the pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , and molecular mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids have suggested alternative approaches in ALL . 
These suggest that prolonged , i.e. 28 day , glucocorticoid therapy may be unnecessary as exposure to glucocorticoid induces down-regulation of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> . 
Dexamethasone may be superior to prednisone in conventional equi-effective doses . 
Blast sensitivity to glucocorticoids correlates closely with sensitivity to other , putatively non-cross-resisting agents and with outcome after multi-agent therapy , suggesting overlapping mechanisms of action , and focusing attention on the determinants of the threshold for apoptosis . 
Increasing success in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia has led to increasing awareness of avascular necrosis of bone as a potentially disabling sequela of glucocorticoid therapy , especially in adolescent and young adult patients . 
<START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein 2 <END> transactivation of the <START:ggp> latent membrane protein 1 promoter <END> is mediated by <START:ggp> J kappa <END> and <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP-1 ) oncogene <END> is regulated by the <START:ggp> EBV nuclear protein 2 ( EBNA-2 ) transactivator <END> . 
<START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> is known to interact with the <START:ggp> cellular DNA-binding protein <END> <START:ggp> J kappa <END> and is recruited to <START:ggp> promoters <END> containing the GTGGGAA <START:ggp> J kappa recognition sequence <END> . 
The <START:ggp> minimal EBNA-2-responsive LMP-1 promoter <END> includes one <START:ggp> J kappa-binding site <END> , and we now show that mutation of that site , such that <START:ggp> J kappa <END> can not bind , reduces <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> responsiveness by 60 % . 
To identify other factors which interact with the <START:ggp> LMP-1 EBNA-2 response element <END> ( <START:ggp> E2RE <END> ) , a <START:ggp> -236/-145 minimal E2RE <END> was used as a probe in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay . 
The previously characterized factors <START:ggp> J kappa <END> , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , and <START:ggp> AML1 <END> bind to the <START:ggp> LMP-1 E2RE <END> , along with six other unidentified factors ( <START:ggp> LBF2 <END> to <START:ggp> LBF7 <END> ) . 
Binding sites were mapped for each factor . 
<START:ggp> LBF4 <END> is B- and T-cell specific and recognizes the <START:ggp> PU.1 GGAA core sequence <END> as shown by methylation interference . 
<START:ggp> LBF4 <END> has a molecular mass of 105 kDa and is probably unrelated to <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> LBF2 <END> was found only in <START:ana> epithelial cell lines <END> , whereas <START:ggp> LBF3 <END> , <START:ggp> LBF5 <END> , <START:ggp> LBF6 <END> , and <START:ggp> LBF7 <END> were not cell type specific . 
Mutations of the <START:ggp> AML1- or LBF4-binding sites <END> had no effect on <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> transactivation , whereas mutation of the <START:ggp> PU.1-binding site <END> completely eliminated <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> responses . 
A <START:ggp> gst-EBNA-2 fusion protein <END> specifically depleted <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> from nuclear extracts and bound in vitro translated <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , providing biochemical evidence for a direct <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> <START:ggp> -PU.1 <END> interaction . 
Thus , <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> transactivation of the <START:ggp> LMP-1 promoter <END> is dependent on interaction with at least two distinct sequence-specific <START:ggp> DNA-binding proteins <END> , <START:ggp> J kappa <END> and <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> LBF3 <END> , <START:ggp> LBF5 <END> , <START:ggp> LBF6 <END> , or <START:ggp> LBF7 <END> may also be involved , since their binding sites also contribute to <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> responsiveness . 
<START:ggp> Lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor <END> : predictor of sertraline response in adolescent major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . 
Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) in adolescents demonstrates resistance to tricyclic antidepressants and absence of hypercortisolemia . 
The efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SRIs ) is uncertain , and response predictors are unavailable . 
Abnormal fast feedback and negative feedback of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis implicates a dampened <START:ggp> limbic-hippocampal glucocorticoid type II receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GCII <END> ) . 
We hypothesized that <START:ggp> lymphocyte GCII <END> is altered in adolescent MDD and could serve as a marker for response to SRIs . 
In an open-label study , adolescents ( n = 20 ) meeting DSM-III-R criteria for MDD showed baseline <START:ggp> lymphocyte GCII sites <END> per cell ( sites/cell ) values of 793 +/- 106 versus 2 , 563 +/- 499 ( +/- SEM ) for matched controls ( n = 18 ) ( t = 3.5 ; df = 36 ; p < .001 ) . 
<START:ggp> GCII <END> was bimodally distributed , with SRI responders differing from nonresponders ( t = 3.9 ; df = 14 ; p < .001 ) . 
<START:ggp> GCII <END> accurately classified 90 percent of sertraline responders and 80 percent of nonresponders . 
Only SRI responders showed <START:ggp> GCII <END> sites/cell upregulated after 6 weeks of treatment ( t = 2.1 , df = 10 ; p < .05 ) . 
The role of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> in <START:ggp> cyclosporin A-sensitive tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene <END> transcription . 
The <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF alpha ) gene <END> is an immediate early gene in activated <START:ana> T cells <END> , in that it is rapidly induced without a requirement for protein synthesis . 
Maximal induction of <START:ana> TNF alpha mRNA <END> can be induced by treatment of <START:ana> T cells <END> with calcium ionophores alone , via a <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> -dependent process that is blocked by cyclosporin A . 
We have previously identified a <START:ggp> promoter element <END> , <START:ggp> kappa 3 <END> , that is required for calcium-stimulated , cyclosporin A-sensitive induction of the <START:ggp> TNF alpha gene <END> in activated <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Here , we demonstrate that the <START:ggp> kappa 3 binding factor <END> contains <START:ggp> NFATp <END> , a <START:ggp> cyclosporin-sensitive DNA-binding protein <END> required for <START:ggp> interleukin-2 gene <END> transcription . 
<START:ggp> NFATp <END> binds to two sites within the <START:ggp> kappa 3 element <END> , and occupancy of both sites is required for <START:ggp> TNF <END> alpha gene induction . 
Thus , although the <START:ggp> kappa 3 element <END> has little sequence similarity to other <START:ggp> NFATp-binding sites <END> , it appears to function as a <START:ggp> cyclosporin-sensitive promoter element <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> by virtue of its ability to bind <START:ggp> NFATp <END> . 
The involvement of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> in transcriptional activation of both the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> and <START:ggp> TNF alpha genes <END> suggests that this factor plays an important role in the coordinate induction of multiple <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> , starting at the earliest stages of T cell activation . 
Regulation and specificity of <START:ggp> MNDA <END> expression in <START:ana> monocytes <END> , <START:ana> macrophages <END> , and <START:ana> leukemia/B lymphoma cell lines <END> . 
The expression of the <START:ggp> human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen <END> ( <START:ggp> MNDA <END> ) was observed specifically in cells of the granulocyte-macrophage lineage in our earlier reports . 
The specificity of <START:ggp> MNDA <END> expression for cells in the granulocyte-macrophage lineage was reexamined in <START:ana> cell lines <END> established from patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia . 
Cell lines that expressed <START:ggp> MNDA <END> exhibited myeloid cell features and granulocyte or monocyte differentiation could be induced in vitro , while cell lines exhibiting properties of very early stage cells or <START:ana> multipotential cells <END> did not express <START:ggp> MNDA <END> . 
Cells originating from cases of Burkitt 's lymphoma were negative . 
By contrast , three <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> ( immortalized in vitro with Epstein-Barr virus ) were weakly positive and <START:ggp> MNDA <END> was up-regulated by <START:ggp> interferon-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> ) treatment . 
As we reported previously , <START:ana> MNDA mRNA <END> level in adherent <START:ana> monocytes <END> is elevated by <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> ; in this study , we further assessed <START:ggp> MNDA <END> expression in in vitro monocyte-derived <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
Three additional agents ( endotoxin , <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> , and phorbol ester ) and other conditions that affect function , <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production , differentiation , and/or growth of <START:ana> monocytes <END> were examined for their ability to alter <START:ggp> MNDA <END> expression . 
The results varied with the agent , cell type , and stage of differentiation . 
Changes in <START:ggp> MNDA <END> expression occurred slowly ( hours to days ) , suggesting that <START:ggp> MNDA <END> could mediate changes realized over a long period . 
The results also reveal a discordance in certain <START:ana> MNDA positive cells <END> between steady-state levels or changes in levels of protein and <START:ana> mRNA <END> indicating that the regulation of <START:ggp> MNDA <END> expression occurs at more than one point . 
Changes in <START:ggp> MNDA <END> expression are consistent with a role in opposing macrophage differentiation and activation of <START:ana> monocytes <END> <START:ana> /macrophages <END> . 
DNA-binding studies of the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> ) : evidence for complex formation by <START:ggp> latent membrane protein gene promoter-binding proteins <END> in <START:ana> EBNA-2-positive cell lines <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) nuclear antigen 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> ) protein is essential for the immortalization of <START:ana> human primary B cells <END> by EBV . 
<START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> trans-activates <START:ggp> cellular and viral genes <END> like <START:ggp> CD23 <END> , <START:ggp> c-fgr <END> , <START:ggp> latent membrane protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> terminal protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> TP1 <END> ) . 
Trans-activation of the <START:ggp> TP1 promoter <END> and of the <START:ggp> BamHI C promoter <END> has already been investigated in detail and appears to be mediated via protein-protein interactions and not by direct binding of <START:ggp> EBNA-2 type A <END> ( of EBV type 1 ) to the DNA . 
<START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> is able to trans-activate the expression of the <START:ggp> LMP gene <END> in several cell lines . 
Various reports have delineated the <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> of the <START:ggp> LMP promoter <END> through which <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> mediates trans-activation . 
To determine whether <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> also trans-activates the <START:ggp> LMP promoter <END> by protein-protein interactions , we performed a series of gel retardation assays and competition experiments with <START:ggp> LMP promoter fragments <END> of different sizes . 
We determined that the <START:ggp> protein-binding region <END> on the <START:ggp> LMP promoter <END> was within a <START:ggp> 42 bp fragment <END> encompassing nucleotides -135 to -176 relative to the <START:ggp> LMP transcriptional start site <END> . 
None of the DNA fragments investigated indicated interaction of <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> with the DNA via protein-protein interactions . 
No significant differences between <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> -positive and <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> -negative nuclear extracts could be seen in the gel retardation assay under conditions that clearly showed binding of <START:ggp> EBNA-2A <END> to the <START:ggp> TP1 promoter <END> . 
However , analysis of sucrose gradient fractions in the gel retardation assay provided evidence that the <START:ggp> LMP promoter-binding proteins <END> form a complex of higher M ( r ) in <START:ana> EBNA-2-positive cell <END> extracts . 
These complexes were destroyed by detergent . 
We deduce from these results that <START:ana> EBNA-2-positive cells <END> might indeed contain <START:ggp> specific complexes <END> bound to the <START:ggp> LMP promoter <END> which are , however , too labile to be detected in a standard gel retardation assay . 
Simultaneous activation of <START:ggp> Ig <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> synthesis and reduction of surface <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> expression by <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> . 
Terminal differentiation of <START:ana> B cells <END> to <START:ana> plasma cells <END> in vivo is characterized by secretion of <START:ggp> Ig <END> and extinction of <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> expression on the cell surface . 
We show that <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> signaling leads to marked increases in the synthesis and secretion of <START:ggp> Ig <END> in <START:ana> clonal human B cell lines <END> and newly <START:ana> isolated polyclonal B lymphocytes <END> in vitro . 
The <START:ana> IL-6-induced cells <END> resemble <START:ana> plasma cells <END> in ultrastructure and in reduced expression of <START:ggp> surface MHC class II <END> . 
Enhanced <START:ggp> Ig <END> synthesis is a result of coordinated transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> Ig genes <END> without promoter or isotype specificity , and differential accumulation of the <START:ana> mRNA <END> encoding the secreted form of <START:ggp> Ig heavy chain <END> . 
It is saturable and subject to negative control when <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> stimulation is prolonged . 
Coordinate with temporal changes in <START:ggp> Ig <END> synthesis , the DNA-binding activity and the synthesis of the <START:ggp> B cell-enriched transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> are regulated . 
Thus , differentiation of <START:ana> B cells <END> with <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> in vitro recapitulates the hallmarks of terminal B differentiation in vivo ; <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> may have a role in this process . 
<START:ggp> T-cell functional regions <END> of the <START:ggp> human IL-3 proximal promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) gene <END> is expressed almost exclusively in activated <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Its expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level . 
We have previously shown that treatment of <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> with <START:ggp> phytohemaglutinin <END> ( <START:ggp> PHA <END> ) and the phorbol ester , PMA , activated transcription initiation from the <START:ggp> IL-3 gene <END> . 
To define the regions of the gene required for transcription activation , we generated a series of reporter constructs containing different regions of the <START:ggp> IL-3 gene 5 ' and 3 ' flanking sequences <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> positive and negative regulatory elements <END> were identified in the <START:ggp> proximal 5 ' flanking region <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-3 gene <END> . 
The <START:ggp> promoter region <END> between <START:ggp> -173 and -60 <END> contained the strongest <START:ggp> activating elements <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> could bind to this positive activator region of the promoter . 
We also examined the function of the <START:ggp> IL-3 CK-1/CK-2 elements <END> that are present in many <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> and found that they acted as a repressor of basal level expression when cloned upstream of a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> but were also inducible by PMA <START:ggp> /PHA <END> . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> Runt domain-encoding PEBP2 alpha genes <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> during thymic development . 
The <START:ggp> PEBP2 alpha A and PEBP2 alpha B genes <END> encode the <START:ggp> DNA-binding subunit <END> of a <START:ggp> murine transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> PEBP2 <END> , which is implicated as a <START:ggp> T-cell-specific transcriptional regulator <END> . 
These two related genes share the evolutionarily conserved region encoding the <START:ggp> Runt domain <END> . 
<START:ggp> PEBP2 alpha B <END> is the <START:ggp> murine counterpart <END> of <START:ggp> human AML1 <END> , which is located at the breakpoints of the <START:ggp> 8 ; 21 and 3 ; 21 chromosome translocations <END> associated with acute myeloid leukemia . 
Northern ( RNA ) blots of various adult mouse tissues revealed that the levels of expression of both genes were most prominent in the thymus . 
Furthermore , transcripts of <START:ggp> PEBP2 alpha A <END> and <START:ggp> mouse AML1/PEBP2 alpha B <END> were detected in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> in the thymuses from day 16 embryos and newborns , as well as 4-week-old adult mice , by in situ hybridization . 
The expression of the genes persisted in peripheral lymph nodes of adult mice . 
The transcripts were detected in all the <START:ana> CD4- CD8- , CD4+ CD8+ , CD4+ CD8- , and CD4- CD8+ cell populations <END> . 
The results indicated that both genes are expressed in <START:ana> T cells <END> throughout their development , supporting the notion that <START:ggp> PEBP2 <END> is a <START:ggp> T-cell-specific transcription factor <END> . 
Transcripts of <START:ggp> mouse AML1/PEBP2 alpha B <END> were also detected in day 12 fetal hematopoietic liver and in the <START:ana> bone marrow cells <END> of newborn mice . 
The implication of mouse <START:ggp> AML1/PEBP2 alpha B <END> expression in <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> other than those of <START:ana> T-cell lineage <END> is discussed in relation to myeloid leukemogenesis . 
Effects of glucocorticoids on transcription factor activation in <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
Glucocorticoids have an inhibitory effect on inflammatory and immune responses , and this may be through the modulation of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> binding to DNA . 
The interaction of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) , <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> ) , and <START:ggp> cAMP-responsive element binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> CREB <END> ) with DNA and <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) was analyzed in <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> by gel mobility shift assays . 
TNF-alpha , IL-1 beta and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) treatment increased <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and NF kappa B DNA binding by up to 200 % but decreased <START:ggp> CREB <END> binding ( 38 % ) over a 60-min time course . 
Dexamethasone produced a rapid and sustained increase in <START:ggp> glucocorticoid response element <END> binding and a concomitant 40-50 % decrease in AP-1 , NF kappa B , and CREB DNA binding that was blocked by combined dexamethasone and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> or PMA treatment . 
These latter effects were due to increases in the nuclear localization of <START:ggp> GR <END> , not to reduced amounts of the other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
This suggests that in these cells <START:ggp> GR <END> within the nucleus interacts with <START:ggp> cytokine-stimulated transcription factors <END> by the process of cross coupling . 
This may be an important molecular site of steroid action . 
Differential induction of the <START:ggp> NF-AT complex <END> during restimulation and the induction of T-cell anergy . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> human CD4+ T-cell clones <END> through the <START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TcR <END> ) by high doses of specific peptide results in the induction of a long-lived state of nonresponsiveness that has been called anergy . 
During the induction of anergy , <START:ana> T cells <END> are phenotypically similar to cells responding to an immunogenic stimulus . 
The amount of <START:ggp> TcR <END> at the cell surface is downmodulated , whereas the <START:ggp> CD2 and CD25 receptors <END> are increased . 
When restimulated , however , <START:ana> anergic T cells <END> fail to up-regulate transcription of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> and in consequence do not produce <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
In this study , we have compared the ability of various <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> to bind to their appropriate site on DNA . 
Factors were isolated from the nuclei of <START:ana> T cells <END> that were in the induction phase of anergy or were undergoing activation . 
The pattern of binding activity in restimulated <START:ana> T cells <END> is consistent with the pattern that has previously been shown to regulate T-cell-specific expression of the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and the beta chain of the <START:ggp> TcR genes <END> . 
The measured binding to a <START:ggp> TCF-1 site <END> is the same in the nuclei of <START:ana> resting , activated , and anergized cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> inducible factors <END> <START:ggp> NK-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> beta E2 <END> , <START:ggp> CD28RC <END> , and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> are not expressed in <START:ana> resting cells <END> and are twofold lower in anergized as compared with activated cells . 
In contrast , <START:ana> anergic T cells <END> express approximately eightfold lower amounts of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , a member of the class of <START:ggp> inducible factors <END> that regulates <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> transcription . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
The number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> peripheral human lymphocytes <END> is elevated by a zinc containing trace element preparation . 
A trace element preparation ( Beres Drops Plus , BDP ) elevates the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> gcR <END> ) in <START:ana> peripheral lymphocytes <END> isolated both from healthy blood donors and rheumatoid arthritis patients . 
This enhancement by BDP was found either for constitutive expression of <START:ggp> gcRs <END> or in experiments when the <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> were stimulated by <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -6 <END> . 
There was no significant effect of BDP on <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> and <START:ggp> tumour necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> ) -induced changes of <START:ggp> gcRs <END> . 
The effect of BDP was greatly dependent on the presence of Zn++ ions in the preparation , since the augmenting effect was abolished if BDP did not contain zinc . 
The DNA and <START:ggp> steroid binding domains <END> of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> are not altered in <START:ana> mononuclear cells <END> of treated CLL patients . 
The aim of this study was to investigate whether mutations in the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> could account for the increasing unresponsiveness of patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia ( CLL ) to combination chemotherapy . 
The receptor was tested immunocytochemically , in steroid binding assays , and by a mutation screening ( denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ) of the <START:ggp> receptor-cDNA <END> . 
The receptor concentration , as measured by staining and steroid binding test , varied considerably but showed no clear correlation to clinical response . 
Using a highly sensitive mutation screening assay of the <START:ggp> DNA- and the steroid-binding region <END> , none of the treated patients revealed any mutation , suggesting that the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> in the CLL patients tested is not altered in these domains . 
In one individual who had not been treated before analysis a silent mutation was found in one receptor allele . 
The results suggest that mechanisms other than altered ligand or DNA binding of the receptor may be responsible for the lack of response to chemotherapy . 
This conclusion is discussed in relation to the mechanism of corticoid resistance in <START:ana> mouse and human lymphoma cells <END> in culture . 
An <START:ggp> AP1 binding site <END> upstream of the <START:ggp> kappa immunoglobulin intron enhancer <END> binds <START:ggp> inducible factors <END> and contributes to expression . 
Expression of the kappa immunoglobulin light chain gene requires developmental- and tissue-specific regulation by <START:ggp> trans-acting factors <END> which interact with two distinct <START:ggp> enhancer elements <END> . 
A new protein-DNA interaction has been identified upstream of the <START:ggp> intron enhancer <END> , within the <START:ggp> matrix-associated region <END> of the <START:ggp> J-C intron <END> . 
The binding activity is greatly inducible in <START:ana> pre-B cells <END> by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> but specific complexes are found at all stages of B cell development tested . 
The <START:ggp> footprinted binding site <END> is homologous to the <START:ggp> consensus AP1 motif <END> . 
The protein components of this complex are specifically competed by an <START:ggp> AP1 consensus motif <END> and were shown by supershift to include <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , suggesting that this <START:ggp> binding site <END> is an <START:ggp> AP1 motif <END> and that the <START:ggp> Jun and Fos families <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> play a role in the regulation of the <START:ggp> kappa light chain gene <END> . 
Mutation of the <START:ggp> AP1 motif <END> in the context of the <START:ggp> intron enhancer <END> was shown to decrease enhancer-mediated activation of the promoter in both <START:ana> pre-B cells <END> induced with LPS and constitutive expression in <START:ana> mature B cells <END> . 
Distinct <START:ggp> DNase-I hypersensitive sites <END> are associated with <START:ggp> TAL-1 <END> transcription in <START:ana> erythroid and T-cell lines <END> . 
The <START:ggp> tal-1 gene <END> , frequently activated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) , is expressed in the <START:ana> erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mast cell lineages <END> during normal hematopoiesis . 
To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that control <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> expression , we investigated <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> chromatin structure in <START:ana> erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines <END> and in <START:ana> T-cell lines <END> either with or without <START:ggp> tal-1 rearrangements <END> . 
Tal-1 transcription was shown to be monoallelic in <START:ana> Jurkat <END> , a T-cell line that expresses <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> in the absence of apparent genomic alteration of the locus . 
Methylation studies indicated that the <START:ggp> tal-15 ' GC-rich region <END> behaves like a <START:ggp> CpG island <END> , hypomethylated in <START:ana> normal cells <END> , and methylated de novo on <START:ggp> transcriptionally inactive alleles <END> in <START:ana> established cell lines <END> . 
Five major <START:ggp> DNase-I hypersensitive sites <END> ( <START:ggp> HS <END> ) were mapped in the <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> locus . 
<START:ggp> HS I , IV , and V <END> were exclusively observed in the <START:ana> erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines <END> that express <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> from the <START:ggp> promoters 1a and 1b <END> . 
<START:ggp> HS II <END> was weak in <START:ana> hematopoietic cell lines <END> , absent in <START:ana> Hela <END> , and greatly enhanced in <START:ana> Jurkat <END> , suggesting that this region might be implicated in the cis-activation of <START:ggp> tal-1 promoter 1b <END> in this cell line . 
<START:ggp> HS III <END> was weak in <START:ana> HEL <END> and <START:ana> Jurkat <END> , and greatly enhanced in <START:ana> DU528 <END> , a <START:ana> T-cell line <END> that bears <START:ggp> a t ( 1 ; 14 ) <END> and initiates <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> transcription within <START:ggp> exon 4 <END> . 
These results suggest that distinct <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> are associated with the use of the different <START:ggp> tal-1 promoters <END> . 
<START:ggp> Erythropoietin <END> -dependent induction of <START:ggp> hemoglobin <END> synthesis in a <START:ana> cytokine-dependent cell line <END> <START:ana> M-TAT <END> . 
<START:ana> M-TAT <END> is a <START:ana> cytokine-dependent cell line <END> with the potential to differentiate along the <START:ana> erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages <END> . 
We cultured <START:ana> M-TAT cells <END> long term ( > 1 year ) in the continuous presence of <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> EPO <END> ) , <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) , or <START:ggp> stem cell factor <END> ( <START:ggp> SCF <END> ) . 
These long term cultures are referred to as <START:ana> M-TAT/EPO , M-TAT/GM-CSF , and M-TAT/SCF cells <END> , respectively . 
<START:ggp> Hemoglobin <END> concentration and <START:ggp> gamma-globin <END> and <START:ana> erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA <END> levels were significantly higher in <START:ana> M-TAT/EPO cells <END> than in <START:ana> M-TAT/GM-CSF cells <END> . 
When the supplemented <START:ggp> cytokine <END> was switched from <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> to <START:ggp> EPO <END> , <START:ggp> hemoglobin <END> synthesis in <START:ana> M-TAT/GM-CSF cells <END> increased rapidly ( within 5 h ) , and the level of <START:ana> GATA-1 mRNA <END> increased . 
In contrast , the addition of <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> to the <START:ana> M-TAT/EPO cell culture <END> decreased the amount of hemoglobin , even in the presence of <START:ggp> EPO <END> , indicating that the <START:ggp> EPO <END> signal for erythroid differentiation is suppressed by <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> . 
Thus , erythroid development of <START:ana> M-TAT cells <END> is promoted by <START:ggp> EPO <END> and suppressed by <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> . 
These results support the hypothesis that <START:ggp> EPO <END> actively influences the programming of gene expression required for <START:ana> erythroid progenitor cell <END> differentiation . 
The role of <START:ggp> cellular transcription factor E2F <END> in the regulation of <START:ana> cdc2 mRNA <END> expression and cell cycle control of human <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> . 
<START:ana> cdc2 mRNA transcripts <END> were detected in <START:ana> immature bone marrow cells <END> and became undetectable along with differentiation . 
<START:ana> Peripheral blood resting cells <END> did not express <START:ana> cdc2 mRNA <END> , but it was induced in <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> when the cells reentered the cell cycle in response to specific mitogens . 
In contrast , <START:ana> cdc2 mRNA <END> could not be induced in <START:ana> granulocytes <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> even after the culture with the appropriate stimulants . 
In order to investigate the mechanism of the regulation of <START:ana> cdc2 mRNA <END> expression in <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> , we isolated the <START:ggp> 5'-flanking sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> cdc2 gene <END> and found the putative E2F <START:ggp> binding site <END> at the position of <START:ggp> nucleotides -124 to -117 <END> . 
The binding of <START:ggp> E2F <END> at this region was detected by a gel-retardation assay and <START:ggp> DNaseI <END> footprinting in <START:ana> phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T-lymphocytes <END> , which was coincident with the expression of <START:ana> cdc2 mRNA <END> . 
<START:ggp> E2F <END> binding was not observed in both <START:ana> granulocytes <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Transient <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase <END> assay revealed that the region containing <START:ggp> E2F binding site <END> had a strong promoter activity , and introduction of the mutation at the <START:ggp> E2F binding site <END> resulted in a significant loss of the activity . 
<START:ana> E2F-1 and DP-1 mRNAs <END> were not detectable in <START:ana> granulocytes <END> , <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> resting T-lymphocytes <END> but were induced after the mitogenic stimulation of <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> . 
The induction of <START:ggp> E2F <END> activity preceded the appearance of <START:ana> cdc2 mRNA <END> , which is consistent with the role of <START:ggp> E2F <END> in the regulation of <START:ana> cdc2 mRNA expression <END> . 
These results suggest that <START:ana> cdc2 mRNA <END> expression is related to the cell cycling of <START:ana> normal human hematopoietic cells <END> and that <START:ggp> E2F <END> plays some roles in the regulation of its expression . 
Association of alterations in <START:ggp> NF-kappa B moieties <END> with HIV type 1 proviral latency in certain <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication is controlled by a complex array of <START:ggp> virally encoded and cellular proteins <END> . 
A wide spectrum of levels of HIV-1 expression have been demonstrated in various cells , both in cell culture and in vivo . 
Molecular mechanisms leading to restricted HIV-1 replication may differ between certain cell types . 
It is now demonstrated that HIV-1 proviral latency in the <START:ana> monocytic cell line U1 <END> , in which only extremely low levels of HIV-1 expression are detected in the baseline unstimulated state , is associated with alterations in nuclear <START:ggp> factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) moieties <END> demonstrated in these cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) and in situ UV cross-linking studies . 
A predominance of <START:ggp> p50 NF-kappa B moieties <END> and possibly <START:ggp> p50 homodimers <END> or closely related species , rather than the <START:ggp> p50-p56 heterodimer <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> that is the predominant <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> species in most <START:ana> T lymphocytic and monocytic cells <END> , is demonstrated in the nuclei of <START:ana> U1 cells <END> . 
This pattern of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-related moieties <END> differs from the <START:ana> latently infected T lymphocytic cell line ACH-2 <END> , and from the <START:ana> U937 monocytic line <END> , the <START:ana> parental cell line <END> of the <START:ana> U1 cellular clone <END> . 
As such , these data suggest that different proximal mechanisms may lead to restricted HIV-1 replication in various cell types . 
[ Regulation of transcription of the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 gene <END> in <START:ana> B-lymphocytes <END> ] 
Since most <START:ana> B cell clones <END> immortalized with EBV virus can be induced to produce <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> , a typical <START:ggp> T cell cytokine <END> , we studied the role of different elements of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> in such clones by transfection . 
It was found , in particular , that the element <START:ggp> TCEd <END> , which binds the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> , is very active in all three <START:ana> B clones <END> tested . 
This element has no activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> of the <START:ana> Jurkat line <END> . 
The <START:ggp> NFATd element <END> , which binds the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> and is very active in <START:ana> T cells <END> , is only weakly active in one <START:ana> B clone <END> and not at all in another . 
Different elements thus contribute to <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activity in different cells . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and <START:ggp> p105 <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> persistently infected with human immunodeficiency virus . 
The mechanisms regulating human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) persistence in human <START:ana> monocytes <END> <START:ana> /macrophages <END> are partially understood . 
Persistent HIV infection of <START:ana> U937 monocytic cells <END> results in <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
Whether virus-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation is a mechanism that favors continuous viral replication in <START:ana> macrophages <END> remains unknown . 
To further delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in HIV-infected <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> , we have focused on the regulation of the I kappa B molecules . 
First , we show that persistent HIV infection results in the activation of NF-kappa B not only in monocytic cells but also in <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
In HIV-infected cells , <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> protein levels are decreased secondary to enhanced protein degradation . 
This parallels the increased <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> synthesis secondary to increased <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> gene transcription , i.e. , increased RNA and transcriptional activity of its promoter-enhancer . 
Another protein with I kappa B function , <START:ggp> p105 <END> , is also modified in HIV-infected cells : <START:ggp> p105 <END> and <START:ggp> p50 <END> steady-state protein levels are increased as a result of increased synthesis and proteolytic processing of <START:ggp> p105 <END> . 
Transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> p105 <END> is also increased in <START:ana> infected cells <END> and is also mediated by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> through a specific <START:ggp> kappa B motif <END> . 
These results demonstrate the existence of a triple autoregulatory loop in <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> involving HIV , <START:ggp> p105 <END> and <START:ggp> p50 <END> , and <START:ggp> MAD3 <END> , with the end result of persistent NF-kappa B activation and viral persistence . 
Furthermore , persistent HIV infection of <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> provides a useful model with which to study concomitant modifications of different <START:ggp> I kappa B molecules <END> . 
Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of <START:ana> human leukemic cells <END> is caused by the repressive function of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
Induction of apoptosis in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , which may account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids in various diseases including leukemia , depends on the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
However , the events leading from the activated receptor to cell lysis are not understood . 
A prevailing hypothesis postulates induction of so-called ' <START:ggp> lysis genes <END> ' by the <START:ggp> activated receptor <END> . 
In this study , we show that an <START:ggp> activation-deficient glucocorticoid receptor mutant <END> is as effective as the <START:ggp> wild-type receptor <END> in repression of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity , inhibition of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> production , inhibition of <START:ggp> c-myc <END> expression and induction of apoptosis . 
Furthermore , we show that retinoic acid can also induce apoptosis in these cells through the <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor <END> , whose repressive functions but not target site specificity , are similar to those of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
Therefore , the primary effect of the receptor in glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis correlates with transcriptional repression rather than activation and could be mediated by interference with other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> required for cell survival . 
HIV type 1 <START:ggp> protease <END> activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> within <START:ana> T lymphoid cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is a <START:ggp> nuclear protein <END> of the <START:ggp> rel oncogene family <END> capable of enhancing transcription of <START:ggp> several cellular genes <END> , including <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and the <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor <END> , and <START:ggp> viral genes <END> transcribed from the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> . 
It has been reported that <START:ggp> HIV-1 protease <END> may cleave the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> precursor to its active form in vitro . 
In this study the effects of HIV protease on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> precursor activation were examined in Jurkat <START:ana> T cells <END> by introducing a <START:ggp> protease expression vector <END> into the cells . 
Increased <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity was observed and this increased activity was blocked by a specific inhibitor of the <START:ggp> viral protease <END> . 
Viral transcription , as measured using <START:ggp> LTR <END> <START:ggp> -CAT <END> assays , was only slightly enhanced in the <START:ana> HIV-protease expressing cells <END> , while secretion of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and expression of the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> receptor were not affected . 
The limited activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by <START:ggp> HIV protease <END> appears unlikely to have a significant effect on virus expression or T cell function . 
Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication by a <START:ggp> Tat-activated , transduced interferon gene <END> : targeted expression to <START:ana> human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected cells <END> . 
We have examined the feasibility of using <START:ggp> interferon <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN <END> ) gene transfer as a novel approach to anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) therapy in this study . 
To limit expression of a transduced <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) -IFNA2 <END> ( the new approved nomenclature for <START:ggp> IFN genes <END> is used throughout this article ) <START:ggp> hybrid gene <END> to the <START:ana> HIV-1-infected cells <END> , <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> was modified . 
Deletion of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B elements <END> of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> significantly inhibited <START:ggp> Tat <END> -mediated transactivation in <START:ana> T-cell lines <END> , as well as in a <START:ana> monocyte line <END> , <START:ana> U937 <END> . 
Replacement of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B elements <END> in the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> by a <START:ggp> DNA fragment <END> derived from the <START:ggp> 5'-flanking region <END> of <START:ggp> IFN-stimulated gene 15 <END> ( <START:ggp> ISG15 <END> ) , containing the <START:ggp> IFN-stimulated response element <END> , partially restored <START:ggp> Tat <END> -mediated activation of <START:ggp> LTR <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> as well as in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Insertion of this <START:ggp> chimeric promoter <END> ( <START:ggp> ISG15 LTR <END> ) upstream of the <START:ggp> human IFNA2 gene <END> directed high levels of <START:ggp> IFN <END> synthesis in <START:ana> Tat-expressing cells <END> , while this promoter was not responsive to <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> -mediated activation . 
<START:ggp> ISG15-LTR-IFN hybrid gene <END> inserted into the <START:ggp> retrovirus vector <END> was transduced into <START:ana> Jurkat <END> and <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
Selected <START:ana> transfected clones <END> produced low levels of <START:ggp> IFN A <END> ( <START:ggp> IFNA <END> ) constitutively , and their abilities to express <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor <END> upon stimulation with <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> and phorbol myristate acetate were retained . 
Enhancement of <START:ggp> IFNA <END> synthesis observed upon HIV-1 infection resulted in significant inhibition of HIV-1 replication for a period of at least 30 days . 
Virus isolated from <START:ana> IFNA-producing cells <END> was able to replicate in the <START:ana> U937 cells <END> but did not replicate efficiently in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> transduced with the <START:ggp> IFNA gene <END> . 
These results suggest that targeting <START:ggp> IFN <END> synthesis to <START:ana> HIV-1-infected cells <END> is an attainable goal and that autocrine <START:ggp> IFN <END> synthesis results in a long-lasting and permanent suppression of HIV-1 replication . 
Chromosomal localization of two <START:ggp> KOX zinc finger genes <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome bands <END> <START:ggp> 7q21-q22 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Human cDNAs <END> encoding <START:ggp> Kruppel-type zinc finger domains <END> , designated <START:ggp> KOX 1-32 <END> , have been cloned from <START:ggp> human T lymphocyte cell line libraries <END> . 
We report here the regional localizations by in situ hybridization of <START:ggp> KOX 18 <END> and <START:ggp> KOX 25 <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome bands 7q21q22 <END> . 
Pulse-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) analysis showed that these genes are physically located within a <START:ggp> DNA fragment <END> of <START:ggp> 250 kb <END> . 
The genes <START:ggp> KOX 4 <END> and <START:ggp> KOX 9 <END> , mapped on <START:ggp> chromosome 8q24 <END> , were found to be located within a <START:ggp> DNA fragment <END> of 450 kb . 
From the present and previous data , eighteen different <START:ggp> KOX genes <END> have been located at least two by two within nine <START:ggp> DNA fragments <END> of 200 to 580 kb . 
Influence of age on the production of <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> by <START:ana> influenza virus-exposed T cells <END> . 
This study investigated age-related T cell responses after in vitro exposure to influenza A virus . 
<START:ana> Mononuclear leukocytes <END> from young or elderly persons were sham-exposed or exposed to influenza virus for 1 , 24 , and 72 h . 
Immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometric analysis were then used to detect <START:ana> T cells <END> producing the <START:ggp> transcriptional regulating proteins <END> <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> . 
Fewer virus-exposed cells from elderly donors stained for <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> at each data point compared with cells from young donors . 
Flow cytometric analysis also showed that at 72 h of virus exposure fewer <START:ana> T cells <END> from the elderly produced <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) , suggesting a link between the magnitude of the <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> responses . 
Thus , failure of <START:ana> virus-exposed T cells <END> to produce <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> could contribute to the increase in illness due to influenza virus in the elderly . 
The regulation of HIV by retinoic acid correlates with cellular expression of the <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptors <END> . 
OBJECTIVES : To analyze the effect of retinoic acids ( RA ) on HIV-1 expression and correlate this effect with expression levels of <START:ggp> RA receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RARs <END> ) in <START:ana> T-lymphoid and monocytoid cell lines <END> . 
DESIGN AND METHODS : The effect of all-trans and 9-cis RA on HIV-1 production in <START:ana> T-lymphoid <END> ( <START:ana> H9 , CEM <END> ) and <START:ana> monocytoid ( U937 , THP-1 ) cell lines <END> was measured during acute and chronic infection . 
The expression levels of <START:ggp> human RAR alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> hRAR alpha , receptor <END> for all-trans RA ) and the <START:ggp> human retinoid-X receptor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> hRXR alpha receptor <END> for 9-cis RA ) were determined by Northern blot analysis . 
RESULTS : Both all-trans and 9-cis RA inhibited virus replication in <START:ana> HIV-1 IIIB-infected monocytoid cells <END> , in the presence and absence of the co-stimulatory agent phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) . 
The retinoids had weak or no stimulatory effects on HIV production by <START:ana> T-cell lines <END> . 
HIV production by <START:ana> PMA-stimulated T-cell lines <END> was inhibited by these retinoids . 
The 9-cis RA was generally more effective than all-trans RA in inhibiting HIV production and in combination generally more effective than the single agents alone . 
<START:ggp> Human RAR alpha <END> was expressed in <START:ana> H9 <END> , <START:ana> U937 <END> and <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> , but almost undetectable in <START:ana> CEM cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Human RXR alpha <END> was significantly expressed in <START:ana> U937 and THP-1 cells <END> , weakly expressed in <START:ana> H9 cells <END> and not detectable in <START:ana> CEM cells <END> . 
After stimulation by PMA , <START:ggp> RXR alpha <END> expression increased in <START:ana> H9 <END> and <START:ana> U937 cells <END> but not in <START:ana> CEM cells <END> . 
Human RAR alpha expression was unchanged in <START:ana> H9 <END> and <START:ana> CEM cells <END> , and elevated in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> , after PMA stimulation . 
CONCLUSION : The effect of RA on HIV-1 expression was cell-type-dependent and partially correlated with cellular expression of <START:ggp> RARs <END> . 
Endogenous or exogenously administered RA may have a significant role in HIV regulation . 
Functions of glutathione and glutathione disulfide in immunology and immunopathology . 
Even a moderate increase in the cellular cysteine supply elevates the intracellular glutathione ( GSH ) and glutathione disulfide ( GSSG ) levels and potentiates immunological functions of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> in vitro . 
At low GSSG levels , <START:ana> T cells <END> can not optimally activate the immunologically important <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> , whereas high GSSG levels inhibit the DNA binding activity of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> . 
The effects of GSSG are antagonized by reduced <START:ggp> thioredoxin <END> ( <START:ggp> TRX <END> ) . 
As the <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase <END> activities <START:ggp> p56lck <END> and <START:ggp> p59fyn <END> are activated in intact cells by hydrogen peroxide , they are likely targets for GSSG action . 
These <START:ggp> redox-regulated enzymes <END> trigger signal cascades for <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> activation and transduce signals from the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> , from <START:ggp> CD4 <END> and <START:ggp> CD8 molecules <END> , and from the <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor beta-chain <END> . 
The effector phase of <START:ana> cytotoxic T cell <END> responses and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -dependent functions are inhibited even by a partial depletion of the intracellular GSH pool . 
As signal transduction is facilitated by prooxidant conditions , we propose that the well-known immunological consequences of GSH depletion ultimately may be results of the accompanying GSSG deficiency . 
As HIV-infected patients and SIV-infected rhesus macaques have , on the average , significantly decreased plasma cyst ( e ) ine and intracellular GSH levels , we also hypothesize that AIDS may be the consequence of a GSSG deficiency as well . 
<START:ana> T cells <END> from renal cell carcinoma patients exhibit an abnormal pattern of kappa B-specific DNA-binding activity : a preliminary report . 
Recent data suggest that the poor induction of a T-cell response to human renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) may be related to alterations in signal transduction pathways . 
We report that <START:ana> T cells <END> from RCC patients have two alterations in kappa B motif-specific DNA-binding activity . 
The first alteration involves the constitutive expression of substantial kappa B-binding activity in nuclear extracts , which was observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay . 
The magnitude of kappa B activity in <START:ana> unstimulated patient T cells <END> was similar to that observed in <START:ana> T cells <END> from normal individuals that had been activated in vitro . 
On the basis of Western blotting experiments using <START:ggp> antibodies <END> to <START:ggp> kappa B/Rel family proteins <END> , the kappa B-binding activity constitutively expressed in <START:ana> T cells <END> from RCC patients is composed mostly of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 ( p50 ) subunit <END> . 
The second abnormality in kappa B-binding activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> from these patients is that <START:ggp> RelA <END> , a member of the <START:ggp> Rel homology family <END> which is part of the normal <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> , was not induced in the nucleus following activation . 
Western blotting analysis did not detect any <START:ggp> RelA <END> in nuclear extracts either before or after stimulation of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The altered kappa B-binding activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> from RCC patients may impair their capacity to respond normally to various stimuli . 
<START:ggp> Hemoglobin <END> switching in humans is accompanied by changes in the ratio of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> SP1 <END> . 
BACKGROUND : Understanding the mechanism of developmental regulation of <START:ggp> hemoglobin <END> switching has scientific as well as clinical relevance because of the influence of fetal <START:ggp> hemoglobin <END> ( <START:ggp> HbF <END> ) production in adulthood on the clinical manifestation of thalassemia and sickle cell anemia . 
We have previously found that the normal developmental patterns of <START:ggp> globin gene <END> expression are recapitulated in an experimental system of <START:ana> primary cultures <END> that support differentiation of <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> . 
We further found that high activities of the <START:ggp> transcriptional activators <END> , <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> SP1 <END> , are associated with normal adult erythroid differentiation . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS : In the present work , we have studied , the activities of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> SP1 <END> during differentiation of cultured <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> derived from cord blood and from fetal livers , as well as from beta zero-thalassemia patients . 
RESULTS : The results showed high <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> binding activity and very low <START:ggp> SP1 <END> activity in the <START:ana> fetal liver cultures <END> . 
This pattern was in contrast to cultures derived from normal adult peripheral blood , in which both <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> SP1 <END> activities were high . 
Cord blood cultures showed an additive combination of `` adult '' and `` fetal '' patterns . 
The progenitors derived from a beta zero-thalassemia patient with high <START:ggp> HbF <END> production showed `` fetal '' pattern . 
On the other hand , in cultures of 2 beta zero-thalassemia patients without high <START:ggp> HbF <END> , `` adult '' pattern was observed . 
CONCLUSIONS : In the present work , we show that <START:ana> human fetal and adult erythroid progenitors <END> are distinct in their <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , and that the commitment to fetal or adult program occurs at a very early differentiation stage . 
Our studies also demonstrate that under anemic stress , recruitment of <START:ana> fetal progenitors <END> may occur in adulthood . 
Transcription-independent turnover of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> during monocyte adherence : implications for a translational component regulating <START:ana> I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA <END> levels . 
We identified <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 <END> as an <START:ggp> immediate-early gene <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> that is expressed in response to a variety of signals , including adhesion , lipopolysaccharide , and phorbol myristate acetate . 
Within 5 min of monocyte adhesion , the level of the <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha protein <END> is markedly diminished but is rapidly replaced in a cycloheximide-sensitive manner within 20 min . 
Accompanying the rapid turnover of the <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha protein <END> is simultaneous translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-related transcription factors <END> to nuclei of adhered monocytes . 
The demonstration that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> can regulate <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene <END> transcription in other cell types suggested that the rapid increase in steady-state <START:ana> I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA <END> levels we observed within 30 min of monocyte adherence would result from <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -dependent transcriptional stimulation of the <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene <END> . 
Nuclear run-on analyses indicated that , instead , while several <START:ggp> immediate-early cytokine genes <END> , such as the <START:ggp> interleukin 1 beta ( IL-1 beta ) gene <END> , were transcriptionally activated during monocyte adhesion , the rate of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene <END> transcription remained constant . 
The adherence-dependent increase in <START:ana> I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA <END> levels was also not a consequence of <START:ana> mRNA <END> stabilization events . 
Interestingly , while increases in both IL-1 beta and I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA levels were detected in nuclei of <START:ana> adherent monocytes <END> , cytoplasmic levels of <START:ana> IL-1 beta mRNA <END> increased during adherence whereas those of <START:ana> I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA <END> did not . 
Taken together , our data suggest that two interactive mechanisms regulate <START:ana> monocytic I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA <END> levels . 
We propose that <START:ana> adherent monocytes <END> regulate nuclear processing ( or decay ) of <START:ana> I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA <END> , thereby increasing mRNA levels without stimulating <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene <END> transcription . 
Moreover , since inhibition of protein synthesis leads to accumulation of <START:ana> I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA <END> without stimulating <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene <END> transcription , we suggest that low cytoplasmic levels of <START:ana> I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA <END> are maintained by a translation-dependent degradation mechanism . 
Distinct roles of the molecular <START:ggp> chaperone hsp90 <END> in modulating dioxin receptor function via the basic <START:ggp> helix-loop-helix <END> and <START:ggp> PAS domains <END> . 
The <START:ggp> intracellular dioxin receptor <END> mediates signal transduction by dioxin and functions as a <START:ggp> ligand-activated transcription factor <END> . 
It contains a <START:ggp> basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) motif <END> contiguous with a <START:ggp> Per-Arnt-Sim ( PAS ) homology region <END> . 
In extracts from nonstimulated cells the receptor is recovered in an inducible cytoplasmic form associated with the <START:ggp> 90-kDa heat shock protein <END> ( <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> ) , a <START:ggp> molecular chaperone <END> . 
We have reconstituted ligand-dependent activation of the receptor to a <START:ggp> DNA-binding form <END> by using the <START:ggp> dioxin receptor <END> and its <START:ggp> bHLH-PAS partner factor <END> <START:ggp> Arnt <END> expressed by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate . 
Deletion of the <START:ggp> PAS domain <END> of the receptor resulted in constitutive dimerization with <START:ggp> Arnt <END> . 
In contrast , this receptor mutant showed low levels of xenobiotic response element-binding activity , indicating that the <START:ggp> PAS domain <END> may be important for DNA-binding affinity and/or specificity of the receptor . 
It was not possible to reconstitute <START:ggp> dioxin receptor <END> function with proteins expressed in wheat germ lysate . 
In line with these observations , reticulocyte lysate but not wheat germ lysate promoted the association of de novo synthesized <START:ggp> dioxin receptor <END> with <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> . 
At least two distinct domains of the receptor mediated interaction with <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> : the <START:ggp> ligand-binding domain <END> located within the <START:ggp> PAS region <END> and , surprisingly , the <START:ggp> bHLH domain <END> . 
Whereas ligand-binding activity correlated with association with <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> , bHLH- <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> interaction appeared to be important for DNA-binding activity but not for dimerization of the receptor . 
Several distinct roles for <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> in modulating <START:ggp> dioxin receptor <END> function are therefore likely : correct folding of the ligand-binding domain , interference with <START:ggp> Arnt <END> heterodimerization , and folding of a DNA-binding conformation of the <START:ggp> bHLH domain <END> . 
Thus , the <START:ggp> dioxin receptor <END> system provides a complex and interesting model of the regulation of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> by <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> . 
Induction of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> by aspirin-like drugs . 
Aspirin-like drugs ( ALD ) induce calcium mobilization , an essential component of T cell activation , but do not induce the biosynthesis of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
To understand the extent to which ALD may mimic mitogenic stimulation , we studied cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling steps in <START:ana> ALD-treated T cells <END> . 
We found that ALD induce a transient activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) but have no effect ( in comparison to <START:ggp> anti-CD3 antibodies <END> ) on protein tyrosine phosphorylation nor on PCL gamma 1 tyrosine phosphorylation . 
ALD-induced calcium mobilization and <START:ggp> PKC <END> activation are independent of <START:ggp> tyrosine protein kinase <END> activity as shown by the lack of effect of herbimycin , a <START:ggp> tyrosine-protein kinase <END> -specific inhibitor . 
Although we detected no <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> in <START:ana> ALD-treated cells <END> , the nuclei of these cells contain proteins capable of binding to three <START:ggp> regulatory sequences <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter region <END> : <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> , and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
These binding activities are expressed only in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
The expression of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> depended on calcium mobilization and <START:ggp> PKC <END> activation . 
These data suggest that ALD cause transient but significant changes in T cell transmembrane signaling , although some events induced by stimulation with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 antibodies <END> are not induced by ALD . 
The signal is transmitted to the nucleus and induces DNA-binding activity by several <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
However , the ALD stimulus is not capable of causing complete T cell activation . 
<START:ggp> Protein kinase C <END> is not a downstream effector of <START:ggp> p21ras <END> in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
The aim of this present study was to investigate the role of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) , downstream of <START:ggp> p21ras <END> , in activating <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene <END> expression . 
It has been reported that <START:ggp> PKC <END> is an <START:ggp> effector <END> of <START:ggp> p21ras <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Data is presented , using the potent and selective <START:ggp> PKC <END> inhibitor Ro 31-8425 and transient expression of a constitutively active ras mutant , which clearly shows that <START:ggp> PKC <END> is not downstream of <START:ggp> p21ras <END> in the induction of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> transcriptional activity and in the expression of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in <START:ana> human Jurkat T cells <END> . 
Reporter gene experiments demonstrated that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> transcriptional activity is not affected by expression of activated <START:ggp> p21ras <END> . 
The signaling pathways involving <START:ggp> PKC <END> activation , calcium mobilization and <START:ggp> ras <END> activation combine to provide the necessary components for production of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> during T cell activation . 
The <START:ggp> C-terminus <END> of the <START:ggp> B cell activator <END> <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> functions as an <START:ggp> activation domain <END> in yeast . 
<START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> are human <START:ggp> transcriptional activators <END> that bind to the same DNA element but activate distinct sets of genes . 
We expressed these factors in S. cerevisiae and observed greater than 5-fold stimulation of a <START:ggp> lacZ reporter gene <END> only with <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> . 
Transfer of the <START:ggp> Oct-2 C-terminal domain <END> onto either <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> Oct1.2 <END> ) or a <START:ggp> nonactivating DNA-binding domain <END> from <START:ggp> GAL4 <END> created activators capable of greater than 15 and 10-fold stimulation of activity , respectively . 
Thus , the <START:ggp> C-terminus <END> of <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> is sufficient to confer activation potential to nonactive <START:ggp> DNA-binding fragments <END> in yeast . 
Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
The induction of cell death in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> by glucocorticoids is one of the earliest and most thoroughly studied models of apoptosis . 
Although the exact mechanism by which apoptosis occurs in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> is unknown many biochemical and molecular changes have been shown to occur in these cells in response to glucocorticoids . 
The role of <START:ggp> chromatin <END> degradation and <START:ggp> endonucleases <END> in the apoptotic process has been closely studied , as well as the involvement of several <START:ggp> oncogenes <END> in glucocorticoid-induced cell lysis . 
In addition , the clinical importance of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in the treatment of lymphoid neoplasms has recently received increased attention . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-2 <END> induces tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> stat3 <END> in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> . 
An early biochemical event associated with T cell activation through the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> ) is tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates . 
The exact mechanism by which <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> regulates transcription of different genes is presently unknown . 
Here , we report that stimulation through the <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> induced tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> stat3 <END> , a newly identified member of the <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) family <END> of proteins . 
In contrast , stat1 proteins were not tyrosine phosphorylated after <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ligation , whereas <START:ggp> tyrosine-phosphorylated stat1 proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> 91 and 84 kDa proteins <END> ) were translocated to the nucleus following <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> treatment of <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
Apart from <START:ggp> stat3 <END> , another <START:ggp> cytoplasmic protein <END> was tyrosine phosphorylated and subsequently translocated to the nucleus in response to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
This protein had an apparent molecular mass of 84 kDa and was not recognized by <START:ggp> stat3 <END> or <START:ggp> stat1 mAb <END> or antisera . 
Since <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induced nuclear translocation of the <START:ggp> 84 kDa protein <END> and <START:ggp> stat3 <END> followed identical kinetics , <START:ggp> p84 <END> is a candidate for a new , yet undefined , member of the STAT family . 
Taken together , we report that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induces tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> stat3 <END> and an as yet undefined <START:ggp> 84-kDa protein <END> in <START:ana> antigen-specific human T cell lines <END> . 
Human T-cell leukemia virus type I <START:ggp> Tax <END> activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> involves phosphorylation and degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and <START:ggp> RelA <END> ( <START:ggp> p65 <END> ) -mediated induction of the <START:ggp> c-rel gene <END> . 
The tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is a potent <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> that both stimulates viral gene expression and activates an array of <START:ggp> cellular genes <END> involved in <START:ana> T-cell <END> growth . 
Tax acts indirectly by inducing or modifying the action of various host <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , including members of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel family <END> of <START:ggp> enhancer-binding proteins <END> . 
In <START:ana> resting T cells <END> , many of these <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel factors <END> are sequestered in the cytoplasm by various <START:ggp> ankyrin-rich inhibitory proteins <END> , including <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> HTLV-I Tax <END> expression leads to the constitutive nuclear expression of biologically active <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel complexes <END> ; however , the biochemical mechanism ( s ) underlying this response remains poorly understood . 
In this study , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> Tax <END> -stimulated nuclear expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in both <START:ana> HTLV-I-infected and Tax-transfected human T cells <END> is associated with the phosphorylation and rapid proteolytic degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
In contrast to prior in vitro studies , at least a fraction of the phosphorylated form of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> remains physically associated with the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> in vivo but is subject to rapid degradation , thereby promoting the nuclear translocation of the active <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> . 
We further demonstrate that <START:ggp> Tax <END> induction of nuclear <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> expression is activated by the <START:ggp> RelA <END> ( <START:ggp> p65 <END> ) subunit of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , which activates transcription of the <START:ggp> c-rel gene <END> through an intrinsic <START:ggp> kappa B enhancer element <END> . 
In normal cells , the subsequent accumulation of <START:ggp> nuclear c-Rel <END> acts to inhibit its own continued production , indicating the presence of an autoregulatory loop . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in vivo is regulated by multiple phosphorylations . 
The activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) in intact cells is mechanistically not well understood . 
Therefore we investigated the modifications imposed on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/I kappa B components <END> following stimulation and show that the final step of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> induction in vivo involves phosphorylation of several members of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/I kappa B protein families <END> . 
In <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> as well as in <START:ana> B cells <END> , TNF-alpha rapidly induced nuclear translocation primarily of <START:ggp> p50-p65 <END> , but not of <START:ggp> c-rel <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> precursors and <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> became strongly phosphorylated with the same kinetics . 
In addition to the inducible phosphorylation after stimulation , <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> containing constitutive nuclear <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> revealed constitutively phosphorylated <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
Phosphorylation was accompanied by induced processing of the precursors <START:ggp> p100 <END> and <START:ggp> p105 <END> and by degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
As an in vitro model we show that phosphorylation of <START:ggp> p105 <END> impedes its ability to interact with <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , as has been shown before for <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
Surprisingly , even <START:ggp> p65 <END> , but not <START:ggp> c-rel <END> , was phosphorylated after induction in vivo , suggesting that <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> selectively activates only specific <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> heteromers and that modifications regulate not only <START:ggp> I kappa B molecules <END> but also <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> molecules . 
In fact , cellular <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity was phosphorylation-dependent and the DNA binding activity of <START:ggp> p65-containing NF-kappa B <END> was enhanced by phosphorylation in vitro . 
Furthermore , we found that the induction by hydrogen peroxide of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation to the nucleus , which is assumed to be triggered by reactive oxygen intermediates , also coincided with incorporation of phosphate into the same subunits that were modified after stimulation by <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> . 
Thus , phosphorylation appears to be a general mechanism for activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in vivo . 
Treatment of <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> with various combinations of retinoids and 1 alpha , 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 results in differentiation towards <START:ana> neutrophils <END> or <START:ana> monocytes <END> or a failure to differentiate and apoptosis . 
It is well documented that treatment of <START:ana> serum-grown HL60 cells <END> with 10 ( -7 ) M all-trans retinoic acid ( all-trans RA ) induces <START:ana> neutrophil <END> differentiation , whereas treatment with 10 ( -7 ) M 1 alpha , 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( D3 ) induces differentiation towards <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
In recent investigations , using <START:ana> serum-free grown HL60 cells <END> , we observed that all-trans RA , at 10 ( -7 ) M , did not induce neutrophil differentiation and that all-trans RA , at 10 ( -8 ) M , reduced the D3 concentration required for <START:ana> monocyte <END> differentiation to 5 x 10 ( -9 ) M . 
In this study , co-operative interactions between all-trans and 9-cis RA and D3 which promote neutrophil and monocyte differentiation of <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> have been analysed in detail . 
Treatment of <START:ana> serum-free grown HL60 cells <END> with 5 x 10 ( -7 ) M all-trans RA or 9-cis RA resulted in sub-optimal neutrophil differentiation ( up to 25 % mature cells ) . 
As shown for all-trans RA , 9-cis RA cooperated with D3 to promote monocyte differentiation . 
Culture of <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> in 5 x 10 ( -7 ) M 9-cis RA together with a wide range of concentrations of D3 resulted in promotion of neutrophil differentiation at 10 ( -15 ) -10 ( -12 ) D3 , a failure to differentiate and apoptosis at 10 ( -11 ) -10 ( -10 ) M D3 , followed by co-operativity between 9-cis RA and 5 x 10 ( -9 ) M D3 in inducing monocyte differentiation in the absence of neutrophil differentiation . 
Similar results were obtained when <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> were treated with 5 x 10 ( -7 ) all-trans RA together with a wide range of concentrations of D3 . 
Cross titration analyses of the effects of 9-cis RA and D3 on <START:ana> HL60 cell <END> differentiation were undertaken to determine the boundaries of the concentrations of each agent , alone and in combination , that give rise to optimal neutrophil and monocyte differentiation of <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> . 
The observed cooperativities between either 9-cis RA or all-trans RA and D3 have important implications for the use of combinations of these agents in differentiation therapy . 
Isolation of differentially expressed sequence tags from <START:ana> steroid-responsive cells <END> using <START:ana> mRNA <END> differential display . 
Transcriptional control of <START:ggp> steroid-regulated gene networks <END> by <START:ggp> nuclear receptor proteins <END> results in the coordinate expression of a limited number of <START:ggp> target genes <END> . 
Although much is known about the structure and function of steroid receptors , relatively few cell-specific steroid-regulated genes have been isolated and characterized . 
In this paper we describe results using <START:ana> mRNA <END> differential display <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase <END> PCR ( DDPCR ) to identify and isolate short cDNA sequence tags from <START:ana> thymocyte <END> and <START:ana> prostate cells <END> under various hormone conditions . 
Using this technique we have isolated several <START:ggp> differentially expressed sequence tags <END> ( <START:ggp> DESTs <END> ) from the <START:ana> mouse thymocyte cell line <END> <START:ana> WEHI 7.2 <END> . 
Two of these <START:ggp> DESTs <END> , <START:ggp> GIG10 <END> and <START:ggp> GIG18 <END> , are rapidly induced by dexamethasone within 2 h of treatment . 
<START:ggp> GIG10 <END> is a novel sequence and <START:ggp> GIG18 <END> is the mouse homologue of a <START:ggp> human expressed sequence tag <END> isolated from <START:ana> activated B lymphocytes <END> . 
We also used DDPCR to isolate <START:ggp> DESTs <END> from androgen-modulated rat ventral prostate tissue , one of which we characterized and found to correspond to the <START:ana> 3 ' end <END> of <START:ana> prostatic spermine binding protein mRNA <END> , a known <START:ggp> androgen-regulated gene <END> . 
Modifications of the original DDPCR protocol , which we found can potentially decrease the frequency of isolating false-positive <START:ggp> DESTs <END> , are described and the merits of DDPCR , relative to other differential cDNA cloning strategies , are discussed . 
Activation of <START:ana> human thymocytes <END> after infection by EBV . 
The discovery of EBV in certain T cell malignancies and the expression of the <START:ggp> EBV receptor <END> , <START:ggp> CR2/CD21 <END> , on a population of <START:ana> immature thymocytes <END> , <START:ana> T lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> , and <START:ana> childhood acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells <END> suggested that EBV-receptor interactions on <START:ana> T cells <END> may be of importance . 
We have shown that , within the thymus , a population of <START:ana> large , immature cells <END> expresses <START:ggp> CD21 <END> . 
EBV altered the activation responses of <START:ana> immature thymocytes <END> in vitro . 
Triggering through <START:ggp> CD2 <END> is mitogenic for mature , but not immature , <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
However , during infection by EBV , ligation of <START:ggp> CD2 <END> caused <START:ana> thymocytes <END> to proliferate in the absence of <START:ggp> exogenous cytokines <END> . 
This function was a result of the interaction of EBV with its receptor , <START:ggp> CD21 <END> , but was caused by infection rather than surface signaling , because neither <START:ggp> specific mAb <END> nor the P3HR-1 strain of virus mimicked the effect of B95-8 . 
Immature <START:ana> thymocytes <END> were infected by EBV , as determined by the internalization of the <START:ggp> viral genome <END> and its transcriptional activity . 
Consistent with the activity of <START:ggp> B95-8 <END> , <START:ana> EBNA-2 transcripts <END> were identified within <START:ana> infected thymocyte populations <END> . 
In addition , components of the viral replicative pathway were expressed during infection of <START:ana> thymocytes <END> . 
These components included transcription of <START:ggp> BZLF-1 <END> , an <START:ggp> early gene <END> that characterizes <START:ana> EBV-infected B cells <END> after disruption of latency . 
A second transcript was identified as encoding the recently characterized <START:ggp> RAZ <END> , which also is associated with replicative infection . 
The consequences of EBV infection of <START:ana> T cells <END> at an early stage of differentiation may lead to failure of normal T cell repertoire development , autoimmunity , or malignancy . 
Effects of intranasal glucocorticoids on endogenous glucocorticoid peripheral and central function . 
Glucocorticoids are among the most potent antiinflammatory agents that can be used in the treatment of rhinitis . 
Their mechanisms of action are multiple and complex and a number of reports describe significant systemic effects of locally administered glucocorticoids . 
In order to evaluate the short-term systemic effects of intranasally administered glucocorticoids , 14 normal healthy subjects were treated with two doses of either budesonide ( BUD ) or fluticasone propionate ( FP ) for 2 weeks . 
Before treatment , at regular intervals during the treatment , 1 week and finally 6 weeks after termination of treatment , the effects on glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) and methallothionein ( MTIIa ) mRNA expression levels were examined in <START:ana> peripheral lymphocytes <END> using a solution hybridization assay . 
Serum cortisol , osteocalcin and urinary cortisol levels were also determined . 
An insulin tolerance test ( ITT ) was performed at the end of the second week of treatment and at the end of the 6-week washout period with no statistically significant change in cortisol response . 
In <START:ana> peripheral lymphocytes <END> , <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> levels were significantly down-regulated . 
<START:ana> MTIIa mRNA <END> levels increased significantly . 
Serum <START:ggp> osteocalcin <END> decreased significantly during treatment with both BUD and FP . 
Serum cortisol decreased after 1 week of treatment whereas urinary cortisol was not affected until the second week of treatment . 
In conclusion , intranasal glucocorticoids at clinically recommended doses have not only significant systemic effects on adrenal function , but also have an effect on specific gene expression in <START:ana> peripheral lymphocytes <END> . 
These effects are receptor-dependent , reversible , and according to serum and urinary cortisol levels and ITT , leave the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function intact . 
Finally , these short-term systemic effects were not associated with any of the noticeable side-effects usually observed during long-term treatment with glucocorticoids . 
Biphasic control of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> activation by the <START:ggp> T cell receptor complex <END> : role of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> . 
The regulation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> activation by the <START:ggp> T cell receptor ( TcR ) /CD3 complex <END> in primary human <START:ana> T cells <END> has been studied at various times after activation . 
Only <START:ggp> p50 NF-kappa B protein <END> bound the <START:ggp> kappa B element <END> of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) alpha chain promoter <END> on resting <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
However , immediately after <START:ggp> TcR/CD3 <END> cross-linking ( after approximately 1 h ; immediate ) binding of <START:ggp> p50.p65 heterodimers <END> was observed . 
<START:ggp> p50.c-rel heterodimers <END> were also detected bound to this sequence at early time points ( 7-16 h ; early ) , and both remained active at later time points ( 40 h ; late ) after activation . 
This regulation takes place mainly at the level of nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> c-rel <END> , at immediate and early time points . 
Activation also induced c-rel and p105/p50 mRNA synthesis , but not <START:ana> p65 mRNA <END> whose expression was constitutive . 
Interestingly , all those early and late events , but not the immediate ones , were inhibited by a neutralizing <START:ggp> anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) monoclonal antibody <END> . 
Similarly , cycloheximide prevented the <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> c-rel <END> translocation and consequent formation of active binding heterodimers , at early and late times . 
Cyclosporin A impaired not only early and late , but also immediate events ; however , addition of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> prevented all inhibition . 
These results indicate that the regulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation during T cell activation by <START:ggp> TcR/CD3 <END> signals is biphasic : <START:ggp> TcR/CD3 <END> triggers its immediate translocation , which is transient if no <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> is present . 
<START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , therefore , emerges as the main factor responsible for a second phase of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> regulation , controlling both translocation of <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> c-rel <END> , and new <START:ana> mRNA <END> synthesis for <START:ggp> c-rel <END> and <START:ggp> p105/p50 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor Sp1 <END> is required for induction of the <START:ggp> murine GM-CSF promoter <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> cis-acting region <END> , <START:ggp> GM-kappa B/GC-box <END> ( <START:ggp> positions -95 <END> and <START:ggp> -73 <END> ) , within the <START:ggp> murine GM-CSF gene promoter <END> is required for maximal induction by stimulation with phorbol-12-myristate acetate ( PMA ) and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> GM-kappa B <END> defines a binding site for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , and <START:ggp> GC-box <END> defines a binding site for three ( <START:ggp> A1 <END> , <START:ggp> A2 <END> , <START:ggp> B <END> ) <START:ggp> constitutive proteins <END> . 
We report here that three copies of the <START:ggp> GC-box <END> can functionally compensate for the <START:ggp> GM-kappa B/GC-box region <END> , suggesting that the GC-motif can function independently of the <START:ggp> GM-kappa B motif <END> . 
The major <START:ggp> GC-box <END> binding activity <START:ggp> A1 <END> was purified and identified as the <START:ggp> transcription factor Sp1 <END> . 
We show that depletion of <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> ( <START:ggp> A1 <END> ) from nuclear extracts specifically decreases in vitro transcription activity on <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> templates . 
Since the <START:ggp> human GM-CSF promoter <END> has a base difference within the <START:ggp> GC-box <END> , we speculate that this may explain why the human promoter is weak and that an <START:ggp> upstream enhancer <END> is required for the induction of the <START:ggp> human GM-CSF gene <END> . 
A factor that regulates the <START:ggp> class II major histocompatibility complex gene <END> <START:ggp> DPA <END> is a member of a subfamily of <START:ggp> zinc finger proteins <END> that includes a <START:ggp> Drosophila developmental control protein <END> . 
A novel <START:ggp> DNA sequence element <END> termed the <START:ggp> J element <END> involved in the regulated expression of <START:ggp> class II major histocompatibility complex genes <END> was recently described . 
To study this element and its role in <START:ggp> class II gene <END> regulation further , a <START:ggp> cDNA library <END> was screened with oligonucleotide probes containing both the <START:ggp> S element <END> and the nearby <START:ggp> J element <END> of the <START:ggp> human DPA gene <END> . 
Several <START:ggp> DNA clones <END> were obtained by this procedure , one of which , <START:ggp> clone 18 <END> , is reported and characterized here . 
It encodes a protein predicted to contain 688 amino acid residues , including 11 <START:ggp> zinc finger motifs <END> of the <START:ggp> C2H2 type <END> in the <START:ggp> C-terminal region <END> , that are Kruppel-like in the conservation of the <START:ggp> H/C link sequence <END> connecting them . 
The <START:ggp> 160 N-terminal amino acids <END> in the <START:ggp> nonfinger region <END> of <START:ggp> clone 18 <END> are highly homologous with similar regions of several other <START:ggp> human , mouse , and Drosophila sequences <END> , defining a subfamily of Kruppel-like <START:ggp> zinc finger proteins <END> termed <START:ggp> TAB <END> ( <START:ggp> tramtrack [ ttk ] -associated box <END> ) here . 
One of the <START:ggp> Drosophila sequences <END> , <START:ggp> ttk <END> , is a <START:ggp> developmental control gene <END> , while a second does not contain a <START:ggp> zinc finger region <END> but encodes a structure important in oocyte development . 
An <START:ggp> acidic activation domain <END> is located between the <START:ggp> N-terminal conserved region <END> of <START:ggp> clone 18 <END> and its <START:ggp> zinc fingers <END> . 
This protein appears to require both the <START:ggp> S and J elements <END> , which are separated by 10 bp for optimal binding . 
Antisense cDNA to <START:ggp> clone 18 <END> inhibited the expression of a reporter construct containing the <START:ggp> DPA promoter <END> , indicating its functional importance in the expression of this <START:ggp> class II gene <END> . 
Separation of oxidant-initiated and redox-regulated steps in the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> signal transduction pathway . 
Studies presented here show that overall <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> signal transduction begins with a parallel series of stimuli-specific pathways through which <START:ggp> cytokines <END> ( <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ) , oxidants ( hydrogen peroxide and mitomycin C ) , and phorbol ester ( phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ) individually initiate signaling . 
These initial pathways culminate in a common pathway through which all of the stimulating agents ultimately signal <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
We distinguish the stimuli-specific pathways by showing that the oxidative stimuli trigger <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in only one of two <START:ana> human T-cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> Wurzburg <END> but not <START:ana> Jurkat <END> ) , whereas <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate readily stimulate in both lines . 
We propose the common pathway as the simplest way of accounting for the common requirements and properties of the signaling pathway . 
We include a redox-regulatory mechanism ( s ) in this common pathway to account for the previously demonstrated redox regulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> ( in which oxidants do n't activate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) ; we put tyrosine phosphorylation in the common pathway by showing that kinase activity ( inhibitable by herbimycin A and tyrphostin 47 ) is required for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation by all stimuli tested in both cell lines . 
Since internal sites of oxidant production have been shown to play a key role in the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -stimulated activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , and since tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities are known to be altered by oxidants , these findings suggest that intracellular redox status controls <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation event ( s ) within the common step of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> signal transduction pathway . 
Deleted <START:ggp> chromosome 20 <END> from a patient with Alagille syndrome isolated in a cell hybrid through leucine transport selection : study of three candidate genes . 
Alagille syndrome ( AGS ) is a well-defined genetic entity assigned to the <START:ggp> short arm <END> of <START:ggp> Chromosome ( Chr ) 20 <END> by a series of observations of AGS patients associated with microdeletions in this region . 
By fusing <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cells <END> of an AGS patient that exhibited a microdeletion in the <START:ggp> short arm of Chr 20 <END> encompassing bands <START:ggp> p11.23 to p12.3 <END> with <START:ana> rodent thermosensitive mutant cells <END> ( <START:ana> CHOtsH1-1 <END> ) deficient <START:ggp> in-leucyl-tRNA synthetase <END> , we isolated a <START:ana> somatic cell hybrid <END> segregating the deleted human <START:ggp> Chr 20 <END> . 
This hybrid clone , designated <START:ana> NR2 <END> , was characterized by several methods , including PCR , with eight pairs of oligonucleotides mapped to <START:ggp> Chr 20 <END> : <START:ggp> D20S5 <END> , <START:ggp> D20S41 <END> , <START:ggp> D20S42 <END> , <START:ggp> D20S56 <END> , <START:ggp> D20S57 <END> , <START:ggp> D20S58 <END> , <START:ggp> adenosine deaminase <END> ( <START:ggp> ADA <END> ) , and <START:ggp> Prion protein <END> ( <START:ggp> PRIP <END> ) ; Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism ( <START:ggp> RFLP <END> ) analyses with four <START:ggp> genomic anonymous probes <END> ( <START:ggp> D20S5 <END> , <START:ggp> cD3H12 <END> , <START:ggp> D20S17 <END> , <START:ggp> D20S18 <END> ) ; and fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) with <START:ggp> total human DNA <END> and <START:ggp> D20Z1 <END> , a sequence specific to the <START:ggp> human Chr 20 centromere <END> , as probes . 
The <START:ana> NR2 hybrid <END> allowed us to exclude three <START:ggp> candidate genes <END> for AGS : <START:ggp> hepatic nuclear factor 3 beta <END> ( <START:ggp> HNF3 beta <END> ) , <START:ggp> paired box 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> PAX1 <END> ) , and <START:ggp> cystatin C <END> ( <START:ggp> CST3 <END> ) as shown by their localization outside of the deletion . 
The <START:ana> NR2 hybrid <END> is a powerful tool for the mapping of new probes of this region , as well as for obtaining new informative probes specific for the deletion by subtractive cloning of the region . 
Such markers will be useful for linkage analysis and screening of <START:ggp> cDNA libraries <END> . 
Positive and negative regulation of the <START:ggp> composite octamer motif <END> of the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 enhancer <END> by <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , and <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor <END> . 
The differentiating agent retinoic acid ( RA ) has been previously reported to interfere with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) /Ca ( 2+ ) -induced signals for the regulation of the <START:ggp> -96 to -66-bp octamer motif <END> found in the enhancer for the <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2 gene <END> , which encodes a major <START:ggp> T lymphocyte growth factor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> IL-2 octamer motif <END> is a composite <START:ggp> cis-element <END> which binds <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> as well as a <START:ggp> TPA/Ca ( 2+ ) -inducible nuclear factor <END> , previously termed <START:ggp> octamer-associated protein <END> ( <START:ggp> OAP40 <END> ) . 
We show here that <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , despite the presence of an active transcriptional activation domain , requires TPA/Ca ( 2+ ) -induced signals to strongly transactivate the <START:ggp> IL-2 octamer motif <END> in Jurkat T cells . 
This <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> -dependent transactivation is inhibited by RA . 
The presence of an <START:ggp> intact COOH-terminal domain <END> of <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> contributes to both TPA/Ca ( 2+ ) -induced transactivation and the RA-mediated repression . 
We also show that both <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> components of the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> factors participate in the <START:ggp> OAP40 complex <END> . 
Furthermore , transfected <START:ggp> c-jun , jun-B , jun-D , c-fos , or Fos-B expression vectors <END> partially substitute for TPA and Ca2+ and cooperate with <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> for the transactivation of the combined <START:ggp> OAP/octamer cis-element <END> . 
Mutations of the <START:ggp> genuine octamer-binding site <END> abrogate both the binding of <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> and the TPA/Ca ( 2+ ) -induced transactivation of the <START:ggp> OAP/octamer motif <END> . 
<START:ggp> OAP <END> confers to <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> responsivity to both TPA/Ca2+ and RA , since specific mutations of the <START:ggp> AP-1/OAP-binding site <END> significantly reduce the transactivation by <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> in response to TPA and Ca2+ and abolish the inhibition by RA . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR <END> ) alpha is able to inhibit in vitro the formation of the complex between the nuclear <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> <START:ggp> /OAP <END> and its specific binding site , resulting in the interference with <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> -dependent cis-regulatory function of this <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> element . 
Therefore , we propose that the TPA/calcium-activated <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> <START:ggp> /OAP <END> element is the main target of positive or negative regulatory signals influencing the <START:ggp> IL-2 octamer motif <END> , through synergism with <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> and antagonism by <START:ggp> RAR <END> . 
Missense mutation in <START:ggp> exon 7 <END> of the <START:ggp> common gamma chain gene <END> causes a moderate form of X-linked combined immunodeficiency . 
Clinical and immunologic features of a recently recognized X-linked combined immunodeficiency disease ( XCID ) suggested that XCID and X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) might arise from different genetic defects . 
The recent discovery of mutations in the <START:ggp> common gamma chain ( gamma c ) gene <END> , a constituent of several <START:ggp> cytokine receptors <END> , in XSCID provided an opportunity to test directly whether a previously unrecognized mutation in this same gene was responsible for XCID . 
The status of <START:ggp> X chromosome <END> inactivation in blood leukocytes from obligate carriers of XCID was determined from the polymorphic , short tandem repeats ( CAG ) , in the <START:ggp> androgen receptor gene <END> , which also contains a <START:ggp> methylation-sensitive HpaII site <END> . 
As in XSCID , X-chromosome inactivation in obligate carriers of XCID was nonrandom in <START:ana> T and B lymphocytes <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> X chromosome <END> inactivation in PMNs was variable . 
Findings from this analysis prompted sequencing of the <START:ggp> gamma c gene <END> in this pedigree . 
A missense mutation in the region coding for the cytoplasmic portion of the <START:ggp> gamma c gene <END> was found in three affected males but not in a normal brother . 
Therefore , this point mutation in the <START:ggp> gamma c gene <END> leads to a less severe degree of deficiency in cellular and humoral immunity than that seen in XSCID . 
Posttranscriptional regulation of macrophage <START:ggp> tissue factor <END> expression by antioxidants . 
<START:ggp> Tissue factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TF <END> ) expression by cells of <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage lineage <END> represents an important mechanism underlying the initiation of <START:ggp> fibrin <END> deposition at sites of extravascular inflammation . 
Recent evidence suggests a role for oxidant stress in the signalling pathway of various cell types by virtue of its ability to induce DNA binding of various <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , including <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
The effect of antioxidant treatment on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced <START:ggp> TF <END> expression was examined in <START:ana> murine peritoneal macrophages <END> and <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Both pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , an oxidant scavenger , and N-acetyl-cysteine , a precursor of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione , inhibited stimulation of macrophage procoagulant activity by LPS . 
Northern blot analysis showed that neither of these agents reduced LPS-stimulated <START:ggp> TF <END> mRNA accumulation , thereby suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism for the effect . 
Immunofluorescence studies of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> using polyclonal <START:ggp> anti-TF antibody <END> showed that N-acetyl-cysteine treatment prevented the characteristic plasmalemmal localization of <START:ggp> TF antigen <END> that occurs in response to LPS . 
Western blot analysis showed that N-acetyl-cysteine reduced the accumulation of the <START:ggp> 47-kD mature glycoprotein <END> in <START:ana> LPS-treated cells <END> , a finding consistent with the results of the immunofluorescence studies . 
Furthermore , these conditions did not result in an accumulation of the less mature forms of <START:ggp> TF <END> . 
When considered together , these data suggest that antioxidants exert their effects by impairing translation and/or by causing degradation of newly <START:ggp> translated protein <END> . 
The effect of antioxidants on <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> appeared to be species specific , with no effect on LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor in murine cells , but with inhibition in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
The posttranscriptional effect of antioxidants on <START:ggp> TF <END> expression data suggests a novel mechanism whereby these agents might modulate <START:ana> monocyte <END> <START:ana> /macrophage <END> activation . 
Characterization of the <START:ggp> CD48 gene <END> demonstrates a positive element that is specific to <START:ana> Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B-cell lines <END> and contains an essential <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> . 
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection of mature , <START:ana> resting B cells <END> drives them to become lymphoblasts expressing high levels of cell surface molecules , such as <START:ggp> CD48 <END> , characteristically expressed on <START:ana> normal activated B cells <END> . 
Here , we report on the identification of an <START:ggp> enhancer element <END> in the <START:ggp> CD48 gene <END> which reproducibly confers strong transcriptional activity only in <START:ana> EBV-positive B-lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> . 
The element is not activated upon infection of established <START:ana> EBV-negative B-cell lines <END> , indicating that EBV fails to drive these cells to a fully <START:ana> lymphoblastoid phenotype <END> . 
An <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding site is an essential component of the element but alone is not sufficient to account for the activity or the specificity of the element . 
We have detected a specific <START:ggp> nuclear protein complex <END> that binds to the element and show that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 <END> ( <START:ggp> p50 <END> ) is a part of this complex . 
The <START:ggp> EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 <END> is capable of transactivating the isolated <START:ggp> CD48 <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> but not the <START:ggp> intact element <END> , suggesting that the <START:ggp> latent membrane protein 1 <END> -driven activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> must interact with other regulatory pathways to control expression of cellular genes as EBV drives <START:ana> resting B cells <END> into the cell cycle . 
Thapsigargin induces <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor alpha-chain <END> in <START:ana> human peripheral <END> and <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> via a <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> -independent mechanism . 
Thapsigargin ( TG ) , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> Ca ( 2+ ) -ATPase <END> , depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores and induces a sustained Ca2+ influx without altering phosphatidyl inositol levels . 
TG plus phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) but not TG alone induced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> , suggesting that TG had no effect on <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) . 
However , TG induced increases in <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha protein <END> as well as <START:ana> IL-2R alpha mRNA <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> in a dose-dependent manner . 
A similar increase in <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> by TG was also observed in <START:ana> human peripheral T cells <END> . 
Further , like PMA , TG markedly induced <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
However , TG and PMA exhibited a synergistic action on <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> expression , suggesting that TG and PMA induce <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> through distinct pathways . 
<START:ggp> PMA -but not TG-induced IL-2R alpha <END> is inhibited by the <START:ggp> PKC <END> inhibitor H7 , whereas <START:ggp> TG -but not PMA-induced IL-2R alpha <END> was inhibited by cholera toxin , forskolin and 1 , 9-dideoxy forskolin . 
In toto , these results suggest that TG induces <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> through a <START:ggp> PKC <END> -independent pathway . 
Physiological concentration of estradiol inhibits <START:ana> polymorphonuclear leukocyte <END> chemotaxis via a receptor mediated system . 
Estrogen exhibits a variety of actions , including immuno-modulatory effects , in vivo and in vitro . 
The mechanism by which estrogen exerts its anti-inflammatory effect is not yet understood . 
We investigated the possible mechanisms of estradiol acting via the <START:ana> polymorphonuclear leukocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PMNs <END> ) , which are important in the immune response . 
The agent , 17 beta-estradiol , but not 17 alpha-estradiol , significantly reduced <START:ana> PMNs <END> chemotaxis to FMLP in a dose-dependent manner ( control vs estrogen 10 ( -10 ) - ( -6 ) M , P < 0.05 ) . 
Physiological concentrations of estradiol significantly reduced the chemotaxis of <START:ana> PMNs <END> ( 10 ( -10 ) mol ) . 
Pre-incubation with clomiphene or tamoxifen which are estrogen receptor antagonists , eliminated the inhibitory effect of 17 beta-estradiol on the chemotaxis of <START:ana> PMNs <END> , restoring it to the control level . 
These observations suggest that 17 beta-estradiol suppressed the chemotaxis of <START:ana> PMNs <END> by a receptor-dependent mechanism . 
In addition , the level of estradiol in <START:ana> human plasma <END> , which <START:ana> PMNs <END> were drawn , showed a close , inverse correlation with the <START:ana> PMNs <END> chemotaxis to FMLP ( r = -0.821 p < 0.001 ) . 
Estrogen may modify the activity of <START:ana> neutrophils <END> during the normal menstrual cycle , not only during pregnancy , and influence inflammation . 
Identification of the <START:ggp> TCL1 gene <END> involved in <START:ana> T-cell <END> malignancies . 
The <START:ggp> TCL1 locus <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 14q32.1 <END> is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations and inversions with one of the <START:ggp> T-cell receptor loci <END> in human T-cell leukemias and lymphomas . 
The <START:ggp> chromosome 14 region <END> translocated or rearranged involves approximately 350 kb of DNA at chromosome band 14q32.1 . 
Within this region we have identified a gene coding for a <START:ana> 1.3-kb transcript <END> , expressed only in restricted subsets of cells within the <START:ana> lymphoid lineage <END> and expressed at high levels in <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> carrying a t ( 14 ; 14 ) ( q11 ; q32 ) chromosome translocation or a inv ( 14 ) ( q11 ; q32 ) chromosome inversion . 
The <START:ggp> cognate cDNA sequence <END> reveals an <START:ggp> open reading frame <END> of 342 nt encoding a <START:ggp> protein of 14 kDa <END> . 
The <START:ggp> TCL1 gene <END> sequence , which , to our knowledge , shows no sequence homology with other <START:ggp> human genes <END> , is preferentially expressed early in <START:ana> T- and B-lymphocyte <END> differentiation . 
Identification of a region which directs the monocytic activity of the <START:ggp> colony-stimulating factor 1 ( macrophage colony-stimulating factor ) receptor promoter <END> and binds <START:ggp> PEBP2/CBF <END> ( <START:ggp> AML1 <END> ) . 
The receptor for the <START:ggp> macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( or <START:ggp> colony-stimulating factor 1 <END> [ <START:ggp> CSF-1 <END> ] ) is expressed from different promoters in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> and <START:ana> placental trophoblasts <END> . 
We have demonstrated that the monocyte-specific expression of the <START:ggp> CSF-1 receptor <END> is regulated at the level of transcription by a <START:ggp> tissue-specific promoter <END> whose activity is stimulated by the <START:ggp> monocyte/B-cell-specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> ( D.-E.Zhang , C.J.Hetherington , H.-M.Chen , and D.G.Tenen , Mol.Cell. Biol.14 : 373-381 , 1994 ) . 
Here we report that the tissue specificity of this <START:ggp> promoter <END> is also mediated by sequences in a <START:ggp> region II <END> ( bp -88 to - 59 ) , which lies <START:ggp> 10 bp upstream <END> from the <START:ggp> PU.1-binding site <END> . 
When analyzed by <START:ggp> DNase <END> footprinting , <START:ggp> region II <END> was protected preferentially in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that <START:ggp> region II <END> interacts specifically with <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> from <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
Two <START:ggp> gel shift complexes <END> ( <START:ggp> Mono A <END> and <START:ggp> Mono B <END> ) were formed with separate sequence elements within this region . 
Competition and supershift experiments indicate that <START:ggp> Mono B <END> contains a member of the <START:ggp> polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2/core-binding factor ( PEBP2/CBF ) family , <END> which includes the AML1 gene product , while <START:ggp> Mono A <END> is a distinct complex preferentially expressed in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Promoter constructs <END> with mutations in these sequence elements were no longer expressed specifically in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> multimerized region II sequence elements <END> enhanced the activity of a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> but not other cell types tested . 
These results indicate that the <START:ggp> monocyte/B-cell-specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> and the <START:ggp> Mono A and Mono B protein complexes <END> act in concert to regulate monocyte-specific transcription of the <START:ggp> CSF-1 receptor <END> . 
Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , a potent inhibitor of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) activation , prevents apoptosis in human <START:ana> promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells <END> and <START:ana> thymocytes <END> . 
We examined the effect of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , which potently blocks the activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) , on the induction of apoptosis by a variety of agents . 
Treatment of a <START:ana> human promyelocytic leukemia cell line <END> , <START:ana> HL-60 <END> , with 10 micrograms/mL etoposide or 2 microM 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation within 1 hr and subsequently caused apoptosis within 3-4 hr . 
The simultaneous addition of 50-500 microM PDTC with these agents blocked <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation and completely abrogated both morphologically apoptotic changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation for up to 6 hr . 
However , PDTC failed to inhibit the <START:ggp> endonuclease <END> activity contained in the whole cell lysates . 
The inhibitory effect of PDTC was also observed in etoposide -and dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in <START:ana> human thymocytes <END> at a concentration of 1-10 microM . 
Since PDTC has both antioxidant and metal-ion chelating activities , we tested the effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) ( antioxidant ) or o-phenanthroline ( OP ) ( metal-ion chelator ) on the induction of apoptosis . 
Pretreatment of HL-60 cells or <START:ana> thymocytes <END> with 100-500 microM OP for 2 hr , but not 10-60 mM NAC , suppressed subsequent occurrence of apoptosis induced by etoposide . 
These results suggest that the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> plays an important role in the apoptotic process of <START:ana> human hematopoietic cells <END> . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> protein kinase C-zeta <END> stimulates <START:ana> leukemic cell <END> differentiation . 
A function for <START:ggp> protein kinase C-zeta <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC-zeta <END> ) , a member of the phorbol ester nonresponsive atypical <START:ggp> protein kinase C subfamily <END> , in modulating differentiation was examined in the <START:ana> leukemic U937 cell <END> . 
Transfected <START:ana> U937 cells <END> stably overexpressing <START:ggp> PKC-zeta <END> displayed a longer doubling time , lower saturation density at confluency , and an increase in adherence to plastic as compared to <START:ana> control cells <END> . 
<START:ana> PKC-zeta cells <END> expressed a more differentiated phenotype as assessed by changes in morphology , surface antigen expression , and <START:ggp> lysosomal enzyme <END> activities and were distinct from <START:ana> parental U937 cells <END> stimulated to differentiate by exposure to phorbol esters . 
In contrast to parental <START:ana> U937 cells <END> , <START:ana> PKC-zeta cells <END> constitutively expressed <START:ana> mRNA transcripts <END> for <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and a low mobility <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding activity . 
Thus , <START:ggp> PKC-zeta <END> overexpression stimulates a type of phenotypic differentiation that differs significantly from maturation occurring upon activation of other <START:ggp> PKC subfamilies <END> induced by phorbol ester treatment . 
Increased expression of the <START:ggp> c-jun <END> protooncogene and an increase in <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding activity in <START:ana> PKC-zeta cells <END> provides a potential mechanism for explaining the altered differentiation status of this cell . 
A family of <START:ggp> serine proteases <END> expressed exclusively in myelo- <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> specifically processes the <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B subunit p65 <END> in vitro and may impair human immunodeficiency virus replication in these cells . 
Two groups of <START:ana> U937 promonocytic cells <END> were obtained by limiting dilution cloning which differed strikingly in their ability to support human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication . 
<START:ana> `` Plus '' clones <END> replicated the virus efficiently , whereas <START:ana> `` minus '' clones <END> did not . 
We examined these clones for differences in <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> activity which might account for the observed phenomenon . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> plus clones <END> liberated the classical <START:ggp> p50-p65 complex <END> from cytoplasmic pools , whereas <START:ana> minus clones <END> produced an apparently novel , <START:ggp> faster-migrating complex <END> , as judged by electrophoretic mobility shift assays . 
It is surprising that the <START:ggp> faster-migrating complex <END> was composed also of <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 <END> . 
However , the <START:ggp> p65 subunit <END> was COOH-terminally truncated , as shown by immunoprecipitation . 
The truncation resulted from limited proteolysis of <START:ggp> p65 <END> during cellular extraction which released particular <START:ggp> lysosomal serine proteases <END> , such as <START:ggp> elastase <END> , <START:ggp> cathepsin G <END> , and <START:ggp> proteinase 3 <END> . 
These specific proteases are coordinately expressed and were present exclusively in the <START:ana> minus U937 clones <END> , but not in the <START:ana> plus clones <END> , as demonstrated in the case of <START:ggp> cathepsin G <END> . 
In addition , these proteases were detected in certain subclones of <START:ana> THP-1 <END> and <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> and in primary <START:ana> monocytes <END> , in each case correlating with the truncated from of <START:ggp> p65 <END> . 
We demonstrate in vitro cleavage of <START:ggp> p65 <END> by purified <START:ggp> elastase <END> and <START:ggp> cathepsin G <END> . 
It is possible that particular <START:ggp> serine proteases <END> may have inhibiting effects on the replication of HIV-1 in <START:ana> myelo-monocytic cells <END> . 
The data also demonstrate that special precautions must be taken when making extracts from <START:ana> myelo-monocytic cells <END> . 
A <START:ggp> germline TaqI restriction fragment length polymorphism <END> in the <START:ggp> progesterone receptor gene <END> in ovarian carcinoma [ see comments ] 
Clinical outcome in ovarian carcinoma is predicted by <START:ggp> progesterone receptor <END> status , indicating an endocrine aspect to this disease . 
<START:ggp> Peripheral leucocyte genomic DNAs <END> were obtained from 41 patients with primary ovarian carcinoma and 83 controls from Ireland , as well as from 26 primary ovarian carcinoma patients and 101 controls in Germany . 
Southern analysis using a <START:ggp> human progesterone receptor ( hPR ) cDNA probe <END> identified a <START:ggp> germline TaqI restriction fragment length polymorphism <END> ( <START:ggp> RFLP <END> ) defined by two alleles : <START:ggp> T1 <END> , represented by a <START:ggp> 2.7 kb fragment <END> ; and <START:ggp> T2 <END> , represented by a <START:ggp> 1.9 kb fragment <END> and characterised by an additional <START:ggp> TaqI restriction site <END> with respect to <START:ggp> T1 <END> . 
An over-representation of <START:ggp> T2 <END> in ovarian cancer patients compared with controls in the pooled Irish/German population ( P < 0.025 ) was observed . 
A difference ( P < 0.02 ) in the distribution of the <START:ggp> RFLP <END> genotypes between Irish and German control populations was also observed . 
The allele distributions could not be shown to differ significantly from Hardy-Weinberg distribution in any subgroup . 
Using <START:ggp> hPR cDNA region-specific probes <END> , the extra TaqI restriction site was mapped to <START:ggp> intron G <END> of the <START:ggp> hPR gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> OBF-1 <END> , a <START:ggp> novel B cell-specific coactivator <END> that stimulates <START:ggp> immunoglobulin promoter <END> activity through association with <START:ggp> octamer-binding proteins <END> . 
Recent biochemical and genetic studies indicate that in addition to the <START:ggp> octamer-binding proteins <END> <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , other <START:ggp> B cell components <END> are required for lymphoid-restricted , octamer site-mediated <START:ggp> immunoglobulin gene promoter <END> activity . 
Using a genetic screen in yeast , we have isolated <START:ggp> B cell-derived cDNAs <END> encoding <START:ggp> Oct-binding factor 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> OBF-1 <END> ) , a novel protein that specifically associates with <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> . 
Biochemical studies demonstrate that <START:ggp> OBF-1 <END> has no intrinsic DNA-binding activity and recognizes the <START:ggp> POU domains <END> of <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , but not those of <START:ggp> Oct-4 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-6 <END> . 
The <START:ana> OBF-1 mRNA <END> is expressed in a highly cell-specific manner , being most abundant in <START:ana> B cells <END> and essentially absent in most of the other cells or tissues tested . 
Furthermore , expression of <START:ggp> OBF-1 <END> in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> selectively stimulates the activity of a natural <START:ggp> immunoglobulin promoter <END> in an <START:ggp> octamer site <END> -dependent manner . 
Thus , <START:ggp> OBF-1 <END> has all the properties expected for a <START:ggp> B cell-specific transcriptional coactivator protein <END> . 
Modulation of <START:ggp> transcription factor NF kappa B <END> activity by intracellular glutathione levels and by variations of the extracellular cysteine supply . 
HIV-infected individuals and SIV-infected rhesus macaques have , on the average , decreased plasma cysteine and cystine concentrations and decreased intracellular glutathione levels . 
We now show that a depletion of intracellular glutathione in a <START:ana> human T cell line <END> ( <START:ana> Molt-4 <END> ) inhibits the activation and nuclear translocation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor NF kappa B <END> , whereas incubation with increasing extracellular concentrations of cysteine inhibits the DNA-binding and transactivating activity of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> . 
Because inhibition of DNA-binding activity is associated with increasing intracellular glutathione disulfide levels and <START:ggp> GSSG <END> can be shown to inhibit the DNA-binding activity directly in cell-free systems , our studies suggest that <START:ggp> GSSG <END> is a physiologically relevant inhibitor in <START:ana> intact cells <END> also . 
<START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> controls many <START:ggp> immunologically important genes <END> , so our studies suggest that the immune system may be sensitive not only against a cysteine and glutathione deficiency but also against an excess of cysteine . 
Two distinct signalling pathways are involved in the control of the biphasic <START:ggp> junB <END> transcription induced by <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> in the <START:ana> B cell hybridoma 7TD1 <END> . 
We have measured the level of <START:ana> junB mRNA <END> in the <START:ana> B hybridoma cell line 7TD1 <END> , under <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ) stimulation . 
<START:ggp> IL-6 <END> increases <START:ana> junB mRNA <END> in a biphasic fashion . 
The first early-induced peak was transient and likely corresponds to the well documented typical <START:ana> junB mRNA <END> , stimulated in response to numerous <START:ggp> growth factors <END> , including <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> . 
At variance , the second peak which has never been reported previously , lasted several hours . 
As a consequence of its effect on <START:ana> junB mRNA <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> stimulated , in a biphasic fashion , the nuclear accumulation of the <START:ggp> JunB protein <END> . 
In this study , we demonstrated that <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> regulation occurred exclusively at the transcriptional level and that the bimodal increase of <START:ana> junB mRNA <END> and <START:ggp> JunB protein <END> can be accounted for by a biphasic stimulation of <START:ggp> junB <END> transcription . 
Furthermore , our data point to two major differences between the mechanism of control of the early and the late <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> -induced <START:ggp> junB <END> transcription waves . 
First , cycloheximide strongly potentiated the transcription of the second wave , whereas it failed to affect the early-induced burst . 
Second , tyrphostin , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , impaired the expression of the first but not the second <START:ana> junB mRNA <END> peak . 
Conversely , genistein , another tyrosine kinase inhibitor , totally abolished the expression of the second peak of <START:ana> junB mRNA <END> whereas it did not affect the expression of the first peak . 
Altogether these data indicate that , in <START:ana> 7TD1 cells <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> controls <START:ggp> junB <END> transcription in a biphasic fashion by means of two separate transduction pathways . 
A newly established <START:ana> megakaryoblastic/erythroid cell line <END> that differentiates to <START:ana> red cells <END> in the presence of <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> and produces <START:ana> platelet-like particles <END> . 
In August , 1992 , we established a <START:ana> leukemic cell line <END> ( <START:ana> NS-Meg <END> ) from a patient in megakaryoblastic transformation of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia . 
The <START:ana> NS-Meg cells <END> were positive for <START:ggp> alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase <END> and periodic acid-Schiff ( PAS ) staining and for surface <START:ggp> CD4 <END> , <START:ggp> CD7 <END> , <START:ggp> CD13 <END> , <START:ggp> CD34 <END> , <START:ggp> CD41a <END> , and <START:ggp> glycophorin A antigens <END> . 
Ultrastructurally , the cells had alpha-granules , demarcation membranes , and <START:ggp> platelet peroxidase <END> activity . 
The <START:ana> NS-Meg cells <END> spontaneously produced <START:ana> platelet-like particles <END> which contained alpha-granules , mitochondria and dense bodies , strongly suggesting platelet production . 
<START:ggp> Erythropoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> Epo <END> ) , <START:ggp> granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) , and <START:ggp> interleukin 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> ) promoted the growth of <START:ana> NS-Meg cells <END> . 
Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate increased the expression of both <START:ggp> CD41a <END> and CD61 antigens . 
Ten-day exposure to <START:ggp> Epo <END> induced <START:ana> mature erythroblasts <END> and <START:ana> red cells <END> . 
These <START:ana> benzidine-positive cells <END> were positive for <START:ggp> hemoglobin <END> F staining . 
Untreated <START:ana> NS-Meg cells <END> expressed <START:ana> mRNA <END> for the <START:ggp> Epo receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> EpoR <END> ) , for <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , and for <START:ggp> alpha 1 , alpha 2 and gamma globin genes <END> . 
These results indicate that <START:ana> NS-Meg cells <END> undergo terminal differentiation of both <START:ana> megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages <END> . 
This <START:ana> cell line <END> should be a very useful tool for the investigation of both megakaryocytic and erythroid maturation . 
Differential regulation of <START:ggp> proto-oncogenes <END> <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and <START:ggp> c-fos <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> activated through <START:ggp> CD28 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> T cell surface molecule <END> <START:ggp> CD28 <END> binds to ligands on <START:ana> accessory cells <END> and <START:ana> APCs <END> , playing an important costimulatory role in the response of <START:ana> T cells <END> to <START:ggp> Ags <END> . 
Our knowledge of the intracellular signaling pathways coupled to this receptor is incomplete . 
In addition to activation of <START:ggp> phospholipase C gamma 1 <END> , ligation of this receptor also seems to activate a calcium-independent , <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -specific pathway . 
In this paper , we report that cross-linking of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> ( but not <START:ggp> CD2 <END> , <START:ggp> CD5 <END> , <START:ggp> LFA-1 <END> , or <START:ggp> CD7 <END> ) leads to an elevation of <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> , with only minimal activation of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression . 
<START:ggp> CD28 <END> -dependent induction of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression requires <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase <END> activity , but does not depend on activation of a <START:ggp> phorbol ester-responsive protein kinase C <END> or elevation of cytosolic calcium . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -dependent elevation of <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> does not appear to be mediated at the level of mRNA stability . 
A mechanism is suggested whereby expression of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and <START:ggp> junB <END> , in the absence of members of the <START:ggp> fos family <END> , can prevent inappropriate activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> caused by ligation of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> in the absence of a specific antigenic stimulus . 
Enhanced responsiveness to <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> contributes to the unique phenotype of simian immunodeficiency virus variant SIVsmmPBj14 . 
Infection with a variant of simian immunodeficiency virus , SIVsmmPBj14 , leads to severe acute disease in macaques . 
This study was designed to investigate the functional significance of previously described mutations in the <START:ggp> viral long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) and to elucidate their contribution to the unique phenotype of SIVsmmPBj14 . 
<START:ggp> LTR <END> -directed transcription was measured by using <START:ggp> luciferase reporter constructs <END> that were transiently transfected into <START:ana> cultured cells <END> . 
In a wide range of cell types , the basal transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> LTR <END> from SIVsmmPBj14 was found to be 2- to 4.5-fold higher than that of an <START:ggp> LTR <END> from a non-acutely pathogenic strain . 
These <START:ggp> LTRs <END> differ by five point mutations and a <START:ggp> 22-bp duplication <END> in SIVsmmPBj14 , which includes a <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) site <END> . 
Transcriptional differences between these <START:ggp> LTRs <END> were further enhanced by two- to threefold upon treatment of cells with phorbol ester or <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> or by cotransfection with <START:ggp> plasmids <END> expressing <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> subunits . 
Mutagenesis studies , and the use of a reporter construct containing an enhancerless promoter , indicate that these transcriptional effects are due principally to the <START:ggp> 22-bp sequence duplication <END> and the <START:ggp> NF kappa B site <END> contained within it . 
Finally , infectious virus stocks that were isogenic except for the <START:ggp> LTR <END> were generated . 
The <START:ggp> LTR <END> from SIVsmmPBj14 was found to confer an increase in the kinetics of virus replication in <START:ana> cultured cells <END> . 
Inclusion of this <START:ggp> LTR <END> in recombinant SIVs also resulted in a two- to threefold rise in the extent of cellular proliferation that was induced in <START:ana> quiescent simian peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that <START:ggp> LTR <END> mutations assist SIVsmmPBj14 in responding efficiently to cellular stimulation and allow it to replicate to high titers during the acute phase of viral infection . 
Constitutive <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kappa B <END> in cells of the monocyte lineage . 
In <START:ana> monocytes <END> , the <START:ggp> nuclear factor NF-kappa B <END> has been invoked as an important <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> in the expression of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> , of <START:ggp> cell-surface receptors <END> and in the expression of human immunodeficiency virus . 
In such cells , DNA binding activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> can be detected without intentional stimulation . 
In our studies , cells of the <START:ana> human monocytic line <END> <START:ana> Mono Mac 6 <END> , cultured in medium containing fetal-calf serum and low levels of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , also exhibit such 'constitutive ' <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , as demonstrated by mobility-shift analysis of nuclear extracts . 
This <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kappa B <END> was still present when contaminant LPS was removed by ultrafiltration and when serum was omitted . 
Protein-DNA complexes of constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> are similar in mobility to the <START:ggp> LPS-induced NF-kappa B <END> and both are recognized by an antibody specific to the <START:ggp> p50 subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
By contrast , treatment of cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) will only block <START:ggp> LPS-induced NF-kappa B <END> , but not the <START:ggp> constitutive binding protein <END> . 
Using LPS-free and serum-free conditions , constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> can be detected in different <START:ana> cell lines <END> of the <START:ana> monocytic lineage <END> ( <START:ana> HL60 <END> , <START:ana> U937 <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 <END> , <START:ana> Mono Mac 1 <END> and <START:ana> Mono Mac 6 <END> ) , but not in <START:ana> Molt 4 T cells <END> or <START:ana> K562 stem cells <END> . 
When ordered according to stage of maturation , the amount of constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was not increased in more <START:ana> mature cell lines <END> . 
Furthermore , when inducing differentiation in <START:ana> Mono Mac 6 cells <END> , with vitamin D3 , no change in constitutive or inducible <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> can be detected . 
Analysis of primary cells revealed substantial constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -binding activity in <START:ana> blood monocytes <END> , <START:ana> pleural macrophages <END> and <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> . 
The constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> appears to be functionally active , since a low level of <START:ana> tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) transcript <END> is detectable in <START:ana> monocytes <END> , and this level can be increased by blocking transcript degradation using cycloheximide . 
The level of constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in these cells is variable and is frequently found to be lower in the more <START:ana> mature macrophages <END> . 
Constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was not maintained by autocrine action of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> <START:ggp> TNF <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin 6 <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin <END> 10 , <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> or <START:ggp> macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> , since neutralizing antibodies did not reduce constitutive DNA-binding activity . 
Furthermore , blockade of prostaglandin or leukotriene biosynthesis did not affect constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS ) 
<START:ggp> Steel factor <END> affects <START:ggp> SCL <END> expression during normal erythroid differentiation . 
<START:ggp> Steel factor <END> is one of the <START:ggp> growth factors <END> that controls the proliferation and differentiation of <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> and <START:ggp> SCL <END> , also known as <START:ggp> Tcl-5 <END> or <START:ggp> Tal-1 <END> , is a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> involved in erythropoiesis . 
In this report , we studied the role of SCL in the proliferation of <START:ana> human peripheral blood burst-forming unit-erythroid <END> ( <START:ana> BFU-E <END> ) and the effects of <START:ggp> Steel factor <END> on <START:ggp> SCL <END> expression in <START:ana> proliferating erythroid cells <END> . 
<START:ana> BFU-E-derived colonies <END> increase progressively in size , as determined by cell number , from day 7 to day 14 of culture , with the greatest increase in colony size ( 10-fold expansion ) occurring between day 7 and day 10 . 
<START:ggp> SCL protein <END> levels in <START:ana> BFU-E-derived cells <END> were highest in day 7 cells and decreased progressively from day 7 to day 14 of culture , suggesting an association of <START:ggp> SCL <END> with erythroid proliferation . 
In contrast , <START:ana> SCL mRNA <END> levels did not decrease significantly between day 7 and day 14 cells , suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms are largely responsible for the decrease in <START:ggp> SCL protein <END> observed . 
The role of <START:ggp> SCL <END> in <START:ggp> Steel factor <END> -induced erythroid proliferation was then examined . 
In <START:ana> BFU-E-derived colonies <END> cultured with <START:ggp> Steel factor <END> , colony size was significantly increased compared to control . 
In day 7 and day 10 <START:ana> erythroid precursors <END> cultured with <START:ggp> Steel factor <END> , <START:ggp> SCL protein <END> was increased significantly compared to control . 
The increase in <START:ggp> SCL <END> protein levels in early <START:ana> erythroid precursors <END> stimulated with <START:ggp> Steel factor <END> suggests one mechanism through which <START:ggp> Steel factor <END> may enhance normal erythroid proliferation . 
<START:ana> SCL mRNA <END> levels assessed by Northern blot in day 7 cells did not increase significantly in response to <START:ggp> Steel factor <END> stimulation , suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms may also be important in the increase in <START:ggp> SCL protein <END> observed in response to <START:ggp> Steel <END> . 
<START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> regulation of the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha gene <END> . 
<START:ana> Activated macrophages <END> contribute to chronic inflammation by the secretion of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> proteinases <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> ) is particularly important in this process because of its ability to regulate other inflammatory mediators in an autocrine and paracrine fashion . 
The mechanism ( s ) responsible for the cell type-specific regulation of <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> is not known . 
We present data to show that the expression of <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> is regulated by the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> activated the <START:ggp> TNF alpha gene promoter <END> in cotransfection assays and bound to it at a site which failed to bind the closely related protein <START:ggp> C/EBP alpha <END> . 
Finally , a dominant-negative version of <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> blocked <START:ggp> TNF alpha promoter <END> activation in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> . 
Our results implicate <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> as an important regulator of <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> by <START:ana> myelomonocytic cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II <END> downregulates both calcineurin and protein kinase C-mediated pathways for <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> transcription in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
Engagement of the <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> for antigen activates <START:ggp> phospholipase C <END> resulting in an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ( [ Ca2+ ] i ) and activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) . 
Increased [ Ca2+ ] i activates <START:ggp> Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases <END> including the multifunctional <START:ggp> Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II <END> ( <START:ggp> CaM-K II <END> ) , as well as <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , a <START:ggp> type 2B protein phosphatase <END> . 
Recent studies have identified <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> as a key enzyme for interleukin ( IL ) -2 and IL-4 promoter activation . 
However , the role of <START:ggp> CaM-K II <END> remains unknown . 
We have used mutants of these <START:ggp> kinases <END> and <START:ggp> phosphatases <END> ( <START:ggp> gamma B*CaM-K <END> and <START:ggp> delta CaM-AI <END> , respectively ) to explore their relative role in <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> transcription and their interactions with <START:ggp> PKC <END> -dependent signaling systems . 
<START:ggp> gamma B*CaM-K <END> and <START:ggp> delta CaM-AI <END> , known to exhibit constitutive Ca ( 2+ ) -independent activity , were cotransfected ( alone or in combination ) in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> with a plasmid containing the intact <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> driving the expression of the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene <END> . 
Cotransfection of <START:ggp> gamma B*CaM-K <END> with the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter construct <END> downregulated its transcription in response to stimulation with ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) . 
The inhibitory effect of <START:ggp> CaM-K II <END> on <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> was associated with decreased transcription of its AP-1 and NF-AT transactivating pathways . 
Under the same conditions , <START:ggp> delta CaM-AI <END> superinduced <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activity ( approximately twofold increase ) . 
When both mutants were used in combination , <START:ggp> gamma B*CaM-K <END> inhibited the induction of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> by <START:ggp> delta CaM-AI <END> . 
Similar results were obtained when a construct containing the <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter <END> also was used . 
<START:ggp> gamma B*CaM-K <END> also downregulated the activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> in response to transfection with a constitutively active mutant of <START:ggp> PKC <END> or stimulation with PMA . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> CaM-K II <END> may exert negative influences on <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> transcription in <START:ana> human T cells <END> , and provide preliminary evidence for negative cross-talk with the calcineurin- and PKC- dependent signaling systems . 
Induction of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> LFA-3 <END> by <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 and mechanism of down-regulation of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> or <START:ggp> LFA-1 <END> in <START:ana> adult-T-cell-leukemia cell lines <END> . 
The present study was undertaken to determine the role of <START:ggp> HTLV-I TaxI <END> in the up-regulation of <START:ggp> ICAM-I <END> and <START:ggp> LFA-3 <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> transformed with HTLV-I and the mechanism of down-regulation of <START:ggp> ICAM-I <END> and <START:ggp> LFA-I <END> in <START:ana> ATL-derived cell lines <END> . 
Induction of <START:ggp> TaxI <END> in a <START:ana> human T-cell line Jurkat <END> carrying the <START:ggp> TaxI gene <END> under the <START:ggp> metallothionein promoter <END> led to increases in <START:ana> mRNA <END> and surface expression of <START:ggp> ICAM-I <END> . 
The response of <START:ggp> LFA-3 <END> to <START:ggp> TaxI <END> induction was , on the other hand , relatively slow and weak , and might be indirect . 
Transactivation of the <START:ggp> ICAM-I promoter <END> by <START:ggp> TaxI <END> was further shown by co-transfection of a <START:ggp> CAT reporter construct <END> with the <START:ggp> ICAM-I promoter <END> and a <START:ggp> plasmid <END> expressing <START:ggp> TaxI <END> . 
The mechanism of down-regulation of <START:ggp> ICAM-I <END> or <START:ggp> LFA-I <END> in <START:ana> 4 ATL cell lines <END> was next examined . 
<START:ana> ICAM-I mRNA <END> was quite low in <START:ana> MT-I <END> , but no genomic changes were found . 
The <START:ggp> CAT reporter <END> with the <START:ggp> ICAM-I promoter <END> was inactive in <START:ana> MT-I <END> . 
Finally , combined treatment of <START:ana> MT-I <END> with 5-azacytidine and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induced re-expression of <START:ggp> ICAM-I <END> . 
Collectively , ( a ) <START:ggp> transcriptional factor <END> ( s ) necessary for expression of <START:ggp> ICAM-I gene <END> may be repressed in <START:ana> MT-I <END> through DNA methylation . 
Three other <START:ana> ATL cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> TL-OmI <END> , <START:ana> H582 <END> , <START:ana> HuT102 <END> ) were found to have little <START:ana> mRNA <END> for the <START:ggp> LFA-I beta chain <END> ( <START:ggp> CD18 <END> ) . 
<START:ana> H582 <END> and <START:ana> HuT102 <END> were also negative for the <START:ana> LFA-I alpha chain ( CDIIa ) mRNA <END> . 
No genomic changes were found , and a <START:ggp> CAT reporter gene <END> with the <START:ggp> CD18 promoter <END> was inactive in the 3 of them , again suggesting lack of ( a ) <START:ggp> transcriptional factor <END> ( s ) necessary for <START:ggp> CD18 <END> expression . 
Infection with Theileria annulata induces expression of <START:ggp> matrix metalloproteinase 9 <END> and <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> in <START:ana> bovine leucocytes <END> . 
Theileria annulata infects <START:ana> bovine leucocytes <END> and results in their reversible transformation such that they become immortalised and metastatic . 
The present study describes parasite-induced changes in <START:ggp> host cell gene <END> expression which have a direct bearing on this transformation process . 
<START:ana> T. annulata-infected leucocytes <END> produce a number of novel <START:ggp> metalloproteinase <END> activities . 
One of these , previously called <START:ggp> B1 <END> , is a <START:ggp> 97-kDa protein <END> which is secreted in large amounts and has been purified from protein-free , conditioned medium . 
An antiserum to this enzyme was used to isolate a <START:ggp> cDNA clone <END> . 
The predicted protein sequence of <START:ggp> B1 <END> is 81 % identical to human <START:ggp> matrix metalloproteinase 9 <END> ( <START:ggp> MMP9 <END> ) , demonstrating that it is the bovine homologue of this enzyme . 
<START:ggp> RNAase <END> protection assays demonstrated that the <START:ggp> MMP9 <END> activity , unique to <START:ana> infected cells <END> , is due to increased <START:ggp> MMP9 <END> mRNA levels . 
We also assayed the levels of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and demonstrated that it was constitutively present in increased amounts in <START:ana> Theileria-infected cells <END> . 
In addition we assayed the level of <START:ana> mRNA <END> encoding <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , a common component of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and observed that it was indeed up-regulated in <START:ana> infected cells <END> . 
Since <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> is implicated in the control of the cell cycle , and <START:ggp> MMP9 <END> can confer metastatic properties , these results are of considerable significance with respect to the transformed phenotype induced by Theileria infection . 
<START:ana> B-cell <END> proliferation and induction of early <START:ggp> G1-regulating proteins <END> by Epstein-Barr virus mutants conditional for <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> . 
Infection of <START:ana> primary B-lymphocytes <END> by Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) leads to growth transformation of these <START:ana> B-cells <END> in vitro . 
EBV nuclear antigen 2 ( <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> ) , one of the first genes expressed after EBV infection of <START:ana> B-cells <END> , is a transcriptional activator of <START:ggp> viral and cellular genes <END> and is essential for the transforming potential of the virus . 
We generated conditional EBV mutants by expressing <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> as <START:ggp> chimeric fusion protein <END> with the hormone binding domain of the <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> on the genetic background of the virus . 
Growth transformation of <START:ana> primary normal B-cells <END> by mutant virus resulted in <START:ana> estrogen-dependent lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> expressing the chimeric <START:ggp> EBNA2 protein <END> . 
In the absence of estrogen about half of the cells enter a quiescent non-proliferative state whereas the others die by apoptosis . 
<START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> is thus required not only for initiation but also for maintenance of transformation . 
Growth arrest occurred at G1 and G2 stages of the cell cycle , indicating that functional <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> is required at different restriction points of the cell cycle . 
Growth arrest is reversible for <START:ana> G1/G0 cells <END> as indicated by the sequential accumulation and modification of <START:ggp> cell cycle regulating proteins <END> . 
EBV induces the same cell cycle regulating proteins as polyclonal stimuli in primary <START:ana> B-cells <END> . 
These data suggest that EBV is using a common pathway for B-cell activation bypassing the requirement for antigen , T-cell signals and <START:ggp> growth factors <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-1 receptor <END> and <START:ggp> TCR <END> signals synergize to activate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -mediated gene transcription . 
Previous studies have demonstrated that <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1R <END> ) - and <START:ggp> TCR <END> -initiated signals can interact synergistically to increase the rate of transcription of several <START:ggp> lymphokine and lymphokine receptor genes <END> during the competence phase of the activation program in <START:ana> T helper lymphocytes <END> . 
In this report we describe how signals initiated through the <START:ggp> type I IL-1R <END> interact with signals from the antigen receptor to synergistically augment the transactivating properties of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
The synergistic <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> initiated signals are mediated through <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> because they can be mimicked by the phorbol ester , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , but not with calcium ionophores ; and are staurosporine sensitive but cyclosporine resistant . 
Gel shift analyses demonstrate that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> nuclear translocation is stimulated primarily by <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> rather than by <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> signals . 
Western blot and phosphorylation analyses demonstrate that the synergistic effect on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> functional activity is independent of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> MAD3 <END> ) - <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> dissociation in the cytosol and is not associated with <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> nuclear translocation . 
The <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA nuclear localization is transient and can be prolonged either by an antigen receptor-initiated signal or by inhibiting protein synthesis . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> induces both <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> nuclear translocation and the synthesis of a protein ( s ) responsible for terminating <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -DNA interaction in the nucleus . 
Antigen receptor signals prolong <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -DNA interaction , probably by functionally antagonizing the <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -induced synthesis of a protein ( s ) responsible for the transient <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -DNA interaction and consequently synergistically enhance <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -dependent gene transcription . 
Identification of the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> of chicken anemia virus ( CAV ) containing a novel <START:ggp> enhancer-like element <END> . 
The single <START:ggp> promoter region <END> in the cloned genome [ Noteborn et al. , J. Virol. 65 ( 1991 ) 3131-3139 ] of chicken anemia virus ( CAV ) in <START:ana> chicken T-cells <END> was analysed via <START:ggp> CAT <END> assays . 
A unique region containing four or five near-perfect direct repeats ( DR ) of 21 bp with one <START:ggp> 12-bp insert <END> was proven to be the main <START:ggp> transcription-activation element <END> , with enhancer-like characteristics . 
PCR studies revealed that CAV isolates from across the world all contained this <START:ggp> promoter sequence <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays ( EMSA ) showed that <START:ggp> individual DR units <END> , as well as the <START:ggp> 12-bp insert <END> , can bind to <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> of <START:ana> chicken T-cells <END> . 
Competition assays revealed that the <START:ggp> DR units <END> bound to factors other than the <START:ggp> 12-bp insert <END> . 
A synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing an <START:ggp> SP1-box <END> ( 5'-GGGCGG ) could compete with factors binding to the <START:ggp> 12-bp insert <END> . 
Purified <START:ggp> human SP1 <END> was shown to have very strong affinity for the <START:ggp> 12-bp insert <END> . 
Functional <START:ggp> Myc-Max heterodimer <END> is required for activation-induced apoptosis in <START:ana> T cell hybridomas <END> . 
<START:ana> T cell hybridomas <END> respond to activation signals by undergoing apoptotic cell death , and this is likely to represent comparable events related to tolerance induction in <START:ana> immature and mature T cells <END> in vivo . 
Previous studies using antisense oligonucleotides implicated the <START:ggp> c-Myc protein <END> in the phenomenon of activation-induced apoptosis . 
This role for <START:ggp> c-Myc <END> in apoptosis is now confirmed in studies using a dominant negative form of its heterodimeric binding partner , <START:ggp> Max <END> , which we show here inhibits activation-induced apoptosis . 
Further , coexpression of a <START:ggp> reciprocally mutant Myc protein <END> capable of forming functional <START:ggp> heterodimers <END> with the mutant <START:ggp> Max <END> can compensate for the dominant negative activity and restore activation-induced apoptosis . 
These results imply that <START:ggp> Myc <END> promotes activation-induced apoptosis by obligatory heterodimerization with <START:ggp> Max <END> , and therefore , by regulating gene transcription . 
<START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus SM protein <END> . 
The protein products of the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) BMLF1 open reading frame have been characterized in the early productive cycle in <START:ana> B95-8 <END> and <START:ana> Akata cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> SM protein <END> derived from the spliced RNA joining <START:ggp> BSLF2 <END> to <START:ggp> BMLF1 <END> is much the most abundant protein . 
<START:ggp> SM <END> is a <START:ggp> phosphoprotein <END> in EBV <START:ana> -infected cells <END> and can be phosphorylated in vitro with <START:ggp> casein kinase II <END> ( <START:ggp> CKII <END> ) . 
Computer analysis of the <START:ggp> SM protein <END> sequence showed a <START:ggp> C terminal section <END> of <START:ggp> SM <END> to be related to <START:ggp> genome positional homologues <END> of four other herpesviruses and revealed <START:ggp> consensus CKII sites <END> near the <START:ggp> N termini <END> of the <START:ggp> EBV SM protein <END> , the <START:ggp> herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) ICP27 protein <END> and the <START:ggp> herpesvirus saimiri ( HVS ) open reading frame 57 protein <END> . 
Site-directed mutagenesis of the <START:ggp> consensus CKII site <END> in EBV SM greatly reduced the in vitro phosphorylation of <START:ggp> SM <END> by <START:ggp> CKII <END> . 
The mechanism of transactivation by <START:ggp> BMLF1 proteins <END> has been controversial but <START:ggp> SM <END> was shown to transactivate gene expression from a <START:ggp> CAT reporter construct <END> by increasing the amount of <START:ana> cytoplasmic CAT mRNA <END> . 
Mutagenesis of the <START:ggp> CKII <END> site in <START:ggp> SM <END> made no difference to the transactivation in this transient transfection assay . 
Inducible binding to the c-fos serum response element during T cell activation is regulated by a <START:ggp> phosphotyrosine-containing protein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> proto-oncogene c-fos <END> is an <START:ggp> immediate-early gene <END> , and one of the first genes transcribed after stimulation of most cells with a variety of ligands . 
Fos expression may be a pivotal event in converting ligand-receptor interactions at the membrane into functional modulation of cell phenotype . 
The <START:ggp> serum response element <END> ( <START:ggp> SRE <END> ) in the <START:ggp> c-fos regulatory region <END> participates in induction of transcription by various <START:ggp> growth factors <END> and by phorbol esters and subsequent squelching of transcription . 
We show that an inducible <START:ggp> protein complex <END> ( <START:ggp> Band A <END> ) binds to <START:ggp> SRE DNA <END> within 10 min after mitogenic stimulation of <START:ana> human PBL-T <END> , and becomes nondetectable by 60 min . 
<START:ggp> Band A <END> contains the <START:ggp> serum response factor <END> plus additional factor ( s ) . 
A protein that is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue in <START:ana> resting PBL-T <END> suppresses binding of a component of <START:ggp> Band A <END> to the <START:ggp> SRE motif <END> . 
Upon stimulation of the cells , this protein no longer prevents binding of DNA by <START:ggp> Band A <END> , and suppression of binding is restored within 30 min . 
The phosphorylated tyrosine residue itself is important for the protein-protein interaction . 
In vivo modification of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex class II DRA promoter <END> occupancy mediated by the <START:ggp> AIR-1 trans-activator <END> . 
<START:ana> RJ 2.2.5 <END> is a <START:ana> human B cell mutant <END> derived from the <START:ana> Burkitt lymphoma Raji cell <END> which is defective in the AIR-1 locus function . 
This locus encodes a transcriptional trans-activator required for the constitutive expression of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes <END> . 
Here we show , by in vivo <START:ggp> DNase I <END> footprinting , that the <START:ggp> AIR-1 locus defect <END> correlates with changes in the <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> occupancy . 
Interestingly , reexpression of <START:ggp> human MHC class II genes <END> in <START:ana> RJ 2.2.5 x mouse spleen cell hybrids <END> is associated with partial reversion of <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> occupancy to the Raji pattern . 
<START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> occupancy in other <START:ana> class II-negative B cell lines <END> , derived from patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome , is drastically different from the one observed in <START:ana> RJ 2.2.5 <END> and <START:ana> Raji cells <END> . 
Moreover , the use of the <START:ggp> DNase I <END> as an in vivo footprinting agent reveals that the <START:ana> patients ' cell lines <END> do not display a completely `` <START:ggp> bare promoter <END> `` as previously reported using dimethyl sulfate as the footprinting agent . 
Thus , the use of <START:ggp> DNase I <END> allowed us , for the first time , to correlate the <START:ggp> AIR-1 locus defect <END> with <START:ggp> class II promoter <END> occupancy alterations and distinguish these alterations from the ones observed in phenotypically similar but genetically distinct <START:ana> MHC class II-negative cells <END> . 
Regulation of cell-type-specific <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain <END> gene expression : potential role of physical interactions between <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> , <START:ggp> HMG-I ( Y ) <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B family proteins <END> . 
The <START:ggp> interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain ( IL-2R alpha ) gene <END> is rapidly and potently induced in <START:ana> T cells <END> in response to mitogenic stimuli . 
Previously , an <START:ggp> inducible enhancer <END> between <START:ggp> nucleotides -299 and -228 <END> that contains <START:ggp> NF-kappa B and CArG motifs <END> was identified . 
We now report the characterization of a second <START:ggp> essential positive regulatory element <END> located between <START:ggp> nucleotides -137 and -64 <END> that binds <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> and <START:ggp> HMG-I ( Y ) <END> . 
This element had maximal activity in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> , paralleling the cell type specificity of <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> expression . 
Transcription from the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha promoter <END> was inhibited when either the <START:ggp> Elf-1 or the HMG-I ( Y ) binding site <END> was mutated . 
Coexpression of both proteins activated transcription of the <START:ggp> -137 to -64 element <END> in <START:ana> COS-7 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> physically associated with <START:ggp> HMG-I <END> and with <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> in vitro , suggesting that protein-protein interactions might functionally coordinate the actions of the <START:ggp> upstream and downstream positive regulatory elements <END> . 
This is the first report of a physical interaction between an Ets family member and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B family proteins <END> . 
These findings provide significant new insights into the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that regulate cell-type-specific and inducible <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> gene expression and also have implications for other genes regulated by <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B family proteins <END> . 
Isolation of <START:ggp> cDNA clones <END> for 42 different <START:ggp> Kruppel-related zinc finger proteins <END> expressed in the <START:ana> human monoblast cell line U-937 <END> . 
To study the complexity and structural characteristics of <START:ggp> zinc finger proteins <END> expressed during human hematopoiesis and to isolate novel regulators of blood cell development , a degenerate oligonucleotide probe specific for a <START:ggp> consensus zinc finger peptide domain <END> was used to isolate 63 <START:ggp> cDNA clones <END> for <START:ggp> Kruppel-related zinc finger genes <END> from the <START:ana> human monoblast cell line U-937 <END> . 
By extensive nucleotide sequence and Northern blot analysis , these <START:ggp> cDNA clones <END> were found to originate from approximately 42 different genes ( <START:ggp> HZF 1-42 <END> ) of which only 8 have previously been described . 
Northern blot analysis showed that a majority of these genes were expressed at comparable levels in <START:ana> U-937 <END> and <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
The large number of individual genes represented among the 63 clones and their apparent non-cell-type-specific expression suggest that the majority of the <START:ggp> Kruppel-related zinc finger genes <END> are likely to be expressed in most human tissues . 
In contrast , some of the genes displayed a restricted expression pattern , indicating that they represent potential regulators of monocyte differentiation or proliferation . 
Detailed structural analysis of the first 12 <START:ggp> cDNAs <END> ( <START:ggp> HZF 1-10 <END> ) and a partial characterization of <START:ggp> HZF 11-42 <END> revealed that a common feature of <START:ggp> human Kruppel-related zinc finger proteins <END> is the presence of tandem arrays of <START:ggp> zinc fingers <END> ranging in number from 3 to over 20 that are preferentially located in the <START:ggp> carboxy-terminal regions <END> of the proteins . 
In addition , several novel <START:ggp> KRAB-containing zinc finger genes <END> and a novel <START:ggp> conserved sequence element <END> were identified . 
CAG repeat length variation in <START:ana> sperm <END> from a patient with Kennedy 's disease . 
Using a modified <START:ana> sperm <END> typing protocol , the mutation frequency of the <START:ggp> CAG repeat region <END> at the <START:ggp> androgen receptor locus <END> has been measured using a rare semen sample from an individual with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) . 
Among 258 <START:ana> X chromosome-containing sperm <END> , 19 % had a repeat number equal to the <START:ggp> donor 's somatic DNA <END> ( 47 repeats ) , 66 % were expansions and 15 % were contractions . 
The average expansion was 2.7 repeats . 
More than half of the expansions involved one or two repeats ; the largest was 11 repeats . 
68 % of the contractions were also one or two repeats but six ( 16 % ) were very large ( 12-25 repeats ) . 
One contraction generated an allele in an intermediate size range ( 33-39 repeats ) . 
Such alleles have not been observed among more than 900 normal and <START:ggp> SBMA X-chromosomes <END> that have been examined . 
Comparison of the SBMA <START:ana> sperm <END> typing results with mutation frequency data on normal alleles supports the hypothesis that <START:ggp> trinucleotide repeat <END> expansions may have a different molecular origin than contractions . 
Aspirin-like drugs can protect <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> against benzoquinone cytotoxicity : evidence for a <START:ggp> NAD ( P ) H : quinone reductase <END> -dependent mechanism . 
Benzene toxicity towards <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> is thought to be mediated by metabolites of benzene including benzoquinone ( BQ ) . 
<START:ggp> NAD ( P ) H : quinone reductase <END> ( <START:ggp> QR <END> ) is known to protect against BQ toxicity . 
The expression of the <START:ggp> QR gene <END> is regulated by the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
We had previously found that aspirin-like drugs ( ALD ) induce <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> . 
It was therefore hypothesized that ALD would protect <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> against BQ toxicity by inducing <START:ggp> QR <END> . 
<START:ana> Molt-4 cells <END> ( <START:ana> M4 <END> ) , a <START:ana> human T lymphocyte cell line <END> , were incubated with different concentrations of two ALD , flurbiprofen and sodium diclofenac , and then exposed to BQ . 
Toxicity was measured by viability ( trypan blue exclusion ) . 
Both drugs protected the cells against BQ cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner , e.g. , sodium diclofenac at 15 microM reduced the fraction of BQ-treated dead cells by 70 % . 
ALDs induced <START:ggp> QR <END> activity in the M4 cells in the same range of concentrations that protected the cells against BQ toxicity . 
The protective effect of ALD was significantly reduced by dicoumarol , a <START:ggp> QR <END> -specific inhibitor . 
Since <START:ana> human T cells <END> and <START:ana> T cell lines <END> do not metabolize arachidonic acid , our data suggest that ALD can protect <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> against a metabolite of benzene by induction of <START:ggp> QR <END> activity . 
Correlation of differentiation-inducing activity of retinoids on <START:ana> human leukemia cell lines <END> <START:ana> HL-60 <END> and <START:ana> NB4 <END> . 
Retinoids , including all-trans-retinoic acid , its isomers , and fifty synthetic retinoids ( retinobenzoic acids ) , were tested for differentiation-inducing activity on <START:ana> human leukemia cell lines <END> <START:ana> HL-60 <END> and <START:ana> NB4 <END> . 
A good linear correlation , with an r value of 0.91 , between the ED50 values for the differentiation-inducing activity towards <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> and that towards <START:ana> NB4 cells <END> was found . 
<START:ggp> Platelet-activating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> PAF <END> ) positively auto-regulates the expression of <START:ggp> human PAF receptor transcript 1 <END> ( leukocyte-type ) through <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human platelet-activating factor receptor ( PAFR ) gene <END> is transcribed by two distinct <START:ggp> promoters <END> ( <START:ggp> promoter 1 <END> and <START:ggp> promoter 2 <END> ) to generate two transcripts ( designated as <START:ana> PAFR transcript 1 <END> and <START:ana> PAFR transcript 2 <END> ) , though their open reading frames are identical . 
By primer extension analysis to discriminate two transcripts , we found that the levels of <START:ana> PAFR transcript 1 <END> ( leukocyte-type ) , but not <START:ana> PAFR transcript 2 <END> ( tissue-type ) , are upregulated by <START:ggp> PAF <END> as well as by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) in the <START:ana> human stomach cancer cell line <END> ( <START:ana> JR-St cells <END> ) which expresses both functional <START:ana> PAFR transcript 1 <END> and <START:ana> PAFR transcript 2 <END> endogenously . 
Functional analysis of the <START:ggp> promoter 1 <END> with a transient expression assay using <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene <END> as a reporter showed that both <START:ggp> PAF <END> and TPA activated the <START:ggp> promoter 1 <END> but not the deleted promoter lacking the three <START:ggp> consensus binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> located from -571 bp to -459 bp . 
These findings suggest a molecular mechanism of positive regulation of <START:ggp> PAFR <END> gene expression by <START:ggp> PAF <END> through <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , possibly by a phosphorylation reaction involving <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> by <START:ggp> PAF <END> . 
One gene , two <START:ana> transcripts <END> : isolation of an alternative transcript encoding for the <START:ggp> autoantigen La/SS-B <END> from a <START:ggp> cDNA library <END> of a patient with primary Sjogrens ' syndrome . 
A <START:ggp> cDNA library <END> was prepared from peripheral blood <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> of an autoimmune patient with primary Sjogrens ' syndrome . 
The <START:ggp> cDNA library <END> was screened with the patients own autoimmune serum being monospecific for the <START:ggp> nuclear autoantigen La/SS-B <END> . 
Thereby an alternative type of <START:ana> La mRNA <END> was identified that differed from the known <START:ana> La mRNA <END> due to an exchange of the <START:ggp> exon 1 <END> . 
Sequencing of the genomic region between the <START:ggp> exons 1 and 2 <END> showed that the <START:ggp> alternative 5'-end <END> is a part of the <START:ggp> intron <END> . 
In addition , the presence of an <START:ggp> alternative promoter site <END> , which exists within the <START:ggp> intron <END> downstream of the <START:ggp> exon 1 <END> , became evident . 
In consequence , the <START:ana> alternative La mRNA <END> is the result of a promoter switching combined with an alternative splicing mechanism . 
In the intron , further <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> binding sites , including a <START:ggp> NF-kappa B element <END> , were identified leading to the suggestion that the expression of the gene encoding for the <START:ggp> nuclear autoantigen La/SS-B <END> alters in dependence on disease conditions . 
Cross-linking <START:ggp> CD40 <END> on <START:ana> B cells <END> rapidly activates <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> . 
The <START:ggp> B cell-associated surface molecule CD40 <END> functions to regulate B cell responses . 
Cross-linking <START:ggp> CD40 <END> on <START:ana> B cells <END> can lead to homotypic cell adhesion , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> production , and , in combination with <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , to Ig isotype switching . 
Tyrosine kinase activity is increased shortly after engagement of this receptor . 
Little is known about how the very early events induced by <START:ggp> CD40 <END> cross-linking link to cellular responses . 
In this study , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-like transcription factors <END> are activated after cross-linking <START:ggp> CD40 <END> on resting <START:ana> human tonsillar B cells <END> and on <START:ana> B cell lines <END> . 
The activation is rapid and is mediated through a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway . 
The complexes detected in electrophoretic mobility shift assays contain <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p65 <END> ( <START:ggp> RelA <END> ) , <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , and most likely other components . 
By using transient transfection assays , we found that cross-linking <START:ggp> CD40 <END> supports <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -dependent gene expression . 
Our results define the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> system as an intermediate event in <START:ggp> CD40 <END> signaling and suggest that the <START:ggp> CD40 <END> pathway can influence the expression of <START:ggp> B cell-associated genes <END> with <START:ggp> NF-kappa B consensus sites <END> . 
Protease inhibitors block lipopolysaccharide induction of tissue factor gene expression in <START:ana> human monocytic cells <END> by preventing activation of <START:ggp> c-Rel/p65 heterodimers <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tissue factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TF <END> ) is expressed rapidly by <START:ana> human monocytes <END> exposed to <START:ggp> bacterial endotoxin <END> ( lipopolysaccharide , or LPS ) . 
Transcriptional regulation is mediated by binding of <START:ggp> c-Rel/p65 heterodimers <END> to a <START:ggp> kappa B-like site <END> in the <START:ggp> TF promoter <END> . 
Nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> cytosolic c-Rel/p65 heterodimers <END> and other members of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel family <END> requires dissociation and proteolytic degradation of the <START:ggp> inhibitor protein <END> , <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
The protease inhibitors N alpha-tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone ( TPCK ) and N alpha-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone ( TLCK ) block activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel proteins <END> by preventing degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
To determine if TPCK and TLCK inhibited LPS induction of <START:ggp> TF <END> expression , freshly isolated <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> monocytic THP-1 cells <END> were pretreated with these inhibitors for 30 min before LPS stimulation . 
Both TPCK and TLCK inhibited LPS induction of <START:ggp> TF protein <END> , <START:ana> TF mRNA <END> and <START:ggp> TF <END> promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner . 
These inhibitors specifically prevented degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> c-Rel/p65 heterodimers <END> . 
In contrast , TPCK and TLCK did not block induction of an <START:ggp> immediate-early gene <END> encoding the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> . 
Taken together , these data indicated that inhibiting nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> c-Rel/p65 heterodimers <END> prevented LPS induction of <START:ggp> TF <END> gene transcription in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> 1 , 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> from patients with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism . 
A decreased number of <START:ggp> calcitriol ( 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) receptors <END> has been observed in parathyroid glands of uremic animals . 
In humans , studies carried out in surgically removed parathyroid glands have shown that calcitriol binding is higher in primary than in secondary hyperparathyroidism . 
Since specific receptors for calcitriol have been described in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) , we have investigated the specific uptake of 3H-labelled 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 in <START:ana> PBMC <END> of 12 women with primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHP ) , 8 women with hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal failure ( SH ) , 9 women with renal transplant ( RT ) , and 23 healthy women . 
The median dissociation constant ( Kd ) was similar in all three groups of patients and in healthy women ( mean +/- S.D. ( range ) : PHP , 1.2 +/- 1.0 ( 0.2-4 ) x 10 ( -10 ) M ; SH , 0.6 +/- 0.4 ( 0.2-1.2 ) x 10 ( -10 ) M ; RT , 1.1 +/- 0.5 ( 0.4-1.9 ) x 10 ( -10 ) M ; controls , 1.0 +/- 0.6 ( 0.3-2.6 ) x 10 ( -10 ) M ) . However , the maximal binding capacity ( Nmax ) was significantly enhanced in PHP ( 3.9 +/- 1.9 ( 1.3-7.6 ) fmol/10 ( 7 ) cells vs. 2.3 +/- 0.9 ( 1.1-4.4 ) fmol/10 ( 7 ) cells in controls ; P = 0.0006 ) and decreased in SH ( 0.8 +/- 0.5 ( 0.2-1.6 ) fmol/10 ( 7 ) cells vs. 2.3 +/- 0.9 ( 1.1-4.4 ) fmol/10 ( 7 ) cells in controls ; P = 0.0001 ) , whereas no changes were seen in RT ( 2.3 +/- 0.7 ( 1.2-3.3 ) fmol/10 ( 7 ) cells vs. 2.3 +/- 0.9 ( 1.1-4.4 ) fmol/10 ( 7 ) cells in controls ) . 
In three patients with PHP who were subjected to parathyroidectomy , the calcitriol number came down to normal . 
Changes of <START:ggp> calcitriol receptors <END> in primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism could magnify the consequences of disturbances in serum concentration of calcitriol itself and might play an important role in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in uremia . 
The severe phenotype of females with <START:ggp> tiny ring X chromosomes <END> is associated with inability of these <START:ggp> chromosomes <END> to undergo X inactivation . 
Mental retardation and a constellation of congenital malformations not usually associated with Turner syndrome are seen in some females with a mosaic 45 , X/46 , X , r ( X ) karyotype . 
Studies of these females show that the <START:ggp> XIST locus <END> on their <START:ggp> tiny ring X chromosomes <END> is either not present or not expressed . 
As <START:ggp> XIST <END> transcription is well correlated with inactivation of the <START:ggp> X chromosome <END> in <START:ana> female somatic cells <END> and <START:ana> spermatogonia <END> , nonexpression of the locus even when it is present suggests that these <START:ggp> chromosomes <END> are transcriptionally active . 
We examined the transcriptional activity of ring <START:ggp> X chromosomes <END> lacking <START:ggp> XIST <END> expression ( XISTE- ) , from three females with severe phenotypes . 
The two tiny ring <START:ggp> X chromosomes <END> studied with an <START:ggp> antibody <END> specific for the acetylated isoforms of <START:ggp> histone H4 <END> marking <START:ggp> transcribed chromatin domains <END> were labeled at a level consistent with their being active . 
We also examined tow of the <START:ggp> XISTE- ring chromosomes <END> to determine whether <START:ggp> genes <END> that are normally silent on an <START:ggp> inactive X <END> are expressed from these <START:ggp> chromosomes <END> . 
Analyses of <START:ana> hybrid cells <END> show that <START:ggp> TIMP <END> , <START:ggp> ZXDA <END> , and <START:ggp> ZXDB loci <END> on the <START:ggp> proximal short arm <END> , and <START:ggp> AR <END> and <START:ggp> PHKA1 loci <END> on the long arm , are well expressed from the <START:ggp> tiny ring X chromosome <END> lacking <START:ggp> XIST DNA <END> . 
Studies of the <START:ggp> ring chromosome <END> that has <START:ggp> XIST DNA <END> but does not transcribe it show that its AR allele is transcribed along with the one on the normal X allele . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Inhibition of activation of <START:ggp> transcription factor AP-1 <END> by <START:ggp> CD28 <END> signalling in <START:ana> human T-cells <END> . 
Co-stimulation of <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> by <START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TcR <END> ) occupancy and activation of the <START:ggp> CD28 surface molecule <END> results in enhanced proliferation and <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) production . 
The increase in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> gene expression triggered by <START:ggp> CD28 <END> involves a <START:ggp> kappa B-like sequence <END> in the <START:ggp> 5'-regulatory region <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> , called <START:ggp> CD28-responsive element <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> T-cells <END> by agonistic <START:ggp> anti-CD28 antibodies <END> in conjunction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) - or <START:ggp> TcR <END> -derived signals induces the enhanced activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Here we report that <START:ggp> CD28 <END> engagement , however , exerts opposite effects on the <START:ggp> transcription factor AP-1 <END> . 
Whereas <START:ggp> anti-CD28 <END> together with PMA increased the DNA binding and trans-activation activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , PMA-induced activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> was significantly suppressed . 
The inhibitory effect exerted by <START:ggp> anti-CD28 <END> was observed at the level of DNA binding as well as in functional reporter-gene assays . 
These results suggest that the two <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are independently regulated and may perform different functions during T-cell activation . 
<START:ggp> HIV-1 Nef <END> leads to inhibition or activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> depending on its intracellular localization . 
<START:ggp> Nef <END> of primate lentiviruses is required for viremia and progression to AIDS in monkeys . 
Negative , positive , and no effects of <START:ggp> Nef <END> have also been reported on viral replication in cells . 
To reconcile these observations , we expressed a <START:ggp> hybrid CD8-Nef protein <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
Two opposite phenotypes were found , which depended on the intracellular localization of <START:ggp> Nef <END> . 
Expressed in the cytoplasm or on the cell surface , the <START:ggp> chimera <END> inhibited or activated early signaling events from the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> . 
Activated <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> died by apoptosis , and only cells with mutated <START:ggp> nef genes <END> expressing truncated <START:ggp> Nefs <END> survived , which rendered <START:ggp> Nef <END> nonfunctional . 
These mutations paralleled those in other viral strains passaged in vitro . 
Not only do these positional effects of <START:ggp> Nef <END> reconcile diverse phenotypes of <START:ggp> Nef <END> and suggest a role for its N-terminal myristylation , but they also explain effects of <START:ggp> Nef <END> in HIV infection and progression to AIDS . 
An intricate arrangement of binding sites for the <START:ggp> Ets family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> regulates activity of the <START:ggp> alpha 4 integrin gene promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> alpha 4 integrins <END> mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions that are critical for maturation and function of the immune system as well as differentiation of skeletal muscle . 
Here we examine molecular mechanisms controlling the pattern of <START:ggp> alpha 4 <END> expression . 
The activity of constructs containing <START:ggp> 5 ' deletion mutants <END> of the <START:ggp> alpha 4 gene promoter <END> was compared in transfection assays into <START:ana> cell lines <END> that express <START:ggp> alpha 4 <END> and <START:ana> cell lines <END> that do not . 
The sequence between position <START:ggp> -42 and -76 base pairs <END> ( bp ) was required for efficient transcription in cells that express <START:ggp> alpha 4 <END> , but it showed no activity in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , which do not express <START:ggp> alpha 4 <END> . 
Three <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for the <START:ggp> Ets family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are found in this region : two adjacent sites at positions <START:ggp> -50 and -54 bp <END> and a more <START:ggp> 5 ' site <END> at position <START:ggp> -67 bp <END> . 
Using a series of constructs containing deletions and mutations in this region , we found that the <START:ggp> 3'-most site <END> alone was sufficient for binding <START:ggp> GA-binding protein alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> GABP alpha ) /GABP beta <END> and for a low level of transcriptional activation . 
When all three sites were present , a second complex `` a '' was detected , which contains an unknown member of the <START:ggp> Ets family <END> . 
Formation of complex a was cell-type specific and correlated with a high level of transcription . 
Deletion of the <START:ggp> 5'-most Ets site <END> had no effect on binding to <START:ggp> GABP alpha/GABP beta <END> , but it eliminated a . 
Concomitant with this loss of a , a <START:ggp> new Ets-1-containing complex <END> `` <START:ggp> c <END> `` appeared . 
Complex c substituted efficiently for complex a in transcriptional activation . 
We conclude that although neither of the two <START:ggp> 5'-most Ets sites <END> alone binds <START:ggp> nuclear protein <END> , they appear to act as modulators which control the pattern of <START:ggp> Ets proteins <END> that bind the <START:ggp> alpha 4 gene promoter <END> . 
This arrangement of <START:ggp> Ets sites <END> , coupled with the tissue- and developmental-specific expression of <START:ggp> Ets members <END> , likely play a key role in defining the pattern of <START:ggp> alpha 4 integrin <END> . 
Mechanism of antiandrogen action : conformational changes of the receptor . 
<START:ana> Androgen receptor mRNA <END> was translated in vitro , and <START:ggp> androgen- and antiandrogen-bound receptor complexes <END> were studied using limited proteolytic digestion by <START:ggp> trypsin <END> . 
Partial proteolysis of <START:ggp> androgen-bound receptor protein <END> resulted in a <START:ggp> 29-kDa proteolysis-resisting fragment <END> , whereas antiandrogen binding stabilised a <START:ggp> 35-kDa fragment <END> . 
Both fragments contain the entire <START:ggp> ligand binding domain <END> , and the <START:ggp> 35-kDa fragment <END> extended into the <START:ggp> hinge region <END> of the receptor . 
Several antiandrogens show agonistic properties for a <START:ggp> mutated androgen receptor <END> ( <START:ana> LNCaP cell variant <END> ) ; <START:ggp> trypsin <END> digestion of <START:ggp> antiandrogen-bound mutated receptor <END> also resulted in a <START:ggp> 29-kDa fragment <END> . 
Our results point to an important difference between antiandrogens and antagonists of other <START:ggp> steroid hormone receptors <END> . 
Antiandrogens result in protection of both the <START:ggp> hinge region <END> and <START:ggp> C-terminus <END> of the <START:ggp> androgen receptor <END> agonist proteolytic attack , whereas other studies showed that antiestrogens and antiprogestagens expose the <START:ggp> C-terminal end <END> of the <START:ggp> ligand binding domain <END> of their respective receptors to <START:ggp> protease <END> . 
Differences in conformation of the <START:ggp> hinge region <END> distinguish <START:ggp> androgen-bound <END> from <START:ggp> antiandrogen-bound receptor complexes <END> , which represents an important feature of antiandrogen action . 
Activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> in <START:ana> human neuroblastoma cell lines <END> . 
The <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) is a eukaryotic <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
In <START:ana> B cells <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> it is constitutively present in cell nuclei , whereas in many other cell types , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocates from cytosol to nucleus as a result of transduction by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> ) , phorbol ester , and other polyclonal signals . 
Using <START:ana> neuroblastoma cell lines <END> as models , we have shown that in <START:ana> neural cells <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was present in the cytosol and translocated into nuclei as a result of <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> treatment . 
The <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> -activated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was transcriptionally functional . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation by <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> was not correlated with cell differentiation or proliferation . 
However , reagents such as <START:ggp> nerve growth factor <END> ( <START:ggp> NGF <END> ) and the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , which induce phenotypical differentiation of the <START:ana> SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line <END> , activated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , but only in that particular <START:ana> cell line <END> . 
In a <START:ana> NGF-responsive rat pheochromocytoma cell line <END> , <START:ana> PC12 <END> , PMA activated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , whereas <START:ggp> NGF <END> did not . 
In other <START:ana> neuroblastoma cell lines <END> , such as <START:ana> SK-N-Be ( 2 ) <END> , the lack of PMA induction of differentiation was correlated with the lack of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
We found , moreover , that in <START:ana> SK-N-Be ( 2 ) cells <END> <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) enzymatic activity was much lower compared with that in a <START:ana> control cell line <END> and that the low <START:ggp> PKC <END> enzymatic activity was due to low <START:ggp> PKC <END> protein expression . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was not activated by retinoic acid , which induced morphological differentiation of all the <START:ana> neuroblastoma cell lines <END> used in the present study . 
Thus , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation was not required for <START:ana> neuroblastoma <END> cell differentiation . 
Furthermore , the results obtained with <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> proved that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation was not sufficient for induction of <START:ana> neuroblastoma <END> differentiation . 
<START:ggp> ERP <END> , a new member of the <START:ggp> ets transcription factor/oncoprotein family <END> : cloning , characterization , and differential expression during B-lymphocyte development . 
The <START:ggp> ets gene family <END> encodes a group of proteins which function as <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> under physiological conditions and , if aberrantly expressed , can cause cellular transformation . 
We have recently identified two regulatory elements in the <START:ggp> murine immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) enhancer <END> , <START:ggp> pi <END> and <START:ggp> microB <END> , which exhibit striking similarity to <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> ets-related proteins <END> . 
To identify <START:ggp> ets-related transcriptional regulators <END> expressed in <START:ana> pre-B lymphocytes <END> that may interact with either the <START:ggp> pi <END> or the <START:ggp> microB site <END> , we have used a PCR approach with degenerate oligonucleotides encoding conserved sequences in all members of the <START:ggp> ets family <END> . 
We have cloned the gene for a new <START:ggp> ets-related transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> ERP <END> ( <START:ggp> ets-related protein <END> ) , from the <START:ana> murine pre-B cell line <END> <START:ana> BASC 6C2 <END> and from mouse lung tissue . 
The <START:ggp> ERP <END> protein contains a region of high homology with the ETS DNA-binding domain common to all members of the <START:ggp> ets transcription factor/oncoprotein family <END> . 
Three additional smaller regions show homology to the ELK-1 and <START:ggp> SAP-1 <END> genes , a subgroup of the <START:ggp> ets gene family <END> that interacts with the <START:ggp> serum response factor <END> . 
Full-length <START:ggp> ERP <END> expresses only negligible DNA-binding activity by itself . 
Removal of the <START:ggp> carboxy terminus <END> enables <START:ggp> ERP <END> to interact with a variety of <START:ggp> ets-binding sites <END> including the <START:ggp> E74 site <END> , the <START:ggp> IgH enhancer pi site <END> , and the <START:ggp> lck promoter ets site <END> , suggesting a <START:ggp> carboxy-terminal negative regulatory domain <END> . 
At least three <START:ggp> ERP-related transcripts <END> are expressed in a variety of tissues . 
However , within the <START:ana> B-cell lineage <END> , <START:ggp> ERP <END> is highly expressed primarily at early stages of <START:ana> B-lymphocyte <END> development , and expression declines drastically upon B-cell maturation , correlating with the enhancer activity of the <START:ggp> IgH pi site <END> . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> ERP <END> might play a role in <START:ana> B-cell <END> development and in <START:ggp> IgH gene <END> regulation . 
Gene for a <START:ggp> tissue-specific transcriptional activator <END> ( <START:ggp> EBF <END> or <START:ggp> Olf-1 <END> ) , expressed in <START:ana> early B lymphocytes <END> , <START:ana> adipocytes <END> , and <START:ana> olfactory neurons <END> , is located on <START:ggp> human chromosome 5 <END> , <START:ggp> band q34 <END> , and <START:ggp> proximal mouse chromosome 11 <END> . 
<START:ana> Murine B lymphocytes <END> , <START:ana> adipocytes <END> , and <START:ana> olfactory neurons <END> contain a <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> that participates in the regulation of <START:ggp> genes <END> encoding tissue-specific components of signal transduction . 
Purification and cloning of this protein , termed early <START:ggp> B-cell factor <END> ( <START:ggp> EBF <END> ) , from <START:ana> murine B lymphocytes <END> and independent cloning of a protein , termed <START:ggp> Olf-1 <END> , from <START:ana> olfactory neuronal cells <END> revealed virtual complete amino acid sequence identity between these proteins . 
As a first step towards identifying a human genetic disorder or mouse mutation for which <START:ggp> EBF <END> could be a candidate gene , we have chromosomally mapped the corresponding locus in both species . 
By Southern hybridization analyses of somatic cell hybrid panels with <START:ggp> murine cDNA probe <END> , fluorescence chromosomal in situ hybridization ( FISH ) of <START:ggp> human genomic clones <END> , and analysis of <START:ana> recombinant inbred mouse strains <END> , we have found single sites for <START:ggp> EBF homologous sequences <END> on human Chromosome ( Chr ) 5 , <START:ggp> band q34 <END> , and on <START:ggp> proximal mouse Chr 11 <END> , in an <START:ggp> evolutionarily conserved region <END> . 
<START:ggp> Calcineurin <END> activates transcription from the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> in synergy with either <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> or <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> /AP-1 <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Two <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> <START:ggp> GM-kappa B/GC-box <END> and <START:ggp> CLE0 <END> , of the <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene <END> are required for maximal induction in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> by costimulation with phorbol-12-myristate acetate ( PMA ) and Ca2+ ionophore ( A23187 ) . 
The <START:ggp> GM-kappa B sequence <END> is recognized by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , which is mainly induced by PMA . 
The <START:ggp> CLE0 sequence <END> interacts with factors , related to a <START:ggp> PMA-induced AP-1 <END> and a <START:ggp> PMA/A23187-induced NF-AT <END> . 
We examined whether signal transducing components in <START:ana> T cells <END> can activate transcription of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> . 
Cotransfection of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B ( p50/p65 ) - or AP-1 ( c-Jun/c-Fos ) - expression vectors <END> into <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> with a <START:ggp> luciferase reporter <END> containing the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> did not stimulate transcription from the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> . 
In contrast , cotransfection with a combination of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> significantly augmented transcription from the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> containing the <START:ggp> GM-kappa B/GC-box <END> and the <START:ggp> CLE0 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1/NF-AT <END> ) . 
Expression of a constitutively active <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> ( <START:ggp> CN <END> ) , a <START:ggp> Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase <END> , potentiated by two fold the transcriptional activation by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> /AP-1 <END> . 
Both constitutively active forms of <START:ggp> CN <END> and <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) synergistically activated transcription from the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> . 
These results suggest that cooperation among <START:ggp> NF-kappa B- , AP-1- and NF-AT-binding sequences <END> is required for induction of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> through PKC- and Ca2+- signaling pathways downstream of T cell activation . 
<START:ggp> Nonpituitary human prolactin gene <END> transcription is independent of <START:ggp> Pit-1 <END> and differentially controlled in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> and in endometrial stroma . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> human PRL ( hPRL ) gene <END> in extrapituitary sites such as the uterus ( decidualized endometrial stroma and myometrium ) and cells of the <START:ana> hematopoietic lineage <END> is directed by an <START:ggp> alternative promoter <END> which is located approximately <START:ggp> 6 kilobases ( kb ) upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> pituitary-specific start site <END> . 
In order to delineate the tissue-specific mechanisms governing the control of nonpituitary <START:ggp> PRL gene <END> expression , we have cloned and sequenced <START:ggp> 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA <END> of the upstream <START:ggp> decidual/lymphoid ( dPRL ) promoter <END> . 
Based on sequence homology we identified two <START:ggp> binding motifs <END> for <START:ggp> Pit-1 <END> and seven <START:ggp> half-sites <END> for <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor/progesterone receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> PR <END> ) binding . 
We focused our studies on the role of <START:ggp> Pit-1 <END> and of <START:ggp> PR <END> as potential <START:ggp> transcriptional regulators <END> , since the <START:ggp> POU domain protein <END> <START:ggp> Pit-1 <END> is essential in the control of pituitary <START:ggp> PRL <END> expression , and progesterone induces decidual transformation of the endometrial stroma , a differentiation process during which the decidual <START:ggp> PRL gene <END> is activated . 
We demonstrate in a variety of cell types , including <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> and endometrial stroma , that <START:ggp> Pit-1 <END> is not involved in the regulation of <START:ggp> dPRL promoter/reporter gene constructs <END> carrying <START:ggp> 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA <END> . 
Our experiments also show that activated <START:ggp> PR <END> does not confer direct transcriptional control on the <START:ggp> dPRL promoter <END> . 
When we compared the activity of the transfected <START:ggp> dPRL promoter <END> in <START:ana> PRL-secreting and nonsecreting lymphoid cells <END> , we found that the <START:ggp> 3 kb 5'-flanking region <END> of the <START:ggp> dPRL promoter <END> did not contain elements restricting expression to only those <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> that produce PRL but allowed expression of fusion reporter genes irrespective of the status of the endogenous <START:ggp> PRL gene <END> . 
This was in sharp contrast to endometrial cells where 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA conferred strong transcriptional activation on the <START:ggp> dPRL promoter <END> in decidualized <START:ana> endometrial stromal cells <END> actively secreting <START:ggp> PRL <END> , but did not allow transcription in undifferentiated <START:ana> non-PRL-secreting endometrial stromal cells <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> dPRL promoter <END> construct in these undifferentiated cells could however be induced by the addition of cAMP , in the absence of progesterone , suggesting that a signal transduced through the cAMP signaling pathway is a primary inducer of decidual <START:ggp> PRL gene <END> expression . 
Signals and <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> that regulate the expression of <START:ggp> interleukin-4 and interleukin-5 genes <END> in <START:ana> helper T cells <END> . 
<START:ana> Mouse thymoma line EL-4 cells <END> produce <START:ggp> cytokines <END> such as <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , and <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) . 
<START:ana> EL-4 cells <END> also produce low levels of <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> when stimulated by PMA alone ; however , cAMP greatly augments PMA-dependent <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> production . 
A transient transfection assay revealed that two signals , PMA and cAMP , are required for optimal activation of the <START:ggp> IL-5 promoter <END> . 
In contrast , cAMP almost completely inhibited the PMA-dependent activation of the <START:ggp> endogenous IL-2 gene <END> , as well as the transfected <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> . 
These results indicate that the <START:ggp> IL-5 gene <END> is positively regulated by cAMP in a manner opposite to that for the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> . 
One of the <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> ( <START:ggp> NFs <END> ) that regulates the response of the <START:ggp> IL-5 promoter <END> to cAMP and PMA has properties similar to <START:ggp> NF <END> for <START:ana> activated t cell <END> . 
The <START:ggp> P sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> , defined as a <START:ggp> responsive element <END> for PMA and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) , shares sequence similarity with the <START:ggp> NF kappa B and the NF-activated T cell binding sites <END> . 
We attempted to determine whether <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> , a nuclear factor specific for the <START:ggp> P sequence <END> , is related to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> nuclear factor for activated T cell <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) . 
In electromobility shift assays both <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> P65 <END> or <START:ggp> P65/P50 heterodimer <END> ) and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> bound to the <START:ggp> P sequence <END> . 
However , sequence specificity of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> was more similar to that of <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> , and only a small amount of <START:ggp> P65 <END> was detected in <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> . 
These results indicate that a component or components of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> have the potential to reconstitute <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> , whereas <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> alone does not account for <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> in Jurkat crude extract . 
Taken together , these results suggest that <START:ggp> NF-AT-like factors <END> are involved in the regulation of <START:ggp> IL-4 and IL-5 genes <END> . 
Solution structure of a <START:ggp> POU-specific homeodomain <END> : 3D-NMR studies of human <START:ggp> B-cell transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> POU DNA-binding motif <END> defines a conserved family of <START:ggp> eukaryotic transcription factors <END> involved in regulation of gene expression . 
This <START:ggp> bipartite motif <END> consists of an <START:ggp> N-terminal POU-specific domain <END> ( <START:ggp> POUs <END> ) , a <START:ggp> flexible linker <END> , and a <START:ggp> C-terminal POU-specific homeodomain <END> ( <START:ggp> POUHD <END> ) . 
Here we describe the solution structure of a <START:ggp> POU-specific homeodomain <END> . 
An NMR model is obtained from <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , a <START:ggp> human B-cell specific transcription factor <END> which participates in the regulation of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin genes <END> . 
A fragment of <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> containing <START:ggp> POUHD <END> and an adjoining linker was expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized by three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance ( 3D-NMR ) spectroscopy . 
Complete 1H and 15N resonance assignment of the <START:ggp> POUHD moiety <END> is presented . 
The <START:ggp> POUHD <END> solution structure , as calculated by distance geometry and simulated annealing ( DG/SA ) , is similar to that of <START:ggp> canonical homeodomains <END> . 
A salient difference between solution and crystal structures is observed in the <START:ggp> C-terminal segment <END> of <START:ggp> alpha-helix 3 <END> ( the <START:ggp> HTH recognition helix <END> ) , which is not well ordered in solution . 
Because this segment presumably folds upon specific DNA binding , its flexibility in solution may reduce the intrinsic DNA affinity of <START:ggp> POUHD <END> in the absence of <START:ggp> POUs <END> . 
NF-kappa B-dependent and -independent pathways of HIV activation in a <START:ana> chronically infected T cell line <END> . 
<START:ana> J delta K cells <END> were isolated as a <START:ana> chronically infected survivor cell line <END> , following infection of <START:ana> Jurkat CD4+ T cells <END> with dl-NF , a mutated strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) containing a deletion of the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> sites . 
<START:ana> J delta K cells <END> exhibited very low levels of constitutive HIV production . 
HIV-1 expression was activated from <START:ana> J delta K cells <END> by treatment with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , sodium butyrate ( NaB ) , or hexamethylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) , but not <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) , confirming the role of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in mediating <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> induction of HIV transcription . 
The strong induction of HIV expression by NaB or HMBA in <START:ana> J delta K cells <END> clearly demonstrates the existence of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -independent mechanisms of HIV activation in <START:ana> chronically infected cells <END> . 
<START:ana> J delta K cells <END> may provide a useful model for characterizing <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -independent transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> HIV LTR <END> . 
<START:ggp> JNK <END> is involved in signal integration during costimulation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ana> T lymphocyte <END> activation and <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) production require at least two signals , generated by phorbol ester ( TPA ) and Ca2+ ionophore or costimulation of the <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) and the <START:ggp> CD28 auxiliary receptor <END> . 
We investigated how these stimuli affect <START:ggp> mitogen activated protein ( MAP ) kinases <END> . 
Full activation of the <START:ggp> MAP kinases <END> that phosphorylate the <START:ggp> Jun activation domain <END> , <START:ggp> JNK1 <END> and <START:ggp> JNK2 <END> , required costimulation of <START:ana> T cells <END> with either TPA and Ca2+ ionophore or antibodies to <START:ggp> TCR <END> and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> . 
Alone , each stimulus resulted in little or no activation . 
Similar to its effect on <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induction , cyclosporin A ( CsA ) inhibited the synergistic activation of <START:ggp> JNK <END> , and a competitive inhibitor of <START:ggp> Jun <END> phosphorylation by <START:ggp> JNK <END> inhibited <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activation . 
By contrast , the <START:ggp> MAP kinases <END> <START:ggp> ERK1 <END> and <START:ggp> ERK2 <END> were fully activated by TPA or <START:ggp> TCR <END> stimulation and were not affected by Ca2+ , CD28 , or CsA . 
Hence , integration of signals that lead to T cell activation occurs at the level of <START:ggp> JNK <END> activation . 
Inhibition of <START:ana> rat splenocyte <END> proliferation with methylprednisolone : in vivo effect of liposomal formulation . 
The effect of a liposomal formulation of methylprednisolone ( MPL ) on the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation in <START:ana> spleen cells <END> was investigated following IV dosing in rats . 
Liposomes do not alter the suppressive action of MPL when placed in <START:ana> lymphocyte culture <END> . 
<START:ana> Rat splenocytes <END> were found to have greater sensitivity to MPL ( EC50 = 7.9 nM ) than do <START:ana> human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> ( EC50 = 28 nM ) . 
In vivo studies in rats utilized 2 mg/kg IV bolus doses of liposomal MPL compared to drug in solution . 
Animals were sacrificed at various times post-dosing until 120 h , spleen was excised and , after incubation of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> with <START:ggp> PHA <END> , splenocyte blastogenic responses were assessed by measuring cellular incorporation of 3H-thymidine . 
The suppressive effect of liposomal MPL in comparison with free drug was significantly prolonged ( > 120 h vs < 18 h ) . 
Inhibition effects versus time were described by a pharmacodynamic model using MPL concentrations in <START:ana> plasma <END> as an input function . 
A nonlinear relationship was found between suppression of <START:ana> splenocyte <END> proliferation and the concentration of bound <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in spleen . 
Only partial receptor occupancy accompanied complete lymphocyte suppression . 
The suppression of endogenous corticosterone in <START:ana> plasma <END> for both treatments was similar with values from L-MPL rats returning to baseline after 24 h . 
These results demonstrate enhanced efficacy of local immunosuppression by targeting spleen with liposomal MPL . 
Function of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex class II invariant chain promoter <END> is dependent on cell-specific binding of different <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel subunits <END> . 
The <START:ggp> promoter <END> of the human major <START:ggp> histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant-chain gene <END> ( <START:ggp> Ii <END> ) contains two <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel binding sites <END> located at <START:ggp> -109 to -118 <END> ( <START:ggp> Ii kappa B-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> -163 to -172 <END> ( <START:ggp> Ii kappa B-2 <END> ) from the transcription start site . 
We report here that the differential function of each of these <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel sites <END> in several distinct cell types depends on cell-specific binding of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors <END> . 
<START:ggp> Ii kappa B-1 <END> is a <START:ggp> positive regulatory element <END> in <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> and in the <START:ana> Ii-expressing T-cell line <END> , <START:ana> H9 <END> , but acts as a <START:ggp> negative regulatory element <END> in <START:ana> myelomonocytic and glia cell lines <END> . 
In vivo protein-DNA contacts are detectable at <START:ggp> Ii kappa B-1 <END> in <START:ana> cell lines <END> in which this site is functional as either a <START:ggp> positive or negative regulator <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility supershift assays determine that members of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> can bind to this site in vitro and that <START:ggp> DNA-binding complexes <END> that contain <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p52 <END> , <START:ggp> p65 <END> , and <START:ggp> cRel <END> correlate with positive regulation whereas the presence of <START:ggp> p50 <END> correlates with negative regulation . 
<START:ggp> Ii kappa B-2 <END> is a site of positive regulation in <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> and a site of negative regulation in <START:ana> H9 T cells <END> , <START:ana> myelomonocytic , and glial cell lines <END> . 
In vivo occupancy of this site is observed only in the <START:ana> H9 T-cell line <END> . 
Again , in vitro supershift studies indicate that the presence of <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p52 <END> , <START:ggp> p65 <END> , and <START:ggp> cRel <END> correlates with positive function whereas the presence of only <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p52 <END> correlates with negative function . 
This differential binding of specific <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel subunits <END> is likely to mediate the disparate functions of these two <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel binding sites <END> . 
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) replicative gene expression in <START:ana> tumour cells <END> of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma in relation to <START:ggp> CD4 <END> cell number and antibody titres to EBV . 
OBJECTIVE : To determine whether activation of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) replication in <START:ana> tumour cells <END> of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( ARNHL ) is correlated with <START:ggp> CD4+ <END> cell counts and influences antibody response to EBV [ <START:ggp> anti-Z Epstein-Barr replicative activator <END> ( <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> ) , <START:ggp> anti-early antigen <END> ( <START:ggp> EA <END> ) , <START:ggp> anti-viral capsid antigen <END> ( <START:ggp> VCA <END> ) ] . 
DESIGN : Retrospective study based on immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to detect EBV replicative gene products in tissue samples from patients affected by ARNHL and correlation with <START:ggp> CD4+ <END> cell counts and results of EBV serology ( including anti- <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> activity ) in sera from the same patients . 
METHODS : Seventeen out of 22 cases of ARNHL were selected for the presence of EBV [ Epstein-Barr early region ( EBER ) RNA-positive ] . 
Immunohistochemistry was performed with <START:ggp> anti-ZEBRA <END> , <START:ggp> anti-EA-restricted , anti-VCA antibodies <END> and in situ hybridization with BHLF1/NotI oligoprobes on tumour samples . 
Results were statistically correlated with those of <START:ggp> CD4+ <END> cell counts ( 17 out of 17 ) and with anti-EBV antibody titres ( 13 out of 17 ) assessed using standard immunofluorescence method and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure using <START:ggp> recombinant ZEBRA protein <END> and synthetic peptides as <START:ggp> antigens <END> . 
RESULTS : <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> ) or <START:ggp> early gene products <END> ( <START:ggp> EA-R <END> and <START:ggp> EA-D/BHLF1/NotI <END> ) were detected in a small proportion ( < 0.01-5 % ) of <START:ana> tumour cells <END> in eight of these 17 cases by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization . 
Demonstration of replicative gene expression did not correlate with either low <START:ggp> CD4+ <END> cell counts ( P > 0.05 ) or anti-EBV antibody titres ( P > 0.05 ) . 
Anti- <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> activity was not significantly increased in patients affected with ARNHL , the cells of which expressed replicative gene products ( P > 0.05 ) . 
CONCLUSION : The degree of immunodeficiency does not clearly enhance replicative gene expression in <START:ana> tumour cells <END> of ARNHL . 
EBV serology , including anti- <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> activity , is not a reliable tool for predicting the occurrence of such proliferations . 
Effects of <START:ggp> prostaglandin E2 <END> on <START:ana> Th0-type human T cell clones <END> : modulation of functions of <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> involved in <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production . 
The effects of <START:ggp> prostaglandin E2 <END> ( <START:ggp> PGE2 <END> ) on <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production and proliferation of the <START:ana> CD4+ human helper T cell clone SP-B21 <END> were investigated . 
In cells stimulated with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 mAb <END> , <START:ggp> PGE2 <END> inhibited cell proliferation and the production of all the <START:ggp> cytokines <END> examined . 
Addition of <START:ggp> rIL-2 <END> fully restored the proliferative response and partially restored the production of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> , but not that of other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
In contrast , in cells stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) /A23187 , <START:ggp> PGE2 <END> enhanced the production of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> , and only partially inhibited the production of other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
Therefore , the effects of <START:ggp> PGE2 <END> vary depending on the mode of T cell activation , and the <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> are regulated differently from other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
In a mobility shift assay , only the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B ( p50/p50 ) homodimer <END> was observed in a complex formed with the <START:ggp> kappa B sequence <END> in unstimulated SP-B21 cells . 
When cells were stimulated with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 mAb <END> or PMA/A23187 , a complex formation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> p50 <END> <START:ggp> /p65 <END> ) heterodimer with the <START:ggp> kappa B sequence <END> was induced . 
Interestingly , <START:ggp> PGE2 <END> or di-butyryl ( Bt2 ) cAMP abolished the binding of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B ( p50/p65 ) heterodimer <END> to the <START:ggp> kappa B sequence <END> in cells stimulated with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 mAb <END> but not with PMA/A23187 . 
Our results suggest that the target of <START:ggp> PGE2 <END> action is a component in the signal transduction pathway leading to the activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> . 
However , the inhibition of the T cell activation signals by <START:ggp> PGE2 <END> is selective . 
<START:ggp> PGE2 <END> enhanced the complex formation with <START:ggp> NF-AT , AP-1 and CLE0 sequences <END> when the cells were activated by either <START:ggp> anti-CD3 mAb <END> or PMA/A23187 stimulation . 
It seems therefore that <START:ggp> PGE2 <END> , by elevating cAMP levels , interferes with the activation pathway for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> but not for <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> or <START:ggp> CLE0 binding protein <END> . 
Characterization of <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> , the <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> that interacts with the regulatory <START:ggp> P sequence <END> ( 5'-CGAAAATTTCC-3 ' ) of the <START:ggp> human interleukin-4 gene <END> : relationship to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
The <START:ggp> P sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> human interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) gene <END> , which was defined as a <START:ggp> responsive element <END> for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> , shares sequence similarity with the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B and the NF-AT binding sites <END> . 
We examined whether <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> , a <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> specific for the <START:ggp> P sequence <END> , is related to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> P65 <END> or <START:ggp> P65/P50 heterodimer <END> ) bound to the <START:ggp> P sequence <END> in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) and activated transcription through the <START:ggp> P sequence <END> when <START:ggp> expression plasmids <END> were cotransfected with <START:ggp> P sequence-driven reporter plasmids <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
In EMSAs , <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> binding was inhibited by the <START:ggp> unlabeled NF-AT binding site <END> but not by the <START:ggp> unlabeled AP1 binding site <END> and <START:ggp> purified NF-AT <END> contained an activity that bound to the <START:ggp> P sequence <END> . 
Both mobility shift and sequence specificity of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> were similar to those of <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> and only a small amount of <START:ggp> P65 <END> was detected in <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> in crude nuclear extracts . 
These results indicate that the component ( s ) of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> has the potential to reconstitute <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> whereas <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> alone can not account for <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> in crude extracts . 
Unlike <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> does not contain <START:ggp> AP1 <END> as its <START:ggp> DNA binding component <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> early growth response 1 gene <END> transcription and <START:ggp> pp90rsk <END> during induction of monocytic differentiation . 
The present work has studied mechanisms responsible for induction of <START:ggp> early growth response 1 ( EGR-1 ) gene <END> expression during monocytic differentiation of <START:ana> U-937 myeloid leukemia cells <END> . 
Differentiation of <START:ana> U-937 cells <END> with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) , an activator of the <START:ggp> serine/threonine protein kinase C <END> , was associated with transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> EGR-1 promoter-reporter constructs <END> . 
The <START:ggp> EGR-1 promoter <END> contains six CC ( A/T ) 6GG ( CArG ) motifs . 
The two <START:ggp> 5'-most distal CArG sequences <END> conferred TPA inducibility . 
In contrast , there was little effect of TPA on <START:ggp> EGR-1 <END> transcription in a <START:ana> TPA-resistant U-937 cell variant <END> , designated <START:ana> TUR <END> . 
Treatment of both <START:ana> U-937 <END> and <START:ana> TUR cells <END> with okadaic acid , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> serine/threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2A <END> , was associated with induction of monocytic differentiation and <START:ggp> EGR-1 <END> transcription through the <START:ggp> 5'-most CArG element <END> . 
Since these findings supported the involvement of serine/threonine protein phosphorylation in the regulation of <START:ggp> EGR-1 <END> expression , we studied activation of the <START:ggp> 40S ribosomal protein S6 serine/threonine kinases <END> , <START:ggp> pp70S6K <END> and <START:ggp> pp90rsk <END> . 
Although both kinases participate in regulating cell growth , there was no detectable activation of <START:ggp> pp70S6K <END> during TPA- or okadaic acid-induced monocytic differentiation . 
Moreover , rapamycin , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> pp70S6K <END> activation , had no effect on induction of <START:ggp> EGR-1 <END> expression . 
In contrast , analysis of <START:ggp> pp90rsk <END> activity by phosphorylation of a peptide derived from <START:ggp> S6 protein <END> demonstrated stimulation of this <START:ggp> kinase <END> in <START:ana> TPA-treated U-937 , and not TUR , cells <END> . 
Okadaic acid treatment of both cell types was associated with activation of <START:ggp> pp90rsk <END> . 
Antioxidants inhibit <START:ana> monocyte <END> adhesion by suppressing <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> mobilization and induction of <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> in <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> stimulated to generate radicals . 
Cell adhesion to <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> <START:ggp> stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) is due to induction of <START:ggp> surface receptors <END> , such as <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) . 
The antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) specifically inhibits activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) . 
Since <START:ggp> kappa B motifs <END> are present in <START:ggp> VCAM-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) promoters <END> , we used PDTC to study the regulatory mechanisms of <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> induction and subsequent <START:ana> monocyte <END> adhesion in <START:ana> TNF-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> HUVECs <END> ) . 
PDTC or N-acetylcysteine dose dependently reduced <START:ggp> TNF-induced VCAM-1 <END> but not <START:ggp> ICAM-1 surface protein <END> ( also in <START:ana> human umbilical arterial endothelial cells <END> ) and mRNA expression ( by 70 % at 100 mumol/L PDTC ) in <START:ana> HUVECs <END> as assessed by flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction . 
Gel-shift analysis in <START:ana> HUVECs <END> demonstrated that PDTC prevented <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> mobilization by <START:ggp> TNF <END> , suggesting that only <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> induction was controlled by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Since <START:ana> HUVECs <END> released superoxide anions in response to TNF , and H2O2 induces <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> , PDTC may act as a radical scavenger . 
Although <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> induction was unaffected , inhibitors of <START:ggp> NADPH oxidase <END> ( apocynin ) or <START:ggp> cytochrome P-450 <END> ( SKF525a ) suppressed <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> induction by TNF , revealing that several radical-generating systems are involved in its regulation . 
PDTC , apocynin , or SKF525a decreased adhesion of <START:ana> monocytic U937 cells <END> to <START:ana> TNF-treated HUVECs <END> ( by 75 % at 100 mumol/L PDTC ) . 
Inhibition by <START:ggp> anti-VCAM-1 monoclonal antibody <END> <START:ggp> 1G11 <END> indicated that <START:ana> U937 <END> adhesion was <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> dependent and suppression by antioxidants was due to reduced <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> induction . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Displacement of an <START:ggp> E-box-binding repressor <END> by <START:ggp> basic helix-loop-helix proteins <END> : implications for B-cell specificity of the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer <END> . 
The activity of the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) enhancer <END> is restricted to <START:ana> B cells <END> , although it binds both <START:ggp> B-cell-restricted and ubiquitous transcription factors <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> in <START:ana> non-B cells <END> upon overexpression of the <START:ggp> basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) protein <END> <START:ggp> E2A <END> appears to be mediated not only by the binding of <START:ggp> E2A <END> to its cognate <START:ggp> E box <END> but also by the resulting displacement of a <START:ggp> repressor <END> from that same site . 
We have identified a <START:ggp> `` two-handed '' zinc finger protein <END> , denoted <START:ggp> ZEB <END> , the DNA-binding specificity of which mimics that of the <START:ggp> cellular repressor <END> . 
By employing a derivative <START:ggp> E box <END> that binds <START:ggp> ZEB <END> but not <START:ggp> E2A <END> , we have shown that the <START:ggp> repressor <END> is active in <START:ana> B cells <END> and the <START:ggp> IgH enhancer <END> is silenced in the absence of binding competition by <START:ggp> bHLH proteins <END> . 
Hence , we propose that a necessary prerequisite of <START:ggp> enhancer <END> activity is the B-cell-specific displacement of a <START:ggp> ZEB-like repressor <END> by <START:ggp> bHLH proteins <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by sodium salicylate and aspirin [ see comments ] 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) is critical for the inducible expression of multiple <START:ggp> cellular and viral genes <END> involved in inflammation and infection including <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> ) , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , and <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> . 
The anti-inflammatory drugs sodium salicylate and aspirin inhibited the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , which further explains the mechanism of action of these drugs . 
This inhibition prevented the degradation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B inhibitor <END> , <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> , and therefore <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was retained in the cytosol . 
Sodium salicylate and aspirin also inhibited <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -dependent transcription from the <START:ggp> Ig kappa enhancer <END> and the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) in <START:ana> transfected T cells <END> . 
Effects of the antisense myb expression on hemin- and erythropoietin- induced erythroid differentiation of <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
In order to elucidate the role of <START:ggp> c-myb gene <END> in erythroid differentiation of <START:ana> K562 cell <END> induced by <START:ggp> hemin <END> ( <START:ggp> Hm <END> ) and <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> Epo <END> ) , we constructed <START:ggp> recombinant plasmid <END> that could produce <START:ana> antisense myb RNA <END> after induction with dexamethasone . 
During treatment with <START:ggp> Hm <END> , <START:ana> K562 cells <END> constitutively expressed <START:ana> c-myb mRNA <END> , and 50 % of them began to synthesize <START:ggp> hemoglobin <END> ( <START:ggp> Hb <END> ) . 
Expression of <START:ana> antisense myb RNA <END> reduced the amount of <START:ana> c-myb mRNA <END> , and the percentage of <START:ana> Hb-synthesizing cells <END> was decreased to 20 % . 
In the presence of <START:ggp> Epo <END> , <START:ana> c-myb mRNA <END> declined and 20 % of <START:ana> K562 cells <END> synthesized <START:ggp> Hb <END> regardless of <START:ana> antisense myb RNA <END> expression . 
It is suggested that constitutive expression of <START:ana> c-myb mRNA <END> is necessary for <START:ggp> Hm <END> -induced differentiation , and that a decrease in the amount of <START:ana> c-myb mRNA <END> induced by <START:ana> antisense myb RNA <END> expression suppresses <START:ggp> Hm <END> -induced differentiation . 
The amount of <START:ana> c-myb mRNA <END> in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> was reduced during the differentiation induced by <START:ggp> Epo <END> . 
Expression of <START:ana> GATA-1 mRNA <END> was almost constant during <START:ggp> Hm <END> -induced differentiation , but increased during <START:ggp> Epo <END> treatment . 
It is supposed that the mechanism of <START:ggp> Hm <END> -induced differentiation is distinguished from that of <START:ggp> Epo <END> -induced differentiation in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
Prenatal immune challenge alters the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in adult rats . 
We investigated whether non-abortive maternal infections would compromise fetal brain development and alter hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical ( HPA ) axis functioning when adult . 
To study putative teratogenic effects of a T cell-mediated immune response versus an endotoxic challenge , 10-d-pregnant rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of 5 x 10 ( 8 ) <START:ana> human red blood cells <END> ( <START:ana> HRBC <END> ) or gram-negative bacterial endotoxin ( Escherichia coli LPS : 30 micrograms/kg ) . 
The adult male progeny ( 3 mo old ) of both experimental groups showed increased basal plasma corticosterone levels . 
In addition , after novelty stress the <START:ana> HRBC <END> group , but not the <START:ana> LPS group <END> , showed increased ACTH and corticosterone levels . 
Both groups showed substantial decreases in mineralocorticoid ( MR ) and glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) levels in the hippocampus , a limbic brain structure critical for HPA axis regulation , whereas <START:ggp> GR <END> concentrations in the hypothalamus were unchanged and in anterior pituitary were slightly increased . 
<START:ana> HRBC <END> and LPS indeed stimulated the maternal immune system as revealed by specific <START:ggp> anti-HRBC antibody <END> production and enhanced IL-1 beta mRNA expression in <START:ana> splenocytes <END> , respectively . 
This study demonstrates that a T cell-mediated immune response as well as an endotoxic challenge during pregnancy can induce anomalies in HPA axis function in adulthood . 
Clinically , it may be postulated that disturbed fetal brain development due to prenatal immune challenge increases the vulnerability to develop mental illness involving inadequate responses to stress . 
A low <START:ggp> NM23.H1 gene <END> expression identifying high malignancy human melanomas . 
The <START:ggp> NM23 gene <END> has been proposed as a <START:ggp> metastasis-suppressor gene <END> , and its use has been suggested as prognostic factor . 
<START:ggp> NM23 <END> was identified in a system of <START:ana> murine melanoma cell lines <END> , in which an inverse relationship was found between <START:ggp> NM23 <END> expression and metastatic ability . 
In a human malignant melanoma study <START:ggp> NM23 <END> expression was found to be significantly lower in metastases that developed less than 24 months after diagnosis of the primary tumours . 
The present paper studies the expression of the <START:ggp> NM23.H1 gene <END> in <START:ana> cell lines <END> which derive from primary or metastatic human malignant melanomas in relation to staging , infiltration degree , lymphocytic infiltration , cell morphology , cell pigmentation , karyotype , and disease-free survival . 
The level of mRNA expression of the <START:ggp> NM23 gene <END> is significantly lower in <START:ana> cell lines <END> that derive from more infiltrating primary melanomas than in <START:ana> cell lines <END> obtained from less infiltrating tumours . 
Moreover , <START:ana> cell lines <END> derived from tumours of patients with a disease-free survival of more than 24 months ( 24-58 months ) express the <START:ggp> NM23 gene <END> at higher levels than <START:ana> cell lines <END> obtained from melanomas of patients with a disease-free survival of less than 24 months ( 6-15 months ) . 
Activation of a novel <START:ggp> serine/threonine kinase <END> that phosphorylates <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> upon stimulation of <START:ana> T and B lymphocytes <END> via antigen and <START:ggp> cytokine receptors <END> . 
Ligation of <START:ggp> Ag receptors <END> in <START:ana> T and B lymphocytes <END> initiates signal transduction cascades which alter the expression of genes that regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation . 
The transmission of signals from the membrane to the nucleus is mediated principally through the action of <START:ggp> protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases <END> . 
We have identified and characterized a novel <START:ggp> serine/threonine kinase <END> that phosphorylated the <START:ggp> proto-oncogene product <END> , <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , and is termed <START:ggp> Fos kinase <END> . 
<START:ggp> Fos kinase <END> was rapidly activated after ligation of the <START:ggp> CD3 and CD2 receptors <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat <END> and <START:ana> normal human T lymphocytes <END> and in response to <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> and <START:ggp> anti-IgM <END> in the <START:ana> human B cell lines <END> <START:ana> AF10 <END> and <START:ana> Ramos <END> , respectively . 
The phorbol ester , PMA , was also a potent inducer of <START:ggp> Fos kinase <END> activity in all of the above populations , suggesting that <START:ggp> PKC <END> plays a role in the regulation of this <START:ggp> enzyme <END> . 
<START:ggp> Fos kinase <END> phosphorylates <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> at a site near the <START:ggp> C-terminus <END> , as well as a peptide derived from this region ( <START:ggp> residues 359-370 <END> , <START:ggp> RKGSSSNEPSSD <END> ) , and Fos peptide competitively inhibited <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> phosphorylation . 
<START:ggp> Fos kinase <END> was shown to be distinct from other identified <START:ggp> serine/threonine kinases <END> , including <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> , <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> , <START:ggp> casein kinase II <END> , <START:ggp> MAP kinases <END> , <START:ggp> p70S6K <END> and <START:ggp> p90RSK <END> . 
<START:ggp> Fos kinase <END> was purified by anion exchange chromatography and exhibited an apparent M ( r ) = 65 , 000 and isoelectric point = 6.1 . 
<START:ggp> Fos kinase <END> may play a role in transcriptional regulation through its capacity to phosphorylate <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> at a site required for expression of the transcriptional transrepressive activity of this molecule . 
Moreover , its rapid activation suggests it may have a wider role within signal transduction cascades in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
Antigenic specificities of <START:ana> human CD4+ T-cell clones <END> recovered from recurrent genital herpes simplex virus type 2 lesions . 
Lesions resulting from recurrent genital herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infection are characterized by infiltration of <START:ana> CD4+ lymphocytes <END> . 
We have investigated the antigenic specificity of 47 <START:ana> HSV-specific CD4+ T-cell clones <END> recovered from the HSV-2 buttock and thigh lesions of five patients . 
Clones with proliferative responses to <START:ggp> recombinant truncated glycoprotein B <END> ( <START:ggp> gB <END> ) or <START:ggp> gD <END> of HSV-2 or purified natural gC of HSV-2 comprised a minority of the total number of <START:ana> HSV-specific clones <END> isolated from lesions . 
The <START:ana> gC2- and gD2-specific CD4+ clones <END> had cytotoxic activity . 
The approximate locations of the HSV-2 genes encoding HSV-2 type-specific <START:ggp> CD4+ antigens <END> have been determined by using HSV-1 x HSV-2 intertypic recombinant virus and include the approximate map regions 0.30 to 0.46 , 0.59 to 0.67 , 0.67 to 0.73 , and 0.82 to 1.0 units . 
The antigenic specificity of an <START:ana> HLA DQ2-restricted , HSV-2 type-specific T-cell clone <END> was mapped to <START:ggp> amino acids 425 to 444 <END> of <START:ggp> VP16 <END> of HSV-2 by sequential use of an intertypic recombinant virus containing <START:ggp> VP16 <END> of HSV-2 in an HSV-1 background , <START:ggp> recombinant VP16 fusion proteins <END> , and synthetic peptides . 
Each of the remaining four patients also yielded at least one <START:ana> type-specific T-cell clone <END> reactive with an HSV-2 epitope mapping to approximately 0.67 to 0.73 map units . 
The antigenic specificities of <START:ana> lesion-derived CD4+ T-cell clones <END> are quite diverse and include at least 10 epitopes . 
<START:ana> Human T-cell clones <END> reactive with <START:ggp> gC <END> and <START:ggp> VP16 <END> are reported here for the first time . 
Marked basophilia in acute promyelocytic leukaemia treated with all-trans retinoic acid : molecular analysis of the cell origin of the <START:ana> basophils <END> . 
We report a patient with acute promyelocytic leukaemia who developed marked basophilia during all-trans retinoic acid treatment . 
We studied <START:ggp> genomic DNA <END> and RNA extracted from the patient 's <START:ana> peripheral leucocytes <END> in order to determine the origin of the <START:ana> basophils <END> . 
The <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> rearranged band in the Southern blot analysis and a <START:ggp> chimaeric product <END> of <START:ggp> PML-RAR alpha <END> by polymerase chain reaction were strongly visible before ATRA treatment , but at the time of maximal basophilia both of them were markedly diminished . 
These findings suggest that the <START:ana> basophils <END> which appeared during the ATRA treatment are reactive in nature rather than a <START:ana> leukaemic clone <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> interleukin 6 gene <END> by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or lipopolysaccharide is mediated by <START:ggp> nuclear factors NF-IL6 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> [ published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1995 Apr 11 ; 92 ( 8 ) : 3632 ] 
The host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis includes granuloma formation at sites of infection and systemic symptoms . 
<START:ggp> Cytokines <END> have been identified by immunohistochemistry in granulomas in animal models of bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) infection and are released by <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> upon stimulation by mycobacterial proteins . 
In this regard , the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> <START:ggp> interleukin 6 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ) may play a role in the clinical manifestations and pathological events of tuberculosis infection . 
We have demonstrated that <START:ggp> lipoarabinomannan <END> ( <START:ggp> LAM <END> ) from the mycobacterial cell wall , which was virtually devoid of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , stimulated <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> to release <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> in a dose-response manner . 
<START:ggp> LAM <END> and LPS were potent inducers of <START:ggp> IL-6 gene <END> expression in <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> LAM <END> -and <START:ggp> LPS-inducible IL-6 promoter <END> activity was localized to a <START:ggp> DNA fragment <END> , positions <START:ggp> -158 to -49 <END> , by deletion analysis and <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase <END> assay . 
Two <START:ggp> nuclear factor NF-IL6 <END> ( positions <START:ggp> -153 to -145 <END> and -83 to -75 ) and one <START:ggp> nuclear factor NF-kappa B ( positions -72 to -63 ) motifs <END> are present within this fragment . 
Site-directed mutagenesis of one or more of these motifs within the <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> promoter demonstrated that each has positive regulatory activity and that they could act in a function- and orientation-independent manner . 
Deletion of all three elements abolished inducibility of <START:ggp> IL-6 promoter <END> activity by both <START:ggp> LAM <END> and LPS . 
We conclude that the <START:ggp> NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B sites <END> mediate <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> induction in response to both LPS and <START:ggp> LAM <END> , acting as <START:ggp> bacterial or mycobacterial response elements <END> . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> CD14 <END> expression during monocytic differentiation induced with 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 . 
<START:ggp> CD14 <END> , a <START:ggp> monocyte/macrophage receptor <END> for the complex of LPS and <START:ggp> LPS binding protein <END> , is a differentiation marker for the <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage lineage <END> . 
We have analyzed the regulation of <START:ggp> CD14 <END> expression during 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VitD3 ) -induced monocytic differentiation . 
Using FACS , Northern blotting , and nuclear run-on analyses , we demonstrate that the up-regulation of <START:ggp> CD14 <END> expression during monocytic cell maturation is regulated mainly at the level of gene transcription , and that new protein synthesis is required for <START:ggp> CD14 <END> induction . 
We have recently cloned the <START:ggp> CD14 5 ' upstream sequence <END> and demonstrated its <START:ggp> tissue-specific promoter <END> activity . 
Using stable transfection of the <START:ana> monocytoid U937 cell line <END> with a series of deletion mutants of the <START:ggp> CD14 5 ' upstream sequence <END> coupled to a reporter gene construct , we show that <START:ggp> bp -128 to -70 <END> is the critical region for the induction of <START:ggp> CD14 <END> expression . 
This region contains two <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for the <START:ggp> Sp1 transcription factor <END> . 
A 3-bp mutation at the distal <START:ggp> Sp1-binding site <END> not only eliminates <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> interaction , but also abolishes most of the VitD3 induction of <START:ggp> CD14 <END> expression . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis does not detect a direct interaction of the <START:ggp> CD14 <END> distal <START:ggp> Sp1-binding site <END> with the <START:ggp> vitamin D3 receptor <END> and its partner , the <START:ggp> retinoid X receptor <END> . 
These data demonstrate that VitD3 induces <START:ggp> CD14 <END> indirectly through some <START:ggp> intermediary factor <END> , and suggest a critical role for <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> in this process . 
DNA-binding and transcriptional regulatory properties of <START:ggp> hepatic leukemia factor <END> ( <START:ggp> HLF <END> ) and the t ( 17 ; 19 ) <START:ggp> acute lymphoblastic leukemia chimera E2A-HLF <END> . 
The <START:ggp> t ( 17 ; 19 ) <END> translocation in acute lymphoblastic leukemias results in creation of <START:ggp> E2A-hepatic leukemia factor <END> ( <START:ggp> HLF <END> ) <START:ggp> chimeric proteins <END> that contain the <START:ggp> DNA-binding and protein dimerization domains <END> of the <START:ggp> basic leucine zipper ( bZIP ) protein <END> <START:ggp> HLF <END> fused to a portion of <START:ggp> E2A proteins <END> with transcriptional activation properties . 
An in vitro binding site selection procedure was used to determine DNA sequences preferentially bound by <START:ggp> wild-type HLF <END> and <START:ggp> chimeric E2A-HLF <END> proteins isolated from various <START:ana> t ( 17 ; 19 ) -bearing leukemias <END> . 
All were found to selectively bind the <START:ggp> consensus sequence <END> 5'-GTTACGTAAT-3 ' with high affinity . 
Wild-type and <START:ggp> chimeric HLF proteins <END> also bound closely related sites identified previously for <START:ggp> bZIP proteins <END> of both the <START:ggp> proline <END> -and acidic amino acid-rich ( <START:ggp> PAR <END> ) and <START:ggp> C/EBP subfamilies <END> ; however , <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> proteins were significantly less tolerant of certain deviations from the <START:ggp> HLF consensus binding site <END> . 
These differences were directly attributable to loss of an <START:ggp> HLF ancillary DNA-binding domain <END> in all <START:ggp> E2A-HLF chimeras <END> and were further exacerbated by a zipper mutation in one isolate . 
Both <START:ggp> wild-type <END> and <START:ggp> chimeric HLF proteins <END> displayed <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> properties in <START:ana> lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells <END> on <START:ggp> reporter genes <END> containing <START:ggp> HLF or C/EBP consensus binding sites <END> . 
But on <START:ggp> reporter genes <END> with <START:ggp> nonoptimal binding sites <END> , their transcriptional properties diverged and <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> competitively inhibited activation by <START:ggp> wild-type PAR proteins <END> . 
These findings establish a spectrum of binding site-specific transcriptional properties for <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> which may preferentially activate expression of select subordinate genes as a homodimer and potentially antagonize expression of others through heteromeric interactions . 
<START:ggp> ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase <END> , <START:ggp> CD45 <END> , and <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> involvement in UV- and H2O2-induced T cell signal transduction . 
Several mammalian responses to UV irradiation , including the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , are believed to involve tyrosine phosphorylation . 
UV irradiation and H2O2 treatment of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca2+ signals similar to those observed following biological stimulation . 
We have examined the role of cell surface molecules in these responses . 
Normal <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> whose surface expression of <START:ggp> CD3 <END> was depleted showed impaired UV-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca2+ signals . 
Similarly , <START:ana> Jurkat T cell lines <END> deficient in CD3 or CD45 expression also gave impaired UV responses . 
However , all these cell types still gave strong Ca2+ and tyrosine phosphorylation responses to H2O2 . 
The T cell tyrosine <START:ggp> kinase ZAP-70 <END> was found to be highly responsive to UV and H2O2 treatment . 
<START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> responsiveness to UV required expression of both <START:ggp> CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> CD45 <END> , whereas only <START:ggp> CD3 <END> was required for the response to H2O2 . 
UV-induced activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was blocked by <START:ggp> CD3 <END> depletion , indicating the importance of such <START:ggp> cell surface molecules <END> in biological responses to UV . 
In <START:ana> nonlymphoid cells <END> , the <START:ggp> epidermal growth factor receptor <END> displayed increased tyrosine phosphorylation within seconds of UV irradiation . 
These results suggest that UV-induced signal transduction is mediated via <START:ggp> cell surface receptors <END> that normally respond to biological stimulation , whereas H2O2 is able to partially bypass this requirement . 
Inhibition of the differentiation of <START:ana> human myeloid cell lines <END> by redox changes induced through glutathione depletion . 
We have investigated the effect of redox changes in vivo on the differentiation of two <START:ana> human myeloid cell lines <END> , <START:ana> HL-60 <END> and <START:ana> KG-1 <END> . 
The glutathione-depleting agent diethyl maleate ( DEM ) prevented the development of differentiated features in response to phorbol esters , including adherence of the cells to plastic surfaces and repression of the <START:ggp> myeloperoxidase and CD34 genes <END> . 
Moreover , DEM abolished phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> , suggesting that inhibition of differentiation may be due , at least in part , to redox modifications of these <START:ggp> proteins <END> . 
Lipopolysaccharide induction of <START:ggp> tissue factor gene <END> expression in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> is mediated by binding of <START:ggp> c-Rel/p65 heterodimers <END> to a <START:ggp> kappa B-like site <END> . 
Exposure of <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) activates the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel family <END> of proteins and leads to the rapid induction of <START:ggp> inflammatory gene products <END> , including <START:ggp> tissue factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TF <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> TF <END> is the primary cellular initiator of the <START:ggp> coagulation protease <END> cascades . 
Here we report the characterization of a <START:ggp> nuclear complex <END> from human <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> that bound to a <START:ggp> kappa B-like site <END> , <START:ggp> 5'-CGGAGTTTCC-3 ' <END> , in the <START:ggp> 5'-flanking region <END> of the <START:ggp> human TF gene <END> . 
This <START:ggp> nuclear complex <END> was activated by LPS with kinetics that preceded induction of the <START:ggp> TF gene <END> . 
In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the <START:ggp> TF site <END> bound translated <START:ggp> c-Rel and p65 homodimers <END> but not <START:ggp> p50/p65 heterodimers <END> or <START:ggp> p50 homodimers <END> . 
Base-pair substitutions in the <START:ggp> TF site <END> indicated that the presence of a cytosine at <START:ggp> position 1 <END> precluded binding of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
In fact , under low-ionic-strength conditions , the <START:ggp> TF complex <END> did not migrate with translated <START:ggp> p50/p65 dimers <END> but instead comigrated with <START:ggp> c-Rel/p65 dimers <END> . 
Antibodies against the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and Rel proteins and UV cross-linking studies revealed the presence of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> and p65 and the absence of <START:ggp> p50 <END> in the <START:ggp> TF complex <END> and further showed that <START:ggp> c-Rel/p65 heterodimers <END> selectively bound to the <START:ggp> TF kappa B-like site <END> . 
Functional studies indicated that the <START:ggp> TF site <END> conferred LPS inducibility on a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> and was transactivated by <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> or p65 . 
Taken together , our results demonstrated that binding of <START:ggp> c-Rel/p65 heterodimers <END> to a novel <START:ggp> kappa B-like site <END> mediated LPS induction of <START:ggp> TF <END> gene expression in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
Inhibition of T cell activation by the <START:ggp> extracellular matrix protein <END> <START:ggp> tenascin <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tenascin <END> ( <START:ggp> TN <END> ) is an <START:ggp> extracellular matrix protein <END> that is expressed widely in the fetus and sparingly in the adult , but reappears at high levels in certain areas of tissue insult such as tumor matrices and sites of wound healing . 
We show here that soluble <START:ggp> TN <END> inhibits proliferation of <START:ana> human T cells <END> in response to <START:ggp> alpha CD3 Ab <END> co-immobilized with the <START:ggp> extracellular matrix protein <END> <START:ggp> fibronectin <END> ( <START:ggp> FN <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> TN <END> also inhibits proliferation driven by <START:ggp> alpha CD3/IL-2 <END> or by <START:ggp> phorbol ester/IL-2 , <END> and it prevents high level induction of <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> . 
The presence of <START:ggp> TN <END> in culture medium does not detectably alter the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation resulting from T cell triggering with <START:ggp> alpha CD3 <END> , but at later time points prevents the appearance of functional <START:ggp> NF-AT1 transcription factor complexes <END> in T cell nuclear extracts . 
These findings are consistent with the postulated role for <START:ggp> TN <END> as a natural antagonist to <START:ggp> FN <END> action , and suggest that T cell responses occurring at tissue sites in which <START:ggp> TN <END> is expressed could be influenced by its presence . 
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef protein down-regulates <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> in vitro after T-cell receptor stimulation . 
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) <START:ggp> negative factor <END> ( <START:ggp> Nef <END> ) has been shown to down-regulate the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> in vitro . 
To define the mechanism of action of the <START:ggp> Nef <END> protein , the signal transduction pathways which may be affected in <START:ana> T cells <END> by constitutive expression of the nef gene were examined . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> T cells <END> with tumor necrosis factor , interleukin-1 , or lipopolysaccharide resulted in the recruitment of transcriptional factors to a similar level whether or not the cells expressed the nef gene . 
On the other hand , stimulation of <START:ana> T cells <END> by mitogens or antibodies to the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) - <START:ggp> CD3 <END> complex resulted in the down-regulation of transcriptional factors <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> in cells expressing the nef gene compared with cells not expressing the nef gene . 
Because the <START:ggp> Nef <END> protein does not affect the surface expression of the <START:ggp> CD3 <END> -TCR complex , we conclude that the <START:ggp> Nef <END> protein down-regulates the transcriptional factors <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> in vitro through an effect on the TCR-dependent signal transduction pathway . 
Effects of alpha-lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid on expression of <START:ggp> proto-oncogene c-fos <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> is an important human mediator of the cellular response to serum , <START:ggp> growth factors <END> , and phorbol esters such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13 acetate ( TPA ) . 
The <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> complex consists of distinct <START:ggp> protein heterodimers <END> encoded by the <START:ggp> proto-oncogene c-fos <END> and <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> whose gene expression can be induced by TPA , cyclic AMP and <START:ggp> growth factors <END> . 
Recent findings suggest an involvement of reactive oxygen species in the pathway of TPA and <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> leading to expression of <START:ana> c-fos and c-jun mRNA <END> . 
To investigate the role of reactive oxygen species we studied the effects of alpha-lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid ( natural thiol antioxidants ) on the expression of <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> in <START:ana> human Jurkat T cells <END> . 
When cells were preincubated with dihydrolipoic acid ( 0.2 mM ) the expression of <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> was suppressed at 30 min after stimulation of TPA ( 0.5 microM ) whereas in the case of preincubation of alpha-lipoic acid ( 0.2 microM ) , the expression was enhanced at 30 min . 
These studies support the idea that superoxide anion radical plays a role in the expression of <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> . 
Appraisal of potential therapeutic index of antioxidants on the basis of their in vitro effects on HIV replication in <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> -induced lymphocyte proliferation . 
Antioxidant molecules have been suggested to be of therapeutic value in the treatment of HIV-infected patients . 
To evaluate this possibility , we examined in vitro the effects of two types of antioxidant molecules in terms of inhibition of HIV replication in <START:ana> monocytes <END> , one of the main reservoirs of HIV , and also in terms of modulation of the immune competence as measured by <START:ana> PBMC <END> proliferation . 
We tested the effects of BHA , a phenolic , lipid-soluble , chain-breaking antioxidant , and NAC , a known glutathione precursor with some direct free-radical scavenging properties as well , on the regulation of HIV-1 expression in latently infected <START:ana> U1 cells <END> and in productively and chronically infected <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
Both antioxidants inhibited <START:ggp> TNF <END> -or PMA-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity in <START:ana> U1 cells <END> , as well as the sustained <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity permanently induced by the virus itself in chronically HIV-infected <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
This resulted in only a partial inhibition of <START:ggp> TNF <END> -or PMA- induced HIV replication in <START:ana> U1 cells <END> , and no detectable effect on HIV replication in <START:ana> chronically infected U937 cells <END> . 
This may be the first limitation to potential antiviral effects of antioxidant therapies . 
Another limitation is that antioxidant concentrations high enough to block <START:ggp> NK-kappa B <END> activation were shown to have a suppressive effect on immune functions in vitro , because NAC and BHA blocked <START:ana> IL-2-induced PBMC <END> proliferation . 
These data warrant prudence in the design of antioxidant-based therapies aimed at suppressing HIV replication . 
Isolation and characterization of gelatinase granules from <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> . 
We recently confirmed the existence of gelatinase granules as a subpopulation of peroxidase-negative granules by double-labeling immunogold electron microscopy on intact cells and by subcellular fractionation . 
Further characterization of gelatinase granules has been hampered by poor separation of specific and gelatinase granules on both two-layer Percoll gradients and sucrose gradients . 
We have developed a three-layer Percoll density gradient that allows separation of the different granules and vesicles from <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> ; in particular , it allows separation of specific and gelatinase granules . 
This allows us to characterize these two granule populations with regard to their content of <START:ggp> membrane proteins <END> , which become incorporated into the plasma membrane during exocytosis . 
We found that gelatinase granules , defined as peroxidase-negative granules containing <START:ggp> gelatinase <END> but lacking <START:ggp> lactoferrin <END> , contain 50 % of total cell <START:ggp> gelatinase <END> , with the remaining residing in specific granules . 
Furthermore , we found that 20 % to 25 % of both the <START:ggp> adhesion protein Mac-1 <END> and the <START:ggp> NADPH-oxidase component cytochrome <END> <START:ggp> b558 <END> is localized in <START:ggp> gelatinase <END> granules . 
Although no qualitative difference was observed between specific granules and <START:ggp> gelatinase <END> granules with respect to <START:ggp> cytochrome b558 <END> and <START:ggp> Mac-1 <END> , stimulation of the <START:ana> neutrophil <END> with <START:ggp> FMLP <END> resulted in a selective mobilization of the least dense peroxidase-negative granules , ie , <START:ggp> gelatinase <END> granules , which , in concert with secretory vesicles , furnish the plasma membrane with <START:ggp> Mac-1 <END> and <START:ggp> cytochrome b558 <END> . 
This shows that <START:ggp> gelatinase <END> granules are functionally important relative to specific granules in mediating early inflammatory responses . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain <END> expression and <START:ggp> nuclear factor.kappa B <END> activation by <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Autocrine role of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> . 
The regulation of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> ) expression and <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> ( NF ) activation by <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) in <START:ana> resting T cells <END> , has been studied . 
Treatment of human <START:ana> resting T cells <END> with phorbol esters strongly induced the expression of <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> and the activation of <START:ggp> NF.kappa B <END> . 
This activation was due to the translocation of <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> <START:ggp> NF.kappa B <END> proteins from cytoplasmic stores to the nucleus , where they bound the <START:ggp> kappa B sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha promoter <END> either as <START:ggp> p50.p65 <END> or as <START:ggp> p50.c-Rel <END> heterodimers . 
Interestingly , all of those events were largely indirect and mediated by endogenously secreted <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> ) , as they were strongly inhibited by a <START:ggp> neutralizing anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody <END> . 
Furthermore , cyclosporin A , which blocked <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> production induced by <START:ggp> PKC <END> , strongly inhibited <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> and <START:ggp> NF.kappa B <END> activation . 
The addition of either <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> or <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> partially recovered cyclosporin A-induced <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> inhibition , but only <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> completely recovered <START:ggp> NF.kappa B <END> activation . 
Those results indicate that , in <START:ana> resting T cells <END> , <START:ggp> PKC <END> activation has only a triggering role , whereas the endogenously secreted <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> plays an essential role in the quantitative control of the expression of <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> chain or <START:ggp> NF.kappa B <END> activation . 
<START:ggp> Superantigens <END> activate HIV-1 gene expression in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
Binding of superantigens to <START:ggp> MHC class II molecules <END> results in transduction of biochemical signals leading to cellular activation and gene expression . 
We demonstrate that the <START:ggp> staphylococcal superantigens <END> <START:ggp> toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> TSST-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> staphylococcal enterotoxin A <END> ( <START:ggp> SEA <END> ) activate <START:ggp> HIV-1-LTR <END> -driven transcription of <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyl transferase <END> in the <START:ana> human monocytic cell line <END> <START:ana> THP-1 <END> . 
Induction of HIV-1- <START:ggp> LTR <END> -driven transcription in <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> by <START:ggp> superantigens <END> was associated with the induction of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> DNA-binding activity . 
<START:ggp> Superantigens <END> also increased viral protein secretion from the <START:ana> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-pretreated chronically infected human monocytic cell line U1 <END> . 
Induction of HIV-1 gene expression in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> by <START:ggp> superantigens <END> occurred via tumor necrosis factor-alpha-dependent and -independent mechanisms . 
Our results suggest that <START:ggp> superantigens <END> and other <START:ggp> MHC class II ligands <END> may activate HIV-1 gene expression in <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> . 
Mitogen activation of <START:ana> human peripheral T lymphocytes <END> induces the formation of new <START:ggp> cyclic AMP response element-binding protein nuclear complexes <END> . 
A large body of evidence indicates that experimental agents which raise cellular cAMP levels inhibit T cell growth and division . 
By contrast , many studies have reported that <START:ggp> mitogen <END> activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> increases cAMP levels , implying a positive physiological role for cAMP in the activation process . 
In the present study we demonstrate that <START:ggp> mitogen <END> activation of <START:ana> human peripheral T lymphocytes <END> induces nuclear factors that form complexes with <START:ggp> cyclic AMP response element-binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> CREB <END> ) . 
Four complexes are identified by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay , two of which are induced by <START:ggp> mitogen <END> activation . 
All four complexes contain <START:ggp> CREB <END> and are bound to the <START:ggp> cAMP response element ( CRE ) core sequence <END> ( TGACGTCA ) , as indicated by antibody and oligonucleotide competition experiments . 
Binding of the four complexes to <START:ggp> CRE <END> is prevented by dephosphorylation of nuclear extracts and is restored by rephosphorylation with <START:ggp> cAMP-dependent protein kinase <END> or <START:ggp> endogenous kinases <END> . 
Similar complexes are detected in nuclear extracts of <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
Mitogen induction of the <START:ggp> electrophoretic mobility shift assay complexes <END> is not accounted for by protein phosphorylation or by induction of <START:ggp> CREB <END> . 
Rather , the data indicate that mitogen increases the levels of a nuclear factor ( s ) that dimerizes with <START:ggp> CREB <END> . 
Induction of new <START:ggp> CREB complexes <END> implies a physiological role for cAMP in <START:ggp> mitogen <END> activation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Alpha-tocopherol inhibits agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion to <START:ana> cultured human endothelial cells <END> . 
Antioxidants have been proposed to be anti-atherosclerotic agents ; however , the mechanisms underlying their beneficial effects are poorly understood . 
We have examined the effect of alpha-tocopherol ( alpha-tcp ) on one cellular event in atherosclerotic plaque development , monocyte adhesion to <START:ana> stimulated endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> ECs <END> ) . 
Human umbilical vein <START:ana> ECs <END> were pretreated with alpha-tcp before stimulation with known agonists of monocyte adhesion : <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> ( 10 ng/ml ) , LPS ( 10 ng/ml ) , <START:ggp> thrombin <END> ( 30 U/ml ) , or PMA ( 10 nM ) . 
Agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion , but not basal adhesion , was inhibited in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by alpha-tcp . 
The IC50 of alpha-tcp on an <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -induced response was 45 microM . 
The inhibition correlated with a decrease in steady state levels of <START:ana> E-selectin mRNA <END> and cell surface expression of <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> which is consistent with the ability of a <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> to <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> to inhibit monocytic cell adhesion in this system . 
Probucol ( 50 microM ) and N-acetylcysteine ( 20 mM ) also inhibited agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion ; whereas , several other antioxidants had no significant effect . 
<START:ggp> Protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) does not appear to play a role in the alpha-tcp effect since no suppression of phosphorylation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> substrates was observed . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is reported to be necessary but not sufficient for <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> expression in <START:ana> EC <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays failed to show an alpha-tcp-induced decrease in activation of this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> after <START:ggp> cytokine <END> stimulation . 
It has been hypothesized that alpha-tcp acts as an anti-atherosclerotic molecule by inhibiting generation of oxidized LDL -- a putative triggering molecule in the atherosclerotic process . 
Our results point to a novel alternative mechanism of action of alpha-tcp . 
<START:ana> Central nervous system-derived cells <END> express a kappa B-binding activity that enhances human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription in vitro and facilitates <START:ggp> TAR <END> -independent transactivation by <START:ggp> Tat <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Tat protein <END> of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is a potent activator of <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> -directed transcription . 
While in most cell types , activation requires interaction of Tat with the unusual <START:ggp> transcription element <END> <START:ggp> TAR <END> , <START:ana> astrocytic glial cells <END> support <START:ggp> TAR <END> -independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription by Tat . 
This alternative pathway of <START:ggp> Tat <END> activation is mediated by the <START:ggp> viral enhancer <END> , a kappa B domain capable of binding the prototypical form of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> nuclear factor kappa B ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) present in many cell types , including <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tat <END> transactivation mediated by the <START:ggp> kappa B domain <END> is sufficient to allow replication of <START:ggp> TAR <END> -deleted mutant HIV-1 in <START:ana> astrocytes <END> . 
The present study demonstrates the existence of <START:ggp> kappa B-specific binding factors <END> present in <START:ana> human glial astrocytes <END> that differ from prototypical <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
The novel astrocyte-derived kappa B-binding activity is retained on an HIV-1 <START:ggp> Tat <END> affinity column , while prototypical <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> from <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> is not . 
In vitro transcription studies demonstrate that <START:ggp> astrocyte-derived kappa B-binding factors <END> activate transcription of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> and that this activation is dependent on the <START:ggp> kappa B domain <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> TAR <END> -independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription is reproduced in vitro in an astrocyte factor-dependent manner which correlates with kappa B-binding activity . 
The importance of the <START:ggp> central nervous system-enriched kappa B <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> in the regulation of HIV-1 expression is discussed . 
<START:ggp> Human interleukin-13 <END> activates the <START:ggp> interleukin-4-dependent transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-IL4 <END> sharing a <START:ggp> DNA binding motif <END> with an <START:ggp> interferon-gamma-induced nuclear binding factor <END> . 
The effects of <START:ggp> interleukin-13 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> ) and <START:ggp> interleukin-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) on cellular functions were shown to be quite similar . 
We provide evidence that in monocytes as well as in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> both <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> activate the same recently identified <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-IL4 <END> which binds to the <START:ggp> specific responsive element IL-4RE <END> . 
In addition , we show that a <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> activated by interferon-gamma also interacts with the <START:ggp> IL-4RE <END> . 
It differs from <START:ggp> NF-IL4 <END> in the electrophoretic mobility of the complex with DNA , in its DNA-binding specificity and in the proteins interacting with the <START:ggp> DNA sequence <END> . 
Sensitivity against various enzyme inhibitors suggests that components of the signal transduction pathway are shared by all three <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
Encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site RNA-protein interactions . 
Translational initiation of <START:ana> encephalomyocarditis virus ( EMCV ) mRNA <END> occurs by ribosomal entry into the <START:ggp> 5 ' nontranslated region <END> of the <START:ana> EMCV mRNA <END> , rather than by ribosomal scanning . 
Internal ribosomal binding requires a <START:ggp> cis-acting element <END> termed the <START:ggp> internal ribosomal entry site <END> ( <START:ggp> IRES <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> IRES elements <END> have been proposed to be involved in the translation of <START:ana> picornavirus mRNAs <END> and some <START:ana> cellular mRNAs <END> . 
Internal ribosome binding likely requires the interaction of <START:ggp> trans-acting factors <END> that recognize both the <START:ana> mRNA <END> and the <START:ggp> ribosomal complex <END> . 
Five <START:ggp> cellular proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> p52 <END> , <START:ggp> p57 <END> , <START:ggp> p70 <END> , <START:ggp> p72 <END> , and <START:ggp> p100 <END> ) cross-link the EMCV <START:ggp> IRES <END> or fragments of the <START:ggp> IRES <END> . 
For one of these proteins , <START:ggp> p57 <END> , binding to the <START:ggp> IRES <END> correlates with translation . 
Recently , <START:ggp> p57 <END> was identified to be very similar , if not identical , to <START:ggp> polypyrimidine tract-binding protein <END> . 
On the basis of cross-linking results with 21 different <START:ggp> EMCV IRES fragments <END> and cytoplasmic HeLa extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate as the source of polypeptides , <START:ggp> consensus binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> p52 <END> , <START:ggp> p57 <END> , <START:ggp> p70 <END> , and <START:ggp> p100 <END> are proposed . 
It is suggested that each of these proteins recognizes primarily a structural feature of the RNA rather than a specific sequence . 
A novel <START:ggp> heterodimerization partner <END> for <START:ggp> thyroid hormone receptor <END> . 
<START:ggp> Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <END> . 
<START:ggp> Retinoid-like receptors <END> play a central role in hormonal responses by forming <START:ggp> heterodimers <END> with other <START:ggp> nuclear hormone receptors <END> . 
In this study we have identified the <START:ggp> peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> PPAR <END> ) as a new <START:ggp> thyroid hormone receptor ( THR ) auxiliary nuclear protein <END> , heterodimerizing with <START:ggp> THR <END> in solution . 
Although these <START:ggp> heterodimers <END> do not recognize a classical <START:ggp> thyroid hormone response element <END> ( <START:ggp> TRE <END> ) characterized by direct repeat separated by four nucleotides ( <START:ggp> DR+4 <END> ) , <START:ggp> PPAR <END> behaves as a dominant negative regulator of thyroid hormone ( TH ) action . 
However , a TH-dependent positive effect is elicited by selective interaction of the <START:ggp> THR beta-PPAR <END> but not the <START:ggp> THR alpha-PPAR heterodimer <END> with a novel <START:ggp> TRE <END> ( <START:ggp> DR+2 <END> ) . 
The critical region of <START:ggp> THR <END> beta was mapped to 3 amino acids in the <START:ggp> distal box <END> of the <START:ggp> DNA binding domain <END> . 
Hence , <START:ggp> PPAR <END> can positively or negatively influence TH action depending on <START:ggp> TRE <END> structure and <START:ggp> THR isotype <END> . 
Comparison of retinoic acid and phorbol myristate acetate as inducers of monocytic differentiation . 
Several <START:ana> human myeloid leukemia cell lines <END> growing in vitro can be induced to differentiate to more mature <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage-like cells <END> by treatment with <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> -activating phorbol esters , such as PMA . 
In addition to PMA , cells of the <START:ana> THP-1 myeloid leukemia cell line <END> acquire macrophage-like characteristics after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) . 
To analyze the signal transduction mechanisms induced by RA , we first compared the effects of PMA and RA on the expression of genes which are known to be regulated during monocytic differentiation . 
Both RA and PMA effectively down-regulated <START:ggp> c-myc <END> expression , while <START:ggp> c-myb <END> expression decreased only after PMA treatment . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> beta 2-integrin genes <END> , <START:ggp> CD11a <END> and <START:ggp> CD11b <END> , was clearly increased after both of these treatments . 
Their effects on the <START:ggp> src-family tyrosine kinase genes <END> were different : <START:ggp> hck <END> expression was similarly induced by these agents but lyn expression was stronger and more rapid after RA treatment . 
RA also enhanced <START:ana> lyn mRNA <END> production rapidly in <START:ana> HL-60 <END> , indicating that the activation of <START:ggp> lyn gene <END> expression is common in monocytic and granulocytic maturation of <START:ana> myeloid leukemia cells <END> . 
To examine whether the <START:ggp> AP-1 enhancer <END> activity is involved in RA-induced monocytic differentiation , <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> were transiently transfected with a <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) -reporter gene <END> containing 5 copies of the <START:ggp> AP-1 binding sites <END> . 
In contrast to PMA , RA did not induce any <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity in these cells , thus suggesting that the RA-induced changes in the expression of those genes described above were not dependent on the <START:ggp> AP-1 enhancer <END> activity . 
An active <START:ggp> v-abl protein tyrosine kinase <END> blocks <START:ggp> immunoglobulin light-chain gene <END> rearrangement . 
<START:ana> Lymphoid cells <END> transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus have provided one of the classic models for study of early B-cell development and <START:ggp> immunoglobulin <END> rearrangement . 
Most of these cells have rearranged their <START:ggp> heavy-chain locus <END> but not their <START:ggp> light chain genes <END> , suggesting that an active <START:ggp> v-abl protein <END> interferes with this differentiation step . 
To test this hypothesis , <START:ggp> light-chain gene structure <END> was examined in <START:ana> pre-B cells <END> transformed by temperature-sensitive mutants of the Abelson virus and in derivatives that survive at the nonpermissive temperature because they express a <START:ggp> human BCL-2 gene <END> . 
Our studies reveal that inactivation of the <START:ggp> v-abl protein tyrosine kinase <END> triggers high-frequency rearrangement of <START:ggp> kappa and lambda light-chain genes <END> . 
These events are accompanied by marked increases in the expression of <START:ana> RAG-1 and RAG-2 RNAs <END> . 
These increases occur in the absence of protein synthesis but are dependent on inactivation of the <START:ggp> v-abl protein tyrosine kinase <END> . 
As documented in the accompanying paper ( Klug et al. , this issue ) , an active <START:ggp> v-abl protein <END> also suppresses the activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/rel <END> and expression controlled by the <START:ggp> kappa intron enhancer <END> . 
Together these data demonstrate that the <START:ggp> v-abl protein <END> specifically interferes with <START:ggp> light-chain gene <END> rearrangement by suppressing at least two pathways essential for this stage of <START:ana> B-cell <END> differentiation and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is important in regulating <START:ggp> RAG gene <END> expression . 
Calcium signalling in <START:ana> T cells <END> stimulated by a <START:ggp> cyclophilin B-binding protein <END> . 
The immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A blocks a calcium-dependent signal from the <START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) that normally leads to T-cell activation . 
When bound to <START:ggp> cyclophilin <END> , cyclosporin A binds and inactivates the key signalling intermediate <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
To identify potential cellular homologues of cyclosporin A that might regulate calcium signalling , we have cloned human genes encoding <START:ggp> cyclophilin B-binding-proteins <END> using the yeast two-hybrid system . 
One gene product , when overexpressed in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> , specifically induced transcription from the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 enhancer <END> , by activating the <START:ggp> T-cell-specific transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> and <START:ggp> NF-IL2A <END> . 
This protein , termed <START:ggp> calcium-signal modulating cyclophilin ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> CAML <END> ) , acts downstream of the <START:ggp> TCR <END> and upstream of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> by causing an influx of calcium . 
<START:ggp> CAML <END> appears to be a new participant in the calcium-signal transduction pathway , implicating <START:ggp> cyclophilin B <END> in calcium signalling , even in the absence of cyclosporin . 
Expression and genomic configuration of <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> , <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> , <START:ggp> M-CSF receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> C-FMS <END> ) , <START:ggp> early growth response gene-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> EGR-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> M-CSF genes <END> in primary myelodysplastic syndromes . 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seventeen patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) in advanced stage were enriched for <START:ana> blasts <END> and tested for ( 1 ) karyotype , ( 2 ) genomic configuration and ( 3 ) expression of <START:ggp> IL-3 , GM-CSF , FMS and EGR-1 genes <END> which are all located on the <START:ggp> long arm of chromosome 5 <END> . 
The expression of the <START:ggp> M-CSF gene <END> , that has been recently reassigned to the <START:ggp> short arm of chromosome 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> lp <END> ) , was also investigated . 
Aims of the study were to ( 1 ) assess the potential role of the expression of these genes in the maintenance and expansion of the <START:ana> neoplastic clones <END> and ( 2 ) search for constitutional losses or rearrangements of one <START:ggp> allele <END> followed by a deletion of the second <START:ggp> allele <END> of the same genes in the <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> . 
The latter issue was investigated by comparing , in 8 cases , <START:ggp> constitutive DNA <END> from <START:ana> skin fibroblasts <END> with <START:ggp> leukemic DNA <END> . 
Eleven of the 17 patients had abnormal karyotypes . 
The <START:ggp> M-CSF gene <END> was expressed in 6 cases and the <START:ggp> FMS <END> and the <START:ggp> EGR-1 genes <END> were expressed in 2 of the latter cases . 
An autocrine mechanism of growth could be hypothesized only for the 2 patients whose cells expressed both the <START:ggp> M-CSF and FMS genes <END> . 
No germline changes or rearrangements were observed in any of the genes studied . 
Thus , deregulation of genes encoding for certain <START:ggp> hemopoietic growth factors <END> or receptors does not seem to represent a major mechanism of MDS progression . 
A novel <START:ggp> human homeobox gene <END> distantly related to <START:ggp> proboscipedia <END> is expressed in lymphoid and pancreatic tissues . 
A novel <START:ggp> human homeobox gene <END> , <START:ggp> HB9 <END> , was isolated from a <START:ggp> cDNA library <END> prepared from in <START:ana> vitro stimulated human tonsil B lymphocytes <END> and from a <START:ggp> human genomic library <END> . 
The <START:ggp> HB9 gene <END> is composed of 3 <START:ggp> exons <END> spread over 6 kilobases of DNA . 
An <START:ggp> open reading frame <END> of 1206 nucleotides is in frame with a <START:ggp> diverged homeodomain <END> . 
The predicted <START:ggp> HB9 protein <END> has a molecular mass of 41 kilodaltons and is enriched for alanine , glycine , and leucine . 
The <START:ggp> HB9 homeodomain <END> is most similar to that of the <START:ggp> Drosophila melanogaster homeobox gene <END> <START:ggp> proboscipedia <END> . 
Northern blot analysis of <START:ana> poly ( A ) RNA <END> purified from the <START:ana> human B cell line RPMI 8226 <END> and from <START:ana> activated T cells <END> revealed a <START:ana> major mRNA transcript <END> of 2.2 kilobases . 
Similar analysis of <START:ana> poly ( A ) RNA <END> from a variety of adult tissues demonstrated <START:ggp> HB9 <END> transcripts in pancreas , small intestine , and colon . 
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to examine <START:ana> HB9 RNA transcripts <END> in <START:ana> hematopoietic cell lines <END> . 
<START:ana> HB9 RNA transcripts <END> were most prevalent in several <START:ana> human B cell lines <END> and <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
In addition , transcripts were detected in RNA prepared from <START:ana> tonsil B cells <END> and in situ hybridization studies localized them in the germinal center region of adult tonsil . 
These findings suggest the involvement of <START:ggp> HB9 <END> in regulating gene transcription in lymphoid and pancreatic tissues . 
<START:ggp> Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat <END> upregulates <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> secretion in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
Dysregulation of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> secreted by <START:ana> T cells <END> may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS . 
To investigate the effects of <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) Tat <END> on <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) expression , we used <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs <END> and <START:ana> IL-2-secreting Jurkat T cells <END> as a model system . 
Transient expression of <START:ggp> HIV-1 Tat <END> induced a five- to eightfold increase in <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> stimulated with <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> and phorbol myristate acetate . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion was increased more than twofold in both <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> and <START:ana> primary T cells <END> stimulated by <START:ggp> extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ana> mRNA <END> suggested that Tat exerts its effect on <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> primarily at the transcriptional level . 
The <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> at positions <START:ggp> -206 to -195 <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> was required but not sufficient for the <START:ggp> Tat <END> effect . 
The <START:ggp> Tat <END> -mediated increase in <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activity could selectively be blocked by antisense tat or-unlike the analogous effect of <START:ggp> human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax <END> -by cyclosporin A . 
The observed increase in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> levels might facilitate virus spread from or to <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Furthermore , it might contribute to the hypergammaglobulinemia or , together with other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> found to be dysregulated , the T-helper cell dysfunctions observed in AIDS patients . 
Activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> in <START:ana> human lymphoblastoid cells <END> by low-dose ionizing radiation . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) is a <START:ggp> pleiotropic transcription factor <END> which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several specific genes . 
Recent reports demonstrated that ionizing radiation in the dose range of 2-50 Gy results in expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> human KG-1 myeloid leukemia cells <END> and <START:ana> human B-lymphocyte precursor cells <END> ; the precise mechanism involved and the significance are not yet known . 
The present report demonstrates that even lower doses of ionizing radiation , 0.25-2.0 Gy , are capable of inducing expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> EBV-transformed 244B human lymphoblastoid cells <END> . 
These results are in a dose range where the viability of the cells remains very high . 
After exposure to 137Cs gamma rays at a dose rate of 1.17 Gy/min , a maximum in expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was seen at 8 h after a 0.5-Gy exposure . 
Time-course studies revealed a biphasic time-dependent expression after 0.5- , 1- and 2-Gy exposures . 
However , for each time examined , the expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was maximum after the 0.5-Gy exposure . 
The expression of the <START:ggp> p50 and p65 NF-kappa B subunits <END> was also shown to be regulated differentially after exposures to 1.0 and 2.0 Gy . 
Alternative splicing of <START:ana> RNA transcripts <END> encoded by the <START:ggp> murine p105 NF-kappa B gene <END> generates <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma isoforms <END> with different inhibitory activities . 
The gene encoding the <START:ggp> 105-kDa protein ( p105 ) precursor <END> of the <START:ggp> p50 <END> subunit of transcription factor <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> also encodes a <START:ggp> p70 I kappa B protein <END> , <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma <END> , which is identical to the <START:ggp> C-terminal 607 amino acids <END> of <START:ggp> p105 <END> . 
Here we show that alternative RNA splicing generates <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma isoforms <END> with properties different from those of <START:ggp> p70 <END> . 
One <START:ggp> 63-kDa isoform <END> , termed <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma-1 <END> , which lacks 59 amino acids C-terminal to <START:ggp> ankyrin repeat 7 <END> , has a novel <START:ggp> 35-amino acid C terminus <END> encoded by an <START:ggp> alternative reading frame <END> of the <START:ggp> p105 gene <END> . 
A <START:ggp> 55-kDa isoform <END> , <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma-2 <END> , lacks the <START:ggp> 190 C-terminal amino acids <END> of <START:ggp> p70 <END> <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma <END> . 
In contrast to <START:ggp> p70 <END> <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma <END> , which is a <START:ggp> cytoplasmic protein <END> , <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma-1 <END> is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus , whereas <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma-2 <END> is predominantly nuclear . 
The <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma isoforms <END> also display differences in specificity and affinity for <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B proteins <END> . 
While <START:ggp> p70 <END> <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma <END> inhibits p50- , p65- , and c-Rel-mediated transactivation and/or DNA binding , both <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma-1 <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma-2 <END> are specific for <START:ggp> p50 <END> and have different affinities for this subunit . 
The absence in <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma-1 <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma-2 <END> of a <START:ggp> protein kinase A site <END> whose phosphorylation modulates <START:ggp> p70 <END> <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma <END> inhibitory activity suggests that alternative RNA splicing may be used to generate <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma isoforms <END> that respond differently to intracellular signals . 
Structure and expression of the <START:ggp> human GATA3 gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> GATA3 <END> , a member of the <START:ggp> GATA family <END> that is abundantly expressed in the <START:ana> T-lymphocyte lineage <END> , is thought to participate in <START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> gene activation through binding to <START:ggp> enhancers <END> . 
To understand <START:ggp> GATA3 gene <END> regulation , we cloned the <START:ggp> human gene <END> and the <START:ggp> 5 ' end <END> of the <START:ggp> mouse GATA3 gene <END> . 
We show that the <START:ggp> human GATA3 gene <END> contains six <START:ggp> exons <END> distributed over 17 kb of DNA . 
The two <START:ggp> human GATA3 zinc fingers <END> are encoded by two separate <START:ggp> exons <END> highly conserved with those of <START:ggp> GATA1 <END> , but no other structural homologies between these two genes can be found . 
The <START:ggp> human and mouse GATA3 transcription units <END> start at a <START:ggp> major initiation site <END> . 
The promoter sequence analysis of these two genes revealed that they are embedded within a <START:ggp> CpG island <END> and share structural features often found in the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of <START:ggp> housekeeping genes <END> . 
Finally , we show that a <START:ggp> DNA fragment <END> containing the <START:ggp> human GATA3 transcription unit <END> , <START:ggp> 3 kb upstream <END> from the <START:ggp> initiation site <END> and <START:ggp> 4 kb downstream <END> from the <START:ggp> polyadenylation site <END> , displays T-cell specificity . 
Characterization of the <START:ggp> human gene <END> encoding <START:ggp> LBR <END> , an <START:ggp> integral protein <END> of the nuclear envelope inner membrane . 
We have characterized the <START:ggp> human gene <END> encoding <START:ggp> LBR <END> , an <START:ggp> integral protein <END> of the nuclear envelope inner membrane . 
Restriction mapping shows that the <START:ggp> transcription unit <END> spans approximately 35 kilobases . 
A transcription start site is located approximately 4 kilobases 5 ' to the <START:ggp> translation initiation codon <END> , and an RNA splice of 3863 bases occurs in the <START:ggp> 5'-untranslated region <END> to generate <START:ana> mature HeLa cell mRNA <END> . 
5 ' to the identified <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> are two <START:ggp> CCAAT sequences <END> and <START:ggp> potential recognition sites <END> for several <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> including <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> . 
There are 13 protein coding <START:ggp> exons <END> in the <START:ggp> LBR gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> LBR <END> 's <START:ggp> nucleoplasmic domain <END> is encoded by <START:ggp> exons 1-4 <END> , and its <START:ggp> hydrophobic domain <END> , with eight putative <START:ggp> transmembrane segments <END> , is encoded by <START:ggp> exons 5-13 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> hydrophobic domain <END> is homologous to three yeast polypeptides , suggesting that this <START:ggp> higher eukaryotic gene <END> could have evolved from recombination between a gene that encoded a <START:ggp> soluble nuclear protein <END> and a <START:ggp> membrane protein gene <END> similar to those in yeast . 
These results are the first to demonstrate the structural organization of a <START:ggp> vertebrate gene <END> encoding an <START:ggp> integral membrane protein <END> of the nuclear envelope that may be a member of a family of polypeptides conserved in evolution . 
Retinoic acid-induced expression of <START:ggp> CD38 antigen <END> in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> is mediated through <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor-alpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD38 <END> is a <START:ggp> leukocyte differentiation antigen <END> that has been thought to be a phenotypic marker of different subpopulations of <START:ana> T- and B- lymphocytes <END> . 
In <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> , <START:ggp> CD38 <END> is expressed during early stages of differentiation . 
Virtually no information is available on regulation and functions of <START:ggp> CD38 <END> . 
Recently we reported that all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is a potent and highly specific inducer of <START:ggp> CD38 <END> expression in <START:ana> human promyelocytic leukemia cells <END> . 
Here we report that ATRA-induced expression of <START:ggp> CD38 antigen <END> in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> is mediated through <START:ggp> retinoic acid-alpha receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> ) . 
ATRA failed to induce <START:ggp> CD38 <END> expression in a <START:ana> mutant subclone <END> of the <START:ana> HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line <END> ( designated <START:ana> HL-60R <END> ) that is relatively resistant to ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation . 
Retroviral vector-mediated transduction of <START:ggp> RA receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> ) into this <START:ana> HL-60R subclone <END> completely restored the sensitivity of these cells to ATRA in terms of their ability to express <START:ggp> CD38 <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> CD38 <END> expression was not inducible by ATRA in <START:ana> HL-60R cells <END> , transfected with a functional <START:ggp> RAR beta <END> , <START:ggp> RAR gamma <END> , or <START:ggp> RXR alpha receptor <END> . 
Induction of <START:ggp> CD38 <END> in <START:ana> acute promyelocytic and acute myeloblastic leukemia cells <END> was independent of ATRA-induced cytodifferentiation . 
Following culture with ATRA , increased <START:ggp> CD38 <END> protein levels were also observed in <START:ana> normal CD34+ bone marrow cells <END> , but not on <START:ana> normal circulating granulocytes <END> . 
From these results , we conclude that <START:ggp> CD38 <END> is ATRA inducible in <START:ana> myeloid leukemia cells <END> and <START:ana> normal CD34+ bone marrow cells <END> . 
This effect is independent of differentiation and is mediated by <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> in <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> , suggesting a similar role for <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> in <START:ggp> CD38 <END> expression in other <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> . 
Some antioxidants inhibit , in a co-ordinate fashion , the production of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-beta <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> by <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
Some antioxidants , including butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) , tetrahydropapaveroline ( THP ) , nordihydroguiauretic acid , and 10 , 11-dihydroxyaporphine ( DHA ) , were found to be potent inhibitors of the production of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> by <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( IC50s in the low micromolar range ) . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production was gene selective and not due to general effects on protein synthesis . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production by <START:ana> PBMC <END> was observed also when other inducers were used ( staphylococci , silica , zymosan ) . 
Much higher concentrations of other antioxidants -- including ascorbic acid , trolox , alpha-tocopherol , butylated hydroxytoluene , and the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton -- did not affect the production of these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
The active compounds did not inhibit <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -induced production of <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> , showing the cell selectivity of the effect . 
Antioxidant-mediated inhibition of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production was correlated with low levels of the corresponding <START:ana> messenger RNAs <END> . 
Nuclear run-on experiments showed that THP inhibited transcription of the <START:ggp> IL-1 beta gene <END> . 
THP decreased the concentration of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> detected in nuclear extracts of <START:ana> PBMC <END> cultured in the presence or absence of LPS . 
THP and DHA markedly decreased the levels of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> in the circulation of mice following LPS injection . 
Thus antioxidants vary widely in potency as inhibitors of the activation of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> and of the transcription of <START:ggp> genes <END> for <START:ggp> pro-inflammatory cytokines <END> . 
Coordinate inhibition of the transcription of genes for inflammatory <START:ggp> cytokines <END> could provide a strategy for therapy of diseases with inflammatory pathogenesis and for septic shock . 
An <START:ggp> interleukin-4-induced transcription factor <END> : <START:ggp> IL-4 Stat <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) is an immunomodulatory cytokine secreted by activated <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , <START:ana> basophils <END> , and <START:ana> mast cells <END> . 
It plays an important role in modulating the balance of <START:ana> T helper ( Th ) cell subsets <END> , favoring expansion of the <START:ana> Th2 lineage <END> relative to <START:ana> Th1 <END> . 
Imbalance of these <START:ana> T lymphocyte subsets <END> has been implicated in immunological diseases including allergy , inflammation , and autoimmune disease . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> may mediate its biological effects , at least in part , by activating a <START:ggp> tyrosine-phosphorylated DNA binding protein <END> . 
This protein has now been purified and its encoding gene cloned . 
Examination of the primary amino acid sequence of this protein indicates that it is a member of the <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat ) family <END> of <START:ggp> DNA binding proteins <END> , hereby designated <START:ggp> IL-4 Stat <END> . 
Study of the inhibitory activities of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides derived from the <START:ggp> intracellular domain of the IL-4 receptor <END> provided evidence for direct coupling of <START:ggp> receptor <END> and <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> during the <START:ggp> IL-4 Stat <END> activation cycle . 
Such observations indicate that <START:ggp> IL-4 Stat <END> has the same <START:ggp> functional domain <END> for both receptor coupling and dimerization . 
Evaluation of the respiratory epithelium of normals and individuals with cystic fibrosis for the presence of <START:ggp> adenovirus E1a sequences <END> relevant to the use of E1a- adenovirus vectors for gene therapy for the respiratory manifestations of cystic fibrosis . 
Lung disease associated with disorders such as cystic fibrosis ( CF ) may be amenable to somatic gene therapy in which there is delivery of the <START:ggp> normal gene <END> directly to the respiratory epithelium using E1a- adenovirus ( Ad ) type 2- or 5-based vectors . 
For safety reasons , the Ad vectors are rendered replication deficient by deletion of the <START:ggp> E1a region <END> . 
Because there is the theoretical possibility of an E1a- replication-deficient vector replicating as a result of recombination or complementation with <START:ggp> Ad 2/5 E1a sequences <END> present in the target cell , this study is directed toward evaluating respiratory epithelium of normals and individuals with CF for the presence of E1a sequences . 
Using <START:ggp> Ad 2/5 E1a-specific primers <END> and the polymerase chain reaction to evaluate DNA recovered from freshly isolated nasal and bronchial epithelium recovered by brushing , <START:ggp> E1a sequences <END> were detected in respiratory epithelium of 19 of 91 normals ( 21 % ) . 
In the E1a-positive samples , the average of E1a copy number was 55 +/- 18/10 ( 3 ) recovered cells . 
In CF individuals , 7 of 52 ( 13 % ) had detectable <START:ggp> E1a sequences <END> in the respiratory epithelium , with E1a copy number in the positive samples of 80 +/- 21/10 ( 3 ) recovered cells . 
These results demonstrate that there are detectable <START:ggp> Ad 2/5 E1a sequences <END> in the respiratory epithelium of a small percentage of normals and individuals with CF . 
Because of the theoretical potential of such sequences supporting replication of E1a- Ad vectors , human gene therapy protocols for CF utilizing such vectors should consider evaluating study individuals for the presence of <START:ggp> Ad 2/5 E1a sequences <END> in the respiratory epithelium . 
Leiomyosarcoma of the vulva : report of a case . 
A 52-year-old female presented with a progressively enlarging vulvar mass . 
Pathological evaluation revealed a high-grade vulvar leiomyosarcoma . 
Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies were performed to support the diagnosis . 
In an effort to better understand the biology of this tumor additional immunohistochemical studies for the <START:ggp> protein product <END> of <START:ggp> p53 tumor suppressor gene <END> and <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> expression by <START:ana> tumor cells <END> , as well as the type of <START:ana> immune cells <END> infiltrating the tumor were performed . 
<START:ana> Tumor cells <END> showed an overexpression of <START:ggp> p53 protein <END> and were <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> -positive . 
<START:ana> Macrophages <END> and <START:ana> T and B lymphocytes <END> infiltrated the tumor in moderate numbers with occasional lymphoid aggregate formation . 
This study is the first attempt to better understand the biology of these tumors . 
Stimulation of HIV replication in <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> by <START:ggp> leukemia inhibitory factor <END> . 
This study examined the effects of <START:ggp> leukemia inhibitory factor <END> ( <START:ggp> LIF <END> ) on human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) replication in <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> ( <START:ana> MNP <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> LIF <END> induced a dose-dependent increase in <START:ggp> p24 antigen <END> production in the <START:ana> chronically infected promonocytic cell line U1 <END> . 
The magnitude and time kinetics of the <START:ggp> LIF <END> effects were similar to <START:ggp> interleukin 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> ) , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) , other cytokines known to induce HIV replication in this cell line . 
To characterize mechanisms responsible for these <START:ggp> LIF <END> effects , levels of <START:ana> HIV mRNA <END> , activation of the <START:ggp> DNA binding protein nuclear factor <END> <START:ggp> ( NF ) -kB <END> , signal transduction pathways , and potential interactions with other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> were analyzed . 
<START:ggp> LIF <END> increased steady-state levels of <START:ana> HIV mRNA <END> at 2.0 , 4.3 , and 9.2 kB . 
This was detectable by 24 h and persisted until 72 h . 
The <START:ggp> DNA binding protein NF-kB <END> is a central mediator in <START:ggp> cytokine <END> activation of HIV transcription . 
<START:ggp> NF-kB <END> levels were higher in <START:ana> unstimulated U1 cells <END> as compared to the <START:ana> parent cell line <END> <START:ana> U937 <END> . 
In both cell lines <START:ggp> LIF <END> increased <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> activity . 
Induction of <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> and HIV replication by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> are at least in part dependent on reactive oxygen intermediates . 
The oxygen radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine , but not an inhibitor of <START:ggp> nitric oxide synthase <END> , inhibited <START:ggp> LIF <END> -induced HIV replication . 
<START:ggp> LIF <END> induces the production of other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> in monocytes but its effects on HIV replication were not inhibited by <START:ggp> antibodies <END> to <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> , <START:ggp> TNF <END> , or <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> . 
These results identify <START:ggp> LIF <END> as a stimulus of HIV replication . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Mechanisms involved in the inhibition of growth of a <START:ana> human B lymphoma cell line <END> , <START:ana> B104 <END> , by <START:ggp> anti-MHC class II antibodies <END> . 
The mechanisms involved in the inhibition of growth of a <START:ana> human B lymphoma cell line <END> , <START:ana> B104 <END> , by <START:ggp> anti-MHC class II antibodies <END> ( <START:ggp> Ab <END> ) were compared with those in <START:ggp> anti-IgM Ab <END> -induced B104 growth inhibition . 
Two <START:ggp> anti-MHC class II Ab <END> , <START:ggp> L227 <END> and <START:ggp> 2.06 <END> , inhibited the growth of <START:ana> B104 cells <END> , although <START:ggp> 2.06 <END> , but not <START:ggp> L227 <END> , needed to be further cross-linked with a <START:ggp> goat anti-mouse IgG Ab <END> ( <START:ggp> GAM <END> ) to show the effect . 
<START:ggp> L227 <END> induced an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ( [ Ca2+ ] i ) from the intracellular pool and little or no protein tyrosine phosphorylation , phosphatidyl inositol turnover , or expression of <START:ana> Egr-1 mRNA <END> , whereas <START:ggp> 2.06 <END> plus <START:ggp> GAM <END> induced an increase in [ Ca2+ ] i from both the intracellular and , in particular , the extracellular pools . 
The inhibition of <START:ana> B104 cell <END> growth induced by <START:ggp> anti-MHC class II Ab <END> was Ca ( 2+ ) -independent and not inhibited by actinomycin D or cyclosporin A , and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M interphase was not observed . 
These features are very different from those observed in <START:ana> B104 cell <END> death induced by <START:ggp> anti-IgM Ab <END> . 
Neither DNA fragmentation nor the morphology of apoptosis was observed . 
These findings demonstrate that cross-linking of <START:ggp> MHC class II molecules <END> transduced the negative signals through intracellular mechanisms different from those present in the cross-linking of surface <START:ggp> IgM <END> . 
Functional block for 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-mediated gene regulation in <START:ana> human B lymphocytes <END> . 
Elements necessary for the steroid hormone 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 ) to induce a biological response include the presence of specific <START:ggp> intracellular receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> vitamin D3 receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) ) and modulation of gene expression via hormone-activated receptor binding to <START:ggp> regulatory regions <END> of <START:ggp> target genes <END> . 
These parameters were examined in normal and <START:ana> Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized human B cells <END> and compared with <START:ana> 1 alpha , 25- ( OH ) 2D3-responsive cells <END> of the <START:ana> T and monocytic lineages <END> . 
Although resting tonsillar B cells did not express <START:ana> VDR mRNA <END> , activation of these cells with <START:ggp> interleukin-4 <END> induced <START:ggp> VDR <END> in the absence of exogenously supplemented 1 alpha , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 . 
As indicators of hormone-mediated gene regulation we analyzed modulation of <START:ggp> CD23 <END> , a <START:ggp> common B cell/monocyte surface antigen <END> , and <START:ggp> 24-hydroxylase <END> . 
1 alpha , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 inhibited <START:ggp> CD23 <END> expression in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> , yet failed to modulate <START:ggp> CD23 <END> expression in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Furthermore , 1 alpha , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 induced <START:ggp> 24-hydroxylase <END> mRNA expression and metabolic activity in both <START:ana> U937 cells <END> and <START:ana> lectin-activated T cells <END> , yet failed to induce <START:ana> 24-hydroxylase mRNA <END> or its metabolic activity in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
These findings suggest that although <START:ana> human B lymphocytes <END> can express <START:ana> VDR mRNA <END> and <START:ggp> protein <END> , they exhibit a functional block for vitamin D-dependent gene regulation . 
Positive and negative regulation of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> gene expression : role of multiple regulatory sites . 
Interleukin 2 ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) is an important <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> required in the process of T cell activation , proliferation , clonal expansion and differentiation . 
The <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> displays both T cell specific and inducible expression : it is only expressed in <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> after antigenic or mitogenic stimulation . 
Several <START:ggp> cis-acting regulatory sites <END> are required for induction of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> after stimulation . 
In this study , we have analysed the function of these <START:ggp> cis-acting regulatory sites <END> in the context of the native <START:ggp> IL-2 enhancer <END> and <START:ggp> promoter sequence <END> . 
The results of this study suggest that the <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ( <START:ggp> -276 to -261 <END> ) , the <START:ggp> distal octamer <END> ( <START:ggp> -256 to -248 <END> ) and the <START:ggp> proximal octamer <END> ( <START:ggp> -75 to -66 <END> ) sites not only act as enhancers of <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> transcription in the presence of cellular stimulation , but also have a silencing effect on <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> expression in resting cells . 
Two other sites display disparate effects on <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> expression in different <START:ana> T leukemia cell lines <END> : the <START:ggp> distal purine box <END> ( <START:ggp> -291 to -277 <END> ) and the <START:ggp> proximal purine box sites <END> ( <START:ggp> -145 to -128 <END> ) . 
Finally , the <START:ggp> AP-1 ( -186 to -176 ) and the kappa B sites <END> ( <START:ggp> -206 to -195 <END> ) respond to different cellular activation in <START:ana> EL4 cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> AP-1 site <END> mediated the response to PMA stimulation while the <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> responded to <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> stimulation . 
These data suggest that the regulation of <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> expression is a complex process and multiple <START:ggp> cis-acting regulatory sites <END> interact to exert different effects in <START:ana> T cells <END> representative of alternative stages of differentiation . 
<START:ggp> Sp1 <END> is a critical factor for the monocytic specific expression of <START:ggp> human CD14 <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD14 <END> is a <START:ggp> membrane glycoprotein <END> expressed specifically on <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> , and its expression is markedly increased during the process of <START:ana> monocyte <END> differentiation . 
In order to study <START:ggp> CD14 gene <END> regulation , the <START:ggp> human CD14 gene <END> was cloned from a partial <START:ggp> EcoRI digested chromosome 5 library <END> . 
A <START:ggp> 5.5-kilobase genomic clone <END> contained the full-length <START:ggp> CD14 coding sequence <END> and <START:ggp> 4.2 kilobases of 5'-upstream sequence <END> . 
One <START:ggp> major and one minor transcription start site <END> were identified <START:ggp> 101 and 130 base pairs ( bp ) upstream <END> , respectively , from the <START:ggp> protein translation start ATG <END> . 
A <START:ggp> DNA fragment <END> containing <START:ggp> 128 bp of upstream sequence <END> had strong , monocyte-specific promoter activity in the <START:ana> CD14 positive monocytic cell line <END> <START:ana> Mono Mac 6 <END> as compared to the <START:ana> nonmonocytic cell lines <END> <START:ana> HeLa <END> and <START:ana> REX <END> . 
Four regions in this <START:ggp> DNA fragment <END> interact with <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> isolated from <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> bound to three different regions in the <START:ggp> CD14 promoter <END> . 
Mutation of the <START:ggp> major Sp1 binding site <END> ( <START:ggp> -110 bp <END> ) decreased tissue-specific promoter activity , and these results , together with transactivation experiments , demonstrate that <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> plays a critical role in the tissue-specific expression of <START:ggp> CD14 <END> in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD14 <END> <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> site oligonucleotides bound preferentially to a <START:ggp> 105-kDa Sp1 species <END> , which is present in higher relative levels in <START:ana> monocytic <END> than <START:ana> non-monocytic cells <END> , suggesting that modification of <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , such as phosphorylation , may explain how the <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> site mediates monocytic specific promoter activity . 
The <START:ggp> interleukin-8 AP-1 and kappa B-like sites <END> are genetic end targets of FK506-sensitive pathway accompanied by calcium mobilization . 
FK506 , an immunosuppressant , inhibits the production of several <START:ggp> cytokines <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
We observed that FK506 suppressed the transcription of a <START:ggp> chemotactic cytokine <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin-8 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> ) in a <START:ana> human T cell line <END> , <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and calcium ( Ca2+ ) ionophore ( ionomycin ) . 
By deleted and mutated analysis of the <START:ggp> IL-8 promoters <END> , the <START:ggp> AP-1 and kappa B-like sites <END> were identified as the responsive elements for PMA and ionomycin . 
FK506 suppressed the transcriptions through the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> or <START:ggp> kappa B-like sites <END> induced by PMA plus Ca ( 2+ ) -mobilizing agents , but not those induced by Ca ( 2+ ) -independent stimuli . 
In gel retardation analysis , FK506 had little effect on the binding to the <START:ggp> AP-1 site <END> of PMA/ionomycin-induced nuclear factors , which were recognized with <START:ggp> anti-JunD <END> or <START:ggp> c-Fos antibody <END> . 
In contrast , FK506 or EGTA ( Ca2+ chelator ) similarly affected the formation of <START:ggp> kappa B-like site binding complexes <END> , which were not recognized by any <START:ggp> antibodies <END> against the <START:ggp> human Rel family proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , <START:ggp> p65 <END> , <START:ggp> p50 <END> , and <START:ggp> p49 <END> ) . 
Furthermore , we confirmed the previous report that FK506 suppressed the PMA/ionomycin-induced activation through authentic <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin ( Ig ) gene <END> , to which <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding was also decreased by FK506 , indicating that both <START:ggp> IL-8 kappa B-like site <END> and Ig <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> are FK506-sensitive in spite of the difference of <START:ggp> binding factors <END> . 
Our results indicate that not only the reported <START:ggp> IL-2 NF-AT and NFIL-2A sites <END> and Ig <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> , but also the <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> kappa B-like sites <END> are terminals of FK506-sensitive pathway involving Ca2+ mobilization . 
<START:ggp> Androgen binding sites <END> in <START:ana> peripheral human mononuclear leukocytes <END> of healthy males and females . 
<START:ggp> Androgen binding sites <END> have been identified in <START:ana> circulating human mononuclear leukocytes <END> of healthy donors of both sexes . 
Cells were separated from blood samples on a Ficoll gradient and incubated with different concentrations of [ 3H ] testosterone in the presence or absence of a 400-fold excess of unlabelled testosterone . 
Binding data were derived from Scatchard analysis . 
The <START:ggp> binding sites <END> fulfil the required criteria for specific <START:ggp> steroid binding sites <END> however differ somewhat from the classic <START:ggp> androgen receptors <END> from <START:ana> genital skin fibroblast <END> : in fertile adult males ( n = 20 ) the <START:ggp> binding sites <END> showed ( 1 ) a high affinity for testosterone ( 1.32 +/- 0.49 nM ; mean +/- SD ) , ( 2 ) a saturable capacity ( 184 +/- 52 <START:ggp> binding sites <END> per cell ; mean +/- SD ) , and ( 3 ) a characteristic competitive binding profile for other steroid hormones ( relative binding affinities : testosterone = dihydrotestosterone > 17 beta-estradiol > progesterone , whereas aldosterone , 17-hydroxy-progesterone and cortisol did not compete appreciably ) . 
Furthermore the number of <START:ggp> binding sites <END> determined using [ 3H ] dihydrotestosterone , [ 3H ] RU-1881 , or [ 3H ] testosterone were comparable . 
This raises the possibility that <START:ggp> androgen receptors <END> in <START:ana> peripheral mononuclear leukocytes <END> differ from those in <START:ana> genital skin fibroblasts <END> . 
There was no apparent correlation between serum testosterone concentrations and <START:ggp> androgen binding sites <END> . 
In fertile women remarkable changes in <START:ggp> androgen binding sites <END> were seen in the course of the menstrual cycle , with a significant increase in the immediate preovulatory period . 
The presence of <START:ggp> androgen receptors <END> in <START:ana> peripheral mononuclear leukocytes <END> provides for the first time the experimental basis for an hypothesis of direct , receptor-mediated effects of androgens on <START:ana> mature immunocompetent cells <END> . 
The immunological implications of these results are discussed . 
Induction of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> uses the <START:ggp> CD28 <END> costimulatory pathway . 
<START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , a potent <START:ggp> chemotactic factor <END> for <START:ana> neutrophil granulocytes <END> and <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted by a variety of cell types , including <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Stimulation of the <START:ggp> CD28 cell surface molecule <END> delivers costimulatory signals essential for <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> production in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> via a <START:ggp> conserved sequence element <END> found in the <START:ggp> promoter <END> of several <START:ggp> lymphokine genes <END> . 
<START:ana> Anti-CD28-stimulated T cells <END> produced significant amounts of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> ; additionally , costimulation with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> anti-CD28 Abs <END> resulted in a synergistic induction of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> secretion . 
Sequence homology , single nucleotide mutations , and <START:ggp> anti-CD28 Ab <END> stimulation studies established that the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-like sequence <END> in the <START:ggp> promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-8 gene <END> functioned as a <START:ggp> CD28 response element <END> . 
Furthermore , cyclosporin A , but not rapamycin , blocked the synergistic induction of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> expression achieved with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> and anti- <START:ggp> CD28 <END> costimulation . 
The involvement of a <START:ggp> CD28 response element <END> in the induction of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> expression in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> may provide new insights into the pathogenesis and persistence of immune disorders characterized by increased levels of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis . 
<START:ggp> MHC class II <END> signaling in <START:ana> B-cell <END> activation [ see comments ] 
The cognate interaction between <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> antigen-presenting cells <END> ( <START:ana> APCs <END> ) , mediated by <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II molecules <END> , results in the delivery of activation signals to the <START:ana> APC <END> . 
These signals contribute to the expression of co-stimulatory activity by <START:ana> APCs <END> and have important consequences for cell effector function . 
<START:ggp> MHC class II <END> molecules also serve as receptors for <START:ana> B-cell <END> stimulation by <START:ggp> microbial superantigens <END> . 
In this review , Paul Scholl and Raif Geha discuss recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms of <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> signaling and analyse their role in human <START:ana> B-cell <END> activation . 
Effects of glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis . 
Diminished <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> do not result in glucocorticoid resistance . 
OBJECTIVE . 
Lymphocytes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) have diminished receptor density ; thus , patients with RA should show partial resistance to glucocorticoids . 
We investigated the glucocorticoid sensitivity of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> in RA patients compared with healthy subjects . 
METHODS . 
We determined the effects of glucocorticoids on <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> proliferation and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> release . 
RESULTS . 
Proliferation and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> release were inhibited in RA patients to the same extent as in healthy controls . 
CONCLUSION . 
Diminished receptor density in RA patients does not result in glucocorticoid resistance . 
Arrested development : understanding <START:ggp> v-abl <END> . 
The <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase <END> activity of the <START:ggp> v-abl oncogene <END> has been demonstrated to subvert the normal second messenger systems used by <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> for growth and differentiation . 
Transformation of bone marrow with the Abelson murine leukemia virus results in the appearance of <START:ana> B cell lineage cells <END> arrested at the pre-B cell stage . 
Recent reports have characterized these cells expressing high <START:ggp> v-abl <END> kinase activity as deficient in detectable <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA binding activity and low level <START:ggp> RAG gene <END> expression . 
These observations suggest that <START:ggp> v-abl <END> may be inhibiting the differentiation of <START:ana> B cells <END> by blocking these two crucial elements in the maturation pathway . 
<START:ggp> Corticosteroid receptors <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> : a possible marker of brain involution ? 
A similarity has recently been found between the regulation of <START:ggp> corticosteroid receptors <END> in brain and in lymphoid tissue . 
We have studied the regulation of <START:ggp> corticosteroid receptors <END> in <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> as a possible marker of brain involution . 
<START:ggp> Type I corticosteroid receptors <END> are down regulated by excess of mineralocorticoids ( primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism , pseudohyperaldosteronism ) and of glucocorticoids ( Cushing 's syndrome ) . <START:ggp> Type II corticosteroid receptors <END> are not reduced by excess of endogenous corticosteroids ( Cushing 's syndrome ) . 
In normal adults there is a direct significant correlation between plasma cortisol and <START:ggp> Type I <END> and between plasma cortisol and <START:ggp> Type II receptors <END> in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> , while in Cushing 's syndrome the correlation is inverse between plasma cortisol at 8 a.m. and <START:ggp> Type II receptors <END> . 
In an aged population the mean numbers of <START:ggp> Type I <END> and of <START:ggp> Type II receptors <END> are lower and plasma cortisol is higher than in adult controls , but the increase of plasma cortisol is not followed by a clinical picture of hypercorticism . 
<START:ggp> Corticosteroid Type I and Type II receptors <END> are inversely correlated with age . 
After dexamethasone suppression ( 1 mg at 11 p.m. ) <START:ggp> Type I receptors <END> always decrease in controls while the response of <START:ggp> Type II <END> is not homogeneous . 
In an aged group of patients , both receptors are reduced by dexamethasone . 
We conclude that the decrease with age of <START:ggp> corticosteroid receptors <END> is possibly related to a physiological involution of <START:ggp> corticosteroid receptors <END> and that this reduction does increase plasma cortisol concentration , without affecting the glucocorticoid effector mechanism . 
All-trans retinoic acid and 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 co-operate to promote differentiation of the <START:ana> human promyeloid leukemia cell line <END> <START:ana> HL60 <END> to <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
A basis for differentiation therapy of leukemias is provided by knowledge of agents which induce specific lineage maturation . 
All-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) induces differentiation of <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> to <START:ana> neutrophils <END> and is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia . 
We observed that RA did not induced neutrophil differentiation in <START:ana> serum-free grown HL60 cells <END> whereas 50 nM 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( D3 ) induced maximal monocyte differentiation . 
Increasing RA concentrations reduced the D3 concentration required for monocyte differentiation . 
Cells treated with 5 nM D3 showed little response , but differentiated maximally with 5 nM D3 and 10 nM RA . 
The D3 analogs MC903 , EB1089 and KH1060 were more potent inducers of monocyte differentiation . 
The extent to which analog activity was increased after cotreatment with RA was inversely related to potency . 
Twenty-four hour treatment with 10 nM <START:ana> RA primed cells <END> for response to 5 nM D3 ; the reverse sequence being ineffective . 
Priming with 10 nM RA , or subsequent treatment with D3 ( 5 nM ) , did not alter expression of <START:ana> mRNAs <END> encoding <START:ggp> receptors <END> for D3 ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) , RA ( <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> ) or 9-CIS RA ( <START:ggp> RXR alpha , beta , gamma <END> ) . 
That RA promotes both neutrophil and monocyte differentiation has implications for the use of RA and D3 in treatment of leukemias and provides insight into mechanisms whereby RAR , <START:ggp> VDR <END> and <START:ggp> RXR <END> facilitate monocyte differentiation . 
[ An overexpression of <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor alpha <END> blocks <START:ana> myeloid cell <END> differentiation at the promyelocyte stage ] 
Retinoic acid ( RA ) , a vitamin A derivative , exerts a wide range of biological effects related to cell proliferation and differentiation . 
The pleiotropic effects of RA are thought to be mediated through specific nuclear <START:ggp> RA receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RARs <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> RARs <END> are members of the <START:ggp> steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily <END> and exhibit a molecular structure that possess discrete DNA-binding and <START:ggp> RA ( ligand ) -binding domains <END> . 
In hematopoietic system , RA and <START:ggp> RARs <END> , predominantly <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> may play key roles for the proliferation and differentiation of <START:ana> hematopoietic progenitors <END> . 
However , it is currently unknown how RA and <START:ggp> RARs <END> are involved in regulating normal hematopoietic differentiation . 
To make clear the roles of RA and <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> in the normal hematopoiesis , I have introduced the construct of <START:ggp> human RAR alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> hRAR alpha <END> ) into <START:ana> murine bone marrow cells <END> with retroviral vector , and selected infected cells with <START:ggp> drug resistant marker <END> ( <START:ggp> Neo ( r ) <END> ) cultured on the <START:ana> stroma cell line <END> ( <START:ana> PA6-neo <END> ) , and analyzed the behavior of <START:ana> infected cells <END> . 
All of procedure were done in vitro . 
Most cells infected with <START:ggp> hRAR alpha <END> exhibited <START:ana> promyelocytic morphology <END> and were thought to be blocked at the promyelocytic stage in their myeloid differentiation . 
Furthermore , these <START:ana> immature cells <END> differentiated terminally into mature granulocytes by adding with RA ( 10 ( -6 ) M ) . 
<START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> <START:ana> infected cells <END> were also able to differentiate into <START:ana> mature macrophages <END> in the both of long term culture and <START:ana> IL3 colony <END> . 
These observations suggest that an overexpression of <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> alone is effective to suppress <START:ana> myeloid cell <END> differentiation and <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> plays a crucial role in the terminal differentiation of myeloid precursors . 
The system described here may serve as a model for studying the the <START:ggp> essential genes <END> for differentiation of <START:ana> normal bone marrow cells <END> . 
Hypoxic induction of <START:ggp> interleukin-8 gene <END> expression in <START:ana> human endothelial cells <END> . 
Because leukocyte-mediated tissue damage is an important component of the pathologic picture in ischemia/reperfusion , we have sought mechanisms by which <START:ana> PMNs <END> are directed into hypoxic tissue . 
Incubation of <START:ana> human endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> ECs <END> ) in hypoxia , PO2 approximately 14-18 Torr , led to time-dependent release of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> antigen into the conditioned medium ; this was accompanied by increased chemotactic activity for <START:ana> PMNs <END> , blocked by antibody to <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> . 
Production of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> by hypoxic <START:ana> ECs <END> occurred concomitantly with both increased levels of <START:ana> IL-8 mRNA <END> , based on polymerase chain reaction analysis , and increased <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> transcription , based on nuclear run-on assays . 
Northern analysis of mRNA from hypoxic <START:ana> ECs <END> also demonstrated increased levels of <START:ana> mRNA <END> for <START:ggp> macrophage chemotactic protein-1 <END> , another member of the <START:ggp> chemokine superfamily <END> of <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-8 gene <END> induction was associated with the presence of increased binding activity in nuclear extracts from <START:ana> hypoxic ECs <END> for the NF-kB site . 
Studies with human umbilical vein segments exposed to hypoxia also demonstrated increased elaboration of <START:ggp> IL-8 antigen <END> compared with normoxic controls . 
In mice exposed to hypoxia ( PO2 approximately 30-40 Torr ) , there was increased pulmonary leukostasis , as evidenced by increased <START:ggp> myeloperoxidase <END> activity in tissue homogenates . 
In parallel , increased levels of transcripts for <START:ggp> IP-10 <END> , a murine homologue in the <START:ggp> chemokine family <END> related to <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , were observed in hypoxic lung tissue . 
Taken together , these data suggest that hypoxia constitutes a stimulus for leukocyte chemotaxis and tissue leukostasis . 
<START:ggp> Thrombin <END> and <START:ggp> thrombin receptor <END> agonist peptide induce early events of T cell activation and synergize with <START:ggp> TCR <END> cross-linking for <START:ggp> CD69 <END> expression and interleukin 2 production . 
<START:ggp> Thrombin <END> stimulation of the <START:ana> T leukemic cell line Jurkat <END> induced a transient increase in [ Ca2+ ] i . 
Proteolytic activity of the <START:ggp> enzyme <END> was required for this effect since <START:ggp> diisopropyl fluorophosphate-thrombin <END> failed to increase [ Ca2+ ] i . 
Furthermore , hirudin and <START:ggp> anti-thrombin III <END> inhibited the thrombin-induced [ Ca2+ ] i rise in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
A synthetic <START:ggp> thrombin receptor <END> agonist peptide ( TRP ) of 7 residues ( SFLLRNP ) was found to be as effective as <START:ggp> thrombin <END> for [ Ca2+ ] i mobilization , and both agonists induced Ca2+ release exclusively from internal stores . 
<START:ggp> Thrombin <END> stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins of <START:ggp> molecular mass 40 , 42 , 70 , 120 , and 130 kDa <END> . 
There was a good correlation between <START:ggp> thrombin <END> -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter three proteins and Ca2+ mobilization . 
<START:ggp> Thrombin <END> and TRP also caused translocation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> from the cytosol to the plasma membrane . 
As a likely consequence of these events , <START:ggp> thrombin <END> activated the <START:ggp> nuclear factor NF-kB <END> . 
Several cell lines of hematopoietic origin including the <START:ana> leukemic T cell line HPB.ALL <END> and the <START:ana> erythroleukemic cell line K562 <END> were responsive to <START:ggp> thrombin <END> , whereas others such as <START:ana> THP1 <END> , a <START:ana> myelomonocytic cell line <END> , and <START:ana> BL2 , <END> a <START:ana> Burkitt lymphoma <END> were refractory to <START:ggp> thrombin <END> or TRP stimulation . 
The magnitude of the <START:ggp> thrombin <END> response in the different cell types paralleled the expression of the <START:ana> thrombin receptor mRNA <END> . 
We found that activation of <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> by a combination of <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate led to a dramatic inhibition of <START:ana> thrombin receptor mRNA <END> expression and to a concomitant loss of the <START:ggp> thrombin <END> response . 
Finally , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> thrombin <END> and TRP enhanced <START:ggp> CD69 <END> expression and <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> production induced by <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> cross-linking in both <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> and peripheral blood <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
These findings highlight the role of <START:ggp> thrombin <END> as a potential regulator of <START:ana> T lymphocyte <END> activation . 
Stress response of <START:ana> senescent T lymphocytes <END> : reduced <START:ggp> hsp70 <END> is independent of the proliferative block . 
<START:ana> Senescent human T lymphocyte cultures <END> are unable to undergo proliferation , but show no difference from <START:ana> early passage cells <END> in cytotoxic function or surface antigenic profile . 
A second feature of <START:ana> senescent T cells <END> is the dramatic reduction in <START:ggp> hsp70 <END> production in response to heat shock . 
This decline is associated with a decrease in binding of nuclear extracts to the <START:ggp> consensus heat shock element <END> . 
Interestingly , the progressive decline in the heat shock response of <START:ana> cultured T cells <END> correlates with the percent proliferative life span completed rather than with the actual proliferative activity at the time of heat shock . 
This suggests that for <START:ana> senescent T cells <END> the reduced ability to respond to heat shock by producing <START:ggp> hsp70 <END> , although possibly lying at the level of transcriptional control , may nevertheless be unrelated to the reduced DNA synthesis or the diminished proliferative activity also manifested by these cells . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> phospholipase D <END> in the activation of <START:ggp> transcription factor AP-1 <END> in <START:ana> human T lymphoid Jurkat cells <END> . 
The induction of the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> has been ascribed to the early events leading to T lymphocyte activation . 
We have examined the possibility that stimulation of <START:ggp> phospholipase D <END> ( <START:ggp> PLD <END> ) may regulate activation of <START:ggp> transcription factor AP-1 <END> in human T cells by transfecting human <START:ana> T lymphocyte Jurkat cells <END> with a plasmid containing an <START:ggp> AP-1 enhancer element <END> and a <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene <END> . 
We have detected activatable <START:ggp> PLD <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , and we have found that addition of phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , the physiologic product of <START:ggp> PLD <END> action on phospholipids , is rapidly incorporated into <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> and leads to activation of <START:ggp> transcription factor AP-1 <END> . 
Treatment of <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 mAb <END> activated both <START:ggp> PLD <END> and <START:ggp> transcription factor AP-1 <END> . 
Wortmannin , an inhibitor of receptor-coupled <START:ggp> PLD <END> activation , blocked the <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> -induced increases in both <START:ggp> PLD <END> activity and <START:ggp> AP-1 enhancer <END> activity . 
We found a good correlation in the <START:ana> transfected cells <END> between <START:ggp> PLD <END> activation and induction of <START:ggp> AP-1 enhancer <END> activity under different experimental conditions . 
Furthermore , ethanol , an inhibitor of the <START:ggp> PLD <END> pathway , blocked the anti-CD3-stimulated <START:ggp> AP-1 enhancer <END> activity . 
However , this <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> -mediated response was not inhibited by neomycin , an inhibitor of phosphoinositide hydrolysis . 
The increases in <START:ggp> AP-1 enhancer <END> activity induced by PA or <START:ggp> anti-CD3 mAb <END> were efficiently abrogated by the presence of propranolol , an inhibitor of PA <START:ggp> phosphohydrolase <END> and <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) . 
Furthermore , the PA -and the <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> -induced increases in <START:ggp> AP-1 enhancer <END> activity were blocked by the presence of <START:ggp> PKC <END> inhibitors or by <START:ggp> PKC <END> down-regulation . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> PLD <END> stimulation can activate the <START:ggp> transcription factor AP-1 <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , and suggest that the induction of <START:ggp> AP-1 enhancer <END> factor activity by PA is mediated via <START:ggp> PKC <END> stimulation , either through a direct activating effect of PA or through PA-derived diacylglycerol formation . 
These data also provide evidence for a role of <START:ggp> PLD <END> -derived lipids in the induction of <START:ggp> AP-1 enhancer <END> activity resulting from stimulation of the <START:ggp> TCR/CD3 complex <END> , suggesting that increased <START:ggp> PLD <END> activity can play an important role in <START:ana> T lymphocyte <END> activation . 
Upregulation of <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> by the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein <END> <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> : a B-cell-specific response that is delayed relative to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation and to induction of <START:ggp> cell surface markers <END> . 
An ability of the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein <END> <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> to enhance the survival of <START:ana> infected B cells <END> through upregulation of the <START:ggp> bcl-2 oncogene <END> was first suggested by experiments involving gene transfection and the selection of stable <START:ana> LMP1+ clones <END> ( S.Henderson , M. Rowe , C.Gregory , F.Wang , E.Kieff , and A.Rickinson , Cell 65 : 1107-1115 , 1991 ) . 
However , it was not possible to ascertain whether <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> upregulation was a specific consequence of <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> expression or an artifact of the selection procedure whereby rare <START:ana> Bcl-2+ cells <END> already present in the starting population might best be able to tolerate the potentially toxic effects of <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> . 
We therefore reexamined this issue by using two different experimental approaches that allowed <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> -induced effects to be monitored immediately following expression of the viral protein and in the absence of selective pressures ; activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> and upregulation of the <START:ggp> cell adhesion molecule <END> <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> were used as early indices of <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> function . 
In the first approach , stable clones of two <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> carrying an <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> gene under the control of an inducible <START:ggp> metallothionein promoter <END> were induced to express <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> in all cells . 
Activation of <START:ggp> NK-kappa B <END> and upregulation of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> occurred within 24 h and were followed at 48 to 72 h by upregulation of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> . 
In the second approach , we tested the generality of this phenomenon by transiently expressing <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> from a strong constitutively active promoter in a range of different cell types . 
All six <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> tested showed <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in response to <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> expression , and this was followed in five of six lines by expression of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> . 
In the same experiments , all three non- <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> showed <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation and <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> upregulation but never any effect upon <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> . 
We therefore conclude that <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> upregulation is part of the panoply of cellular changes induced by <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> but that the effect is cell type specific . 
Our data also suggest that whilst <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> may be an essential component of <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> signal transduction , other <START:ggp> cell-specific factors <END> may be required to effect some functions of the <START:ggp> viral protein <END> . 
Long-term inositol phosphate release , but not <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activity , correlates with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> induction in <START:ana> anti-CD3-activated peripheral human T lymphocytes <END> . 
The cascade of events within the first few minutes of <START:ana> T cell <END> stimulation has been well characterized . 
Although many second messengers have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for <START:ana> T cell <END> activation in a number of model systems , the rate-limiting step in <START:ana> peripheral T cells <END> has not been demonstrated . 
To model effective versus ineffective <START:ggp> CD3 <END> -mediated stimulation in <START:ana> peripheral T cells <END> , we used two <START:ggp> anti-CD3 mAbs <END> that differ in their ability to stimulate <START:ana> purified T cells <END> : <START:ggp> OKT3 <END> , which causes early second messenger generation but is unable to activate <START:ana> T cells <END> without a second signal , and <START:ggp> 64.1 <END> , which stimulates <START:ana> T cell <END> proliferation on its own . 
We found that <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activity was similar for both <START:ggp> mAbs <END> over a period of hours . 
However , the inositol phosphate response was stronger for <START:ggp> 64.1 <END> than for <START:ggp> OKT3 <END> . 
To tie these events to gene activation , we measured <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> activity in the nucleus after <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> stimulation . 
Both stimuli induced the appearance of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B components <END> ( <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , <START:ggp> p65 <END> ( <START:ggp> RelA <END> ) , and <START:ggp> p50 <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 <END> ) ) and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA binding activity in the nucleus . 
However , only <START:ggp> 64.1 <END> induced <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> in the nucleus , correlating with its ability to activate <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> induction and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion were correlated with the levels of inositol phosphate release but not with gross levels of <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activity induced late following the response . 
On the other hand , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> induction and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> receptor expression occurred even with the smaller second messenger response generated by <START:ggp> OKT3 <END> . 
HLA-DR- , CD33+ , CD56+ , CD16- myeloid/natural killer cell acute leukemia : a previously unrecognized form of acute leukemia potentially misdiagnosed as French-American-British acute myeloid leukemia-M3 [ see comments ] 
We have identified and characterized a previously unrecognized form of acute leukemia that shares features of both <START:ana> myeloid and natural killer ( NK ) cells <END> . 
From a consecutive series of 350 cases of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , we identified 20 cases ( 6 % ) with a unique immunophenotype : CD33+ , CD56+ , CD11a+ , CD13lo , CD15lo , CD34+/- , <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> - , <START:ggp> CD16 <END> - . 
Multicolor flow cytometric assays confirmed the coexpression of <START:ggp> myeloid ( CD33 , CD13 , CD15 ) and NK cell-associated ( CD56 ) antigens <END> in each case , whereas reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assays confirmed the identity of <START:ggp> CD56 <END> ( <START:ggp> neural cell adhesion molecule <END> ) in <START:ana> leukemic blasts <END> . 
Although two cases expressed <START:ggp> CD4 <END> , no case expressed <START:ggp> CD2 <END> , <START:ggp> CD3 <END> , or <START:ggp> CD8 <END> and no case showed clonal rearrangement of genes encoding the <START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR beta , gamma , delta <END> ) . 
Leukemic blasts in the majority of cases shared unique morphologic features ( deeply invaginated nuclear membranes , scant cytoplasm with fine azurophilic granularity , and finely granular Sudan black B and <START:ggp> myeloperoxidase <END> cytochemical reactivity ) that were remarkably similar to those of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) ; particularly the <START:ggp> microgranular variant <END> ( <START:ggp> FAB AML-M3v <END> ) . 
However , all 20 cases lacked the t ( 15 ; 17 ) and 17 cases tested lacked the <START:ana> promyelocytic/retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR alpha ) fusion transcript <END> in RT-PCR assays ; 12 cases had 46 , XX or 46 , XY karyotypes , whereas 2 cases had abnormalities of <START:ggp> chromosome 17q <END> : 1 with <START:ggp> del ( 17 ) ( q25 ) <END> and the other with <START:ggp> t ( 11 ; 17 ) ( q23 ; q21 ) <END> and the <START:ana> promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger/RAR alpha fusion transcript <END> . 
All cases tested ( 6/20 ) , including the case with <START:ggp> t ( 11 ; 17 ) <END> , failed to differentiate in vitro in response to all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , suggesting that these cases may account for some APLs that have not shown a clinical response to ATRA . 
Four of 6 cases tested showed functional NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity , suggesting a relationship between these unique CD33+ , CD56+ , <START:ggp> CD16 <END> -acute leukemias and <START:ana> normal CD56+ , CD16- NK precursor cells <END> . 
Using a combination of panning and multiparameter flow cytometric sorting , we identified a <START:ana> normal CD56+ , CD33+ , CD16- counterpart cell <END> at a frequency of 1 % to 2 % in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals . 
Our studies suggest that this form of acute leukemia may arise from transformation of a precursor cell common to both the <START:ana> myeloid and NK cell lineages <END> ; thus we propose the designation myeloid/NK acute leukemia . 
Recognition of this new leukemic entity will be important in distinguishing these ATRA-nonresponsive cases from ATRA-responsive true APL . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> down-regulates <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> - , <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> - , and <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> -induced cytokine gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , a product of the <START:ana> T-helper 0 ( Th0 ) and 2 ( Th2 ) subset <END> , was originally described as a <START:ggp> B-cell stimulatory factor <END> and has subsequently been found to suppress IL-1 alpha , IL-1 beta , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNF-alpha gene expression in <START:ana> monocytes <END> stimulated with LPS , and to upregulate <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL1-RA ) gene <END> expression . 
In this study we investigated the effect of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> on the expression of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> evoked by other <START:ggp> T-helper cell cytokines <END> : <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> , and <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> down-regulated mRNA accumulation of the <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> stimulated with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> , and <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> also suppressed the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> mRNA expression . 
Temporal analysis of the <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> down-regulatory effect on the IL-2- , IL-3- , or GM-CSF-induced proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in <START:ana> monocytes <END> provided evidence that <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> acts predominantly on the post-transcriptional level . 
This was supported by the observation that the down-regulatory capacity of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> appeared to be dependent on de novo protein synthesis . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> did not exert significant influence on the induction of expression of <START:ggp> IL-1-RA <END> or various <START:ggp> CSFs <END> by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> , and <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Induction of <START:ggp> proto-oncogene <END> and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression in human peripheral blood <START:ana> monocytes <END> and the <START:ana> monocytic cell line <END> <START:ana> THP-1 <END> after stimulation with mycoplasma-derived material MDHM . 
Mycoplasma fermentans-derived high-molecular-weight material ( MDHM ) was originally described to induce differentiation of <START:ana> murine thymocytes <END> to <START:ana> cytolytic effector T-cells <END> by stimulating <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> release from <START:ana> adherent cells <END> . 
This study shows that human peripheral blood <START:ana> monocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBMo <END> ) also respond to MDHM with increases in <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> and <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> expression , both at the mRNA and protein level . 
The induced expression of <START:ana> IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA <END> in the monocytic <START:ana> THP-1 cell line <END> increased as quickly as in <START:ana> primary cells <END> . 
In contrast to <START:ana> PBMo <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 <END> and 14 other <START:ana> monocytic/myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines <END> did not secrete measurable amounts of the <START:ggp> cytokines <END> upon treatment with MDHM . 
<START:ggp> IL-1 beta and IL-6 genes <END> contain <START:ggp> AP-1 binding sites <END> as <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> , the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> protein being composed of <START:ggp> c-jun and c-fos gene products <END> . 
In <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> expression increased after incubation with MDHM while positive <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression remained unaffected . 
Although these data suggest <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> regulated <START:ggp> cytokine <END> mRNA expression , results from <START:ana> PBMo <END> are not in accordance with this notion . 
In the <START:ana> primary cells <END> MDHM-induced elevation of <START:ana> cytokine mRNA <END> levels was preceded by a downregulation of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression while positive <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression was not modulated . 
<START:ana> c-myc mRNA <END> expression , constitutively high in <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> , was induced in MDHM-stimulated <START:ana> PBMo <END> . 
In conclusion , MDHM-stimulated induction of <START:ana> cytokine mRNA <END> expression was accompanied by different <START:ggp> proto-oncogene <END> responses in <START:ana> PBMo <END> and <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> . 
These differences may represent different regulatory pathways of the two cell systems . 
Alternatively , these data support the notion that neither <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> nor the <START:ggp> c-myc protein <END> are involved in the MDHM-induced increase in IL-1 beta , IL-6 or TNF alpha mRNA levels . 
Furthermore , the present results demonstrate clearly that <START:ggp> mycoplasma products <END> can have a profound impact on the activation status of <START:ana> eukaryotic cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Novel membrane receptors <END> for aldosterone in <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> : a <START:ggp> 50 kDa protein <END> on SDS-PAGE . 
Fast in vitro effects of aldosterone on the <START:ggp> Na+/H ( + ) -exchanger <END> , inositoltrisphosphate generation and corresponding specific binding to plasma membranes at Kd-values of approximately 0.1 nM have been found in <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> and <START:ana> vascular smooth muscle cells <END> . 
The novel aldosterone membrane receptor was analyzed on SDS-PAGE after labeling of microsomal membranes from <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> with a [ 125I ] -aldosterone-derivative by use of BASED as a photoactivatable crosslinker . 
Binding of 1 nM [ 125I ] -aldosterone was found at a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa which was absent with 1 microM cold aldosterone , but not cortisol in the binding media . 
This aldosterone-selectivity is typical and discriminatory for the new <START:ggp> aldosterone membrane receptor <END> . 
Solubilization of the <START:ggp> receptor protein <END> from membranes by high salt concentrations ( 1 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA ) was not achieved . 
It , thus , appears as an <START:ggp> integral membrane protein <END> . 
Dithiothreitol , a sulfhydryl agent , does not reduce specific aldosterone binding indicating the absence of <START:ggp> SH-groups <END> in the <START:ggp> binding domain <END> or sensitive structures of the receptors . 
The results are the first to characterize the <START:ggp> novel membrane receptor <END> for aldosterone with regard to molecular weight and basic properties . 
These findings and other related results are reviewed here . 
A <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory element <END> is associated with a <START:ggp> nuclease-hypersensitive site <END> in the <START:ggp> pol gene <END> of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 . 
Analysis of the chromatin organization of the integrated <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) genome <END> has previously revealed a <START:ggp> major constitutive DNase I-hypersensitive site <END> associated with the <START:ggp> pol gene <END> ( E. Verdin , J. Virol. 65 : 6790-6799 , 1991 ) . 
In the present report , high-resolution mapping of this site with <START:ggp> DNase I <END> and <START:ggp> micrococcal nuclease <END> identified a <START:ggp> nucleosome-free region <END> centered around <START:ggp> nucleotides ( nt ) 4490 to 4766 <END> . 
A <START:ggp> 500-bp fragment <END> encompassing this <START:ggp> hypersensitive site <END> ( <START:ggp> nt 4481 to 4982 <END> ) exhibited transcription-enhancing activity ( two- to threefold ) when it was cloned in its natural position with respect to the <START:ggp> HIV-1 promoter <END> after transient transfection in <START:ana> U937 <END> and <START:ana> CEM cells <END> . 
Using in vitro footprinting and gel shift assays , we have identified four distinct <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> within this <START:ggp> positive regulatory element <END> . 
<START:ggp> Site B <END> ( <START:ggp> nt 4519 to 4545 <END> ) specifically bound four distinct <START:ggp> nuclear protein complexes <END> : a <START:ggp> ubiquitous factor <END> , a <START:ggp> T-cell-specific factor <END> , a <START:ggp> B-cell-specific factor <END> , and the <START:ggp> monocyte/macrophage- and B-cell-specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> PU.1/Spi-1 <END> . 
In most HIV-1 isolates in which this <START:ggp> PU box <END> was not conserved , it was replaced by a <START:ggp> binding site <END> for the related factor <START:ggp> Ets1 <END> . 
Factors binding to <START:ggp> site C <END> ( <START:ggp> nt 4681 to 4701 <END> ) had a DNA-binding specificity similar to that of factors binding to <START:ggp> site B <END> , except for <START:ggp> PU.1/Spi-1 <END> . 
A <START:ggp> GC box <END> containing a <START:ggp> binding site <END> for <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> was identified ( <START:ggp> nt 4623 to 4631 <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> Site D <END> ( <START:ggp> nt 4816 to 4851 <END> ) specifically bound a <START:ggp> ubiquitously expressed factor <END> . 
These results identify a <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory element <END> associated with a <START:ggp> nuclease-hypersensitive site <END> in the <START:ggp> pol gene <END> of HIV-1 and suggest that its activity may be controlled by a complex interplay of cis- <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> v-src <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> correlates with nuclear expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is a rapidly inducible <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> that responds to a variety of signals and influences the expression of many genes involved in the immune response . 
Protein <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> transmit signals from <START:ggp> cytokine and immune receptors <END> . 
Very little information exists linking these two important classes of <START:ggp> signaling molecules <END> . 
We now demonstrate that <START:ggp> v-src <END> expression correlates with nuclear expression of a <START:ggp> kappa B binding complex <END> similar to that induced by phorbol ester and ionomycin , as detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a variety of <START:ggp> kappa B sites <END> . 
This complex was blocked by the <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> inhibitor , herbimycin A . 
The <START:ggp> v-src-induced complex <END> comprised the <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 <END> components of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , as determined by supershift and immunoblot analysis . 
As a functional correlate of this finding , transient co-transfection of <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR reporter constructs <END> in a different <START:ana> T cell line <END> demonstrated that <START:ggp> v-src <END> activated this <START:ggp> promoter <END> in a kappa B-dependent manner . 
We found that transactivation of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> by <START:ggp> v-src <END> was more sensitive to mutations of the proximal , rather than the distal , <START:ggp> kappa B element <END> . 
The implications for <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> signaling and <START:ggp> HIV-1 gene <END> expression are considered . 
trans-activation of the <START:ggp> HIV promoter <END> by a cDNA and its genomic clones of human herpesvirus-6 . 
Human herpesvirus 6 ( HHV-6 ) is a lymphotropic herpesvirus , and in vitro , it can productively infect human <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> as HIV-1 . 
Co-infection of <START:ana> T cells <END> by HIV-1 and HHV-6 can lead to both activation of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 promoter <END> and acceleration of the cytopathic effects . 
An <START:ggp> HHV-6 ( GS ) cDNA clone <END> , <START:ggp> pCD41 <END> , encoding for a <START:ggp> 41-kDa nuclear protein <END> was identified and characterized previously ( Chang and Balachandran , J. Virol. 65 , 2884-2894 and 7085 , 1991 ) . 
Sequence analyses show that this protein has significant homology with the <START:ggp> human cytomegalovirus UL44 gene <END> coding for the <START:ggp> ICP36 family <END> of <START:ggp> early-late-class phosphoprotein <END> . 
Using this <START:ggp> cDNA <END> as the probe , a <START:ggp> 3.8-kb EcoRI genomic fragment <END> encoding the <START:ggp> HHV-6 ( GS ) P41 <END> was cloned and designated as <START:ggp> pGD41 <END> . 
When cotransfected with the <START:ggp> HIV LTR CAT <END> into <START:ana> CV-1 cells <END> , both the <START:ggp> pCD41 <END> and <START:ggp> pGD41 <END> clones trans-activated the <START:ggp> HIV LTR <END> . 
Sequence analyses of <START:ggp> pCD41 <END> indicate that there are two potential <START:ggp> open reading frames <END> ( <START:ggp> ORFs <END> ) , <START:ggp> A <END> and <START:ggp> B <END> , which are homologous to the <START:ggp> ORFs <END> found in the genomic clone <START:ggp> pGD41 <END> . 
Deletion constructs of the <START:ggp> pCD41 clone <END> demonstrated that <START:ggp> ORF-A <END> was critical for the <START:ggp> HIV LTR <END> activation . 
Deletion analyses of the <START:ggp> pCD41 <END> <START:ggp> ORF-A <END> and the use of <START:ggp> promoter constructs <END> further mapped an internal functional promoter within the <START:ggp> pCD41 <END> sequence that can direct the synthesis of the <START:ggp> trans-activating protein <END> . 
By using <START:ggp> HIV LTR deletion mutants <END> , the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> binding sites <END> were found to be critical for response to the <START:ggp> pCD41 <END> trans-activation . 
<START:ggp> CD14 <END> -mediated translocation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> induced by lipopolysaccharide does not require <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activity . 
During the course of serious bacterial infections , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is believed to interact with <START:ggp> macrophage receptors <END> , resulting in the generation of inflammatory mediators and systemic symptoms including hemodynamic instability and shock . 
<START:ggp> CD14 <END> , a <START:ggp> glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked antigen <END> , functions as an <START:ggp> LPS signaling receptor <END> . 
A critical issue concerns the mechanism by which <START:ggp> CD14 <END> , which has no <START:ggp> transmembrane domain <END> , transduces its signal following LPS binding . 
Recently , investigators have hypothesized that <START:ggp> CD14 <END> -mediated signaling is effected through a receptor-associated <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> ( TK ) , suggesting a multicomponent receptor model of LPS signaling . 
Wild-type <START:ana> Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) -K1 cells <END> can be activated by endotoxin to release arachidonate following transfection with human <START:ggp> CD14 <END> ( <START:ggp> CHO/CD14 <END> ) . 
Nuclear translocation of cytosolic NF-kappa B is correlated with a number of LPS-inducible responses . 
We sought to determine if this pathway were present in <START:ana> CHO/CD14 cells <END> and to elucidate the relationship of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation to the <START:ggp> CD14 <END> receptor system . 
LPS-stimulated translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> CHO/CD14 cells <END> resembled the same response in the <START:ana> murine macrophage-like cell line <END> <START:ana> RAW 264.7 <END> . 
Protein synthesis inhibitors and corticosteroids , which suppress arachidonate release and the synthesis of <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> , had no effect on translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in CHO/ <START:ggp> CD14 <END> or <START:ana> RAW 264.7 cells <END> , demonstrating that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation is an early event . 
Although TK activity was consistently observed by immunoblotting extracts from activated <START:ana> RAW 264.7 cells <END> , LPS-induced phosphotyrosine residues were not observed from similarly treated <START:ana> CHO/CD14 cells <END> . 
Furthermore , the TK inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein failed to inhibit translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> CHO/CD14 <END> or <START:ana> RAW 264.7 cells <END> , although both of these agents inhibited LPS-induced TK activity in <START:ana> RAW 264.7 cells <END> . 
These results imply that TK activity is not obligatory for <START:ggp> CD14 <END> -mediated signal transduction to occur in response to LPS . 
Signals transduced through the <START:ggp> CD4 molecule <END> on <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> activate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
We have demonstrated that <START:ggp> native envelope glycoproteins <END> of HIV-1 , gp160 can induce activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
The stimulatory effects of gp160 are mediated through the <START:ggp> CD4 molecule <END> , since pretreatment with soluble <START:ggp> CD4 <END> abrogates its activity . 
The <START:ggp> gp160-induced NF-kappa B complex <END> consists of <START:ggp> p65 <END> , <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> c-rel proteins <END> . 
The stimulatory effect of gp160 on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation is protein synthesis independent , is dependent upon protein tyrosine phosphorylation , and abrogated by inhibitors of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> . 
The gp160-mediated activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> CD4 positive T cells <END> may be involved in biological effects , e.g. , enhanced HIV replication , hypergammaglobulinemia , increased <START:ggp> cytokine <END> secretion , hypercellularity in bone marrow and apoptosis . 
No evidence for the expression of the <START:ggp> progesterone receptor <END> on <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> during pregnancy [ see comments ] 
The expression of the <START:ggp> progesterone receptor <END> in <START:ana> human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> was analysed , using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( Abbott PgR-EIA monoclonal ) , in order to evaluate its prognostic character in the context of spontaneous abortion . 
Cytosols were prepared from lymphocytes of 24 healthy pregnant women ( 11 first , 10 second and three third trimester ) , seven healthy non-pregnant women , nine women with recurrent spontaneous abortion , and six healthy men . 
In addition , a <START:ana> human breast carcinoma cell line <END> ( <START:ana> ZR-75-1 <END> ) , which expresses the <START:ggp> progesterone receptor <END> , was analysed throughout . 
The <START:ana> ZR-75-1 cell line <END> showed an expression of 642 fmol/mg whereas lymphocytes of pregnant women showed an expression < or = 4 fmol/mg . 
<START:ana> Lymphocytes <END> of non-pregnant women , women with threatened pre-term delivery , and men showed equivalent levels : 3 +/- 1 , 3 +/- 2 and 5 +/- 4 fmol/mg respectively . 
These results show that there is no evidence of specific expression of the <START:ggp> progesterone receptor <END> in pregnancy and exclude any prognostic character in spontaneous abortion . 
A role for the <START:ggp> progesterone receptor <END> in the mechanism of the known effect of progesterone on <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> is also excluded . 
Tolerance to lipopolysaccharide involves mobilization of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> with predominance of <START:ggp> p50 <END> homodimers . 
Stimulation of the <START:ana> human monocytic cell line <END> <START:ana> Mono Mac 6 <END> with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) leads to rapid and transient expression of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> like <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) . 
When such cells are precultured for 2 days with a low dose of LPS ( 20 ng/ml ) followed by stimulation with a high dose of LPS ( 1 microgram/ml ) , expression of the <START:ggp> TNF gene <END> is minimal , i.e. the cells are tolerant . 
In nuclear run-on analysis , such <START:ana> tolerant cells <END> show only a low degree of transcription , indicating that tolerance operates at or upstream of the transcription level . 
The <START:ggp> CD14 <END> LPS receptor is , however , up-regulated ( not down-regulated ) in <START:ana> tolerant cells <END> , and LPS can , in fact , still lead to activation of <START:ana> tolerant cells <END> as evidenced by mobilization of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) . 
Resolution of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> in gel shift analysis shows that the <START:ggp> binding protein <END> , mobilized in <START:ana> naive Mono Mac 6 cells <END> , consists mainly of <START:ggp> p50-p65 heterodimers <END> , while in <START:ana> tolerant cells <END> , the <START:ggp> p50 homodimer <END> is predominant . 
This increase in <START:ggp> p50 homodimers <END> coincides with an increase in <START:ana> p105 mRNA <END> , suggestive of a transcriptional up-regulation of <START:ggp> p50 <END> . 
Reporter gene analysis reveals that the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> mobilized in <START:ana> tolerant cells <END> is functionally inactive in that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-dependent luciferase constructs <END> containing the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat <END> or the <START:ggp> TNF 5'-region <END> show only minimal transactivation after LPS stimulation . 
Similar to <START:ana> Mono Mac 6 cells <END> , <START:ana> primary blood monocytes <END> , when precultured with a low dose of LPS , also become tolerant and produce little <START:ggp> TNF <END> after LPS stimulation . 
The <START:ana> tolerant blood monocytes <END> also up-regulate <START:ggp> CD14 <END> , and they mobilize <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> with a predominance of <START:ggp> p50 homodimers <END> . 
Taken together , these results demonstrate that tolerance to LPS is determined by post-receptor mechanisms that involve an altered composition of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> Oct2-isoform <END> expression in <START:ana> lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Oct2-isoform <END> expression in <START:ana> splenic B cells <END> stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or lipopolysaccharide plus phorbol-di-butyrate was analysed by cDNA cloning . 
The frequency of <START:ana> Oct2-positive clones <END> was 1/15 , 000 in both libraries . 
Two new isoforms were found that generate novel <START:ggp> amino- or carboxy-terminal sequences <END> . 
An isoform lacking <START:ggp> exon 11 <END> destroyed the <START:ggp> carboxy-terminal leucin-zipper region <END> and introduced a frame shift creating a novel , <START:ggp> proline-rich carboxy terminus <END> . 
A new <START:ggp> exon <END> containing a highly basic region ( 4c ) was characterized , <START:ggp> between exons 4 and 5 <END> . 
This exon was inserted <START:ggp> between glutamine-rich regions 2 and 3 <END> , <START:ggp> carboxy terminal <END> of a tentative <START:ggp> leucine-zipper structure <END> . 
In addition , a new combination isoform containing <START:ggp> Oct2a 's amino terminal insert <END> ( <START:ggp> exon 7a <END> ) and <START:ggp> Oct2b 's carboxy terminal insert <END> ( <START:ggp> exon 13 <END> ) was found that created a novel large isoform , <START:ggp> Oct2ab <END> . 
More frequent use of the classical <START:ggp> Oct2a <END> and <START:ggp> Oct2b <END> isoforms was observed in the <START:ana> lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cells <END> , while a preference for the <START:ggp> Oct2ab <END> and <START:ggp> Oct2ba <END> isoforms was observed in <START:ana> lipopolysaccharide plus phorbol-di-butyrate-treated cells <END> . 
Positive regulators of the lineage-specific <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> in <START:ana> differentiating erythroid cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> zinc finger transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> is a major regulator of gene expression in <START:ana> erythroid , megakaryocyte , and mast cell lineages <END> . 
<START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> binds to <START:ggp> WGATAR consensus motifs <END> in the <START:ggp> regulatory regions <END> of virtually all <START:ggp> erythroid cell-specific genes <END> . 
Analyses with <START:ana> cultured cells <END> and cell-free systems have provided strong evidence that <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> is involved in control of <START:ggp> globin gene <END> expression during erythroid differentiation . 
Targeted mutagenesis of the <START:ggp> GATA-1 gene <END> in <START:ana> embryonic stem cells <END> has demonstrated its requirement in normal erythroid development . 
Efficient rescue of the defect requires an intact <START:ggp> GATA element <END> in the <START:ggp> distal promoter <END> , suggesting autoregulatory control of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> transcription . 
To examine whether <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> expression involves additional <START:ggp> regulatory factors <END> or is maintained entirely by an autoregulatory loop , we have used a transient heterokaryon system to test the ability of <START:ggp> erythroid factors <END> to activate the <START:ggp> GATA-1 gene <END> in nonerythroid nuclei . 
We show here that <START:ana> proerythroblasts <END> and <START:ana> mature erythroid cells <END> contain a diffusible activity ( TAG ) capable of transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and that this activity decreases during the terminal differentiation of <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> . 
Nuclei from <START:ana> GATA-1 -mutant embryonic stem cells <END> can still be reprogrammed to express their <START:ggp> globin genes <END> in <START:ana> erythroid heterokaryons <END> , indicating that de novo induction of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> is not required for <START:ggp> globin gene <END> activation following cell fusion . 
Role of <START:ggp> HIV-1 Nef <END> expression in activation pathways in <START:ggp> CD4 <END> + T cells . 
The role of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) Nef protein <END> in T cell activation pathways was investigated using a <START:ana> Jurkat CD4+ cell line <END> stably transfected with a Nef expression vector . 
Secretion of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , surface expression of <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> , and DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 ( Fos/Jun ) complex <END> in response to phorbol myristate acetate , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , or immobilized antibodies to <START:ggp> CD3 <END> were monitored . 
These parameters were not modified by <START:ggp> Nef <END> expression in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , whereas stimulation with the same stimuli resulted in partial inhibition of <START:ggp> LTR <END> activation in <START:ana> Nef+ Jurkat cells <END> . 
This inhibition was not mediated through <START:ggp> Nef <END> phosphorylation on Thr-15 or GTP-binding activity because mutations in critical sites did not alter this inhibition . 
Analysis of truncated <START:ggp> LTRs <END> confirmed that inhibition of <START:ggp> LTR <END> activation was not mediated through <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -binding activity but through the region containing the <START:ggp> negative responding elements <END> ( <START:ggp> NREs <END> ) . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> Nef <END> downmodulates <START:ggp> LTR <END> activation without significantly inhibiting the capacity of <START:ana> T cells <END> to respond to immunological activations . 
<START:ggp> Tat-binding protein 7 <END> is a subunit of the <START:ggp> 26S protease <END> . 
<START:ggp> Subunit 6 <END> ( <START:ggp> S6 <END> ) , an integral component of the <START:ggp> 26S protease <END> from <START:ana> human erythrocytes <END> , has been studied by SDS-PAGE , peptide mapping and sequence analysis . 
<START:ggp> S6 <END> was cleaved with <START:ggp> CNBr <END> and three internal peptides were sequenced . 
A comparison with known proteins in Genbank revealed that all three <START:ggp> S6 <END> peptides match the predicted sequence of <START:ggp> TBP7 <END> , <START:ggp> Tat-binding protein 7 <END> . 
Based on peptide matches covering more than 10 % of the <START:ggp> TBP7 <END> sequence , and the fact that the migration of <START:ggp> S6 <END> on SDS-PAGE is consistent with the estimated molecular mass for <START:ggp> TBP7 <END> , we conclude that <START:ggp> subunit 6 <END> of the <START:ggp> 26S protease <END> is <START:ggp> TBP7 <END> . 
Hypoxia causes the activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> through the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> on tyrosine residues . 
The response of <START:ana> mammalian cells <END> to stress is controlled by <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory proteins <END> such as <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) to induce a wide variety of <START:ggp> early response genes <END> . 
In this report , we show that exposure of cells to hypoxia ( 0.02 % O2 ) results in <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> degradation , increased <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA binding activity , and transactivation of a <START:ggp> reporter gene construct <END> containing two <START:ggp> NF-kappa B DNA binding sites <END> . 
Pretreatment of cells with protein <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> inhibitors and the <START:ggp> dominant negative allele <END> of <START:ggp> c-Raf-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> Raf 301 <END> ) inhibited <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> degradation , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding , and transactivation of <START:ggp> kappa B reporter constructs <END> by hypoxia . 
To demonstrate a direct link between changes in the phosphorylation pattern of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> with <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation , we immunoprecipitated <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> after varying times of hypoxic exposure and found that its tyrosine phosphorylation status increased during hypoxic exposure . 
Inhibition of the transfer of tyrosine phosphoryl groups onto <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> prevented <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> degradation and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding . 
In comparison to other activators of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> such as phorbol myristate acetate or <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> , we did not detect changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> following treatment with either of these agents . 
These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> during hypoxia is an important proximal step which precedes its dissociation and degradation from <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Overproduction of <START:ggp> NFKB2 <END> ( <START:ggp> lyt-10 <END> ) and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> : a mechanism for <START:ggp> HTLV-I Tax <END> -mediated trans-activation via the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> signalling pathway . 
Molecular , biochemical and epidemiological evidence implicate HTLV-I as an etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia ( ATL ) . 
The <START:ggp> Tax protein <END> of HTLV-I , a <START:ggp> positive transcriptional activator <END> of HTLV-I gene expression , is a viral oncogene that also increases transcription of <START:ggp> cellular genes <END> including <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> , <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
One of the cellular targets of the trans-activating effects of Tax is the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> pleiotropic regulators <END> of immunoregulatory , cytokine and viral gene expression . 
In this report , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> NFKB2 <END> ( <START:ggp> lyt-10 <END> ) and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> are overexpressed in HTLV-I infected and <START:ana> Tax-expressing cells <END> and , together , account for the majority of the constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity in these cells before and after PMA stimulation . 
Most importantly , we show a <START:ggp> Tax <END> -dependent correlation between expression of <START:ggp> NFKB2 <END> ( <START:ggp> p100 <END> ) and processing to the DNA binding <START:ggp> NFKB2 <END> ( <START:ggp> p52 <END> ) form , induction of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , and trans-activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -mediated gene expression . 
Furthermore , the <START:ggp> NFKB2 <END> precursor is physically associated with <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> and with <START:ggp> Tax <END> in <START:ana> HTLV-I infected cells <END> . 
We propose that <START:ggp> NFKB2 <END> synthesis and processing allows continuous nuclear expression of an otherwise <START:ggp> cytoplasmic protein <END> and , in conjunction with overexpression of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , <START:ggp> NFKB2 <END> alters the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> signalling pathway and contributes to leukemic transformation of <START:ana> T cells <END> by HTLV-I . 
Retinoic acid downmodulates erythroid differentiation and <START:ggp> GATA1 <END> expression in <START:ana> purified adult-progenitor culture <END> . 
All-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) is an important morphogen in vertebrate development , a normal constituent in human adult blood and is also involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemia . 
We have examined the effects of RA on normal hematopoiesis by using early <START:ana> hematopoietic progenitor cells <END> ( <START:ana> HPC <END> ) stringently purified from adult peripheral blood . 
In <START:ana> clonogenetic fetal calf serum-supplemented ( FCS+ ) or -nonsupplemented ( FCS- ) culture <END> treated with saturating levels of <START:ggp> interleukin-3 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> ) <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) and <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> Ep <END> ) ( combined with <START:ggp> c-kit <END> ligand in FCS ( - ) -culture conditions ) , RA induces a dramatic dose-dependent shift from erythroid to granulomonocytic colony formation , the latter colonies being essentially represented by <START:ana> granulocytic clones <END> . 
This shift is apparently not caused by a recruitment phenomenon , because in <START:ana> FCS+ culture <END> , the total number of colonies is not significantly modified by RA addition . 
In <START:ana> FCS- liquid-suspension culture <END> supplemented with saturating <START:ggp> Ep <END> level and <START:ggp> low-dose IL-3/GM-CSF <END> , adult <START:ana> HPC <END> undergo unilineage erythropoietic differentiation : Here again , treatment with high-dose RA induces a shift from the erythroid to granulocytic differentiation pathway . 
Studies on RA time-response or pulse treatment in semisolid or liquid culture show that early RA addition is most effective , thus indicating that early but not late <START:ana> HPC <END> are sensitive to its action . 
We then analyzed the expression of the <START:ggp> master GATA1 gene <END> , which encodes a <START:ggp> finger transcription factor <END> required for normal erythroid development ; addition of RA to <START:ana> HPC <END> stimulated into unilineage erythropoietic differentiation in liquid culture caused a virtually complete inhibition of <START:ana> GATA1 mRNA <END> induction . 
These results indicate that RA directly inhibits the erythroid differentiation program at the level of early adult <START:ana> HPC <END> , and may lead to a shift from the erythroid to granulocytic differentiation pathway . 
This phenomenon is correlated with inhibition of <START:ggp> GATA1 <END> induction in the early stages of erythropoietic differentiation . 
Induction of phosphatidylinositol turnover and <START:ana> EGR-1 mRNA <END> expression by crosslinking of surface <START:ggp> IgM <END> and <START:ggp> IgD <END> in the <START:ana> human B cell line B104 <END> . 
We have previously shown that a <START:ana> human B lymphoma cell line , B104 <END> , expressed <START:ggp> surface IgM <END> ( <START:ggp> sIgM <END> ) and <START:ggp> surface IgD <END> ( <START:ggp> sIgD <END> ) , and that crosslinking of <START:ggp> sIgM <END> and <START:ggp> sIgD <END> by <START:ggp> anti-IgM antibody ( Ab ) <END> and <START:ggp> anti-IgD Ab <END> , respectively , induced Ca2+ influx to almost the same degree , whereas only <START:ggp> sIgM <END> -crosslinking caused <START:ana> B104 cell <END> death . 
Here , we investigated the accumulation of cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) , the hydrolysis of inositol phosphates , <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) activity and the induction of Egr-1 and c-fos mRNA expression by sIgM- and sIgD-crosslinking to examine differences in the signals mediated through <START:ggp> sIgM <END> and <START:ggp> sIgD <END> in <START:ana> B104 cells <END> . 
Both sIgM- and sIgD-crosslinking with antibodies induced elevation of cAMP levels , phosphatidylinositol turnover , <START:ggp> PKC <END> activation and expression of <START:ana> Egr-1 and c-fos mRNA <END> , although <START:ggp> sIgM <END> -crosslinking was more effective than <START:ggp> sIgD <END> -crosslinking , presumably due to the higher expression of <START:ggp> sIgM <END> than of <START:ggp> sIgD <END> . 
<START:ana> Egr-1 mRNA <END> expression induced by sIgM- and sIgD-crosslinking was inhibited by <START:ggp> H7 <END> , erbstatin and genistein , but not by HA1004 . 
Erbstatin and genistein inhibited the sIg-crosslinking-induced <START:ana> Egr-1 mRNA <END> expression in a dose-dependent manner parallel to that observed in the inhibition of sIg-crosslinking-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation . 
Phorbol myristate acetate induced <START:ana> Egr-1 mRNA <END> expression but forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP did not . 
These findings suggest that the <START:ana> Egr-1 mRNA <END> activating signals through <START:ggp> sIgM <END> and <START:ggp> sIgD <END> are protein tyrosine kinase- and PKC-dependent , but <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> -independent . 
Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 rescued <START:ana> B104 cells <END> from death induced by <START:ggp> anti-IgM Ab <END> , but did not affect the expression of <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> and <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> , showing that CsA and FK506 affect signal transducers differently from or downstream to these molecules . 
The difference in signals transduced through <START:ggp> sIgM <END> and <START:ggp> sIgD <END> in <START:ana> B104 cells <END> is discussed . 
Direct exposure to 2 , 3 , 7 , 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) increases infectivity of <START:ana> human erythrocytes <END> to a malarial parasite . 
Direct exposure to 10 nM 2 , 3 , 7 , 8-TCDD caused a 75 % increase and a 2-fold increase in the infectivity of isolated <START:ana> human erythrocytes <END> to P. falciparum after 48 hours when the parasites were in an unsynchronized or synchronized state of growth , respectively . 
Treatment of <START:ana> human erythrocytes <END> with 10 microM sodium orthovanadate ( NaOV ) , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> plasma membrane Ca-ATPase <END> and <START:ggp> phosphotyrosine phosphatase <END> , decreased parasitemia by 30 % . 
Co-treatment of <START:ana> RBCs <END> with TCDD and NaOV completely blocked the TCDD-induced increase in parasitemia . 
Because <START:ana> erythrocytes <END> are anucleated , these results are discussed as evidence for biochemical changes by TCDD without requiring the activation of <START:ggp> gene products <END> . 
Evidence for a <START:ggp> trans-acting activator <END> function regulating the expression of the <START:ggp> human CD5 antigen <END> . 
Interspecies <START:ana> somatic cell hybrids <END> were generated by fusing the <START:ana> mouse T-lymphoma cell line <END> , <START:ana> BW5147 <END> , with <START:ana> normal human T lymphocytes <END> at different stages of differentiation . 
<START:ana> Thymocytes <END> , <START:ana> activated peripheral T lymphocytes <END> , or an <START:ana> activated T-cell clone <END> were used as human partners , respectively , in three independent fusions . 
Irrespective of the human cell partner used for fusion , a certain number of <START:ana> hybrids <END> lost <START:ggp> CD5 <END> surface expression over a period of time in culture . 
Analysis at the phenotype and genetic level showed that lack of <START:ggp> CD5 <END> expression was due neither to segregation of <START:ggp> human autosome 11 <END> , on which the <START:ggp> CD5 gene <END> has been mapped , nor to deletion of the <START:ggp> CD5 structural gene <END> . 
Furthermore , loss of <START:ggp> CD5 <END> surface expression correlated with the absence of specific <START:ana> mRNA <END> . 
Since these hybrids preferentially segregate human chromosomes , these results indicate the existence of a <START:ggp> non-syntenic trans-active locus <END> , or loci , positively controlling the expression of the <START:ggp> human CD5 gene <END> . 
Induction of the <START:ggp> CD11b gene <END> during activation of the <START:ana> monocytic cell line U937 <END> requires a novel <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> <START:ggp> MS-2 <END> [ published erratum appears in J Immunol 1999 Jul 15 ; 163 ( 2 ) : 1091 ] 
The differentiation of <START:ana> myeloid precursors <END> into mature <START:ana> myelomonocytic cells <END> is characterized by the induction of the gene encoding the <START:ggp> beta2 integrin <END> <START:ggp> CD11b <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> PU.1 prime <END> the <START:ggp> CD11b promoter <END> , but the nature of the factors responsible for its inducible expression are unknown . 
In addition to the <START:ggp> CD11b gene <END> , the homologous genes encoding <START:ggp> CD11a <END> and <START:ggp> CD11c <END> also exhibit inducible expression during myeloid differentiation . 
Therefore , we compared the <START:ggp> nucleotide sequences <END> of the <START:ggp> CD11a , CD11b , and CD11c gene promoters <END> to identify common elements that might contribute to inducible expression . 
This analysis identified one such element repeated four times within the <START:ggp> CD11b promoter <END> . 
Mutation of these elements indicated that two , <START:ggp> MS-2beta <END> and <START:ggp> MS-2gamma <END> , are critical to the induction of the <START:ggp> CD11b gene <END> during differentiation of the <START:ana> pro-monocytic cell line U937 <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that <START:ggp> MS-2beta <END> and <START:ggp> MS-2gamma <END> interact with <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> that are induced during <START:ana> U937 <END> differentiation . 
These factors are detected at the time the <START:ggp> CD11b promoter <END> is activated . 
The molecular mass of these factors is approximately 28 kDa , and their DNA binding characteristics are indistinguishable from those of the novel <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> <START:ggp> MS-2 <END> . 
Taken together , our data indicate that <START:ggp> MS-2 <END> mediates induction of the <START:ggp> CD11b gene <END> as cells of the monocytic lineage mature . 
The presence of multiple potential binding sites for <START:ggp> MS-2 <END> in the promoter regions of a wide range of genes expressed in <START:ana> mature myeloid cells <END> suggests this factor plays a general role in myeloid differentiation . 
Acetylsalicylic acid and sodium salicylate inhibit LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/c-Rel <END> nuclear translocation , and synthesis of <START:ggp> tissue factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TF <END> ) and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alfa <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
We have investigated the effects of acetylsalicylic acid and sodium salicylate on the LPS-induced synthesis of the pro-coagulant protein tissue factor ( TF ) and the pro-inflammatory protein tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) , as well as the <START:ggp> prostaglandin PGE2 <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Both drugs dose-dependently inhibited <START:ggp> LPS-induced TF <END> and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> synthesis at the <START:ana> mRNA <END> and the protein level , and reduced <START:ggp> PGE2 <END> production . 
As evidenced by electro mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) and the use of a <START:ggp> NF-kappa B prototypic probe <END> , these drugs probably exert their inhibitory effects by interference with the nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/c-Rel proteins <END> . 
These data may expand the understanding of the anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs when activation of <START:ana> monocytes <END> occurs . 
Interferon augments <START:ggp> PML <END> and <START:ggp> PML/RAR alpha <END> expression in normal <START:ana> myeloid <END> and <START:ana> acute promyelocytic cells <END> and cooperates with all-trans retinoic acid to induce maturation of a <START:ana> retinoid-resistant promyelocytic cell line <END> . 
The <START:ggp> PML gene <END> is fused to the <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor alpha gene <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> ) in the acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) 15 ; 17 translocation . 
<START:ggp> PML <END> is expressed in diverse tissues and cell lines and localized in the nucleus with a typical speckled pattern . 
In the bone marrow , it is preferentially expressed in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> PML <END> appears to be transcriptionally regulated by <START:ggp> class I and II interferons <END> , which raises the possibility that interferons modulate the function and growth and differentiation potential of normal <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> and precursors by activating <START:ggp> PML <END> -dependent pathways . 
Similarly , interferons could act on <START:ana> APL cells <END> , alone or in combination with all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) , especially if the <START:ana> PML/RAR alpha fusion transcript <END> that results from the <START:ggp> t ( 15 ; 17 ) <END> is induced by <START:ggp> interferon <END> . 
We report here that <START:ggp> PML <END> is expressed at low levels or not expressed in normal circulating <START:ana> human monocytes <END> , <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , and <START:ana> polymorphonucleate cells <END> , but is markedly induced by <START:ggp> interferon <END> ; that <START:ggp> PML <END> and <START:ggp> PML/RAR alpha <END> expression is augmented by <START:ggp> interferon <END> in the <START:ana> NB4 APL cell line <END> , which carries the <START:ggp> t ( 15 ; 17 ) <END> , and in <START:ana> APL blasts <END> from patients ; that <START:ggp> interferon <END> inhibits growth and survival of NB4 <START:ana> APL cells <END> in cooperation with RA ; that interferons alone have minimal maturation effect on <START:ana> NB4 cells <END> ; and , finally , that <START:ggp> interferon gamma , but not alpha or beta <END> , induces maturation and growth suppression of <START:ana> NB4 cells <END> with de novo retinoid resistance , and partially restores RA response . 
Effects of Ara-C on <START:ggp> neutral sphingomyelinase <END> and <START:ggp> mitogen- and stress- activated protein kinases <END> in <START:ana> T-lymphocyte cell lines <END> . 
<START:ggp> Neutral sphingomyelinase <END> ( <START:ggp> SMase <END> ) can be activated by extracellular signals to produce ceramide , which may affect <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MAPK <END> ) activities . 
Neutral <START:ggp> SMase <END> activity was assessed in membranes from <START:ana> Jurkat <END> , a <START:ana> human T-cell line <END> , and <START:ana> EL4 <END> , a <START:ana> murine T-cell line <END> . 
Ara-C activated <START:ggp> SMase <END> with 10 minutes in both Jurkat and <START:ana> EL4 cells <END> , while phorbol ester ( PMA ) had no effect . 
PMA , but not Ara-C or ceramides , activated <START:ggp> ERK MAPKS <END> , in <START:ana> Jurkat <END> and <START:ana> EL4 <END> . 
PMA acted synergistically with ionomycin to activate <START:ggp> JNK MAPKs <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat <END> and <START:ana> EL4 <END> within 10 minutes . 
Ara-C activated <START:ggp> JNKs <END> only after prolonged incubation ( 90-120 minutes ) . 
Thus , ceramide is not a positive signal for <START:ggp> ERK <END> activation in <START:ana> T-cell lines <END> . 
The effects of Ara-C on <START:ggp> JNK <END> activity may be mediated through secondary response pathways . 
Comparative analysis identifies conserved <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> human and simian Epstein-Barr virus oncogene LMP1 <END> . 
Nonhuman primates are naturally infected with a B-lymphotropic herpesvirus closely related to Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) . 
These simian EBV share considerable genetic , biologic , and epidemiologic features with human EBV , including virus-induced tumorigenesis . 
However , latent , transformation-associated viral genes demonstrate marked sequence divergence among species despite the conserved functions . 
We have cloned the <START:ggp> latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) homologs <END> from the simian EBV naturally infecting baboons ( cercopithicine herpesvirus 12 , herpesvirus papio ) and rhesus monkeys ( cercopithicine herpesvirus 15 ) for a comparative study with the human EBV oncogene . 
The transmembrane domains are well conserved , but there is striking sequence divergence of the <START:ggp> carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain <END> essential for <START:ana> B-cell <END> immortalization and interaction with the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor <END> signaling pathway . 
Nevertheless , the <START:ggp> simian EBV LMP1s <END> retain most functions in common with EBV <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> , including the ability to induce <START:ggp> NF- ( kappa ) B <END> activity in <START:ana> human cells <END> , to bind the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> TRAF3 <END> ) in vitro , and to induce expression of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-responsive genes <END> , such as <START:ggp> ICAM1 <END> , in <START:ana> human B lymphocytes <END> . 
Multiple <START:ggp> TRAF3 binding sites <END> containing a <START:ggp> PXQXT/S core sequence <END> can be identified in the <START:ggp> simian EBV LMP1s <END> by an in vitro binding assay . 
A <START:ggp> PXQXT/S-containing sequence <END> is also present in the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> of the Hodgkin 's disease marker , <START:ggp> CD30 <END> , and binds <START:ggp> TRAF3 <END> in vitro . 
The <START:ggp> last 13 amino acids <END> containing a <START:ggp> PXQXT/S sequence <END> are highly conserved in human and simian EBV <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> but do not bind <START:ggp> TRAF3 <END> , suggesting a distinct role for this conserved region of <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> . 
The conserved <START:ggp> TRAF3 binding sites <END> in <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> and the <START:ggp> CD30 Hodgkin 's disease marker <END> provides further evidence that a <START:ggp> TRAF3 <END> -mediated signal transduction pathway may be important in malignant transformation . 
<START:ggp> Chromosome 1 <END> aneusomy with <START:ggp> 1p36 <END> under-representation is related to histologic grade , DNA aneuploidy , high <START:ggp> c-erb B-2 <END> and loss of <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression in ductal breast carcinoma . 
<START:ggp> Chromosome 1 <END> abnormalities with loss of <START:ggp> 1p36 <END> have been investigated in 95 breast-cancer samples by means of a dual-target fluorescence in-situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique using the <START:ggp> pUC 1.77 <END> and <START:ggp> p1-79 probes <END> , specific for the <START:ggp> 1q12 and 1p36 regions <END> , respectively . 
Abnormalities for one or both probes were detected in 83/95 samples . 
Relative <START:ggp> 1p36 <END> under-representation was found in 79/95 . 
The clinical relevance of these alterations was studied by comparing the FISH results with several parameters currently used in breast-cancer pathology . 
Distinct patterns of <START:ggp> chromosome 1 <END> abnormalities were found among the histologic types of breast carcinoma . 
Lobular or mucinous samples showed few or no alterations , whereas most ductal samples had high <START:ggp> chromosome 1 <END> polysomy with under-representation of <START:ggp> 1p36 <END> . 
In ductal carcinomas , <START:ggp> chromosome 1 <END> alterations increased with histologic grade , DNA aneuploidy , loss of bcl-2 and high <START:ggp> c-erb B-2 <END> expression . 
These associations were found to be statistically significant . 
No correlation between <START:ggp> chromosome 1 <END> alterations and nuclear grade , age , size , lymph-node involvement , hormonal receptor presence , proliferation activity or <START:ggp> p53 <END> protein expression was detected . 
These results indicate the utility of this FISH technique for a better definition of the biological characteristics of ductal carcinomas . 
G ( Anh ) MTetra , a natural bacterial cell wall breakdown product , induces <START:ggp> interleukin-1 beta <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> expression in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
A study of the molecular mechanisms involved in <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokine <END> expression [ published erratum appears in J Biol Chem 1994 Jun 17 ; 269 ( 24 ) : 16983 ] 
It is believed that induction of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression by bacterial cell wall components plays a role in the development and course of sepsis . 
However , most attention has been focused on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . 
We studied the ability of N-acetylglucosaminyl-1 , 6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D- isoglutamyl-m-diaminopimelyl-D-alanine ( G ( Anh ) MTetra ) , a naturally occurring breakdown product of peptidoglycan that is produced by soluble <START:ggp> lytic transglycosylase <END> of Escherichia coli , to induce <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
G ( Anh ) MTetra was found to strongly induce <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -1 beta <END> and <START:ana> IL-6 mRNA <END> expression after 2 h and <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> and <START:ggp> IL-6 protein <END> secretion after 48 h of activation . 
The increase in mRNA accumulation was at least partly due to an increase in the transcription rates of the respective <START:ggp> genes <END> and was accompanied by a strong induction of nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1 transcription factor expression . 
Experiments using inhibitors of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> , <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> , and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways revealed that G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> and <START:ana> IL-6 mRNA <END> expression involves activation of an H7-inhibitable pathway . 
By using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide , it was shown that G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced <START:ana> IL-6 mRNA <END> expression depends on the synthesis of new protein , whereas G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> mRNA accumulation does not . 
When responses to G ( Anh ) MTetra were compared with those to LPS and muramyldipeptide ( MDP ) , it was found that the optimal response to G ( Anh ) MTetra induction was similar to that of LPS but significantly higher than the response to MDP . 
Furthermore , maximal G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> and <START:ana> IL-6 mRNA <END> expression could be enhanced by co-stimulation with LPS or MDP , suggesting that different receptors and/or transduction pathways were involved . 
These results indicate that G ( Anh ) MTetra induces <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> and <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> expression in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> suggesting a possible role for G ( Anh ) MTetra in the release of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> during sepsis . 
Increased proliferation , cytotoxicity , and gene expression after stimulation of <START:ana> human peripheral blood T lymphocytes <END> through a surface ganglioside ( GD3 ) [ published erratum appears in J Immunol 1994 Jul 15 ; 153 ( 2 ) : 910 ] 
Previous studies have suggested that gangliosides have an important role in cell signaling and recognition . 
However , their specific function in these processes has not been clearly defined . 
A <START:ggp> mAb <END> , <START:ggp> R24 <END> , that reacts specifically with a cell surface ganglioside ( GD3 ) has been demonstrated to stimulate proliferation of <START:ana> T cells <END> derived from human peripheral blood . 
In this study , we have investigated the mechanisms by which the <START:ggp> R24 mAb <END> affects T cell functions . 
We have observed that the <START:ggp> R24 mAb <END> stimulates GD3+ T cell proliferation , cytotoxicity , and surface marker expression of <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha-chain <END> , <START:ggp> IL-2R beta-chain <END> , <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> , <START:ggp> CD11a <END> , and <START:ggp> CD11c <END> . 
Additionally , <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> activity but not IL-1 , IL-2 , or IL-4 activity was present in culture supernatants 72 h after <START:ggp> R24 <END> stimulation . 
In some donors , increased <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> activity also was detected after <START:ggp> R24 <END> treatment . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> R24 <END> treatment resulted in translocation of <START:ggp> c-rel <END> , but little or no <START:ggp> NF kappa B p50 <END> or <START:ggp> p65 <END> , from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and an increase of <START:ggp> NF kappa B binding complexes <END> containing <START:ggp> c-rel <END> and <START:ggp> p50 <END> . 
This treatment also caused increased tyrosine phosphorylation of specific protein substrates . 
<START:ggp> R24 <END> -stimulated increases in proliferation , cytotoxicity , and cell surface protein expression could be blocked by cyclosporin and staurosporin , indicating that <START:ggp> cyclophilin/calcineurin <END> and <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> may be involved in the <START:ggp> R24 <END> signaling pathway . 
Additionally , herbimycin A , a <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> inhibitor , blocked the <START:ggp> R24 <END> -stimulated increase in proliferation but not cytotoxicity at concentrations consistent with specificity for <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> . 
These results suggest that multiple biochemical pathways are involved in the activation of <START:ana> human T cells <END> by <START:ggp> R24 <END> . 
Genes encoding <START:ggp> general initiation factors <END> for <START:ggp> RNA polymerase II <END> transcription are dispersed in the <START:ggp> human genome <END> . 
<START:ggp> General transcription factors <END> are required for accurate initiation of transcription by <START:ggp> RNA polymerase II <END> . 
<START:ggp> Human cDNAs <END> encoding subunits of these factors have been cloned and sequenced . 
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) , we show here that the <START:ggp> genes <END> encoding the <START:ggp> TATA-box binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> TBP <END> ) , <START:ggp> TFIIB <END> , <START:ggp> TFIIE alpha <END> , <START:ggp> TFIIE beta <END> , <START:ggp> RAP30 <END> , <START:ggp> RAP74 <END> and the <START:ggp> 62 kDa subunit <END> , of <START:ggp> TFIIH <END> are located at the <START:ggp> human chromosomal bands 6q26-27 , 1p21-22 , 3q21-24 , 8p12 , 13q14 , 19p13.3 and 11p14-15.1 <END> , respectively . 
This dispersed localization of a group of functionally related gene provides insights into the molecular mechanism of <START:ggp> human genome <END> evolution and their possible involvement in human diseases . 
<START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> and the molecular pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoma . 
The results presented identify the first genetic lesion associated with DLCL , the most clinically relevant form of NHL . 
Although no proof yet exists of a role for these lesions in DLCL pathogenesis , the feature of the <START:ggp> BCL-6 gene product <END> , its specific pattern of expression in <START:ana> B cells <END> , and the clustering of lesions disrupting its regulatory domain strongly suggest that deregulation of <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> expression may contribute to DLCL development . 
A more precise definition of the role of <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> in normal and neoplastic B-cell development is the goal of ongoing study of transgenic mice engineered either to express <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> under <START:ggp> heterologous promoters <END> or lacking <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> function due to targeted deletions . 
In addition to contributing to the understanding of DLCL pathogenesis , the identification of <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> lesions may have relevant clinical implications . 
DLCL represent a heterogeneous group of neoplasms which are treated homogeneously despite the fact that only 50 % of patients experience long-term disease-free survival ( Schneider et al. 1990 ) . 
The fact that <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> rearrangements identify biologically and clinically distinct subsets of DLCL suggests that these lesions may be useful as markers in selection of differential therapeutic strategies based on different risk groups . 
Furthermore , the <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> rearrangements can be used to identify and monitor the <START:ana> malignant clone <END> with sensitive PCR-based techniques . 
Since clinical remission has been observed in a significant fraction of DLCL cases , these markers may serve as critical tools for sensitive monitoring of minimal residual disease and early diagnosis of relapse ( Gribben et al. 1993 ) . 
Pancreatic development and maturation of the <START:ana> islet B cell <END> . 
Studies of <START:ana> pluripotent islet cultures <END> . 
Pancreas organogenesis is a highly regulated process , in which two anlage evaginate from the primitive gut . 
They later fuse , and , under the influence of the surrounding mesenchyme , the mature organ develops , being mainly composed of ductal , exocrine and endocrine compartments . 
Early buds are characterized by a branching morphogenesis of the ductal epithelium from which <START:ana> endocrine and exocrine precursor cells <END> bud to eventually form the two other compartments . 
The three compartments are thought to be of common endodermal origin ; in contrast to earlier hypotheses , which suggested that the endocrine compartment was of neuroectodermal origin . 
It is thus generally believed that the pancreatic endocrine-lineage possesses the ability to mature along a differentiation pathway that shares many characteristics with those of neuronal differentiation . 
During recent years , studies of <START:ggp> insulin-gene <END> regulation and , in particular , the tissue-specific transcriptional control of <START:ggp> insulin-gene <END> activity have provided information on pancreas development in general . 
The present review summarizes these findings , with a special focus on our own studies on <START:ana> pluripotent endocrine cultures <END> of rat pancreas . 
Octamer independent activation of transcription from the <START:ggp> kappa immunoglobulin germline promoter <END> . 
Previous analyses of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin V region promoters <END> has led to the discovery of a common <START:ggp> octamer motif <END> which is functionally important in the tissue-specific and developmentally regulated transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin genes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> germline promoters <END> ( <START:ggp> Ko <END> ) located upstream of the <START:ggp> J region gene segments <END> of the <START:ggp> kappa locus <END> also contain an <START:ggp> octamer motif <END> ( containing a single <START:ggp> base pair mutation <END> and referred to as the variant octamer ) which has been shown previously to bind <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in vitro . 
To further elucidate the role of this variant <START:ggp> octamer motif <END> in the regulation of <START:ggp> germline <END> transcription from the unrearranged <START:ggp> kappa locus <END> , we have quantitated the relative binding affinity of <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> for the variant <START:ggp> octamer motif <END> and determined the functional role of this <START:ggp> octamer motif <END> in transcriptional activation . 
We find that , although the variant <START:ggp> octamer motif <END> binds <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> in vitro with 5-fold lower affinity than the <START:ggp> consensus octamer motif <END> , mutation of the variant <START:ggp> octamer motif <END> to either a <START:ggp> consensus octamer <END> or <START:ggp> non-octamer motif <END> has no effect on transcriptional activation from the <START:ggp> germline promoter <END> . 
We also find significant differences in activation of <START:ggp> germline <END> and <START:ggp> V region promoters <END> by <START:ggp> kappa enhancers <END> . 
Our results suggest that the <START:ggp> germline promoters <END> and <START:ggp> V region promoters <END> differ in their dependence on <START:ggp> octamer <END> for activation and respond differently to enhancer activation . 
These findings have important implications in regulation of <START:ggp> germline <END> transcription as well as concomitant activation of the V-J recombination of the <START:ggp> kappa light chain locus <END> . 
Generation of <START:ana> CD1+RelB+ dendritic cells <END> and <START:ana> tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells <END> from <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
We previously showed that <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) and <START:ggp> macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> ) stimulate the differentiation of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> into two phenotypically distinct types of <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
However , in vivo , not only <START:ggp> CSF <END> but also many other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> are produced under various conditions . 
Those <START:ggp> cytokines <END> may modulate the differentiation of <START:ana> monocytes <END> by <START:ggp> CSFs <END> . 
In the present study , we showed that <START:ana> CD14+ adherent human monocytes <END> can differentiate into <START:ana> CD1+relB+ dendritic cells <END> ( <START:ana> DC <END> ) by the combination of <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> plus <START:ggp> interleukin-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) and that they differentiate into <START:ana> tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) -positive osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells <END> ( <START:ana> MGC <END> ) by the combination of <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> plus <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> . 
However , the <START:ana> monocyte-derived DC <END> were not <START:ana> terminally differentiated cells <END> ; they could still convert to <START:ana> macrophages <END> in response to <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) stimulated the terminal differentiation of the <START:ana> DC <END> by downregulating the expression of the <START:ggp> M-CSF receptor <END> , <START:ana> cfms mRNA <END> , and aborting the potential to convert to <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
In contrast to <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) had no demonstrable effect on the differentiation of <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Rather , <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> antagonized the effect of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and suppressed the <START:ana> DC <END> and <START:ana> MGC <END> formation induced by <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> + <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> + <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , respectively . 
Taken together , these results provide a new aspect to our knowledge of monocyte differentiation and provide evidence that <START:ana> human monocytes <END> are flexible in their differentiation potential and are precursors not only of <START:ana> macrophages <END> but also of <START:ana> CD1+relB+DC <END> and <START:ana> TRAP-positive MGC <END> . 
Such a diverse pathway of monocyte differentiation may constitute one of the basic mechanisms of immune regulation . 
The <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> inhibitor , tepoxalin , suppresses surface expression of the <START:ggp> cell adhesion molecules <END> <START:ggp> CD62E <END> , <START:ggp> CD11b/CD18 <END> and <START:ggp> CD106 <END> . 
Tepoxalin , a dual enzyme inhibitor of <START:ggp> cyclooxygenase <END> and <START:ggp> 5-lipoxygenase <END> has been shown to inhibit T-cell activation . 
Its immunosuppressive property is distinct from cyclosporin because only tepoxalin , but not cyclosporin , suppresses <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
Here we report that tepoxalin selectively inhibits <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> <START:ggp> ( ICAM-1 , CD54 ) /MAC-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> CD11b/CD18 <END> ) dependent adhesion of <START:ana> polymorphonuclear cells <END> to <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> activated <START:ana> human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> . 
The mechanism of inhibition is related to the surface expression of several cell <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> . 
Flow cytometry analyses on cultured cells that were treated with tepoxalin or antisense oligonucleotides to the <START:ggp> P65/p50 subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , and then stimulated with PMA , revealed a reduced expression of <START:ggp> CD11b/CD18 <END> on <START:ana> monocytic HL60 cells <END> , and <START:ggp> endothelial adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> CD62E <END> ) and <START:ggp> vascular adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> CD106 <END> ) on <START:ana> human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> . 
Expression of other <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> such as <START:ggp> lymphocyte function associated-antigen-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> CD11a/CD18 <END> ) and <START:ggp> CD54 <END> were unaffected . 
Tepoxalin also inhibited the secretion of a <START:ggp> NF-kappa B regulated chemokine <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , a known inducer of <START:ggp> CD11b/CD18 <END> expression . 
Thus the suppression of <START:ggp> CD11b/CD18 <END> expression by tepoxalin may involve <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> . 
Our results suggest that by inhibiting <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation , surface expression of several <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> can be modulated and that tepoxalin may be useful in treating selected adhesion mediated events such as leukocyte migration or atherosclerotic plaque formation . 
Characterization of a <START:ggp> CD43/leukosialin <END> -mediated pathway for inducing apoptosis in <START:ana> human T-lymphoblastoid cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> ( <START:ggp> mAb <END> ) <START:ggp> J393 <END> induces apoptosis in <START:ana> Jurkat T-cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NH2 <END> -terminal amino acid sequence analysis identified the <START:ggp> 140-kDa surface antigen <END> for <START:ggp> mAb J393 <END> as <START:ggp> CD43/leukosialin <END> , the major <START:ggp> sialoglycoprotein <END> of <START:ana> leukocytes <END> . 
While <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> co-expressed two discrete <START:ggp> cell-surface isoforms <END> of <START:ggp> CD43 <END> , recognized by <START:ggp> mAb J393 <END> and <START:ggp> mAb G10-2 <END> , respectively , only <START:ggp> J393/CD43 <END> signaled apoptosis . 
<START:ggp> J393/CD43 <END> was found to be hyposialylated , bearing predominantly O-linked monosaccharide glycans , whereas <START:ggp> G10-2/CD43 <END> bore complex sialylated tetra- and hexasaccharide chains . 
Treatment with soluble , bivalent <START:ggp> mAb J393 <END> killed 25-50 % of the <START:ana> cell population <END> , while concomitant engagement of either the <START:ggp> CD3.TcR complex <END> or the <START:ggp> integrins <END> <START:ggp> CD18 <END> and <START:ggp> CD29 <END> significantly potentiated this effect . 
Treatment of <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> with <START:ggp> mAb J393 <END> induced tyrosine phosphorylation of specific <START:ggp> protein substrates <END> that underwent hyperphosphorylation upon <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> costimulation . 
<START:ggp> Tyrosine kinase <END> inhibition by herbimycin A diminished <START:ggp> J393/CD43 <END> -mediated apoptosis , whereas inhibition of <START:ggp> phosphotyrosine phosphatase <END> activity by bis ( maltolato ) oxovanadium-IV enhanced cell death . 
Signal transduction through tyrosine kinase activation may lead to altered gene expression , as J393/ <START:ggp> CD43 <END> ligation prompted decreases in the nuclear localization of the <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory protein <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and proteins binding the <START:ggp> interferon-inducible regulatory element <END> . 
Since <START:ana> peripheral blood T-lymphocytes <END> express <START:ggp> cryptic epitopes <END> for <START:ggp> mAb J393 <END> , these findings demonstrate the existence of a tightly regulated <START:ggp> CD43 <END> -mediated pathway for inducing apoptosis in <START:ana> human T-cell lineages <END> . 
Sterol dependent <START:ggp> LDL-receptor gene <END> transcription in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> from normal and CML patients . 
<START:ggp> Sterol regulatory element <END> ( <START:ggp> SRE <END> ) has been recognized to regulate various key <START:ggp> genes <END> coding for especially <START:ggp> low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) -receptor <END> , <START:ggp> 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) reductase <END> and <START:ggp> HMG-CoA synthase <END> known to play a crucial role in the cholesterol feedback mechanism . 
The deranged cholesterol feedback mechanism has been widely recognised in initiation as well as progression of various types of cancers including chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) . 
Consequently , the present study was addressed to understand this phenomenon and revealed the existence of a <START:ggp> unique 47 kDa protein factor <END> having affinity for this <START:ggp> SRE sequence <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> from normal subjects as well as its absence in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> from untreated CML patients . 
However , this factor appeared when the CML patients achieved complete haematological remission ( CHR ) through <START:ggp> alpha-interferon <END> therapy . 
Further , an inverse relationship was also observed between sterol modulated <START:ggp> LDL-receptor gene <END> transcription and the binding affinity of this <START:ggp> 47 kDa factor <END> to the <START:ggp> SRE sequence <END> . 
Based upon these results we propose that <START:ggp> alpha-interferon <END> through its receptor initiates phosphatidic acid dependent signalling which in turn regulates the affinity of <START:ggp> 47 kDa sterol regulatory element binding factor <END> as well as <START:ggp> LDL-receptor gene <END> transcription in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> from CML patients . 
Multiple <START:ggp> prolactin-responsive elements <END> mediate G1 and S phase expression of the <START:ggp> interferon regulatory factor-1 gene <END> . 
The <START:ggp> interferon regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) gene <END> is both an <START:ggp> immediate-early G1 phase gene <END> and an <START:ggp> S phase gene <END> inducible by <START:ggp> PRL <END> in <START:ana> rat Nb2 T lymphocytes <END> . 
To understand the mechanism by which <START:ggp> PRL <END> regulates the biphasic expression of <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> , we cloned the <START:ggp> rat IRF-1 gene <END> and functionally characterized the <START:ggp> IRF-1 promoter <END> . 
Upon transfection into <START:ana> Nb2 T cells <END> , 1.7 kilobases ( kb ) of <START:ggp> IRF-1 5'-flanking DNA <END> linked to a <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) reporter gene <END> mediated a 30-fold induction of <START:ggp> CAT enzyme <END> activity in response to 24 h of <START:ggp> PRL <END> stimulation . 
Deletion mutants containing <START:ggp> 1.3 , 0.6 , and 0.2 kb 5'-flanking DNA <END> were incrementally less transcriptionally active , although 0.2 kb still mediated a 12-fold induction by <START:ggp> PRL <END> . 
The sequence between -1.7 and -0.2 kb linked to a <START:ggp> heterologous thymidine kinase promoter <END> failed to respond to <START:ggp> PRL <END> stimulation , suggesting that the activity of <START:ggp> upstream PRL response elements <END> may require an interaction with <START:ggp> promoter-proximal elements <END> . 
By assaying <START:ggp> CAT enzyme <END> activity across a 24-h <START:ggp> PRL <END> induction time course , we were able to assign G1 vs. S phase <START:ggp> PRL <END> responses of the <START:ggp> IRF-1 gene <END> to different regions of the <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> <START:ggp> 5'-flanking <END> and <START:ggp> promoter DNA <END> . 
The 0.2-kb <START:ggp> IRF-CAT construct <END> was induced by <START:ggp> PRL <END> stimulation during the G1 phase of the cell cycle . 
In contrast , the 1.7-kb IRF- <START:ggp> CAT <END> construct was inducible by <START:ggp> PRL <END> during both G1 and S phase of the cell cycle . 
Hence , the <START:ggp> PRL <END> -induced biphasic expression of the <START:ggp> IRF-1 gene <END> appears to be controlled by separate <START:ggp> PRL-responsive elements <END> : elements in the first 0.2 kb of the <START:ggp> IRF-1 promoter region <END> act during early activation , and elements between 0.2 and 1.7 kb act in concert with the proximal 0.2-kb region during S phase progression . 
Regulation of the <START:ggp> BZLF1 promoter <END> of Epstein-Barr virus by second messengers in <START:ana> anti-immunoglobulin-treated B cells <END> . 
Initiation of the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) lytic cycle is dependent on the transcription of the <START:ggp> BZLF1 gene <END> . 
The <START:ggp> BZLF1 gene promoter <END> ( <START:ggp> Zp <END> ) was activated by crosslinking of <START:ggp> cell surface immunoglobulin <END> ( <START:ggp> Ig <END> ) with <START:ggp> anti-Ig antibody <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> , even in the absence of other viral genes . 
We identified several anti-Ig response elements within <START:ggp> Zp <END> , which were originally defined as <START:ggp> 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) response elements <END> ( ZI repeats and <START:ggp> ZII <END> , an <START:ggp> AP-1-like domain <END> ) . 
Since anti-Ig crosslinking leads to activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) and an increase in intracellular calcium level , <START:ggp> Zp <END> was tested for the response to these <START:ggp> cellular factors <END> . 
Treatment with calcium ionophore A23187 increased <START:ggp> Zp <END> activity . 
When the calcium ionophore was used in conjunction with TPA , a <START:ggp> PKC <END> activator , the <START:ggp> Zp <END> induction was synergistically enhanced . 
1- ( 5-Isoquinolinyl sulfonyl ) -2-methylpiperazine , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> PKC <END> , inhibited the <START:ggp> anti-Ig <END> inducibility of <START:ggp> Zp <END> . 
Calmodulin antagonists , compound R24571 and trifluoperazine , blocked the <START:ggp> Zp <END> activation with <START:ggp> anti-Ig <END> . 
These findings suggest that <START:ggp> Zp <END> responds directly to changes in the activity of both <START:ggp> PKC <END> and <START:ggp> calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase <END> . 
Requirement of <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activation for the <START:ggp> anti-Ig <END> -mediated <START:ggp> Zp <END> activation was also demonstrated through the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin . 
These <START:ggp> cellular gene regulatory molecules <END> induced with anti-Ig may cooperatively play an important part in achieving efficient EBV activation as seen with <START:ggp> anti-Ig <END> treatment in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> SCL protein <END> displays cell-specific heterogeneity in size . 
<START:ggp> SCL protein <END> production was examined in a variety of <START:ana> hemopoietic cell lines <END> by immunoblotting using specific polyclonal antisera . 
<START:ggp> SCL protein <END> was detected in <START:ana> erythroid , megakaryocyte , mast and early myeloid cell lines <END> , as well as in several <START:ana> lymphoid leukemia cell lines <END> which are known to harbor <START:ggp> SCL gene rearrangements <END> . 
In most cell lines , proteins of molecular weight 49 and 44 kDa were found , however two myeloid cell lines expressed only lower <START:ggp> molecular weight species of 24 and 22 kDa <END> . 
This size discrepancy appeared to be due to cell-specific translational regulation , since overexpression of a retrovirally transfected <START:ggp> SCL gene <END> yielded the higher molecular weight forms in most <START:ana> cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> GP+E-86 <END> , <START:ana> AT2.5 <END> , <START:ana> M1 <END> ) but only the <START:ggp> 22 kDa form <END> in the <START:ana> myeloid cell line <END> , <START:ana> WEHI-3B/D+ <END> . 
Overexpression of full-length <START:ggp> SCL protein <END> in the <START:ana> lymphoid cell lines <END> , SupT1 and Raji , did not alter cell phenotype and there was no evidence for autoregulation of <START:ggp> SCL <END> transcription . 
The restricted pattern of <START:ggp> SCL protein <END> synthesis is consistent with the restricted expression of <START:ana> SCL mRNA <END> documented previously . 
In addition , the present results indicate that <START:ggp> SCL protein <END> size was determined by regulation of translation in a cell-specific manner . 
Description and functional implications of a novel mutation in the <START:ggp> sex-determining gene <END> <START:ggp> SRY <END> . 
The sex-determining gene <START:ggp> SRY <END> was screened for molecular alteration in an XY sex-reversed female by single-strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) technique . 
An A-to-G transition was detected which leads to an exchange of a tyrosine by a cysteine in the <START:ggp> SRY protein <END> . 
The affected tyrosine residue located at the <START:ggp> C terminus <END> of the <START:ggp> DNA binding protein <END> is evolutionarily strongly conserved among the members of the <START:ggp> HMG box containing proteins <END> . 
Using gel shift assay and peptide synthesis such a mutation is shown to abolish the <START:ggp> SRY <END> protein DNA binding ability . 
The involvement of this particular amino acid in the binding specificity is also discussed . 
Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and <START:ana> T-cell <END> activation by vanadate peroxide , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> protein tyrosine phosphatases <END> . 
Rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of key cellular proteins is a crucial event in the transduction of activation signals to <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> . 
The regulatory role of <START:ggp> protein tyrosine phosphatases <END> ( <START:ggp> PTPases <END> ) in this process was explored by studying the effects of a powerful <START:ggp> PTPase <END> inhibitor , vanadate peroxide ( pervanadate ) , on the activation cascade of <START:ana> Jurkat human leukaemic T-cells <END> . 
Pervanadate induced activation of the <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> <START:ggp> lck <END> and <START:ggp> fyn <END> ( 4- and 3-fold respectively ) and a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> cellular proteins <END> , notably <START:ggp> phospholipase C gamma 1 <END> . 
After this event , we observed a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration , corresponding to an influx . 
This effect required surface expression of the <START:ggp> CD45 PTPase <END> and was not observed in <START:ana> CD45-deficient variants <END> of <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
In the <START:ana> CD45-negative variant <END> , the effect of pervanadate on tyrosine phosphorylation was globally decreased and some phosphorylated substrates were specifically missing . 
Pervanadate also stimulated transcription of the <START:ggp> c-fos gene <END> and accumulation of its <START:ana> mRNA <END> as well as several other hallmarks of <START:ana> T-lymphocyte <END> activation such as surface expression of the CD69 antigen and the interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain ( CD25 ) . 
Pervanadate synergized with signals delivered by <START:ana> T-cell <END> <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> engagement or by a phorbol ester to induce interleukin 2 production . 
<START:ggp> Pervanadate activated NF-kappa B <END> , as shown by an increase in DNA-binding activity of this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
We thus conclude that <START:ggp> PTPases <END> play a crucial role in the negative regulation of signal transduction culminating in <START:ana> T-lymphocyte <END> activation . 
Moreover , induction of tyrosine phosphorylation appears sufficient per se to initiate a complete activation programme . 
Activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> via <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> requires a <START:ggp> Raf kinase <END> and Ca2+ influx . 
Functional synergy between <START:ggp> Raf <END> and <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
Signals transduced via the <START:ggp> TCR <END> activate the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) , which , in turn , is critical to the transcriptional induction of many genes important for the proliferation and expression of a differentiated phenotype . 
Treatment of <START:ana> T cells <END> with the <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> activator PMA in combination with Ca2+ ionophores mimics this process , and the two agents are often substituted for <START:ggp> TCR <END> stimulation , bypassing the <START:ggp> TCR <END> . 
Here we identify intracellular signaling components involved in activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> following <START:ggp> TCR <END> stimulation . 
<START:ggp> TCR <END> signaling was triggered by treating <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> with <START:ggp> PHA <END> or <START:ggp> anti-CD3 Abs <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation was monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and/or by <START:ggp> kappaB <END> -dependent reporter assays . 
Contrary to the idea that <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> is involved in <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , high doses of staurosporine did not interfere with activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> by <START:ggp> PHA <END> , while the same dose of staurosporine completely blocked activation by PMA . 
<START:ggp> PHA <END> -induced kappaB-dependent reporter activity was , however , effectively blocked by a dominant negative form of <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> , suggesting a critical role for a <START:ggp> Raf kinase <END> . 
The <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> was also dependent on a Ca2+ influx , because the Ca2+ channel blocker , SK & F 96365 , as well as other agents that prevented the Ca2+ influx , inhibited <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
Cotransfection of a constitutively active form of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> largely substituted for the Ca2+ requirement and reversed the blockade by SK & F 96365 . 
Consistent with these observations , coexpression of constitutively active forms of <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> and <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> synergistically induced <START:ggp> kappaB <END> -dependent reporter activity , suggesting a physiologically relevant functional interaction between the <START:ggp> kinase <END> and the <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> . 
Synergistic interactions between <START:ggp> overlapping binding sites <END> for the <START:ggp> serum response factor <END> and <START:ggp> ELK-1 proteins <END> mediate both basal enhancement and phorbol ester responsiveness of <START:ggp> primate cytomegalovirus major immediate-early promoters <END> in monocyte and <START:ana> T-lymphocyte <END> cell types . 
Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection is nonpermissive or persistent in many <START:ana> lymphoid and myeloid cell types <END> but can be activated in <START:ana> differentiated macrophages <END> . 
We have shown elsewhere that both the <START:ggp> major immediate-early gene <END> ( <START:ggp> MIE <END> ) and lytic cycle infectious progeny virus expression can be induced in otherwise nonpermissive <START:ana> monocyte-like U-937 cell cultures <END> infected with either human CMV ( HCMV ) or simian CMV ( SCMV ) by treatment with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) . 
Two <START:ggp> multicopy basal enhancer motifs <END> within the SCMV <START:ggp> MIE enhancer <END> , namely , 11 copies of the 16-bp <START:ggp> cyclic AMP response element <END> ( <START:ggp> CRE <END> ) and 3 copies of novel 17-bp <START:ggp> serum response factor ( SRF ) binding sites <END> referred to as the <START:ggp> SNE <END> ( <START:ggp> SRF/NFkappaB-like element <END> ) , as well as four classical <START:ggp> NFkappaB sites <END> within the HCMV version , contribute to TPA responsiveness in transient assays in <START:ana> monocyte and T-cell types <END> . 
The <START:ggp> SCMV SNE sites <END> contain potential overlapping core recognition binding motifs for <START:ggp> SRF <END> , <START:ggp> Rel/NFkappaB <END> , <START:ggp> ETS <END> , and <START:ggp> YY1 class transcription factors <END> but fail to respond to either <START:ggp> serum or tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> . 
Therefore , to evaluate the mechanism of TPA responsiveness of the <START:ggp> SNE motifs <END> and of a related 16-bp <START:ggp> SEE <END> ( <START:ggp> SRF/ETS element <END> ) motif found in the <START:ggp> HCMV and chimpanzee CMV MIE enhancers <END> , we have examined the functional responses and protein binding properties of <START:ggp> multimerized wild-type and mutant elements <END> added upstream to the <START:ggp> SCMV MIE <END> or <START:ggp> simian virus 40 minimal promoter regions <END> in the <START:ana> U-937 <END> , <START:ana> K-562 <END> , <START:ana> HL-60 <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 <END> , and <START:ana> Jurkat cell lines <END> . 
Unlike classical <START:ggp> NFkappaB sites <END> , neither the <START:ggp> SNE <END> nor the <START:ggp> SEE motif <END> responded to phosphatase inhibition by okadaic acid . 
However , the TPA responsiveness of both <START:ggp> CMV elements <END> proved to involve synergistic interactions between the core <START:ggp> SRF binding site <END> ( CCATATATGG ) and the adjacent inverted <START:ggp> ETS binding motifs <END> ( TTCC ) , which correlated directly with formation of a bound <START:ggp> tripartite complex <END> containing both the cellular <START:ggp> SRF <END> and <START:ggp> ELK-1 proteins <END> . 
This <START:ggp> protein complex <END> was more abundant in U-937 , K-562 , and HeLa cell extracts than in <START:ana> Raji <END> , <START:ana> HF <END> , <START:ana> BALB/c 3T3 <END> , or <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> , but the binding activity was altered only twofold after TPA treatment . 
A 40-fold stimulation of <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase <END> activity mediated by four <START:ggp> tandem repeats <END> of the <START:ggp> SNE <END> could be induced within 2 h ( and up to 250-fold within 6 h ) after addition of TPA in <START:ana> DNA-transfected U-937 cells <END> , indicating that the stimulation appeared likely to be a true <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> -mediated signal transduction event rather than a differentiation response . 
Slight differences in the sequence of the <START:ggp> core SRF binding site <END> compared with that of the classical <START:ggp> c-Fos promoter serum response element <END> , together with differences in the spacing between the <START:ggp> SRF and ETS motifs <END> , appear to account for the inability of the <START:ggp> SCMV SNEs <END> to respond to serum induction . 
<START:ana> T-cell <END> -directed <START:ggp> TAL-1 <END> expression induces T-cell malignancies in transgenic mice . 
The <START:ggp> TAL-1 gene <END> specifies for a basic <START:ggp> domain-helix-loop-helix protein <END> , which is involved in the control of normal hematopoiesis . 
In human pathology , the <START:ggp> TAL-1 gene product <END> is expressed in a high percentage of <START:ana> T-cell <END> acute lymphoblastic leukemias in the pediatric age range ; however , it has not been established whether the expression has a causal role in oncogenesis . 
In this report , we describe the phenotype of <START:ana> mouse transgenic lines <END> obtained by inducing <START:ggp> tal-1 protein <END> expression in lymphoid tissues using the <START:ggp> LCK promoter <END> . 
The survival rate of <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> transgenic animals was much lower as compared with control mice . 
Histopathological analysis revealed lymphomas of T-cell type , often comprising a minor B-cell component . 
Some mice showed marked splenic lymphocyte depletion . 
<START:ana> Primary lymphocyte cultures <END> showed partial independence from exogenous growth stimuli and increased resistance to low-serum apoptosis . 
To further unravel the <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> oncogenic potential , a strain of <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> transgenic mice was crossbred with p53-/- mice ; the survival rate in these animals was reduced by more than one-half when compared with that of <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> mice , and histopathological analysis revealed exclusively <START:ana> T-cell <END> lymphomas . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> TAL-1 <END> , expressed in <START:ana> T cells <END> , is per se a potent oncogene , which may exert a key leukemogenetic role in the majority of <START:ana> T-cell <END> acute lymphoblastic leukemias . 
Tissue and cell-type specific expression of the <START:ggp> tuberous sclerosis gene <END> , <START:ggp> TSC2 <END> , in human tissues . 
<START:ggp> TSC2 <END> is a gene on <START:ggp> chromosome 16p13.3 <END> associated with the autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder , tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) . 
By using a partial nucleotide sequence from the cloned <START:ggp> TSC2 <END> and polymerase chain reaction methodology , we constructed a <START:ggp> digoxigenin-labeled complementary DNA probe <END> to examine <START:ggp> TSC2 <END> gene expression in autopsy- or biopsy-derived human tissues by in situ hybridization . 
<START:ana> TSC2 messenger RNA <END> was widely expressed in various cell types throughout the body , including epithelia , <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , and cells with endocrine functions , e.g. , adrenal cortex and anterior pituitary . 
It was prominently and selectively ( within the central nervous system ) expressed in <START:ana> pyramidal cells <END> of the cerebral cortex and other <START:ana> motor neurons <END> , e.g. , in spinal cord and brainstem nuclei . 
Visceral <START:ggp> TSC2 <END> expression was comparable in autopsy tissues from patients with and without TSC ; <START:ggp> TSC2 <END> messenger RNA expression was most prominent in cells with a rapid mitotic rate and turnover , e.g. , epithelia and <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , with central nervous system <START:ana> pyramidal cells <END> and other neurons being an obvious exception , and/or in cells with important secretory/transport functions . 
This widespread expression of the <START:ggp> TSC2 gene <END> supports the view that it encodes a protein vital to cell growth and metabolism or one that functions as a tumor/growth suppressor . 
Apoptosis signaling pathways in normal <START:ana> T cells <END> : differential activity of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1beta-converting enzyme family <END> protease inhibitors on glucocorticoid- and Fas-mediated cytotoxicity . 
<START:ggp> Fas <END> -mediated apoptosis plays an important role in regulating the immune response in <START:ana> peripheral T cells <END> . 
Restimulation of <START:ana> T cell blasts <END> up-regulates <START:ggp> Fas <END> and <START:ggp> Fas <END> ligand expression , with subsequent interaction leading to cell death . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> in <START:ana> tumor cells <END> blocks apoptosis induced by many stimuli , but inhibition of <START:ggp> Fas <END> -mediated killing has not been consistently observed . 
To examine the behavior of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> in <START:ana> normal cells <END> , <START:ana> T cell blasts <END> were transiently transfected with <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> and related <START:ggp> gene products <END> to determine the effect on apoptotic signaling . 
Transient overexpression of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> in mouse and human <START:ana> T cell blasts <END> did not block <START:ggp> Fas <END> -mediated apoptosis , whereas etoposide- and glucocorticoid-induced cytotoxicity was potently inhibited . 
Expression of <START:ggp> Bcl-xL <END> and <START:ggp> adenovirus E1B 19K <END> did not interfere with anti- <START:ggp> Fas <END> killing . 
In contrast , interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme family protease inhibitors Ac-DEVD-CHO and CrmA blocked <START:ggp> Fas <END> -mediated apoptosis . 
These results suggest that <START:ana> peripheral T cells <END> use distinct apoptosis signaling pathways with differential sensitivity to <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> and interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme family protease inhibitors . 
Since <START:ana> T cells <END> normally express <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> and <START:ggp> Bcl-xL <END> following activation , their inability to block <START:ggp> Fas <END> -mediated apoptosis may allow for the elimination of <START:ana> self-reactive cells <END> and the appropriate regulation of immune responses . 
Increased <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> transcription in <START:ana> murine lymphocytes <END> by ciprofloxacin . 
The fluoroquinolone antibiotic , ciprofloxacin ( cipro ) , induces hyperproduction of <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) and <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) in stimulated <START:ana> human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> . 
In this investigation an enhanced and prolonged <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> response was also detected in both stimulated ( <START:ggp> T cell mitogens <END> or <START:ggp> alloantigens <END> ) <START:ana> murine splenocytes <END> and in the stimulated <START:ana> murine T cell line EL-4 <END> in the presence of ciprofloxacin ( 5-80 micrograms/ml ) as compared to control cells without antibiotics . 
However , in contrast to <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> , <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> production was inhibited and <START:ana> IFN-gamma mRNA <END> levels were unaffected at 24 h and only slightly upregulated at 48 and 72 h of culture in <START:ana> murine splenocytes <END> incubated with cipro ( 20 micrograms/ml ) . 
<START:ana> EL-4 cells <END> were transfected with a plasmid containing the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> and <START:ggp> enhancer region <END> linked to the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity revealed that cipro enhanced IL-2 gene induction . 
In addition , <START:ana> EL-4 cells <END> incubated with ciprofloxacin showed an early peak and more activated nuclear factor of <START:ana> activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> ) as compared to control cells without antibiotics . 
Cipro did not affect the <START:ggp> nuclear transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> or <START:ggp> NFIL-2A <END> . 
Taken together , cipro inhibited <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> synthesis , but enhanced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production in <START:ana> murine lymphocytes <END> by means of influencing <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> and causing an increased <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcription . 
Human T-cell leukemia virus type I <START:ggp> Tax <END> associates with and is negatively regulated by the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B2 p100 gene product <END> : implications for viral latency . 
Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is the etiologic agent of the adult T-cell leukemia , an aggressive and often fatal malignancy of <START:ana> activated human CD4 T cells <END> . 
HTLV-I encodes an essential <START:ggp> 40-kDa protein <END> termed <START:ggp> Tax <END> that not only transactivates the long terminal repeat of this retrovirus but also induces an array of <START:ggp> cellular genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> -mediated transformation of <START:ana> T cells <END> likely involves the deregulated expression of various <START:ggp> cellular genes <END> that normally regulate <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> growth produced by altered activity of various endogenous host <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
In particular , <START:ggp> Tax <END> is capable of modulating the expression or activity of various host <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , including members of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> and <START:ggp> CREB/ATF families <END> , as well as the <START:ggp> cellular factors <END> <START:ggp> HEB-1 <END> and <START:ggp> p67SRF <END> . 
An additional distinguishing characteristic of HTLV-I infection is the profound state of viral latency that is present in circulating <START:ana> primary leukemic T cells <END> . 
In this study , we demonstrate that HTLV-I <START:ggp> Tax <END> can physically associate with <START:ggp> p100 <END> , the product of the <START:ggp> Rel-related NF-kappa B2 gene <END> , both in <START:ana> transfected cells <END> and in <START:ana> HTLV-I-infected leukemic T-cell lines <END> . 
Furthermore , the physical interaction of <START:ggp> Tax <END> with <START:ggp> p100 <END> leads to the inhibition of <START:ggp> Tax <END> -induced activation of the HTLV-I and <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeats <END> , reflecting <START:ggp> p100 <END> -mediated cytoplasmic sequestration of the normally nuclearly expressed <START:ggp> Tax protein <END> . 
In contrast , a mutant of <START:ggp> Tax <END> that selectively fails to activate nuclear <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> expression does not associate with <START:ggp> p100 <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Rhabdomyosarcomas do not contain mutations in the DNA binding domains of myogenic <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Skeletal myogenesis is regulated by a group of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> ( <START:ggp> MyoD <END> , <START:ggp> myogenin <END> , <START:ggp> myf5 <END> , and <START:ggp> myf6 <END> ) that are <START:ggp> `` basic helix-loop-helix '' proteins <END> that bind to the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of <START:ggp> muscle-specific genes <END> and promote their expression . 
We have previously shown that after a mutation of Leu122 to Arg the <START:ggp> DNA binding basic domain <END> of <START:ggp> MyoD <END> confers <START:ggp> c-myc <END> -like functional characteristics to the protein . 
In this study we used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to determine whether such mutations occur naturally in rhabdomyosarcomas . 
We have found that the <START:ggp> basic domains <END> of all the <START:ggp> myogenic factors <END> remain unaltered in rhabdomyosarcomas . 
Selection against such mutations may be the result of functional redundancy of these <START:ggp> myogenic transcription factors <END> . 
Function and activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in the immune system . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is a <START:ggp> ubiquitous transcription factor <END> . 
Nevertheless , its properties seem to be most extensively exploited in cells of the immune system . 
Among these properties are <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> 's rapid posttranslational activation in response to many pathogenic signals , its direct participation in cytoplasmic/nuclear signaling , and its potency to activate transcription of a great variety of genes encoding <START:ggp> immunologically relevant proteins <END> . 
In vertebrates , five distinct <START:ggp> DNA binding subunits <END> are currently known which might extensively heterodimerize , thereby forming complexes with distinct transcriptional activity , DNA sequence specificity , and cell type- and cell stage-specific distribution . 
The activity of <START:ggp> DNA binding NF-kappa B dimers <END> is tightly controlled by <START:ggp> accessory proteins <END> called <START:ggp> I kappa B subunits <END> of which there are also five different species currently known in vertebrates . 
<START:ggp> I kappa B proteins <END> inhibit DNA binding and prevent nuclear uptake of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complexes <END> . 
An exception is the <START:ggp> Bcl-3 protein <END> which in addition can function as a <START:ggp> transcription activating subunit <END> in th nucleus . 
Other <START:ggp> I kappa B proteins <END> are rather involved in terminating <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> 's activity in the nucleus . 
The intracellular events that lead to the inactivation of <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> , i.e. the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , are complex . 
They involve phosphorylation and proteolytic reactions and seem to be controlled by the cells ' redox status . 
Interference with the activation or activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> may be beneficial in suppressing toxic/septic shock , graft-vs-host reactions , acute inflammatory reactions , acute phase response , and radiation damage . 
The inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation by antioxidants and specific protease inhibitors may provide a pharmacological basis for interfering with these acute processes . 
Lack of T-cell-mediated recognition of the fusion region of the <START:ggp> pml/RAR-alpha hybrid protein <END> by <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients . 
In previous studies , it was shown that the fusion region of the <START:ggp> pml/RAR-alpha protein <END> , expressed by <START:ana> acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) cells <END> , can be specifically recognized in vitro by donor ( D. E. ) <START:ana> CD4 T cells <END> in a <START:ggp> HLA class II <END> DR11-restricted fashion . 
We present here the results on the recognition of several pml/RAR-alpha peptides by APL patients expressing <START:ggp> HLA DR11 <END> . 
The in vitro immunization of <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> from four patients in remission ( S.R. , F.R. , M.M. , P. G. ) with BCR1/25 , a 25-mer pml/ <START:ggp> RAR-alpha <END> , did not elicit either a polyclonal or a clonal immune response specific to the peptide . 
We then generated new donor <START:ana> anti-pml/RAR-alpha CD4 ( + ) T-cell clones <END> . 
These clones were tested for their recognition of BCR1/25 . 
One clone ( <START:ana> C3/5 , CD3 ( + ) , CD4 ( + ) , CD8 ( - ) <END> ) was selected for further analysis . 
<START:ana> Clone C3/5 <END> showed specific proliferation , cytotoxicity , and cytokine ( <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> , <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ) production when challenged with <START:ana> autologous lymphoblastic cell lines <END> pulsed with peptide BCR1/25 . 
<START:ana> C3/5 cells <END> developed specific proliferation and cytotoxicity when challenged with <START:ana> peptide-pulsed lymphoblastic cell lines <END> and <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> from the four DR11 ( + ) APL patients . 
<START:ana> APL blasts <END> , available only from patients F.R. and P.G. , were not lysed by <START:ana> C3/5 <END> and were unable to present peptide BCR1/25 . 
Incubation of <START:ana> APL cells <END> with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> failed to induce <START:ggp> HLA class II molecules <END> and recognition by the <START:ana> C3/5 clone <END> . 
Since <START:ana> APL cells <END> do not express <START:ggp> HLA class II molecules <END> , we tested in two donors ( D.E. and C.H.R. ) and in patients S.R.and P.G.whether the use of 9-mer peptides ( BCR1/9 ) would generate a <START:ggp> CD8 <END> <START:ggp> /HLA class I <END> -restricted response . 
No <START:ana> peptide-specific T-cell line <END> or clone could be generated from both donors and patients . 
These findings are discussed in relation to possible therapeutic approaches to the immunotherapy of APL . 
The proximal regulatory element of the <START:ggp> interferon-gamma promoter <END> mediates selective expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) is produced by <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> and certain subsets of <START:ana> T cells <END> , but the basis for its selective expression is unknown . 
Within the region between -108 and -40 base pairs of the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> promoter are two conserved and essential <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> , which confer activation-specific expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
This report describes studies indicating that the most proximal of these two <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> is an important determinant of its restricted expression . 
The proximal element is a composite site that binds members of the <START:ggp> CREB/ATF <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> octamer families <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
<START:ggp> Jun <END> is essential for activation-induced transcription and binds preferably as a heterodimer with <START:ggp> ATF-2 <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> CREB <END> appears to dampen transcription from this element . 
The CpG dinucleotide in this <START:ggp> element <END> is selectively methylated in <START:ana> Th2 T cells <END> and other cells that do not express <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , and methylation markedly reduces <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> binding . 
As a target for DNA methylation and for binding of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that mediate or impede transcription , this element appears to play a central role in controlling <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> expression . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> , but not lipopolysaccharide and <START:ggp> anti-IgM <END> stimulation of <START:ana> primary B lymphocytes <END> , leads to a persistent nuclear accumulation of <START:ggp> RelB <END> . 
In this study we analyzed the effect of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> stimulation on the activity and nuclear appearance of <START:ggp> Rel/nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) factors <END> in <START:ana> primary murine B lymphocytes <END> . 
We show that triggering of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> signaling pathway ( s ) by <START:ggp> CD40 ligands <END> expressed on <START:ana> L cells <END> led to strong activation of an <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-controlled beta-globin reporter gene <END> in <START:ana> primary B lymphocytes <END> from transgenic mice . 
Analyses of nuclear translocation of individual members of <START:ggp> Rel proteins <END> after <START:ggp> CD40 <END> induction of <START:ana> primary B cells <END> showed a strong and long-lasting accumulation of <START:ggp> RelB <END> and , less pronounced , of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> . 
LPS stimulation did not give rise to a persistent nuclear accumulation of <START:ggp> RelB <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , whereas nuclear <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , but not <START:ggp> RelB <END> , accumulated after B cell receptor stimulation . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> induced not only nuclear translocation but also de novo synthesis of <START:ana> RelB RNA <END> and protein . 
<START:ana> S107 plasmacytoma cells <END> , which express <START:ggp> CD40 <END> but are defective for the nuclear appearance of <START:ggp> p50/p65-NF-kappaB <END> , do not express <START:ggp> RelB <END> after <START:ggp> CD40 <END> stimulation . 
In <START:ana> S107 cells <END> stably transfected with <START:ggp> relB genes <END> , stimulation of nuclear <START:ggp> RelB <END> translocation by <START:ggp> CD40 <END> was observed . 
These results indicate that stimulation of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> signaling pathways exerts a long-lasting stimulatory effect on both the transcription and nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> RelB <END> . 
Since LPS and <START:ggp> anti-IgM <END> were unable to activate <START:ggp> RelB <END> , <START:ggp> CD40 <END> appears to trigger a special program of gene expression involved in the proliferation and/or differentiation of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
Identification and characterization of a leukocyte-specific component of the nuclear body . 
The nuclear body ( NB ) is a cellular organelle that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia and viral infection . 
The NB is also a target of <START:ggp> antibodies <END> in the serum of patients with the autoimmune disease primary biliary cirrhosis . 
In this study , serum from a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis was used to identify a cDNA encoding a novel component of the NB , a <START:ggp> 140-kDa protein <END> designated <START:ggp> Sp140 <END> . 
The predicted amino acid sequence of the <START:ggp> amino-terminal portion <END> of <START:ggp> Sp140 <END> was similar to <START:ggp> Sp100 <END> , a previously identified <START:ggp> NB protein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> carboxyl portion <END> of <START:ggp> Sp140 <END> contained a <START:ggp> zinc-finger domain <END> and a <START:ggp> bromodomain <END> , motifs that are present in proteins regulating gene transcription . 
High levels of <START:ana> Sp140 mRNA <END> were detected in human spleen and <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocytes <END> , but not other human tissues . 
The level of <START:ana> SP140 mRNA <END> in <START:ana> myeloid precursor cell lines <END> <START:ana> HL60 <END> and <START:ana> NB4 <END> markedly increased in response to chemically induced cellular differentiation . 
Immunohistochemical techniques were used to demonstrate that <START:ggp> SP140 <END> localized to the NB in differentiated <START:ana> HL60 <END> and <START:ana> NB4 cells <END> . 
The location of <START:ggp> Sp140 <END> in the NB , and expression of this gene in cells involved in host defense , suggest that <START:ggp> Sp140 <END> may be involved in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia and viral infection . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> and <START:ggp> cytokine receptor <END> expression by glucocorticoids . 
Glucocorticoids ( GCS ) profoundly inhibit several aspects of T cell immunity largely through inhibition of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels . 
GCS were also reported to act indirectly by inducing transforming <START:ggp> growth factor-beta <END> expression , which in turn blocks T cell immunity . 
In exerting their antiproliferative effects , GCS diffuse into <START:ana> target cells <END> where they bind their <START:ggp> cytoplasmic receptor <END> , which in turn translocates to the nucleus where it inhibits transcription of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> through direct binding to the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid response elements <END> ( <START:ggp> GRE <END> ) , which are located in the promoter region of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> or , alternatively , through antagonism of the action of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> required for optimal transcriptional activation . 
In contrast to their inhibitory effects on <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression , GCS up-regulate <START:ggp> cytokine receptor <END> expression that correlates with enhanced <START:ggp> cytokine <END> effects on <START:ana> target cells <END> . 
In this review , we summarize the current state of knowledge of the mechanism of action of GCS , including the phenomenon of steroid-induced rebound , which ensues upon GCS withdrawal . 
Isolation and characterization of <START:ggp> murine fra-1 <END> : induction mediated by <START:ggp> CD40 <END> and <START:ggp> surface Ig <END> is <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> dependent . 
The <START:ggp> murine fra-1 gene <END> , encoding <START:ggp> Fos-related Ag 1 <END> , was isolated from a <START:ggp> splenic cDNA library <END> and sequenced . 
<START:ggp> Murine fra-1 <END> was highly homologous to <START:ggp> rat and human fra-1 <END> . 
Oligonucleotide primers based on the <START:ggp> murine sequence <END> were used to construct a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay for gene expression . 
<START:ana> B lymphocyte <END> stimulation via both <START:ggp> CD40 <END> and <START:ggp> surface Ig ( sIg ) receptors <END> substantially induced <START:ggp> fra-1 <END> expression , and for both receptors , induction was <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) dependent . 
This contrasts with induction of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> by both <START:ggp> CD40 <END> and <START:ggp> sIg <END> , which is <START:ggp> PKC <END> independent and indicates that <START:ggp> CD40 <END> is capable of signaling through <START:ggp> PKC <END> or a closely related <START:ggp> kinase <END> . 
Induction of <START:ggp> fra-1 <END> following engagement of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> did not require protein synthesis , suggesting that the <START:ggp> PKC <END> -dependent linkage between <START:ggp> CD40 <END> and <START:ggp> fra-1 <END> is direct . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> fra-1 <END> induction did require <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activity . 
These results demonstrate that <START:ggp> CD40 <END> , like <START:ggp> sIg <END> , may employ <START:ggp> PKC <END> in producing select outcomes , that individual <START:ggp> B cell receptors <END> may signal downstream events via both PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways , and that multiple signal transduction pathways may be used to activate the expression of closely related <START:ggp> genes <END> . 
Pentoxifylline for the treatment of infection with human immunodeficiency virus . 
Cytokine dysregulation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection has been documented in numerous studies and has been cited as an important component in the pathogenesis of this retroviral infection . 
Pharmacological modification of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> dysregulation , therefore , has been suggested as a therapeutic modality for HIV-1 infection . 
Dr. Dezube of Beth Israel Hospital ( Boston ) concisely reviews the state of our knowledge regarding the effects of pentoxifylline on expression of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> , a <START:ggp> cytokine <END> known to influence HIV-1 replication and to play a possible role in the clinical manifestations of advanced infection with this virus . 
Pentoxifylline , a trisubstituted xanthine derivative , has been used to decrease blood viscosity and is reasonably well tolerated by most recipients of the drug . 
Results of preliminary studies , many of which were conducted by Dr. Dezube , suggest that use of this agent in combination with antiretroviral compounds may prove useful in the treatment of patients with HIV-1 infection . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor promoter <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> requires cooperative binding of <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
The <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene <END> has been studied extensively as a model system of transcriptional induction during T-lymphocyte activation . 
The <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> is not expressed in <START:ana> resting peripheral blood T cells <END> but is rapidly induced at the transcriptional level following activation through the <START:ggp> cell surface T-cell receptor <END> . 
A highly conserved 19-bp element located immediately 5 ' of the <START:ggp> human GM-CSF TATA box <END> ( <START:ggp> bp -34 to -52 <END> ) , herein called <START:ggp> purine box 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> PB1 <END> ) , has been shown to bind a <START:ggp> T-cell nuclear protein complex <END> and to be required for transcriptional induction of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> following T-cell activation . 
The <START:ggp> PB1 <END> sequence motif is highly conserved in both <START:ggp> human and murine GM-CSF genes <END> . 
In this report , we demonstrate that the <START:ggp> PB1 element <END> alone confers inducibility on a heterologous promoter following transfection into <START:ana> human Jurkat T cells <END> . 
In addition , we identify a major <START:ggp> PB1 nuclear protein-binding complex <END> that is not present in <START:ana> resting peripheral blood T cells <END> but is rapidly induced following T-cell activation . 
Sequence analysis revealed that <START:ggp> PB1 <END> is composed of <START:ggp> adjacent binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> Ets <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
In vitro mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that both the <START:ggp> Ets and AP-1 sites <END> are required for binding of the inducible <START:ggp> PB1 nuclear protein complex <END> and for the transcriptional activity of this element and the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Steroid-resistant asthma . 
Cellular mechanisms contributing to inadequate response to glucocorticoid therapy . 
The current study examined whether alterations in <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) binding contribute to poor response to glucocorticoid therapy in asthma . 
29 asthma patients with forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV1 ) < 70 % predicted were studied . 
Patients were classified as steroid sensitive ( SS ) if their morning FEV1 increased > 30 % after a 1-wk course of oral prednisone 20 mg twice daily and steroid resistant ( SR ) if they failed to increase > 15 % . 
PBMC obtained from these two groups , 17 SR and 12 SS , as well as 12 normal controls were analyzed. SR patients had two distinguishable <START:ggp> GR <END> binding abnormalities : 15 of the 17 SR patients demonstrated a significantly reduced <START:ggp> GR <END> binding affinity , as compared with SS patients ( P = 0.0001 ) and normal controls ( P = 0.0001 ) . 
This defect was localized to <START:ana> T cells <END> and reverted to normal after 48 h in culture media . 
However , incubation with a combination of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> sustained this abnormality . 
The other two SR patients had an abnormally low <START:ggp> GR <END> number with normal binding affinity that was not limited to <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> GR <END> number failed to normalize after incubation in media alone or <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> . 
Therefore , SR asthma may be due to more than one abnormality , the majority related to a reversible <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -induced reduction in <START:ggp> GR <END> binding affinity and the second related to an irreversible reduction in <START:ggp> GR <END> number . 
These findings may have important implications for the design of alternative treatment approaches for recalcitrant asthma . 
Prevalence of aneuploidy , overexpressed <START:ggp> ER <END> , and overexpressed <START:ggp> EGFR <END> in random breast aspirates of women at high and low risk for breast cancer . 
Breast tissue biomarkers which accurately predict breast cancer development within a 10 year period in high risk women are needed but currently not available . 
We initiated this study to determine 1 ) the prevalence of one or more breast tissue abnormalities in a group of women at high risk for breast cancer , and 2 ) if the prevalence of biomarker abnormalities is greater in high risk than in low risk women . 
Eligible high risk women were those with a first degree relative with breast cancer , prior breast cancer , or precancerous mastopathy . 
Low risk women were those without these or other major identifiable risk factors . 
<START:ana> Ductal cells <END> were obtained via random fine needle aspirations and cytologically classified . 
Biomarkers included DNA ploidy , <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) , and <START:ggp> epidermal growth factor receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> EGFR <END> ) . 
The prevalence of DNA aneuploidy was 30 % , overexpression of <START:ggp> ER <END> 10 % , and overexpression of <START:ggp> EGFR <END> 35 % , in the 206 high risk women whose median 10 year Gail risk ( projected probability ) of developing breast cancer was 4.5 % . 
The prevalence of aneuploidy and overexpressed <START:ggp> EGFR <END> was significantly higher in the high risk women than in the 25 low risk controls ( p < 0.002 ) , whose median 10 year Gail risk was 0.7 % . 
The difference in the prevalence of <START:ggp> ER <END> overexpression between high and low risk groups was not statistically significant ( p = 0.095 ) . 
This may be due to the low prevalence of overexpressed <START:ggp> ER <END> and the small number of controls . 
A significant difference was noted in the prevalence of one or more abnormal biomarkers between the high risk and low risk women ( p < 0.001 ) . 
A large prospective trial is needed to determine if one or more of these biomarkers , is predictive of breast cancer development . 
Inhibition of <START:ana> nuclear factor kappa B subunit p65 mRNA <END> accumulation in <START:ana> lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytic cells <END> treated with sodium salicylate . 
Lipopolysaccharide is one of the most potent trigger substances for monocytes and macrophages causing secretion of <START:ggp> inflammatory mediators <END> such as <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> . 
The nature of the nuclear factors involved in regulation of these <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> is still unknown . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ; heterodimer of p50 and p65 ) proteins <END> have been suggested to play an important role in gene transcription of <START:ggp> inflammatory mediators <END> when <START:ana> monocytes <END> are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide . 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as salicylates have been used to treat symptoms of inflammation , and a new mechanism of drug action was suggested recently . 
Salicylates have been shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced gene transcription via inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation by preventing the degradation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B inhibitor <END> `` <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> `` , blocking the translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> into the nuclear compartment . 
However , the nature of the subunit involved in this mechanism has not been defined . 
To examine the mechanisms by which salicylates affect <START:ggp> cytokine <END> gene transcription , the amount of active and inactive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ana> NF-kappa B mRNA <END> , in Porphyromonas gingivalis <START:ana> lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytic cells <END> was assessed . 
High doses of sodium salicylate suppressed <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ana> p65 mRNA <END> accumulation , resulting in suppression of total <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> p50 <END> on tissue oligonucleotide had no effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
The data demonstrate that the <START:ggp> p65 <END> subunit of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is inhibited by salicylate treatment and highlight the role of salicylate in the control of gene expression of <START:ggp> inflammatory mediators <END> . 
Glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of <START:ggp> RANTES <END> expression in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> chemokine <END> <START:ggp> RANTES <END> has been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammatory diseases including asthma and rhinitis which are frequently treated with glucocorticoids . 
We observed that dexamethasone dramatically inhibited <START:ana> RANTES mRNA <END> expression dose dependently in <START:ana> anti-CD3 activated Hut-78 T cells <END> and <START:ana> human PBMCs <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> RANTES <END> expression did not appear to be secondary to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> inhibition and required binding to the intracellular <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
The down-regulation of <START:ggp> RANTES <END> expression by glucocorticoids in <START:ana> T cells <END> may directly contribute to the efficacy of these agents in suppressing cellular infiltration and to their anti-inflammatory properties . 
Association of <START:ggp> TRAF1 <END> , <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> , and <START:ggp> TRAF3 <END> with an <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus LMP1 domain <END> important for <START:ana> B-lymphocyte <END> transformation : role in <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) transforming protein LMP1 <END> appears to be a <START:ggp> constitutively activated tumor necrosis factor receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNFR <END> ) on the basis of an intrinsic ability to aggregate in the plasma membrane and an association of its <START:ggp> cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus <END> ( <START:ggp> CT <END> ) with <START:ggp> TNFR-associated factors <END> ( <START:ggp> TRAFs <END> ) . 
We now show that in <START:ana> EBV-transformed B lymphocytes <END> most of <START:ggp> TRAF1 <END> or <START:ggp> TRAF3 <END> and 5 % of <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> are associated with <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> and that most of <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> is associated with <START:ggp> TRAF1 <END> or <START:ggp> TRAF3 <END> . 
<START:ggp> TRAF1 <END> , <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> , and <START:ggp> TRAF3 <END> bind to a single site in the <START:ggp> LMP1 CT <END> corresponding to amino acids ( aa ) 199 to 214 , within a domain which is important for B-lymphocyte growth transformation ( aa 187 to 231 ) . 
Further deletional and alanine mutagenesis analyses and comparison with <START:ggp> TRAF binding sequences <END> in CD40 , in CD30 , and in the <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> of other lymphycryptoviruses provide the first evidence that <START:ggp> PXQXT/S <END> is a core <START:ggp> TRAF binding motif <END> . 
The negative effects of point mutations in the <START:ggp> LMP1 ( 1-231 ) core TRAF binding motif <END> on TRAF binding and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation genetically link the <START:ggp> TRAFs <END> to <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> ( 1-231 ) -mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation by <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> ( 1-231 ) is likely to be mediated by <START:ggp> TRAF1 <END> <START:ggp> /TRAF2 <END> heteroaggregates since <START:ggp> TRAF1 <END> is unique among the <START:ggp> TRAFs <END> in coactivating <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> with <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> ( 1-231 ) , a <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> dominant-negative mutant can block <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> ( 1-231 ) -mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation as well as <START:ggp> TRAF1 <END> coactivation , and 30 % of <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> is associated with <START:ggp> TRAF1 <END> in EBV-transformed B cells . 
<START:ggp> TRAF3 <END> is a negative modulator of <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> ( 1-231 ) -mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
Surprisingly , <START:ggp> TRAF1 , -2 , or -3 <END> does not interact with the <START:ggp> terminal LMP1 CT <END> aa 333 to 386 which can independently mediate <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
The constitutive association of <START:ggp> TRAFs <END> with <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> through the <START:ggp> aa 187 to 231 domain <END> which is important in <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and primary <START:ana> B-lymphocyte <END> growth transformation implicates <START:ggp> TRAF <END> aggregation in <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> signaling . 
Lack of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> signaling in <START:ana> human allergen-specific Th2 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-12 <END> is a powerful skewer of <START:ana> CD4+ T cell <END> responses toward the Th1 phenotype by inducing <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> production in <START:ana> naive Th cells <END> . 
In the present study we addressed the question of whether <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> can reverse established Th2 responses into Th1/Th0 responses by inducing <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> production in <START:ana> memory Th2 cells <END> . 
To this aim , <START:ana> allergen-specific CD4+ T cell clones <END> ( <START:ana> TCC <END> ) were generated from the peripheral blood of three atopic patients , and their <START:ggp> cytokine <END> profiles were analyzed . 
The majority of these <START:ana> TCC <END> exhibited a strongly polarized Th2 <START:ggp> cytokine <END> profile , and the production of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> could not be induced by exogenous <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> . 
Only those <START:ana> TCC <END> with low <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> levels in the absence of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> responded to <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> by additional enhancement of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> production . 
The <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> nonresponsiveness of the <START:ana> Th2 clones <END> was further evident by the total lack of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> -induced phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> ( <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription-4 <END> ) , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> that is typically involved in <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> signaling . 
Consequently , <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> also failed to induce the DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> STAT4-containing complexes <END> in the nuclei of these <START:ana> Th2 clones <END> . 
All <START:ana> TCC <END> expressed equal levels of the <START:ggp> low-affinity IL-12R beta1 subunit <END> . 
Our results indicate that human allergen-specific Th cells with strongly polarized Th2 <START:ggp> cytokine <END> profiles do not respond to <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and , therefore , can not be induced to produce <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
The apparent high frequency of <START:ana> IL-12-nonresponsive Th cells <END> within the allergen-specific populations in atopic patients predicts a limited skewing potential of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> in the case of established Th2 responses , but only affecting newly recruited naive <START:ana> Th cells <END> . 
Cloning and expression of the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus-encoded dUTPase <END> : patients with acute , reactivated or chronic virus infection develop <START:ggp> antibodies <END> against the <START:ggp> enzyme <END> . 
The gene encoding the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -specific dUTPase <END> was amplified from <START:ggp> virus DNA <END> by PCR . 
The active enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and in <START:ana> insect cells <END> as a <START:ggp> non-fusion protein <END> . 
The protein from E. coli specifically converted dUTP to dUMP and did not react with other dNTPs or NTPs . 
Preliminary experiments yielded a Km value of about 0.8 microM for dUTP . 
MAbs against the <START:ggp> dUTPase <END> reacted with a protein of approximately 31 kDa in <START:ana> 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) -stimulated B cells <END> harbouring either type 1 or type 2 EBV . 
The protein was found in <START:ana> untreated cells <END> at low levels , whereas induction of the lytic replication cycle by TPA treatment or by providing the <START:ggp> immediate early transactivator <END> <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> in trans resulted in increased expression . 
We demonstrated that the <START:ggp> virus dUTPase <END> isolated from <START:ana> EBV-infected cells <END> is a <START:ggp> phosphoprotein <END> . 
The protein expressed in <START:ana> insect cells <END> was used to test for the presence of <START:ggp> specific antibodies <END> in sera from normal , healthy carriers and from patients with various diseases . 
While the sera of EBV-negative individuals ( 0/3 ) or healthy carriers ( 0/33 ) did not contain detectable levels of antibodies , patients with mononucleosis ( 5/18 ) , chronic EBV infection ( 2/7 ) , EBV reactivation ( 7/20 ) and human immunodeficiency virus infection ( 5/24 ) showed elevated antibody titres against the enzyme . 
This indicated that the dUTPase is expressed during EBV replication and reactivation . 
The enzyme might therefore be a potential target for drug therapy under conditions of active DNA replication . 
The <START:ggp> catalytic domain <END> of <START:ggp> pp56 ( lck ) <END> , but not its <START:ggp> regulatory domain <END> , is sufficient for inducing <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production . 
The <START:ggp> lymphoid src kinase <END> <START:ggp> pp56 ( lck ) <END> has been shown to be essential for the induction of different <START:ana> T lymphocyte <END> responses , including <START:ggp> CD4 <END> -mediated enhancement of Ag-induced T cell activation , early T cell differentiation , induction of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production , and cytotoxicity . 
It is assumed that <START:ggp> pp56 ( lck ) <END> acts on these processes by phosphorylating substrates . 
However , it has been recently reported that the <START:ggp> NH2 <END> <START:ggp> regulatory domain <END> is sufficient to mediate <START:ggp> CD4 <END> accessory function . 
In this report we address the contribution of the <START:ggp> regulatory and catalytic domains <END> of <START:ggp> pp56 ( lck ) <END> to another function of this enzyme independent of <START:ggp> CD4 <END> : TCR-induced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production . 
Two <START:ggp> pp56 ( lck ) mutants <END> lacking either the entire <START:ggp> catalytic domain <END> or the entire <START:ggp> NH2 <END> <START:ggp> regulatory domain <END> were generated , and their abilities to trigger transactivation of the <START:ggp> TCR-regulated nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) region <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> were compared . 
Only the catalytic , but not the <START:ggp> NH2 <END> regulatory , domain of <START:ggp> pp56 ( lck ) <END> was able to induce <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> region transactivation on its own and to cooperate with other intracellular signals to trigger this response . 
Moreover , the <START:ggp> catalytic domain <END> of <START:ggp> pp56 ( lck ) <END> was able to induce <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production to an extent similar to that of wild-type <START:ggp> pp56 ( lck ) <END> . 
We conclude that different domains of the <START:ggp> pp56 ( lck ) <END> molecule contribute to regulate distinct biologic functions . 
In fact , while the <START:ggp> NH2 <END> <START:ggp> regulatory domain <END> is sufficient to mediate <START:ggp> CD4 <END> accessory function , we show here that the <START:ggp> catalytic domain <END> of <START:ggp> pp56 ( lck ) <END> is sufficient for induction of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production , mimicking <START:ggp> TCR <END> ligation . 
[ The changes in glucocorticoid receptors in <START:ana> peripheral leukocytes <END> in asthmatic subjects ] 
The number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GCR <END> ) in <START:ana> peripheral leukocytes <END> was determined by radioligand-binding assay in extrinsic and intrinsic asthmatics . 
Their corresponding plasma cortisol levels were assessed . 
The results showed that the average number of <START:ggp> GCR <END> in asthmatics was significantly lower than that in healthy subjects ( P < 0.01 ) , and there was a linear correlation between the number of <START:ggp> GCR <END> and the course of asthma . 
Besides , there was also a linear correlation between the number of <START:ggp> GCR <END> and the age of the initial attack of asthma . 
No difference in plasma cortisol level was found between asthmatics and healthy subjects . 
These findings suggest that there is no primary and general impairment of glucocorticoid metabolism in the asthmatics , but the number of <START:ggp> GCR <END> in the asthmatics is lower than that in healthy controls . 
The decrease of the number of <START:ggp> GCR <END> in asthmatics , we think , is related to heredity and repeated attacks of asthma . 
Novel <START:ggp> aldosterone receptors <END> : specificity-conferring mechanism at the level of the cell membrane . 
Functional studies in <START:ana> extra-renal , nonepithelial cells <END> such as <START:ana> smooth muscle cells <END> and more recently circulating <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> have provided increasing evidence that aldosterone produces not only classical genomic effects , but also rapid non-genomic effects on transmembrane electrolyte movements . 
These involve activation of the <START:ggp> sodium/proton-exchanger <END> of the cell membrane at very low , physiological concentrations of aldosterone with an acute onset within 1-2 minutes . 
A second messenger cascade involved is the inositol-1 , 4 , 5-trisphosphate/calcium pathway which responds over the same rapid time course . 
Such changes clearly can not be explained by genomic mechanisms , which are responsible for later effects than the membrane-related rapid responses . 
In addition to its rapid time course the unique characteristics of this new pathway for steroid action include a 10000-fold selectivity for aldosterone over cortisol and the ineffectiveness of spironolactones , classical mineralocorticoid antagonists , as antagonists of the response . 
Subsequently binding sites have been demonstrated in the plasma membrane of <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> which show pharmacological ( aldosterone specificity ) and kinetic ( high turnover ) properties identical with those of the rapid aldosterone effects in the same cells . 
SDS-PAGE analysis of the <START:ggp> receptor protein <END> has shown a molecular weight of approximately 50 kD . 
The present paper reviews the data supporting a new , two-step model for non-genomic and genomic aldosterone effects . 
It also suggests a novel specificity-conferring mechanism for mineralocorticoid action at the membrane level . 
The <START:ggp> macrophage transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> directs tissue-specific expression of the <START:ggp> macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) receptor <END> is expressed in a tissue-specific fashion from two distinct <START:ggp> promoters <END> in <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> and the placenta . 
In order to further understand the transcription factors which play a role in the commitment of <START:ana> multipotential progenitors <END> to the monocyte/macrophage lineage , we have initiated an investigation of the factors which activate the <START:ggp> M-CSF receptor <END> very early during the monocyte differentiation process . 
Here we demonstrate that the <START:ggp> human monocytic M-CSF receptor promoter <END> directs reporter gene activity in a tissue-specific fashion . 
Since one of the few <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> which have been implicated in the regulation of <START:ggp> monocyte genes <END> is the <START:ggp> macrophage- and B-cell-specific PU.1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , we investigated whether <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> binds and activates the <START:ggp> M-CSF receptor promoter <END> . 
Here we demonstrate that both in <START:ggp> vitro-translated PU.1 <END> and <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> from nuclear extracts bind to a specific site in the <START:ggp> M-CSF receptor promoter <END> just upstream from the <START:ggp> major transcription initiation site <END> . 
Mutations in this site which eliminate <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> binding decrease <START:ggp> M-CSF receptor <END> promoter activity significantly in <START:ana> macrophage cell lines <END> only . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> transactivates the <START:ggp> M-CSF receptor promoter <END> in <START:ana> nonmacrophage cells <END> . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> plays a major role in macrophage gene regulation and development by directing the expression of a receptor for a <START:ggp> key macrophage growth factor <END> . 
Increased natural killer cell activity correlates with low or negative expression of the <START:ggp> HER-2/neu oncogene <END> in patients with breast cancer . 
BACKGROUND . 
Increased expression of the <START:ggp> HER-2/neu oncogene <END> in breast cancer correlates with decreased <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> concentration and seems to be an important prognostic factor . 
The authors investigated whether there is a correlation between <START:ggp> HER-2/neu <END> expression and immunologic parameters representing tumor defense in patients with breast cancer . 
METHOD . 
A Western blot analysis was used to investigate <START:ggp> HER-2/neu <END> expression , whereas a chromium-release assay using the <START:ana> K562 cell line <END> as target was used to measure <START:ana> natural killer ( NK ) cell <END> activity . 
RESULTS . 
In patients with breast cancer , <START:ana> NK cell <END> activity was significantly higher compared with patients with <START:ana> benign tumors <END> ( P = 0.006 ) or healthy control subjects ( P = 0.002 ) . 
Moreover , 23.3 % of patients with breast cancer showed an overexpression of <START:ggp> HER-2/neu protein <END> . 
Within this group of patients , <START:ana> NK cell <END> activity was significantly lower ( 45.6 +/- 16.1 % ) compared with the group with no <START:ggp> HER-2/neu <END> overexpression ( 57.3 +/- 11.0 % ) . 
<START:ana> NK cell <END> activity did not increase in patients with <START:ggp> HER-2/neu <END> overexpression . 
Thus , there was a statistically significant correlation of cytolytic effector cell function with <START:ggp> HER-2/neu <END> expression of the tumor ( P = 0.003 ) , and <START:ggp> HER-2/neu <END> overexpression correlated with a negative <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> status ( P = 0.005 ) . 
CONCLUSION . 
These data add further evidence to previous observations from the authors ' laboratory that certain tumor characteristics may be associated with reactions of the host with breast cancer . 
[ The value of the clinical test of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> of <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocytes <END> in patients with chronic pulmonary heart disease ] 
In order to inquire into the functional state of adrenal cortex in patients with pulmonary heart disease , the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GCR <END> ) of <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocytes <END> in patients with chronic pulmonary heart disease was determined with radioligand-binding assay and the corresponding plasma cortisol levels were assessed with radioimmune assays . 
The results showed that the number of <START:ggp> GCR <END> in the patients was significantly reduced ( P < 0.01 ) and it was increased when their health state was improved . 
However , it was still lower than that in healthy subjects ( P < 0.01 ) . 
The number of <START:ggp> GCR <END> in the patients was greatly increased when these patients were treated with oxygen ( P < 0.01 ) . 
No difference in plasma cortisol was found between the patients and the healthy subjects ( P > 0.05 ) . 
These results indicate that the function of adrenal cortex may be improved by the compensation mechanism of the patients , but the lower <START:ggp> GCR <END> number was the result of lacking of oxygen in the patients . 
The number of <START:ggp> GCR <END> may be improved by inhalation of oxygen . 
Therefore oxygen therapy is helpful in raising the activity of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> and controlling the development of the disease . 
Signaling via <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> in <START:ana> JAK3-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency lymphocytes <END> : <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> -dependent and independent pathways . 
Both <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> bind to receptors containing the <START:ggp> common gamma chain <END> and <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> is required for proper lymphoid development , the precise roles of this kinase in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> signaling in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> have not been defined . 
Here , we have studied <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> signaling in <START:ana> B cell lines <END> lacking <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced phosphorylation of <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> , <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> all required the presence of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -mediated phosphorylation of <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> , and <START:ggp> insulin receptor <END> substrates 1 and 2 did not . 
However , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -induced effects were clearly improved following <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> expression . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> signaling occurs in the absence of of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> , but is comparatively inefficient . 
These findings may help in understanding the pathogenesis of the immunodeficiency that occurs with mutations of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> and may suggest a mechanism for the pleiotropic effects of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> bind to a critical element in a new enhancer of the <START:ggp> human interleukin-2 receptor alpha gene <END> [ published erratum appears in Mol Cell Biol 1997 Apr ; 17 ( 4 ) : 2351 ] 
The <START:ggp> interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain ( IL-2R alpha ) gene <END> is a key regulator of lymphocyte proliferation . 
<START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> is rapidly and potently induced in <START:ana> T cells <END> in response to mitogenic stimuli . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) stimulates <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> . 
transcription , thereby amplifying expression of its own <START:ggp> high-affinity receptor <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> transcription is at least in part controlled by two <START:ggp> positive regulatory regions <END> , <START:ggp> PRRI <END> and <START:ggp> PRRII <END> . 
<START:ggp> PRRI <END> is an <START:ggp> inducible proximal enhancer <END> , located <START:ggp> between nucleotides -276 and -244 <END> , which contains <START:ggp> NF-kappaB and SRE/CArG motifs <END> . 
<START:ggp> PRRII <END> is a <START:ggp> T-cell-specific enhancer <END> , located between nucleotides -137 and -64 , which binds the <START:ggp> T-cell-specific Ets protein <END> <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> and <START:ggp> HMG-I ( Y ) proteins <END> . 
However , none of these proximal regions account for the induction of IL-2R alpha transcription by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
To find new <START:ggp> regulatory regions <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha gene <END> , 8.5 kb of the 5 ' end noncoding sequence of the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha gene <END> have been sequenced . 
We identified an 86-nucleotide fragment that is 90 % identical to the recently characterized <START:ggp> murine IL-2-responsive element <END> ( <START:ggp> mIL-2rE <END> ) . 
This putative <START:ggp> human IL-2rE <END> , designated <START:ggp> PRRIII <END> , confers <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> responsiveness on a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> PRRIII <END> contains a <START:ggp> Stat protein binding site <END> that overlaps with an <START:ggp> EBS motif <END> ( <START:ggp> GASd/EBSd <END> ) . 
These are essential for <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> inducibility of <START:ggp> PRRIII/CAT reporter constructs <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induced the binding of <START:ggp> Stat5a and b proteins <END> to the <START:ggp> human GASd element <END> . 
To confirm the physiological relevance of these findings , we carried out in vivo footprinting experiments which showed that stimulation of <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> expression correlated with occupancy of the <START:ggp> GASd element <END> . 
Our data demonstrate a major role of the <START:ggp> GASd/EBSd element <END> in <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> regulation and suggest that the <START:ggp> T-cell-specific Elf-1 factor <END> can serve as a <START:ggp> transcriptional repressor <END> . 
Signal transduction by <START:ggp> DR3 <END> , a <START:ggp> death domain-containing receptor <END> related to <START:ggp> TNFR-1 <END> and <START:ggp> CD95 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> TNFR-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> CD95 <END> ( also called <START:ggp> Fas <END> or <START:ggp> APO-1 <END> ) are <START:ggp> cytokine receptors <END> that engage the apoptosis pathway through a region of intracellular homology , designated the `` <START:ggp> death domain <END> . '' Another <START:ggp> death domain-containing member <END> of the <START:ggp> TNFR family <END> , <START:ggp> death receptor 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> DR3 <END> ) , was identified and was shown to induce both apoptosis and activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> DR3 <END> appears to be restricted to tissues enriched in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> DR3 <END> signal transduction is mediated by a complex of <START:ggp> intracellular signaling molecules <END> including <START:ggp> TRADD <END> , <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> , <START:ggp> FADD <END> , and <START:ggp> FLICE <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> DR3 <END> likely plays a role in regulating lymphocyte homeostasis . 
Differential nuclear localization of <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p52 <END> , and <START:ggp> RelB <END> proteins in <START:ana> human accessory cells <END> of the immune response in situ . 
The <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B proteins <END> , <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p52 <END> , <START:ggp> p65 <END> , <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , and <START:ggp> RelB <END> , constitute a family of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> involved in the positive regulation of a variety of genes during the immune response . 
Recently , it has been shown that <START:ggp> RelB <END> knockout mice have no <START:ana> dendritic cells <END> ( <START:ana> DC <END> ) . 
An overexpression of <START:ggp> p50 <END> has been described in <START:ana> follicular dendritic cells <END> ( <START:ana> FDC <END> ) . 
A constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity has been reported in <START:ana> mature macrophages <END> . 
This led to the hypothesis that some of the <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B proteins <END> were key <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> in functions of <START:ana> accessory cells <END> of the immune response . 
Therefore , we investigated in situ the nuclear localization of <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B proteins <END> in <START:ana> accessory cells <END> of the immune system by immunohistochemistry and double labeling by immunofluorescence from five normal human tonsils and five lymph nodes with follicular hyperplasia . 
Nuclear <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> proteins were found in all cell types including <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
In germinal centers GC , <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p52 <END> , and <START:ggp> RelB <END> were found in the nuclei of <START:ana> FDC <END> only and were not detected in the nuclei of <START:ana> CD68+ cells <END> . 
In T cell areas , <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p52 <END> , and <START:ggp> RelB <END> were found in the nuclei of <START:ana> HLA-DR+ cells <END> with an antigen-presenting cell ( APC ) morphology . 
<START:ggp> p52 <END> and <START:ggp> RelB <END> were detected in the nuclei in both <START:ana> CD1a+ <END> and <START:ana> CD68+ cells <END> from the T cell area , whereas <START:ggp> p50 <END> was found only in <START:ana> CD68- and CD1a- cells <END> . 
Cells with nuclear <START:ggp> p50 <END> were negative for the <START:ggp> CD38 <END> , <START:ggp> CD20 <END> and <START:ggp> CD2 markers <END> . 
These results show that , physiologically , high levels of nuclear of <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p52 <END> and <START:ggp> RelB <END> are restricted to <START:ana> accessory cells <END> of the immune system , which include <START:ana> FDC <END> in GC , and <START:ana> DC <END> and macrophages in the T cell zone , that specialized <START:ana> scavenger macrophages <END> from <START:ana> GC <END> do not have detectable levels of <START:ggp> p52 <END> and <START:ggp> RelB <END> , whereas <START:ana> macrophages <END> from the T cell area , known to present the antigen to <START:ana> T cells <END> , do have both nuclear <START:ggp> p52 <END> and <START:ggp> RelB <END> , and that in the T cell zone , <START:ggp> p52 <END> and <START:ggp> RelB <END> are located in nuclei of both <START:ana> CD1a+ <END> , <START:ana> CD68+ <END> or both , cells <START:ana> APC <END> , whereas <START:ggp> p50 <END> is restricted to <START:ana> CD1a- <END> and <START:ana> CD68- APC <END> . 
The different patterns of <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p52 <END> and <START:ggp> RelB <END> protein nuclear localization may provide insight into their different roles during the immune response in vivo . 
Tyrosines 113 , 128 , and 145 of <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> are required for optimal augmentation of <START:ggp> NFAT promoter <END> activity . 
<START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> ( <START:ggp> SH2 domain leukocyte protein <END> of 76 kDa ) is a recently identified substrate of the <START:ggp> TCR-stimulated protein <END> <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> that functions in the signal transduction cascade linking the <START:ggp> TCR <END> with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> gene expression . 
In this report , we demonstrate that engagement of the <START:ggp> TCR <END> results in tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> in its <START:ggp> amino-terminal acidic region <END> . 
Two tyrosines ( Y113 and Y128 ) fall within an identical five amino-acid motif and are shown to be phosphorylated upon <START:ggp> TCR <END> ligation . 
Although mutation of either Y113 and Y128 has a minimal effect on <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> function , mutation of both residues decreases significantly the ability of <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> to promote T cell activation . 
A third tyrosine within the <START:ggp> amino-terminal region <END> ( Y145 ) appears to be the most important for optimal <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> function , as altering it alone to phenylalanine has a potent impact on <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> augmentation of <START:ggp> NFAT promoter <END> activity . 
<START:ggp> Human interferon regulatory factor 2 gene <END> . 
Intron-exon organization and functional analysis of <START:ggp> 5'-flanking region <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interferon regulatory factor 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IRF-2 <END> ) is a <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory protein <END> that terminates <START:ggp> interferon beta <END> expression initiated by <START:ggp> interferon regulatory factor 1 <END> . 
In this study , we isolated the <START:ggp> genomic DNA <END> for <START:ggp> human IRF-2 gene <END> , determined the intron-exon structure of the <START:ggp> human IRF-2 gene <END> , mapped the <START:ggp> major transcription initiation site <END> , identified a number of potential regulatory elements in the <START:ggp> 5'-flanking region <END> , and localized the <START:ggp> IRF-2 gene <END> on <START:ggp> human chromosome 4 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> IRF-2 <END> <START:ggp> promoter region <END> contains a CpG island , with several <START:ggp> GC boxes <END> , a putative <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-binding site <END> , and a <START:ggp> CAAT box <END> , but no <START:ggp> TATA box <END> . 
When the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> was linked with a <START:ggp> heterologous reporter gene <END> , we found that the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> is inducible by both <START:ggp> interferons <END> ( <START:ggp> interferon-alpha and -gamma <END> ) and <START:ggp> interferon regulatory factor 1 <END> . 
The region which induced these inductions was identified as being confined to <START:ggp> 40 nucleotides 5 ' <END> to the <START:ggp> major transcriptional initiation site <END> by testing a series of clones with <START:ggp> truncated promoter <END> of <START:ggp> IRF-2 <END> . 
This region contains elements which are shared with the <START:ggp> transcriptional enhancers <END> of other genes including <START:ggp> interferon regulatory factor 1 <END> , <START:ggp> interferon beta <END> , and <START:ggp> interferon-inducible genes <END> . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> interferon regulatory factor 1 <END> not only triggers the activation of the <START:ggp> interferon <END> signal transduction pathway , but also may play a role in limiting the duration of this response by activating the transcription of <START:ggp> IRF-2 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interferon alpha <END> selectively affects expression of the <START:ggp> human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen <END> in <START:ana> late stage cells <END> in the <START:ana> monocytic <END> but not the <START:ana> granulocytic lineage <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen <END> ( <START:ggp> MNDA <END> ) is expressed constitutively in cells of the <START:ana> myeloid lineage <END> , appearing in <START:ana> myeloblast cells <END> in some cases of acute myeloid leukemia and consistently being detected in <START:ana> promyelocyte stage cells <END> as well as in all <START:ana> later stage cells <END> including <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> and <START:ana> granulocytes <END> . 
The <START:ana> human myeloid leukemia cell lines <END> , <START:ana> HL-60 <END> , <START:ana> U937 <END> , and <START:ana> THP-1 <END> , express similar levels of immunochemically detectable <START:ggp> MNDA <END> . 
Although , the level of <START:ana> MNDA mRNA <END> in <START:ana> primary monocytes <END> is very low it was up-regulated at 6 h following the addition of <START:ggp> interferon alpha <END> . 
The effect of <START:ggp> interferon alpha <END> on the <START:ana> MNDA mRNA <END> is also observed in the <START:ana> cell lines <END> <START:ana> HL-60 <END> , <START:ana> U937 <END> , and <START:ana> THP-1 <END> . 
The <START:ana> MNDA mRNA <END> level in <START:ana> primary granulocytes <END> was unaffected by addition of <START:ggp> interferon alpha <END> and other agents including <START:ggp> interferon gamma <END> , <START:ggp> endotoxin <END> , <START:ggp> poly ( I ) .poly ( C ) <END> , and <START:ggp> FMLP <END> . 
The <START:ana> MNDA mRNA <END> level in the <START:ana> myeloid cell lines <END> was also unaffected by the latter four agents . 
Induction of differentiation in the <START:ana> myeloid cell lines <END> with phorbol ester induces monocyte differentiation which was accompanied by a decrease in <START:ana> MNDA mRNA <END> level . 
This reduced level of <START:ana> mRNA <END> could then be elevated with subsequent <START:ggp> interferon alpha <END> treatment . 
The effects of phorbol ester on <START:ana> MNDA mRNA <END> appeared to be associated with induced differentiation since inhibiting cell proliferation did not alter the level of <START:ana> MNDA mRNA <END> and cell cycle variation in <START:ana> MNDA mRNA <END> levels were not observed . 
The ability of <START:ggp> interferon alpha <END> to up-regulate <START:ana> MNDA mRNA <END> in phorbol ester treated <START:ana> myeloid cell lines <END> is consistent with the observations made in <START:ana> primary monocytes <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Involvement of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> YB-1 <END> in human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I basal gene expression . 
Sequences which control basal human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) transcription likely play an important role in initiation and maintenance of virus replication . 
We previously identified and analyzed a <START:ggp> 45-nucleotide sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> downstream regulatory element 1 <END> [ <START:ggp> DRE 1 <END> ] ) , <START:ggp> +195 to +240 <END> , at the boundary of the <START:ggp> R/U5 region <END> of the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> which is required for HTLV-I basal transcription . 
We identified a protein , p37 , which specifically bound to <START:ggp> DRE 1 <END> . 
An affinity column fraction , containing <START:ggp> p37 <END> , stimulated HTLV-I transcription approximately 12-fold in vitro . 
We now report the identification of a <START:ggp> cDNA clone <END> ( <START:ggp> 15B-7 <END> ) , from a <START:ggp> Jurkat expression library <END> , that binds specifically to the <START:ggp> DRE 1 regulatory sequence <END> . 
Binding of the <START:ggp> cDNA fusion protein <END> , similarly to the results obtained with purified Jurkat protein , was decreased by introduction of site-specific mutations in the <START:ggp> DRE 1 regulatory sequence <END> . 
In vitro transcription and translation of <START:ggp> 15B-7 cDNA <END> produced a <START:ggp> fusion protein <END> which bound specifically to the HTLV-I +195 to +240 oligonucleotide . 
The <START:ggp> partial cDNA <END> encodes a protein which is homologous to the <START:ggp> C-terminal 196 amino acids <END> of the <START:ggp> 36-kDa transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> YB-1 <END> . 
Cotransfection of a <START:ggp> YB-1 expression plasmid <END> increases HTLV-I basal transcription approximately 14-fold in <START:ana> Jurkat T lymphocytes <END> . 
On the basis of the molecular weight , DNA-binding characteristics , and in vivo transactivation activity , we suggest that the previously identified <START:ggp> DRE 1 <END> -binding protein , <START:ggp> p37 <END> , is <START:ggp> YB-1 <END> . 
Changes in triiodothyronine ( T3 ) mononuclear leukocyte receptor kinetics after T3 administration and multiple cold-air exposures . 
Repeated cold-air exposures increase human triiodothyronine ( T3 ) plasma clearance rates . 
To study the response of the <START:ggp> nuclear T3 receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> NT3R <END> ) in this condition , binding characteristics were analyzed in <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> ( <START:ana> MNL <END> ) . 
In addition , we supplemented one group of individuals with a daily oral replacement dose of T3 to isolate the influence of serum thyroxine ( T4 ) and thyrotropin ( TSH ) levels on receptor kinetics . 
The subjects were exposed to cold air ( 4 degrees C ) twice/d , 30 min/exposure , for a total of 80 exposures . 
The T3-subjects received placebo [ n = 8 ] and the T3 + subjects received T3 ( 30 micrograms/d ) [ n = 8 ] in a double-blind fashion . 
<START:ana> Mononuclear leukocytes <END> were isolated from peripheral blood before the cold exposure and drug regimen began , and then after every 20 exposures . 
The dissociation constant ( Kd ) and maximum binding capacity ( MBC ) of the <START:ggp> NT3R <END> values were log transformed to minimize between-subject variability . 
In the T3+ group , serum total thyroxine ( TT4 ) , free T4 ( FT4 ) , and TSH were approx 50 % lower than both basal and T3-values . 
The log10Kd increased 0.304 +/- 0.139 ( p < 0.04 ) and the log10MBC increased 0.49 +/- 0.10 ( p < 0.001 ) in the T3+ subjects compared to baseline . 
This change in MBC represents a 311 % increase in the MBC over baseline and a fivefold increase over placebo-treated subjects . 
The T3 -group showed no change in MBC over the study . 
These results describe for the first time the rapid modulation of the <START:ggp> NT3R <END> in response to the combined influence of cold exposure and reduced circulating T4 and TSH . 
<START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> activity in <START:ana> human CD40-activated B lymphocytes <END> is dependent on <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
<START:ana> CD40-stimulated human B lymphocytes <END> are highly permissive to a productive infection by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 . 
In these cells , <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> involved in activation of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> , which contains the <START:ggp> transcriptional control elements <END> of the virus , are unknown . 
Transient expression assays with plasmids containing deleted parts of the <START:ggp> LTR region <END> linked to a reporter gene showed that the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB binding site <END> was essential for <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> activity in <START:ana> CD40-stimulated B lymphocytes <END> . 
In addition , electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays revealed that important <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding activity composed of at least <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p65 <END> , and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB subunits <END> was present in nuclei of <START:ana> CD40-stimulated B cells <END> . 
These results confirm at a molecular level the ability of HIV-1 to replicate in <START:ana> B cells <END> and that this activity is strongly associated with <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Sequence analysis and expression in <START:ana> cultured lymphocytes <END> of the human <START:ggp> FOSB gene <END> ( <START:ggp> G0S3 <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> G0S3 <END> is a member of a set of <START:ggp> putative G0/G1 switch regulatory genes <END> ( <START:ggp> G0S genes <END> ) selected by screening <START:ggp> cDNA libraries <END> prepared from <START:ana> human blood mononuclear cells <END> cultured for 2 hr with <START:ggp> lectin <END> and cycloheximide . 
The sequence shows high homology with the <START:ggp> murine FOSB gene <END> , which encodes a component of the <START:ggp> AP1 transcriptional regulator <END> . 
Comparison of <START:ggp> cDNA <END> and genomic sequences reveals a <START:ggp> 4-exon structure <END> characteristic of the <START:ggp> FOS family of genes <END> . 
Freshly isolated cells show high levels of <START:ana> FOSB/G0S3 and FOS/G0S7 mRNAs <END> , which decline rapidly during incubation in culture medium . 
The kinetics of expression suggest that the high initial levels are caused by the isolation procedure , and do not reflect constitutive expression . 
In cells preincubated for a day , levels of <START:ana> FOS mRNA <END> reach a maximum 20 min after the addition of <START:ggp> lectin <END> and decline to control levels over the next 3 hr . 
Levels of <START:ana> FOSB mRNA <END> reach a maximum 40 min after the addition of <START:ggp> lectin <END> and decline to control levels over the next 6 hr . 
In freshly isolated cells , both <START:ana> FOS and FOSB mRNAs <END> increase dramatically in response to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide . 
In preincubated cells , the cycloheximide response is decreased , especially in the case of <START:ggp> FOSB <END> . 
These differences in expression of <START:ggp> FOS <END> and <START:ggp> FOSB <END> suggest different roles and regulation . 
Regions of low base order-dependent stem-loop potential in the region of the gene are defined . 
These indicate where base order has been adapted for purposes other than stem-loop stability ( e.g. , encoding proteins or gene regulation ) . 
Regions of low potential in a 68.5-kb genomic segment containing the <START:ggp> FOSB gene <END> suggest that the potential may help locate genes in <START:ggp> uncharted DNA sequences <END> . 
Susceptibility to <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> and down regulation of <START:ggp> MHC <END> class I expression in <START:ana> adenovirus 12 transformed cells <END> are regulated by different <START:ggp> E1A domains <END> . 
All human adenoviruses transform <START:ana> rodent cells <END> in vitro , but only cells transformed by serotypes belonging to subgroups A ( Ad12 ) and B ( Ad3 ) are tumorigenic for immunocompetent animals . 
In these cells , the expression of <START:ggp> MHC-class I antigens <END> is repressed and might allow them to escape from recognition by <START:ana> cytotoxic T lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> CTL <END> ) and to develop in tumor . 
Furthermore , these <START:ana> cell lines <END> appear resistant to lysis by <START:ana> natural killer ( NK ) cells <END> . 
To determine the <START:ggp> E1A domain <END> ( s ) responsible for these properties several <START:ana> cell lines <END> were created by transforming <START:ana> baby rat kidney ( BRK ) cells <END> with a set of <START:ggp> plasmids <END> expressing different <START:ggp> Ad2/Ad12 hybrid E1A gene products <END> . 
The <START:ggp> MHC class 1 gene <END> expression was inhibited in cells expressing the <START:ggp> Ad12 13S mRNA product <END> and in cells transformed with <START:ggp> Ad2/Ad12 hybrid E1A gene product <END> harboring the <START:ggp> C-terminal part <END> of the <START:ggp> conserved region ( CR ) 3 <END> of Ad12 . 
Susceptibility of these transformed <START:ana> cell lines <END> to <START:ana> NK cells <END> was determined by cytolytic assays . 
The results obtained suggest that two <START:ggp> Ad12 E1A domains <END> are required to induce resistance of the <START:ana> cell lines <END> to <START:ana> NK cells <END> . 
Cell specific expression of <START:ggp> human Bruton 's agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase gene <END> ( <START:ggp> Btk <END> ) is regulated by <START:ggp> Sp1- <END> and <START:ggp> Spi-1/PU.1-family members <END> . 
<START:ggp> Bruton 's agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> Btk <END> ) is a <START:ggp> cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase <END> involved in the human disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia ( XLA ) . 
The gene is expressed in all <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> with the exception of <START:ana> T-cells <END> and <START:ana> plasma cells <END> . 
For this expression pattern the first <START:ggp> 280 bp upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> major transcriptional start site <END> seems to be sufficient . 
In vitro footprinting analysis within this part of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> revealed two <START:ggp> Sp1 binding sites <END> as well as a <START:ggp> PU-box <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Spi-1/PU.1 <END> as well as the closely related factor <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> bound to the <START:ggp> PU-box <END> in B-cells . 
In the <START:ana> erythroleukemia cell line K562 <END> , due to the absence of <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> , only <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> bound to the <START:ggp> Btk promoter <END> . 
Mutation of either site reduced the expression in transient transfection experiments . 
However , mutation of the <START:ggp> PU box <END> had no effect in the <START:ana> T-cell line Jurkat <END> , where none of the <START:ggp> Spi-1 family members <END> is expressed . 
In addition <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> as well as <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> were able to transactivate <START:ggp> Btk <END> expression . 
In fetal liver of PU.1-/- mice , which lack <START:ana> lymphoid and myeloid cells <END> , expression of <START:ggp> Btk <END> was reduced two- to threefold but not abolished . 
Collectively this study shows that expression of the <START:ggp> Btk gene <END> is regulated by the combined action of <START:ggp> Sp1- and PU.1-family members <END> . 
T cell response to <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus transactivators <END> in chronic rheumatoid arthritis . 
Rheumatoid arthritis is a multistep disorder associated with autoimmune features of yet unknown etiology . 
Implication of viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis has been suspected on the basis of several indirect observations , but thus far , a direct link between EBV and rheumatoid arthritis has not been provided . 
Here we show that a large fraction of <START:ana> T cells <END> infiltrating affected joints from a patient with chronic rheumatoid arthritis recognizes two <START:ggp> EBV transactivators <END> ( <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> and <START:ggp> BMLF1 <END> ) in a <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex <END> -restricted fashion . 
Responses to these <START:ggp> EBV antigens <END> by synovial lymphocytes from several other chronic rheumatoid arthritis patients were readily detectable . 
Thus these results suggest a direct contribution of EBV to chronic rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis . 
They also demonstrate for the first time the occurrence of T cell responses against <START:ggp> EBV transactivating factors <END> , which might be central in the control of virus reactivation . 
<START:ggp> CD14 <END> -mediated signal pathway of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide in <START:ana> human gingival fibroblasts <END> . 
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces expression of <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> in <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> via <START:ggp> CD14 <END> , one of the <START:ggp> LPS receptors <END> , which is expressed predominantly in these cells . 
It has been demonstrated that Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS ( P-LPS ) also is able to induce <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> in <START:ana> human gingival fibroblasts <END> . 
Therefore , it is important to determine whether <START:ggp> CD14 <END> is expressed in <START:ana> gingival fibroblasts <END> and to define the P-LPS-mediated <START:ggp> signal-transducing <END> mechanism in the cells . 
In this study , we observed unexpectedly by immunohistochemical , Western blotting ( immunoblotting ) , and Northern ( RNA ) blotting assays that <START:ggp> CD14 <END> is expressed at high density in <START:ana> human gingival fibroblasts <END> . 
P-LPS-induced expression of the <START:ggp> monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) gene <END> in the cells was inhibited markedly by treatment with anti-human <START:ggp> CD14 <END> antibody and was completely inhibited by herbimycin A , a potent inhibitor of <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> . 
The inhibitor also dramatically inhibited monocyte chemotactic activity of and <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> production by the cells . 
Furthermore , P-LPS-induced expression of the <START:ggp> MCP-1 gene <END> in the cells also was blocked by inhibitors of two <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , i.e. , curcumin , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , and pyrolidine dithiocarbamate , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Both inhibitors inhibited monocyte chemotactic activity in the culture supernatant of P-LPS-treated cells . 
Gel shift mobility assay showed stimulation of the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> contents in P-LPS-treated cells . 
This study is the first to demonstrate the expression of <START:ggp> CD14 <END> in <START:ana> human gingival fibroblasts <END> and to show that the signal-transducing pathway of P-LPS in the cells is mediated by <START:ggp> CD14 <END> . 
<START:ggp> rel <END> Is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated following <START:ggp> granulocyte-colony stimulating factor <END> treatment of human neutrophils . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> neutrophils <END> with <START:ggp> granulocyte-colony stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> ) results in an enhanced respiratory burst , prolonged survival , and increased tumor cell killing . 
The effects of <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> are mediated by binding to specific , high <START:ggp> affinity receptors <END> . 
<START:ggp> G-CSF receptors <END> lack intrinsic <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activity , but activation of the receptor results in the rapid induction of tyrosine kinase activity . 
Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots of whole cell lysates prepared from <START:ana> neutrophils <END> show that the <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> rapidly induces prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of a relative molecular mass of 80 kDa . 
Using <START:ggp> monospecific antibodies <END> , the 80-kDa <START:ggp> tyrosine-phosphorylated protein <END> has been shown to be <START:ggp> p80c-rel <END> , a <START:ggp> proto-oncogene <END> belonging to a family of <START:ggp> transcriptional regulators <END> which include <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> . 
The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> p80c-rel <END> was unique to <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> in that <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor <END> which also stimulates <START:ana> neutrophils <END> and induces tyrosine phosphorylation does not result in tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> p80c-rel <END> . 
The consequences of <START:ggp> p80c-rel <END> tyrosine phosphorylation are not yet known ; however , tyrosine-phosphorylated <START:ggp> p80c-rel <END> is capable of binding to DNA , and <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> stimulation results in an increase in the amount of <START:ggp> p80c-rel <END> which binds to DNA . 
These results demonstrate that one of the first biochemical events which occurs in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> following <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> stimulation , activation of a <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> , leads directly to the tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> p80c-rel <END> . 
Thus , the <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activated by <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> appears to directly transduce a signal to a protein which functions as a <START:ggp> transcriptional regulator <END> . 
Patterns of <START:ggp> Pan <END> expression and role of <START:ggp> Pan proteins <END> in endocrine cell type-specific complex formation . 
The <START:ggp> Pan gene <END> encodes at least two distinct transcripts , <START:ggp> Pan-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Pan-2 <END> ( also known as <START:ggp> E47 <END> and <START:ggp> E12 <END> , respectively ) , by the mechanism of alternative RNA splicing . 
Northern blot analyses performed on rat and mouse tissues have detected ubiquitously expressed Pan transcripts , but the abundance , distribution , and form of <START:ggp> Pan proteins <END> have not been clearly defined . 
Studies of <START:ana> cell lines <END> representing <START:ana> endocrine , fibroblast , and lymphoid lineages <END> using polyclonal antisera to detect <START:ggp> E2A proteins <END> have suggested that significant <START:ggp> E2A protein <END> expression is restricted to <START:ana> B-lymphocytes <END> . 
We have developed a <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> , <START:ggp> Yae <END> , which is specific for <START:ggp> Pan/E2A proteins <END> , and have used the <START:ggp> Yae antibody <END> to examine a variety of <START:ana> endocrine and nonendocrine cell lineages <END> for differences in Pan/ <START:ggp> E2A protein <END> expression , subcellular localization , and heteromeric complex formation . 
In contrast to previous results obtained using polyclonal antiseras to detect Pan/ <START:ggp> E2A proteins <END> , we report comparable levels of <START:ggp> Pan proteins <END> in <START:ana> GH/PRL- and insulin-producing , B- and T-lymphocyte cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IEF-1 <END> , a pancreatic beta-cell type-specific complex believed to regulate insulin expression , is demonstrated to consist of at least two distinct species , one of which does not contain <START:ggp> Pan molecules <END> . 
Although it has been postulated that <START:ana> pituitary endocrine cells <END> and <START:ana> pancreatic endocrine beta-cells <END> share identical <START:ggp> Pan/E2A complexes <END> , native-Western analyses of pituitary and <START:ana> endocrine beta-cells <END> detect <START:ggp> Pan proteins <END> in distinct <START:ggp> cell type-specific complexes <END> . 
Visualization of the <START:ggp> endogenous NF-kappa B p50 subunit <END> in the nucleus of <START:ana> follicular dendritic cells <END> in germinal centers . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , a <START:ggp> 50 kDa/65 kDa ( p50/p65 ) heterodimer <END> , is a <START:ggp> ubiquitous transcription factor <END> involved in the positive regulation of various <START:ggp> immune genes <END> . 
The aim of this study was to determine whether <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is related to a particular cell type and/or differentiation step during immunopoiesis . 
Using in situ hybridization on sections from non HIV hyperplastic lymph nodes , we found that the gene of the <START:ggp> 105 kDa precursor <END> of <START:ggp> p50 <END> was overexpressed in the light zone of germinal centers , with a network aspect , which suggested the involvement of <START:ana> follicular dendritic cells <END> ( <START:ana> FDC <END> ) . 
By immunohistochemistry , <START:ggp> p50 <END> protein was detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of <START:ana> FDC <END> , confirming the involvement of <START:ana> FDC <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> p50 <END> protein was detected in the cytoplasm of all <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
Thus , we focused our study on isolated <START:ana> FDC <END> clusters from normal tonsils . 
As showed on tissue sections , we detected the <START:ggp> p50 <END> in both cytoplasm and nucleus of <START:ana> FDC <END> . 
Nuclei of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> from <START:ana> FDC <END> clusters were negative . 
We next studied p65 and c-Rel protein expression in <START:ana> FDC <END> clusters . 
<START:ggp> p65 <END> was detected in the cytoplasm of <START:ana> FDC <END> , whereas nuclei were negative . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> p65 <END> was detected in the nuclei of some <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> c-Rel protein <END> was detected only in the cytoplasm of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> and not in the nucleus and cytoplasm of <START:ana> FDC <END> . 
Our results indicated that , in the context of T cell-dependent B cell immunopoiesis occurring in <START:ana> FDC <END> clusters , <START:ggp> p50 <END> is mainly related to <START:ana> FDC <END> with a massive overexpression in the nuclei , whereas <START:ggp> p65 <END> is expressed in a scattered manner in the nuclei of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> and c-Rel protein exclusively in the cytoplasm of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> from <START:ana> FDC <END> clusters . 
These results suggested that the two subunits of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and the <START:ggp> c-Rel protein <END> have different roles in different cell types during B cell immunopoiesis . 
Cloning and characterization of <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> and <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> : the cytoplasmic components of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
Present evidence indicates a pathway of signal transmission in <START:ana> T cells <END> that is outlined in figure 1 . 
The elevation in intracellular calcium that is induced by interactions at the <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> leads to the activation of the <START:ggp> calcium-dependent phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
This in turn leads to the nuclear association of the <START:ggp> cytosolic component <END> of <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> . 
The activation of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> and the nuclear import of <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> can both be blocked by cyclosporin A or FK506 in complex with their respective <START:ggp> immunophilins <END> . 
Once in the nucleus , <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> interacts with <START:ggp> NF-ATn <END> to form an <START:ggp> active transcriptional complex <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-ATn <END> is a ubiquitous protein , can be synthesized in response to PMA , and has many similarities to <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
The mechanism by which <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> enters the nucleus is unknown , and although it appears to require <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> has not yet been shown to be an in vivo substrate of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
Alternative mechanisms include the possibility that <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> operates on some <START:ggp> cytoplasmic anchor <END> or that other proteins that are controlled by <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> carry out the nuclear import of <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> copurifies with <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> , there is as yet no understanding of how <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> is functioning in vivo . 
Now that these proteins are purified and cloned , the major goals will be to understand their role and the roles of other family members in thymic development . 
Induction of <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> by <START:ggp> low-density lipoprotein <END> . 
<START:ggp> Low-density lipoprotein <END> ( <START:ggp> LDL <END> ) is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerosis . 
When endothelial cells are incubated with this lipoprotein in pathophysiologic amounts , the cells are activated . 
Among the documented cellular responses to <START:ggp> LDL <END> is increased recruitment of <START:ana> monocytes <END> , which are believed to play a major role in promoting intimal plaque formation . 
The findings presented here link an <START:ggp> atheogenic lipoprotein <END> , <START:ggp> LDL <END> , with the induction of an adhesion molecule important in atherogenesis Human <START:ggp> LDL <END> induces the <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) transcriptionally with an increase in mRNA levels through activation of the <START:ggp> VCAM promoter <END> . 
This effect is blocked by <START:ggp> anti-VCAM antibodies <END> . 
After a 2-day incubation in <START:ggp> LDL <END> , the binding of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , which is believed to be a key oxidative-stress sensor for <START:ggp> VCAM <END> regulation , remains at basal level . 
In contrast , the binding activities of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> GATA <END> , on the other hand , are increased by <START:ggp> LDL <END> . 
Thus , a component of <START:ggp> LDL <END> -enhanced endothelial recruitment of <START:ana> monocytes <END> is attributed to <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression , which appears to be mediated through <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> GATA <END> . 
These data identify <START:ggp> LDL <END> as a <START:ggp> VCAM <END> -inducer possibly distinct from <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> endotoxin <END> . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis in <START:ana> human B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) is a transcription factor that binds to the <START:ggp> consensus DNA sequence <END> in the <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> of <START:ggp> various genes <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activates the expression of many genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses , little is known about the role of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in the induction of IgE synthesis in <START:ana> human B cells <END> . 
Therefore we first examined the participation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> germline C epsilon <END> transcription in a <START:ana> human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line <END> , <START:ana> DND39 <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> DND39 cells <END> with <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> or <START:ggp> anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody <END> ( <START:ggp> mAb <END> ) activated <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> and subsequently induced nuclear expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , which was identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays . 
n-Acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a potent antioxidant , blocked <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation caused by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and by <START:ggp> anti-CD40 mAb <END> . 
Although inhibition of <START:ana> IL-4-driven germline C epsilon <END> transcription by NAC was not sufficient , the agent remarkably diminished <START:ggp> anti-CD40 mAb <END> -mediated up-regulation of <START:ggp> germline <END> C epsilon transcription . 
Second , we studied the effect of NAC on <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis in human normal B cells costimulated with <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> anti-CD40 mAb <END> . 
NAC was effective in inhibiting mature C epsilon transcription and <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis in the T cell-independent culture system . 
However , NAC did not significantly affect the spontaneous production of <START:ggp> IgE <END> by <START:ana> atopic B cells <END> . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity is commonly inducible in <START:ana> DND39 cells <END> by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> anti-CD40 mAb <END> and suggest that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> sensitive to NAC may play a role in regulating <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Prostaglandin E2 induction of binding activity to <START:ggp> CRE <END> and <START:ggp> AP-2 elements <END> in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> . 
Prostaglandins of the E series are immunomodulatory agents which exert inhibitory as well as stimulatory effects on a variety of immune responses . 
Since it is known that PGE2 is able to increase cAMP levels , we investigated whether it can affect gene expression through the activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> which bind enhancer elements in the promoter regions of <START:ggp> cAMP-regulated genes <END> . 
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay , we demonstrated that a short treatment of <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> with PGE2 induces specific binding activity to <START:ggp> CRE <END> and <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> , but not <START:ggp> AP-1 , DNA elements <END> . 
Since the okadaic acid , a potent protein phosphatase inhibitor , prolongs the induction of the binding activity , phosphorylation events are likely to occur . 
This activity seems to be due to increased cAMP levels because forskolin and IBMX mimic the effects of PGE2 . 
More interestingly , transfection experiments with <START:ggp> CRE-CAT plasmide <END> show that PGE2 activates the transcription of a <START:ggp> CRE-containing promoter <END> . 
These data support the positive role for PGE2 on some immune functions . 
<START:ana> Nasal NK- and T-cell lymphomas <END> share the same type of Epstein-Barr virus latency as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin 's disease . 
<START:ana> Nasal T/NK-cell lymphomas <END> can be further separated into those of <START:ana> natural killer ( NK ) cell lineage <END> or of <START:ana> T-cell lineage <END> , with differences in cellular phenotype , <START:ggp> T-cell receptor ( TcR ) gene <END> rearrangement and TcR transcript expression . 
Both <START:ana> NK- and T-cell subtypes <END> are closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) . 
In this study , <START:ggp> EBV gene <END> expression was determined in 23 cases of nasal lymphoma ( NL ) by in situ hybridisation ( ISH ) , <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase <END> -polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and immunohistochemistry ( IH ) . 
Of the 23 cases , 19 were classified as NK-cell and 4 as T-cell tumours . 
ISH for <START:ana> EBV-encoded small non-polyadenylated RNAs <END> showed that all cases , whether NK or T , harboured EBV in virtually all <START:ana> tumour cells <END> . 
RT-PCR demonstrated that <START:ana> NL <END> of both subtypes expressed <START:ggp> EBNAI <END> of the QUK splice pattern , the <START:ggp> latent membrane proteins <END> , <START:ggp> LMP1 and 2 <END> and the <START:ana> BamHI A rightward transcripts <END> in the absence of <START:ana> EBNA2 mRNAs <END> , compatible with the latency type II pattern . 
In addition , analysis of EBV protein expression by IH revealed a heterogeneous pattern of <START:ggp> EBV gene <END> expression at the single-cell level consisting of both <START:ana> LMP1+ and LMP1- tumour cells <END> , suggesting a mixture of latency I and II . 
Although 2 <START:ggp> early lytic transcripts <END> , <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> and <START:ggp> BHRF1 <END> , were also detected in 13 and 10 cases , respectively , the lack of <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> staining in any case indicates that these lytic transcripts are most likely expressed by rare cells in the biopsies entering lytic cycle . 
The viral transcriptional pattern similar to that of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin 's disease suggests that EBV can exploit common regulatory mechanisms for gene transcription in diverse host cell types . 
Down-regulation of <START:ggp> immunogenic proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> EBNA2-EBNA6 <END> ) in nasal lymphoma may enable <START:ana> tumour cells <END> to evade host cytotoxic T-cell surveillance . 
Potent gene regulatory and antiproliferative activities of 20-methyl analogues of 1 , 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 . 
The biological active form of vitamin D3 , 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VD ) , regulates cellular growth and differentiation . 
This provides the hormone with an interesting therapeutic potential . 
However , hypercalcemia is a side effect , which is caused by VD 's classical action , the regulation of calcium homeostasis . 
This made the need for VD analogues with selectively increased cell regulatory properties . 
Studies with 20-epi analogues pointed out the importance of the carbon-20 position and led to the development of 20-methyl derivatives of VD . 
In this report the biological properties of the compounds ZK161422 and ZK157202 , which are 20-methyl- and 20-methyl-23-eneanalogues , respectively , have been analyzed in comparison with VD . 
Both compounds show about 2-fold lower affinity to the VD receptor ( VDR ) than VD . 
However , compared to VD , their antiproliferative effect is up to 30-fold higher on <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> and even up to 300-fold higher on <START:ana> human breast cancer MCF-7 cells <END> . 
Whereas the hypercalcemic effect for ZK157202 is also increased 10-fold , ZK161422 has the same calcium-mobilizing potency as VD . 
Moreover , ZK161422 , but not ZK157202 , showed preference for gene activation from a <START:ggp> promoter <END> carrying a <START:ggp> VD response element <END> with a palindromic arrangement of two <START:ggp> hexameric receptor binding sites <END> spaced by 9 nucleotides ( IP9 ) rather than for activation from a <START:ggp> response element <END> formed by a direct repeat spaced by 3 nucleotides ( DR3 ) . 
This observation supports a model , in which promoter selectivity reflects the selectively increased antiproliferative effect of VD analogues . 
Calcium-dependent <START:ggp> immediate-early gene <END> induction in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> is negatively regulated by <START:ggp> p21Ha-ras <END> . 
The induction of <START:ggp> immediate-early ( IE ) response genes <END> , such as <START:ggp> egr-1 <END> , <START:ggp> c-fos <END> , and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> , occurs rapidly after the activation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
The process of activation involves calcium mobilization , activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) , and phosphorylation of <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> . 
<START:ggp> p21 ( ras ) <END> , a <START:ggp> guanine nucleotide binding factor <END> , mediates T-cell signal transduction through <START:ggp> PKC <END> -dependent and <START:ggp> PKC <END> -independent pathways . 
The involvement of <START:ggp> p21 ( ras ) <END> in the regulation of calcium-dependent signals has been suggested through analysis of its role in the activation of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
We have investigated the inductions of the <START:ggp> IE genes <END> in response to calcium signals in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> ( in the presence of activated <START:ggp> p21 ( ras ) <END> ) and their correlated consequences . 
The expression of activated <START:ggp> p21 ( ras ) <END> negatively regulated the induction of <START:ggp> IE genes <END> by calcium ionophore . 
This inhibition of calcium-activated <START:ggp> IE gene <END> induction was reversed by treatment with cyclosporin A , suggesting the involvement of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> in this regulation . 
A later result of inhibition of this activation pathway by <START:ggp> p21 ( ras ) <END> was down-regulation of the activity of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and subsequent coordinate reductions in <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> expression and protein production . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> p2l ( ras ) <END> is an essential mediator in generating not only positive but also negative modulatory mechanisms controlling the competence of <START:ana> T cells <END> in response to inductive stimulations . 
<START:ggp> Calcineurin <END> acts in synergy with PMA to inactivate <START:ggp> I kappa B/MAD3 <END> , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
The <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter <END> consists of several independent <START:ggp> T cell receptor ( TcR ) responsive elements <END> . 
The induction of <START:ggp> promoters <END> dependent on these elements is inhibitable by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and tacrolimus ( FK-506 ) . 
<START:ggp> Calcineurin <END> , a <START:ggp> Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase <END> , is the FK-506 -and CsA-sensitive enzyme required for TcR mediated activation of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> . 
We report that a constitutively active form of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> partially substitutes for the Ca2+ co-stimulus required to activate the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter elements <END> <START:ggp> IL-2A <END> ( which binds the factors <START:ggp> OAP <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> IL-2E <END> ( which binds <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) , and completely substitutes for the Ca2+ co-stimulus required to stimulate an <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -dependent element . 
<START:ggp> Calcineurin <END> stimulates the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B element <END> by enhancing inactivation of <START:ggp> I kappa B/MAD3 <END> , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , thereby increasing the amount of nuclear <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA binding activity . 
These data provide the first demonstration in vivo that activation of a <START:ggp> protein phosphatase <END> can inactivate <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> , and suggest one possible explanation for mechanism-based toxicities associated with FK-506 and CsA by demonstrating that these drugs can inhibit the <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> -dependent activation of a virtually <START:ggp> ubiquitous transcription factor <END> . 
Detection of minimal residual disease in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia by RT-PCR : necessity of chemotherapy following ATRA therapy . 
The <START:ggp> PML/RAR alpha fusion gene <END> resulting from the <START:ggp> t ( 15 ; 17 ) translocation <END> is a specific marker for acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . 
We examined bone marrow cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) to detect residual <START:ana> PML/RAR alpha mRNA-containing cells <END> following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and cytotoxic chemotherapy in a patient with APL . 
This RT-PCR assay can detect one <START:ana> leukemic cell <END> in 10 ( 2 ) <START:ana> normal cells <END> in vitro . 
We show that <START:ana> PML/RAR alpha mRNA <END> was still detectable despite clinical remission following ATRA treatment , but undetectable following consolidation with chemotherapy . 
These data show that this technique is useful for the identification of minimal residual disease in patients with APL and that cytotoxic chemotherapy following ATRA therapy is required for the elimination of <START:ana> APL cells <END> . 
Glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of interleukin-2 receptor alpha and -beta subunit expression by human T cells . 
To determine the mechanism of glucocorticoid ( GC ) -mediated inhibition of T cell functions , the effect of dexamethasone ( DM ) on <START:ana> T cell <END> proliferation and <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> ) generation were studied . 
Dexamethasone inhibited <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced <START:ana> T cell <END> proliferation by 30 % -88 % , relative to its concentration within the cultures . 
The effect of DM on expression of <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> Tac <END> , <START:ggp> p55 <END> , <START:ggp> CD25 <END> ) and <START:ggp> beta ( p75 ) genes <END> in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> was examined next . 
In <START:ana> T cells <END> stimulated with purified <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> ( <START:ggp> PHA-p <END> ) and 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) addition of DM to the cultures resulted in a 60 % reduction in <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> and a 30 % reduction in <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> membrane expression compared to <START:ana> T cells <END> cultured in the absence of DM ( p < 0.01 ) . 
Inhibition of membrane <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> expression by 10 ( -6 ) M DM was partially reversible by <START:ggp> recombinant human IL-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> rhIL-2 <END> ) . 
By Northern blot analysis , DM caused a comparable decrease in <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> and in <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> mRNA levels to membrane receptor expression in <START:ana> mitogen-stimulated T cells <END> . 
By in vitro transcription assays , DM regulated <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> gene expression at a transcriptional level while transcription of <START:ggp> IL-2R beta gene <END> was unaffected by DM . 
The mechanism of action of DM on <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> transcription was examined by determining the mRNA levels of the p50 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> that stimulates <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> gene expression . 
The data indicate that 10 ( -6 ) M DM increased <START:ana> T cell <END> p50 <START:ana> NF-kappa B mRNA <END> levels by four-fold compared to the levels obtained in the absence of DM . 
Further , the level of <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> capable of binding to the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B sites <END> in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> increased in response to DM . 
In sum , DM regulates <START:ana> T cell <END> membrane expression of <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> by more than one molecular mechanism . 
Alteration of structural order of human erythrocyte ghost membrane by glucocorticoids and the influence of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486 . 
High-dose pulse glucocorticoid therapy has been used successfully in the clinic in severe pathological conditions for about 20 years . 
The mode of glucocorticoid action after administration of such megadoses is inexplicable up to now . 
It is supposed that some effects may be due to membrane alterations . 
In the present in-vitro experiments the effect of dexamethasone , of further glucocorticoids , and of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486 , on structural order of human erythrocyte ghost membranes was investigated by determining the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene ( DPH ) . 
Dexamethasone was found to induce a significant decrease in membrane structural order at concentrations of about 10 ( -6 ) M in a concentration-dependent manner . 
We found a correlation between the uptake of dexamethasone by the ghost membranes and the decrease in the structural order . 
The other glucocorticoids tested , methylprednisolone and corticosterone , were also effective at concentrations of 10 ( -5 ) M or greater . 
We observed no change in membrane structural order with RU 486 up to a concentration of 10 ( -4 ) M . 
However , simultaneous incubation of RU 486 with dexamethasone caused a distinct interference of RU 486 with dexamethasone . 
Thus , the glucocorticoid-induced membrane perturbation , the possibility to inhibit it by RU 486 , and the inactivity of the structurally related progesterone , refer to relatively specific <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for the glucocorticoids in the membrane of <START:ana> erythrocyte ghosts <END> . 
Mutation of tyrosines 492/493 in the <START:ggp> kinase domain <END> of <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> affects multiple <START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> signaling pathways . 
The <START:ggp> protein-tyrosine kinase <END> <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> is implicated , together with the <START:ggp> Src kinase <END> <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> , in controlling the early steps of the T-cell antigen receptor ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) signaling cascade . 
To help elucidate further the mechanism by which <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> regulates these initial events , we used a dominant-negative mutant approach . 
We overexpressed in the <START:ana> Jurkat T-cell line <END> <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> mutated on Tyr-492 and Tyr-493 in the putative regulatory loop of its <START:ggp> kinase domain <END> . 
This mutant inhibited <START:ggp> TCR <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> by interfering with both intracellular calcium increase and <START:ggp> Ras <END> -regulated activation of <START:ggp> extracellular signal-regulated kinases <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> TCR <END> -induced phosphorylation of <START:ggp> pp36-38 <END> , thought to play a role upstream of these pathways , was found to be reduced . 
In contrast , overexpression of <START:ggp> wild-type ZAP-70 <END> induced constitutive activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> mutant studied here could be phosphorylated on tyrosine when associated to the <START:ggp> TCR zeta chain <END> and was able to bind <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> . 
This result demonstrates that Tyr-492 and Tyr-493 are not responsible for the Src homology domain 2-mediated association of <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> with <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> . 
Our data are most consistent with a model in which recruitment to the <START:ggp> TCR <END> allows <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> autophosphorylation and binding to <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> , which in turn phosphorylates Tyr-492 and/or Tyr-493 with consequent up-regulation of the <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> kinase activity . 
<START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> will then be able to effectively control phosphorylation of its substrates and lead to gene activation . 
Effects of glucocorticoids on lymphocyte activation in patients with steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant asthma . 
BACKGROUND : Glucocorticoids are important medications used to control the airway inflammation associated with asthma . 
Synthetic glucocorticoids vary in their binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor ( GCR ) . 
METHODS : We compared hydrocortisone , beclomethasone dipropionate , triamcinolone acetonide , flunisolide , and budesonide with regard to their capacity to inhibit <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> -induced <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cell <END> proliferation from six patients with steroid-sensitive asthma and seven patients with steroid-resistant asthma . 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell <START:ggp> GCR <END> binding affinities for dexamethasone and budesonide were also determined for both patient groups by using a radioligand binding assay and Scatchard analysis . 
RESULTS : Dose-dependent inhibition was demonstrated for all glucocorticoids in both patient groups , with the steroid-resistant group requiring approximately 2 log-fold more glucocorticoids for an equivalent degree of inhibition . 
The mean concentrations necessary to cause 50 % inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation ( IC50s ) for the steroid-sensitive group ranged from 2 x 10 ( -10 ) mol/L for budesonide to 7 x 10 ( -8 ) mol/L for hydrocortisone , whereas the mean IC50s for the steroid-resistant group ranged from approximately 2 x 10 ( -8 ) mol/L for budesonide to greater than 10 ( -6 ) mol/L for hydrocortisone . 
In addition , a significant correlation was noted between the degree of inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation ( IC50 ) and the binding affinity of dexamethasone to the <START:ggp> GCR <END> . 
Patients with steroid-resistant asthma have been shown to have a reduced <START:ggp> GCR <END> binding affinity . 
The <START:ggp> GCR <END> binding affinity for budesonide was significantly higher in both groups ( i.e. , lower dissociation constant ) than that obtained for dexamethasone . 
CONCLUSION : These data suggest that glucocorticoids such as budesonide , by virtue of their high <START:ggp> GCR <END> binding affinities and greater ability to suppress lymphocyte proliferation , may therefore be beneficial in the management of difficult-to-control asthma . 
Characterization of the <START:ggp> murine cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene <END> <START:ggp> p27Kip1 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor <END> <START:ggp> p27Kip1 <END> plays an important role in regulating cell-cycle progression . 
<START:ggp> p27Kip1 <END> directly inhibits the catalytic activity of <START:ggp> cyclin/cdks ( cyclin-dependent kinase ) complexes <END> and/or interferes physically with <START:ggp> cyclin/cdks <END> activation by <START:ggp> CAK <END> . 
Interestingly , the expression level of <START:ana> p27Kip1 mRNA <END> was maximal in <START:ana> resting Go T-cells <END> and rapidly declined following <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> activation . 
We report here the cloning of <START:ggp> p27Kip1 gene <END> from <START:ggp> murine genomic DNA <END> and the functional analysis of the promoter of the <START:ggp> p27Kip1 <END> gene . 
The gene consists of at least three exons and spans more than <START:ggp> 5.6 kb of DNA <END> . 
Primer extension and nuclease S1 protection analysis revealed two major <START:ggp> transcription initiation sites <END> . 
The <START:ggp> promoter region <END> lacked a <START:ggp> TATA box <END> but contained potential binding sites for the <START:ggp> transcriptional factors <END> including two <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , <START:ggp> CRE <END> , <START:ggp> Myb <END> and <START:ggp> NFkB <END> located at <START:ggp> positions -153 , -178 , -286 , -875 , and -1011 <END> , respectively . 
To analyze the regulatory mechanisms controlling <START:ggp> p27Kip1 <END> gene expression , we characterized the <START:ggp> 5'-flanking region <END> from <START:ggp> nt -1609 to +178 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> -326 to -615 region <END> contained <START:ggp> positive regulatory elements <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear NF-ATp <END> is a hallmark of <START:ana> unstimulated B cells <END> from B-CLL patients . 
<START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> from the peripheral blood of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL ) were analysed for the nuclear presence and DNA binding of a panel of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> which are involved in the gene control of <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
The following <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> were studied : the <START:ggp> Octamer factors <END> <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , members of the <START:ggp> AP-1 factor family <END> , <START:ggp> NF-AT factors <END> , in particular <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> , and members of the <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kB family <END> . 
We show that the constitutive nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> , a member of the growing family of <START:ggp> NF-AT factors <END> , is a hallmark of <START:ana> nonstimulated B cells <END> from CLL patients that distinguishes <START:ana> B-CLL cells <END> from <START:ana> 'normal ' B lymphocytes <END> . 
Constitutive nuclear appearance was also observed for NF-kB2/p52 . 
Constitutive binding of further <START:ggp> factor proteins <END> to DNA , such as <START:ggp> JunD <END> , <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> and <START:ggp> FosB <END> , was detected in several patients whereas the localisation and DNA binding of other factors such as <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> , <START:ggp> RelA/p65 <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> was unaltered . 
It is remarkable that in <START:ana> B-CLL cells <END> the nuclear appearance and DNA binding of specific <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> is dramatically affected whereas other members of the same <START:ggp> factor family <END> remained unaltered in these leukemic cells . 
It remains to be shown which molecular events lead to the specific 'pre-activation ' , i.e . 
constitutive nuclear translocation and DNA binding , of these members of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 factor families <END> . 
<START:ana> Naive ( CD45RA+ ) T lymphocytes <END> are more sensitive to oxidative stress-induced signals than <START:ana> memory ( CD45RO+ ) cells <END> . 
Formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) after oxidative stress has been shown to be an activation signal for <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , e.g. , expression of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and its <START:ggp> receptor <END> are induced . 
These ROI-induced effects can , to a large extent , be attributed to the activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Now we have examined whether <START:ana> naive and memory T lymphocytes <END> differ in their sensitivity to ROI-mediated signals . 
When <START:ana> CD45RA+ ( naive ) <END> and <START:ana> CD45RO+ ( memory ) T lymphocytes <END> were directly stimulated with H2O2 , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> nuclear translocation was stronger in <START:ana> naive cells <END> than in <START:ana> memory cells <END> and it could be induced with lower doses . 
The composition of the induced <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kappaB <END> ( levels of <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> RelA proteins <END> ) was similar in these cell types . 
The magnitude and kinetics of intracellular ROI were similar , suggesting that there were no differences in ROI-forming mechanisms or antioxidative capacities . 
The probable regulatory point was the cytoplasmic <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> inhibitor : in CD45RA+ cells , H2O2 caused a more profound depression in the levels of <START:ggp> IkappaB alpha <END> . 
These findings indicate that <START:ana> T cells <END> representing different activation and/or differentiation stages can be differentially responsive to ROI-mediated signals . 
Rapid shuttling of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> in discrimination of Ca2+ signals and immunosuppression . 
Cells need to distinguish between transient Ca2+ signals that induce events such as muscle contraction , secretion , adhesion and synaptic transmission , and sustained Ca2+ signals that are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation . 
The latter class of events is blocked in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 , which inhibit <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , a <START:ggp> Ca2+-activated serine/threonine phosphatase <END> necessary for the nuclear import of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Here we report that sustained high concentrations of Ca2+ , but not transient pulses , are required to maintain <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in the nucleus , where they participate in Ca2+-dependent induction of <START:ggp> genes <END> required for <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> activation and proliferation . 
Furthermore , overexpression and constitutive nuclear localization of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , but not <START:ggp> Jun , Fos , NF-kappaB , Oct or Ets family members <END> , renders the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 enhancer <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T lymphocytes <END> resistant to FK506 and cyclosporin A . 
Thus a primary effect of these immunosuppressive reagents is to control the subcellular localization of the <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> family of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Autoregulation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B transactivator <END> <START:ggp> RelA <END> ( <START:ggp> p65 <END> ) by multiple <START:ggp> cytoplasmic inhibitors <END> containing <START:ggp> ankyrin motifs <END> . 
<START:ggp> RelA <END> ( <START:ggp> p65 <END> ) functions as the critical transactivating component of the <START:ggp> heterodimeric p50-p65 NF-kappa B complex <END> and contains a <START:ggp> high-affinity binding site <END> for its <START:ggp> cytoplasmic inhibitor <END> , <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
After cellular activation , <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> is rapidly degraded in concert with the induced nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
The present study demonstrates that <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> -induced degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> is preceded by its rapid phosphorylation in vivo . 
However , these effects on <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> result in nuclear mobilization of only a fraction of the entire cytoplasmic pool of <START:ggp> RelA <END> . 
Subsequent studies have revealed that ( i ) <START:ggp> cytoplasmic RelA <END> is stably associated not only with <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> but also with other <START:ggp> ankyrin motif-rich proteins <END> including the products of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B2 ( p100 ) and NF-kappa B1 ( p105 ) genes <END> ; ( ii ) in contrast to <START:ggp> RelA <END> <START:ggp> -I kappa B alpha <END> , <START:ggp> RelA-p100 cytoplasmic complexes <END> are not dissociated following <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> activation ; ( iii ) <START:ggp> p100 <END> functions as a potent inhibitor of <START:ggp> RelA <END> -mediated transcription in vivo ; ( iv ) the interaction of <START:ggp> RelA <END> and <START:ggp> p100 <END> involves the <START:ggp> conserved Rel homology domain <END> of both proteins but not the <START:ggp> nuclear localization signal <END> of <START:ggp> RelA <END> , which is required for <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> binding ; ( v ) <START:ggp> p100 <END> inhibition of <START:ggp> RelA <END> function requires the <START:ggp> C-terminal ankyrin motif domain <END> , which mediates cytoplasmic retention of <START:ggp> RelA <END> ; and ( vi ) as observed with <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> , nuclear <START:ggp> RelA <END> stimulates <START:ana> p100 mRNA <END> and protein expression . 
These findings thus reveal the presence of a second inducible autoregulated inhibitory pathway that helps ensure the rapid but transient action of <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kappa B <END> . 
Effects of <START:ggp> CD45 <END> on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Implications for replication of HIV-1 . 
Increased levels of replication of the HIV type 1 are observed after the activation of <START:ana> infected T cells <END> through the <START:ggp> TCR <END> . 
However , anti- <START:ggp> CD45 <END> antibodies inhibit these effects in cells from infected individuals . 
In this study , we examined interrelationships between <START:ggp> CD45 <END> and HIV-1 further . 
We measured effects on the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> in <START:ana> T cell lines <END> that were stimulated with antibodies against <START:ggp> CD45 <END> and in those that lacked the expression of <START:ggp> CD45 <END> on their surfaces . 
First , <START:ggp> anti-CD45 antibodies <END> did not affect basal but decreased activated levels of expression from the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> . 
Second , <START:ana> T cells <END> , which lack <START:ggp> CD45 <END> and can not signal via the <START:ggp> TCR <END> , supported higher levels of viral replication and gene expression . 
This was due to the presence of active <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complexes <END> in the nucleus of <START:ggp> CD45 <END> -T cells . 
Additionally , <START:ana> infected T cells <END> displayed lower levels of <START:ggp> CD45 <END> on their surfaces . 
Thus , <START:ggp> CD45 <END> plays an active role in the physiology of <START:ana> T cells <END> and in the replication of HIV-1 . 
<START:ggp> Calcineurin <END> potentiates activation of the <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> : involvement of the <START:ggp> conserved lymphokine element 0 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) and <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) are produced by stimulation with phorbol-12-myristate acetate ( PMA ) and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) in <START:ana> human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells <END> . 
The expression of <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> is inhibited by immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 . 
Earlier studies on the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> gene expression showed that overexpression of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> ( <START:ggp> CN <END> ) , a <START:ggp> Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase <END> , can stimulate transcription from the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> through the <START:ggp> NF-AT-binding site <END> . 
In this study , we obtained evidence that transfection of the <START:ggp> cDNAs <END> for <START:ggp> CN A ( catalytic ) and CN B ( regulatory ) subunits <END> also augments transcription from the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> and recovers the transcription inhibited by CsA . 
The constitutively active type of the <START:ggp> CN A subunit <END> , which lacks the <START:ggp> auto-inhibitory <END> and <START:ggp> calmodulin-binding domains <END> , acts in synergy with PMA to activate transcription from the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> . 
We also found that the active <START:ggp> CN <END> partially replaces calcium ionophore in synergy with PMA to induce expression of endogenous <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
By multimerizing the <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> , we found that one of the <START:ggp> target sites <END> for the <START:ggp> CN <END> action is the <START:ggp> conserved lymphokine element 0 <END> ( <START:ggp> CLE0 <END> ) , located at positions between -54 and -40 . 
Mobility shift assays showed that the <START:ggp> CLE0 <END> sequence has an <START:ggp> AP1-binding site <END> and is associated with an <START:ggp> NF-AT-like factor <END> , termed <START:ggp> NF-CLE0 gamma <END> . 
NF- <START:ggp> CLE0 <END> gamma binding is induced by PMA/A23187 and is inhibited by treatment with CsA . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> CN <END> is involved in the coordinated induction of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF and IL-2 genes <END> and that the <START:ggp> CLE0 sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> is a functional analogue of the <START:ggp> NF-AT-binding site <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> , which mediates signals downstream of T cell activation . 
Alternate immune system targets for TCDD : <START:ana> lymphocyte stem cells <END> and <START:ana> extrathymic T-cell <END> development . 
We here summarize evidence that thymic atrophy induced by 2 , 3 , 7 , 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) can be mediated , at least in part , by damage to <START:ana> extrathymic T-cell precursors <END> in bone marrow and fetal liver . 
This atrophy induction does not involve apoptotic mechanisms in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> affected by the <START:ggp> bcl-2 proto-oncogene <END> . 
TCDD mediates atrophy induction through its specific receptor ( the <START:ggp> AhR <END> ) and not through effects on the estrogen receptor . 
Both TCDD and estradiol induce extrathymic T-cell differentiation in the liver . 
These <START:ana> extrathymic T-cell populations <END> include cells expressing elevated levels of <START:ggp> V beta T-cell receptors <END> that are normally deleted in thymic development . 
Identification of <START:ggp> Bcd <END> , a novel <START:ggp> proto-oncogene <END> expressed in <START:ana> B-cells <END> . 
A <START:ana> novel B-cell <END> derived ( <START:ggp> Bcd <END> ) <START:ggp> oncogene <END> has been isolated from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of one B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) patient using DNA transfer and a mouse tumorigenicity assay . 
The <START:ggp> Bcd <END> <START:ggp> proto-oncogene <END> was activated by a truncation in the <START:ggp> 5 ' UTR <END> . 
It predicts for two <START:ggp> open reading frames <END> ( <START:ggp> ORFs <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> ORF1 <END> consists of 240 bp that would encode 80 amino acids , while the <START:ggp> major ORF2 <END> consists of 648 bp capable of coding for 216 amino acids . 
<START:ggp> Predicted peptide sequence <END> of <START:ggp> ORF2 <END> contained a <START:ggp> zinc finger domain <END> which showed significant homology to <START:ggp> GC box binding proteins <END> <START:ggp> BTEB2 <END> and <START:ggp> SP1 <END> . 
Transfection of an <START:ggp> expression vector <END> containing <START:ggp> ORF2 <END> but not <START:ggp> full length cDNA <END> was able to transform <START:ana> NIH3T3 cells <END> and induce tumors in nude mice . 
<START:ana> Bcd mRNA transcripts <END> of < or = 2.6 kb were selectively expressed in <START:ana> PBL <END> and testis of healthy individuals . 
Within the <START:ana> PBL <END> , <START:ggp> Bcd <END> gene expression was restricted to <START:ana> CD19+ B-cells <END> and absent from <START:ana> CD14+ monocytes <END> and <START:ana> T-cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Bcd <END> transcripts were detected in all normal <START:ana> PBL <END> samples tested but not in several <START:ana> malignant human B-cell lines <END> and not in 50 % of <START:ana> B-cells <END> from B-CLL patients . 
However , stimulation of <START:ana> B-cells <END> from B-CLL patients under conditions which induced differentiation into <START:ana> plasma cells <END> was associated with induction of <START:ggp> Bcd <END> gene expression . 
The <START:ggp> Bcd gene <END> may therefore play an important role in B-cell growth and development . 
A <START:ggp> novel SP-1 site <END> in the <START:ggp> human interleukin-1 beta promoter <END> confers preferential transcriptional activity in <START:ana> keratinocytes <END> . 
To investigate the mechanisms of transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> interleukin-1beta <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> ) in non-monocytic cells , we constructed a series of reporter plasmids with the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene linked to various parts of the <START:ggp> human IL-1beta promoter <END> and performed transient transfection experiments . 
We identified a promoter segment that activates transcription most efficiently in <START:ana> keratinocytes <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) with a <START:ggp> 43-mer oligonucleotide <END> derived from the functionally identified <START:ggp> cis-acting element <END> revealed specific complexes . 
By competition analysis with <START:ggp> transcription factor consensus sequence oligonucleotides <END> and by immunosupershift , <START:ggp> transcription factor SP-1 <END> or a closely related protein was shown to bind to this <START:ggp> regulatory element <END> . 
The closest match to the known <START:ggp> SP-1 consensus sequence <END> within the respective region is a <START:ggp> TCCCCTCCCCT motif <END> . 
Mutation of this motif almost completely , and specifically , abolished the binding of two <START:ggp> low-mobility complexes <END> and led to a 95 % decrease of constitutive transcriptional activation of a reporter construct <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> ( -170/+108 ) . 
Likewise , activation of this reporter construct by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> depended on the <START:ggp> SP-1 site <END> . 
These observations suggest that a so-far-unrecognized <START:ggp> SP-1 site <END> in the <START:ggp> human IL-1beta promoter <END> may participate in the transcriptional regulation of this gene in <START:ana> keratinocytes <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> correlates with the transformed phenotype and the type of viral latency in <START:ana> EBV genome positive lymphoid cell lines <END> . 
In this paper we have investigated the role of <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> in B cell growth regulation by examining the gene expression in a panel of <START:ana> B cell lines <END> , including both <START:ggp> EBV genome <END> negative and <START:ana> EBV carrying cell lines <END> . 
<START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> expression correlates with the cellular phenotype and the specific pattern of viral latency established within the <START:ana> individual cell lines <END> . 
Thus , constitutive activation of <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> gene is invariably associated with unrestricted expression of viral latent genes in all <START:ana> group III EBV genome carrying cell lines <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> expression is abrogated in <START:ana> group I Burkitt tumor cells <END> , irrespective of the <START:ggp> EBV genome <END> carrying status . 
Activated viral gene expression associated with phenotypic conversion of <START:ana> group I cell lines <END> in to <START:ana> group II <END> or <START:ana> III <END> restores the <START:ggp> Egr-1 gene <END> expression . 
Several forms of <START:ggp> EGR-1 protein <END> are found within the different groups of cell lines , and the binding activity to <START:ggp> DNA consensus sequences <END> was investigated . 
Finally , time course analysis of <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> expression during the early steps of EBV infection in vitro demonstrated that <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> is upregulated within minutes from the initial interaction with the <START:ana> B lymphocyte <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> erythroid-specific genes <END> in megakaryoblastic disorders . 
Currently available data indicate that erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation pathways are closely related to each other , and there may exist <START:ana> progenitor cells <END> common to those two lineages may exist . 
Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia ( AML-M7 ) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down 's syndrome ( TMD ) are characterized by rapid growth of <START:ana> abnormal blast cells <END> which express <START:ggp> megakaryocytic markers <END> . 
These <START:ana> blast cells <END> express <START:ggp> lineage-specific transcription factors <END> such as <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> common to these lineages and frequently express <START:ana> erythroid-specific mRNAs <END> such as <START:ggp> gamma-globin <END> and <START:ggp> erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase <END> ( <START:ggp> ALAS-E <END> ) , indicating that most of the blasts in M7 and TMD cases have erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes . 
These results suggest that <START:ana> blasts <END> in M7 and TMD may correspond to <START:ana> progenitors <END> of both <START:ana> erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages <END> . 
<START:ggp> Stat3 <END> recruitment by two distinct <START:ggp> ligand-induced , tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites <END> in the <START:ggp> interleukin-10 receptor intracellular domain <END> . 
Recent work has shown that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> induces activation of the <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> -STAT <END> signaling pathway . 
To define the mechanism underlying <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) protein <END> recruitment to the <START:ggp> interleukin 10 ( IL-10 ) receptor <END> , the <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> activated by <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays . 
In all cells tested , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> activated <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> and induced the formation of three distinct <START:ggp> DNA binding complexes <END> that contained different combinations of these two <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> also activated <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> in <START:ana> Ba/F3 cells <END> that stably expressed the murine <START:ggp> IL-10 receptor <END> . 
Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach , two tyrosine residues ( Tyr427 and Tyr477 ) in the <START:ggp> intracellular domain <END> of the murine <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> but not for <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> or <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> . 
Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in <START:ggp> phosphorylated form <END> coprecipitated <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> but not <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> and blocked <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> -induced <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> phosphorylation in a cell-free system . 
In contrast , tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> or block <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> activation . 
These data demonstrate that <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> but not <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> or <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> is directly recruited to the <START:ggp> ligand-activated IL-10 receptor <END> by binding to specific but redundant <START:ggp> receptor intracellular domain sequences <END> containing phosphotyrosine . 
This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> by different <START:ggp> cytokine receptors <END> is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable , <START:ggp> tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites <END> in <START:ggp> receptor intracellular domains <END> . 
Silencing of human fetal <START:ggp> globin <END> expression is impaired in the absence of the <START:ggp> adult beta-globin gene activator protein <END> <START:ggp> EKLF <END> . 
<START:ggp> Globin genes <END> are subject to tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific regulation . 
A switch from <START:ggp> human fetal ( gamma ) <END> -to <START:ggp> adult ( beta ) -globin <END> expression occurs within <START:ana> erythroid precursor cells <END> of the <START:ana> adult lineage <END> . 
Previously we and others showed by targeted gene disruption that the <START:ggp> zinc finger gene <END> , <START:ggp> erythroid Kruppel-like factor <END> ( <START:ggp> EKLF <END> ) , is required for expression of the <START:ggp> beta-globin gene <END> in mice , presumably through interaction with a <START:ggp> high-affinity binding site <END> in the <START:ggp> proximal promoter <END> . 
To examine the role of <START:ggp> EKLF <END> in the developmental regulation of the <START:ggp> human gamma-globin gene <END> we interbred <START:ggp> EKLF heterozygotes <END> ( +/- ) with mice harboring a <START:ggp> human beta-globin yeast artificial chromosome transgene <END> . 
We find that in the absence of <START:ggp> EKLF <END> , while <START:ggp> human beta-globin <END> expression is dramatically reduced , <START:ana> gamma-globin transcripts <END> are elevated approximately 5-fold . 
Impaired silencing of <START:ggp> gamma-globin <END> expression identifies <START:ggp> EKLF <END> as the first <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> participating quantitatively in the <START:ggp> gamma-globin <END> to <START:ggp> beta-globin <END> switch . 
Our findings are compatible with a competitive model of switching in which <START:ggp> EKLF <END> mediates an adult stage-specific interaction between the <START:ggp> beta-globin gene promoter <END> and the <START:ggp> locus control region <END> that excludes the <START:ggp> gamma-globin gene <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> by zinc and related cations . 
Zinc is an important trace element for immune function . 
Here , we show that zinc addition in a serum- and lipopolysaccharide-free cell culture system leads to significantly enhanced levels of <START:ggp> interleukin 1 beta <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> ) and <START:ggp> tumour necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) and to expression of the corresponding <START:ana> mRNA <END> in <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) . 
Structurally related divalent cations like cobalt , nickel , and mercury also partially increase monokine secretion but to a much lower and thus insignificant extent . 
They fail to induce <START:ana> mRNA <END> of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> after 3 h of culture . 
Therefore , monokine induction is a zinc-specific effect influenced by the physicochemical properties of the ion . 
Confirmation of the unique significance of zinc for immune function provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of specific zinc-mediated immune modulation . 
<START:ggp> E3 <END> , a <START:ggp> hematopoietic-specific transcript <END> directly regulated by the <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor alpha <END> . 
Retinoic acid ( RA ) -induced maturation mediated by the <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> ) has been implicated in myeloid development . 
We have used differential hybridization analysis of a <START:ggp> cDNA library <END> constructed from the murine <START:ana> RA-inducible MPRO promyelocyte cell line <END> to identify <START:ggp> immediate-early genes <END> induced by RA during granulocytic differentiation . 
<START:ggp> E3 <END> , one of nine sequences identified , was upregulated in an immediate-early manner , with transcript levels peaking after 60 minutes exposure to RA . 
<START:ggp> E3 transcripts <END> were RA-inducible in <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> , but not in an <START:ana> RA-resistant subclone <END> , <START:ana> HL60R <END> , that harbors a mutated <START:ggp> RAR alpha gene <END> . 
However , when <START:ana> HL60R cells <END> were transduced with a functional copy of the <START:ggp> RAR alpha gene <END> , RA induced a 10-fold increase in <START:ggp> E3 <END> mRNA levels . 
<START:ggp> E3 transcripts <END> are present in the <START:ana> myeloid , B-lymphoid , and erythroid lineages <END> , absent in <START:ana> nonhematopoietic cells <END> , and encode a highly hydrophobic , potentially phosphorylated polypeptide of unknown function with significant homology to a putative protein expressed in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> . 
The murine <START:ggp> E3 promoter <END> harbors a single <START:ggp> bipartite retinoic acid response element <END> which in transient transfection assays conferred RA sensitivity . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> E3 <END> is a <START:ggp> hematopoietic-specific gene <END> that is an immediate target for the activated <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> during myelopoiesis . 
Multifactor cis-dominant negative regulation of <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> expression in <START:ana> anergized T cells <END> . 
The molecular mechanism underlying <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcriptional blockade in <START:ana> anergic T cell clones <END> is not fully understood . 
To examine whether an active negative regulatory process occurs , we created a <START:ggp> reporter construct <END> containing as an <START:ggp> enhancer <END> four copies of the <START:ggp> NF-AT site <END> and one copy of the <START:ggp> octamer site <END> ( <START:ggp> 4X NF-AT-Oct <END> ) . 
This construct was only slightly reduced ( 1.3-fold ) in its expression when stimulated under anergic conditions , while a whole mouse <START:ggp> IL-2 enhancer construct <END> showed a reduction of 4.3-fold . 
Addition of the <START:ggp> -176 to -96 sequence <END> to the <START:ggp> 4X NF-AT-Oct construct <END> did not impart the ability to be affected by anergy , but addition of the <START:ggp> -236 to -96 sequence <END> did , demonstrating that anergy is an active inhibitory process and that more than the presence of the <START:ggp> -150 AP-1 binding site <END> ( <START:ggp> -152 to -147 <END> ) is required to mediate the effect . 
Mutational studies of the <START:ggp> -236 to -96 sequence <END> indicated that the presence of both the <START:ggp> -130 AP-1-like site <END> ( <START:ggp> -187 to -181 <END> ) and the <START:ggp> -150 proximal AP-1 site <END> were necessary to observe anergy . 
Because the <START:ggp> -180 site <END> is not required for trans-activation , it was possible to confirm by mutation in the normal <START:ggp> mouse IL-2 enhancer <END> that this site is absolutely essential for anergy induction . 
The simplest model to explain these results is that anergy is mediated by a complex of multiple <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that exert a cis-acting dominant negative regulatory effect on the trans-activation of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> . 
Severe combined immunodeficiency due to defective binding of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> of two male siblings . 
<START:ana> Peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBL <END> ) and <START:ana> alloreactive T cell lines <END> of two male infants born to consanguinous parents and presenting with severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) showed a pronounced deficiency in T cell activation . 
Although phenotypically normal , the proliferative response of the childrens ' <START:ana> T cells <END> was strongly reduced but could be improved by the addition of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) . 
Furthermore both childrens ' <START:ana> T cells <END> were unable to produce the <START:ggp> cytokines <END> <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) . 
This multiple <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production deficiency could not be restored by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> or co-stimulatory signals provided by <START:ana> antigen-presenting cells <END> ( <START:ana> APC <END> ) . 
Moreover , <START:ana> mRNA <END> for <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> could not be detected . 
In contrast , expression of the <START:ggp> activation-dependent cell surface markers <END> <START:ggp> CD25 <END> and <START:ggp> CD69 <END> was within normal limits . 
To determine whether the functional defect of the patients ' <START:ana> T cells <END> was due to the absence or abnormal binding of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> involved in <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> expression , electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to examine the DNA binding of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> Oct <END> , <START:ggp> CREB <END> , <START:ggp> SP1 <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) to their respective <START:ggp> response elements <END> in the <START:ggp> promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> . 
Whereas <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , NF-kappa B , <START:ggp> Oct <END> , <START:ggp> CREB <END> and <START:ggp> SP1 <END> displayed normal binding activities in nuclear extracts , the binding of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> to its <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> promoter response element was barely detectable both before and after T cell stimulation . 
Our results strongly suggest that this <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> /DNA binding defect is responsible for the multiple <START:ggp> cytokine <END> deficiency and the SCID phenotype observed in the two infant brothers . 
<START:ggp> oriP <END> is essential for <START:ggp> EBNA gene <END> promoter activity in <START:ana> Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> . 
During Epstein-Barr virus latent infection of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> in vitro , six <START:ggp> viral nuclear antigens <END> ( <START:ggp> EBNAs <END> ) are expressed from one of two <START:ggp> promoters <END> , <START:ggp> Cp <END> or <START:ggp> Wp <END> , whose activities are mutually exclusive . 
Upon infection , <START:ggp> Wp <END> is initially active , followed by a switch to <START:ggp> Cp <END> for the duration of latency . 
In this study , the region upstream of <START:ggp> Cp <END> was analyzed for the presence of cis elements involved in regulating the activities of the <START:ggp> EBNA gene promoters <END> in established <START:ana> in vitro immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> LCLs <END> ) . 
It was determined that <START:ggp> oriP <END> , the origin for episomal maintenance during latency , is essential for efficient transcription initiation from either <START:ggp> Cp <END> or <START:ggp> Wp <END> in <START:ana> LCLs <END> , as well as in some <START:ana> Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines <END> . 
Deletion of the <START:ggp> EBNA2-dependent enhancer <END> located upstream of <START:ggp> Cp <END> resulted in a ca. two- to fivefold reduction in <START:ggp> Cp <END> activity in the <START:ana> LCLs <END> assayed . 
More extensive deletion of sequences upstream of <START:ggp> Cp <END> , including the <START:ggp> EBNA2-dependent enhancer <END> , resulted in nearly complete loss of <START:ggp> Cp <END> activity . 
This loss of activity was shown to correlate with deletion of two <START:ggp> CCAAT boxes <END> , a <START:ggp> proximal CCAAT box <END> located at <START:ggp> bp -61 to -65 <END> and a distal <START:ggp> CCAAT box <END> located at bp <START:ggp> -253 to -257 <END> , upstream of <START:ggp> Cp <END> . 
Site-directed mutagenesis of these <START:ggp> cis elements <END> demonstrated that <START:ggp> Cp <END> activity is highly dependent on the presence of a properly positioned <START:ggp> CCAAT box <END> , with the dependence on the <START:ggp> distal CCAAT box <END> apparent only when the <START:ggp> proximal CCAAT box <END> was deleted or mutated . 
Deletion of the glucocorticoid response elements located at <START:ggp> ca. bp -850 <END> upstream of <START:ggp> Cp <END> did not result in a significant loss in activity . 
In general , deletions which diminished <START:ggp> Cp <END> activity resulted in induction of <START:ggp> Wp <END> activity , consistent with suppression of <START:ggp> Wp <END> activity by transcriptional interference from <START:ggp> Cp <END> . 
The identification of <START:ggp> oriP <END> and the <START:ggp> EBNA2-dependent enhancer <END> as the major positive <START:ggp> cis elements <END> involved in regulating <START:ggp> Cp <END> activity in <START:ana> LCL <END> suggests that <START:ggp> EBNA gene <END> transcription is largely autoregulated by <START:ggp> EBNA 1 <END> and <START:ggp> EBNA 2 <END> . 
Protein-tyrosine kinase activation is required for lipopolysaccharide induction of <START:ggp> interleukin 1beta <END> and <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activation , but not <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> nuclear translocation . 
In <START:ana> human monocytes <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin 1beta <END> protein production and steady state mRNA levels are increased in response to lipopolysaccharide , predominantly as a result of increased transcription of the <START:ggp> interleukin 1beta <END> gene . 
Expression of <START:ggp> interleukin 1beta <END> and other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , such as <START:ggp> interleukin 6 <END> and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> , has been shown to be dependent on the activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> . 
Since recent studies have shown that lipopolysaccharide-induced <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activation is not required for <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> nuclear translocation , we sought to determine whether <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> translocated in the absence of <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activity was active in stimulating transcription . 
We have found that , in the human <START:ana> pro-monocytic cell line <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 <END> , the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of <START:ggp> interleukin 1beta <END> is dependent on <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activation . 
Tyrosine kinases are not required for lipopolysaccharide-mediated nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> . 
However , in the absence of <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activity , the ability of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> to stimulate transcription is impaired . 
This inhibition of transcription is specific for <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> ; in the absence of <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activity , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -dependent transcription is enhanced . 
These results suggest that , while lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of <START:ggp> inflammatory mediators <END> requires <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activity , <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> activity is not obligatory for lipopolysaccharide signal transduction . 
Chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection of <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> disrupts the autoregulatory control of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel <END> pathway via enhanced <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> degradation . 
Productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection causes sustained <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA-binding activity in chronically infected monocytic cells . 
A direct temporal correlation exists between HIV infection and the appearance of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA-binding activity in <START:ana> myelomonoblastic PLB-985 cells <END> . 
To examine the molecular basis of constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA-binding activity in <START:ana> HIV1 -infected cells <END> , we analyzed the phosphorylation and turnover of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> protein , the activity of the <START:ggp> double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PKR <END> ) and the intracellular levels of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB subunits <END> in the <START:ana> PLB-985 <END> and <START:ana> U937 myeloid cell models <END> . 
HIV-1 infection resulted in constitutive , low-level expression of <START:ggp> type 1 interferon <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN <END> ) at the mRNA level . 
Constitutive <START:ggp> PKR <END> activity was also detected in <START:ana> HIV-1-infected cells <END> as a result of low-level <START:ggp> IFN <END> production , since the addition of <START:ggp> anti-IFN-alpha/beta antibody <END> to the cells decreased <START:ggp> PKR <END> expression . 
Furthermore , the analysis of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> turnover demonstrated an increased degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> in <START:ana> HIV-1-infected cells <END> that may account for the <START:ggp> constitutive DNA <END> binding activity . 
A dramatic increase in the intracellular levels of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> subunits <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB2 p100 <END> and a moderate increase in <START:ggp> NF-kappaB2 p52 <END> and <START:ggp> RelA ( p65 ) <END> were detected in <START:ana> HIV-1-infected cells <END> , whereas <START:ggp> NF-kappaB1 p105/p50 <END> levels were not altered relative to the levels in <START:ana> uninfected cells <END> . 
We suggest that HIV-1 infection of <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> induces <START:ggp> IFN <END> production and <START:ggp> PKR <END> activity , which in turn contribute to enhanced <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> phosphorylation and subsequent degradation . 
Nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB subunits <END> may ultimately increase the intracellular pool of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/IkappaBalpha <END> by an autoregulatory mechanism . 
Enhanced turnover of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> and the accumulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel proteins <END> may contribute to the chronically activated state of <START:ana> HIV-1-infected cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> c-Jun delta-domain <END> inhibits <START:ggp> neuroendocrine promoter <END> activity in a DNA sequence- and pituitary-specific manner . 
The transcription and transformation activity of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> is governed by a <START:ggp> 27-amino acid regulatory motif <END> , labeled the <START:ggp> delta-domain <END> , which is deleted in <START:ggp> v-Jun <END> . 
We have previously shown that <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> is a potent inhibitor of the <START:ggp> rat prolactin ( rPRL ) promoter <END> activity induced by either <START:ggp> oncogenic Ras <END> or phorbol esters . 
Here , we have characterized the structural and cell-specific requirements for this <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> inhibitory response , and we show that this <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> inhibitory response mapped to the <START:ggp> rPRL footprint II repressor site <END> , was pituitary-specific and required the <START:ggp> c-Jun delta-domain <END> . 
Moreover , alteration of any one of these features ( e.g. , <START:ggp> cis-element <END> , <START:ggp> trans-factor <END> , or cell-specific background ) switched <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> to a <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> of the <START:ggp> rPRL promoter <END> . 
In <START:ana> HeLa nonpituitary cells <END> , <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> alone activated the <START:ggp> rPRL promoter <END> via the most proximal <START:ggp> GHF-1/Pit-1 binding site <END> , <START:ggp> footprint I <END> , and synergized with <START:ggp> GHF-1 <END> . 
Finally , recombinant <START:ggp> GHF-1 <END> interacted directly with <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> but not <START:ggp> c-Fos proteins <END> . 
These data provide important fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the <START:ggp> c-Jun delta-domain <END> functions as a modulatory switch and further imply that the functional role of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> is dictated by cell-specific influences and the <START:ggp> delta-domain motif <END> . 
Retinoic acid activates <START:ggp> interferon regulatory factor-1 <END> gene expression in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> . 
All-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is the drug of choice in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . 
ATRA induces both in vitro and in vivo differentiation of <START:ana> APL cells <END> into <START:ana> mature granulocytes <END> . 
However , the molecular mechanisms involved in ATRA-dependent growth inhibition and cellular differentiation are not presently understood . 
The <START:ana> NB4 cell line <END> , which is derived from the bone marrow of a patient with APL during relapse , can be used as a model system to study the growth and differentiation of <START:ana> APL cells <END> . 
Because <START:ggp> interferon ( IFN ) regulatory factors <END> ( <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> IRF-2 <END> ) and other <START:ggp> IFN-inducible gene products <END> regulate cell growth , we analyzed the effects of ATRA on the expression of these genes . 
We show that ATRA directly activates <START:ggp> IRF-1 gene <END> expression , followed by activation of <START:ggp> IRF-2 <END> and <START:ggp> 2'-5 ' oligoadenylate synthetase <END> ( OAS ) gene expression with slower kinetics . 
In addition to NB4 cells , ATRA also activated <START:ggp> IRF-1 gene <END> expression in <START:ana> HL-60 <END> , <START:ana> U937 <END> , and <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> , which all respond to ATRA by growth inhibition . 
A more than additive increase in <START:ggp> IRF-1 gene <END> expression was seen with ATRA and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> in <START:ana> NB4 cells <END> . 
ATRA did not activate nuclear factor kappa B or signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) activation pathways , suggesting that an alternate mechanism is involved in <START:ggp> IRF-1 gene <END> activation . 
The ATRA-induced expression of <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> , an activator of transcription and repressor of transformation , may be one of the molecular mechanisms of ATRA-induced growth inhibition , and the basis for the synergistic actions of ATRA and <START:ggp> IFNs <END> in <START:ana> myeloid leukemia cells <END> . 
Recombinant <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> ( NFATp ) is regulated by calcineurin in <START:ana> T cells <END> and mediates transcription of several <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factors <END> of the <START:ggp> NFAT family <END> play a key role in the transcription of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> and other genes during the immune response . 
We have identified two new isoforms of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> ( previously termed <START:ggp> NFATp <END> ) that are the predominant isoforms expressed in <START:ana> murine and human T cells <END> . 
When expressed in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> , recombinant <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> is regulated , as expected , by the <START:ggp> calmodulin-dependent phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , and its function is inhibited by the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A ( CsA ) . 
Transactivation by recombinant <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> requires dual stimulation with ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; this activity is potentiated by coexpression of constitutively active <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> and is inhibited by CsA . 
Immunocytochemical analysis indicates that recombinant <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> localizes in the cytoplasm of <START:ana> transiently transfected T cells <END> and translocates into the nucleus in a CsA-sensitive manner following ionomycin stimulation . 
When expressed in <START:ana> COS cells <END> , however , <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> is capable of transactivation , but it is not regulated correctly : its subcellular localization and transcriptional function are not affected by stimulation of the <START:ana> COS cells <END> with ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate . 
Recombinant <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> can mediate transcription of the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> , interleukin-4 , <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> , and <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor promoters <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> , suggesting that <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> contributes to the CsA-sensitive transcription of these <START:ggp> genes <END> during the immune response . 
<START:ggp> Human TAFII 105 <END> is a <START:ggp> cell type-specific TFIID subunit <END> related to <START:ggp> hTAFII130 <END> . 
We previously characterized <START:ggp> Drosophila and human TAF subunits <END> that make up the core <START:ggp> TFIID complex <END> found in all cells . 
Here , we report that <START:ana> differentiated B cells <END> contain a novel substoichiometric <START:ggp> TAF <END> of 105 kDa not found associated with <START:ggp> TFIID <END> isolated from other cell types . 
The <START:ggp> cDNA <END> encoding <START:ggp> hTAFII105 <END> reveals a highly conserved <START:ggp> C-terminal domain <END> shared by <START:ggp> hTAFII130 <END> and <START:ggp> oTAFII110 <END> , while the <START:ggp> N-terminal coactivator domain <END> has diverged significantly . 
All cells tested express <START:ana> TAFII105 mRNA <END> , but only <START:ana> B cells <END> contain significant levels of protein associated with <START:ggp> TFIID <END> . 
Transient overexpression of <START:ggp> hTAFII105 <END> selectively squelches the transcription of some genes in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
These properties suggest that <START:ggp> TAFII105 <END> is a cell type-specific subunit of <START:ggp> TFIID <END> that may be responsible for mediating transcription by a subset of activators in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Interstitial deletion constitutes the major mechanism for loss of heterozygosity on <START:ggp> chromosome 20q <END> in polycythemia vera . 
An acquired deletion of the long arm of <START:ggp> chromosome 20 <END> is a recurrent abnormality in myeloproliferative disorders , particularly polycythemia vera and myelodysplastic syndromes . 
The association of <START:ggp> 20q deletions <END> with myeloid `` stem cell '' disorders suggests that the deletions mark the site of one or more genes , loss or inactivation of which plays a role in the regulation of <START:ana> normal hematopoietic progenitors <END> . 
We have recently performed a detailed molecular analysis of <START:ggp> 20q deletions <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood ( PB ) granulocytes <END> and defined a <START:ggp> commonly deleted region <END> of 16 to 21 centimorgan ( cM ) . 
To further reduce the size of the common deleted region we have searched for small deletions or mitotic recombination events , neither of which would be detected by conventional cytogenetics . 
We have studied 48 patients with polycythemia vera and four patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis . 
In each case , cytogenetic analysis had either failed or had shown no abnormalities of <START:ggp> chromosome 20 <END> . 
Seventeen <START:ggp> microsatellite markers <END> that span the common deleted region were used to search for loss of heterozygosity in <START:ggp> granulocyte DNA <END> . 
No instance of microsatellite instability was observed in a total of 880 comparisons of <START:ggp> granulocyte and T-cell DNA <END> . 
Granulocyte DNA from four patients exhibited allele loss on <START:ggp> 20q <END> . 
In each case the allele loss was caused by an interstitial deletion because heterozygosity at <START:ggp> distal markers <END> was retained and because quantitative Southern blotting demonstrated hemizygosity . 
Loss of heterozygosity in <START:ana> PB granulocytes <END> would be masked by the presence of significant numbers of <START:ana> normal granulocytes <END> not derived from the <START:ana> malignant clone <END> . 
Therefore , the <START:ggp> human androgen receptor <END> assay ( HUMARA ) was used to determine granulocyte clonality . 
In 21 of 27 informative female patients the majority of the <START:ana> granulocytes <END> were clonally derived . 
In 5 patients the <START:ana> granulocytes <END> appeared polyclonal and in 1 patient unilateral X inactivation was observed in both <START:ana> granulocytes <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
These results show that , in the vast majority of patients presented here , the failure to detect loss of heterozygosity can not be attributed to the presence of <START:ana> normal polyclonal granulocytes <END> . 
Our results therefore show that allele loss on <START:ggp> chromosome 20q <END> in polycythemia vera does not commonly involve mitotic recombination or <START:ggp> chromosome <END> loss and that microsatellite instability is a rare event in this disorder . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-6 <END> promotes multiple myeloma cell growth via phosphorylation of <START:ggp> retinoblastoma protein <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-6 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ) mediates autocrine and paracrine growth of <START:ana> multiple myeloma ( MM ) cells <END> and inhibits tumor cell apoptosis . 
Abnormalities of <START:ggp> retinoblastoma protein <END> ( <START:ggp> pRB <END> ) and mutations of RB gene have been reported in up to 70 % of MM patients and 80 % of <START:ana> MM-derived cell lines <END> . 
Because <START:ggp> dephosphorylated ( activated ) pRB <END> blocks transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle whereas <START:ggp> phosphorylated ( inactivated ) pRB <END> releases this growth arrest , we characterized the role of <START:ggp> pRB <END> in <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> -mediated MM cell growth . 
Both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated <START:ggp> pRB <END> were expressed in all serum-starved MM patient cells and <START:ana> MM-derived cell lines <END> , but <START:ggp> pRB <END> was predominantly in its phosphorylated form . 
In <START:ana> MM cells <END> that proliferated in response to <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , exogenous <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> downregulated <START:ggp> dephosphorylated pRB <END> and decreased dephosphorylated <START:ggp> pRB-E2F complexes <END> . 
Importantly , culture of <START:ana> MM cells <END> with RB antisense , but not RB sense , oligonucleotide ( ODN ) triggered <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> secretion and proliferation in <START:ana> MM cells <END> ; however , proliferation was only partially inhibited by neutralizing <START:ggp> anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody <END> ( <START:ggp> MoAb <END> ) . 
In contrast to <START:ana> MM cells <END> , normal <START:ana> splenic B cells <END> express <START:ggp> dephosphorylated pRB <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> CD40 ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> CD40L <END> ) triggers a shift from dephosphorylated to phosphorylated <START:ggp> pRB <END> and proliferation of <START:ana> B cells <END> , the addition of exogenous <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> to <START:ggp> CD40L <END> -treated <START:ana> B cells <END> does not alter either <START:ggp> pRB <END> or proliferation , as observed in <START:ana> MM cells <END> . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> phosphorylated pRB <END> is constitutively expressed in <START:ana> MM cells <END> and that <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> further shifts <START:ggp> pRB <END> from its dephosphorylated to its phosphorylated form , thereby promoting MM cell growth via two mechanisms ; by decreasing the amount of E2F bound by <START:ggp> dephosphorylated pRB <END> due to reduced <START:ggp> dephosphorylated pRB <END> , thereby releasing growth arrest ; and by upregulating <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> secretion by <START:ana> MM cells <END> and related <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> -mediated autocrine tumor cell growth . 
<START:ggp> Soluble factors <END> secreted by <START:ana> activated T-lymphocytes <END> modulate the transcription of the <START:ggp> immunosuppressive cytokine <END> <START:ggp> TGF-beta 2 <END> in <START:ana> glial cells <END> . 
Coordination of the immune response to injury or disease in the brain is postulated to involve bi-directional discourse between the immune system and the central nervous system . 
This cross communication involves soluble mediators , including various <START:ggp> growth factors <END> , <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , and neuropeptides . 
In this report , we demonstrate that the supernatant from <START:ana> activated T-lymphocytes <END> is able to induce the transcription of a potent <START:ggp> cytokine <END> , <START:ggp> TGF-beta 2 <END> in <START:ana> glial cells <END> . 
The activating stimulus invokes signaling mechanisms distinct from known kinase or protease pathways . 
Activation of <START:ggp> TGF-beta 2 <END> transcription correlates with the loss of binding activity for an <START:ggp> 80 kDA glial labile repressor protein <END> , <START:ggp> GLRP <END> , to a responsive region within the <START:ggp> TFG-beta 2 promoter <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> GLRP <END> shares some characteristics with the inducible <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , it appears to be distinct from known <START:ggp> AP-1 family members <END> . 
These data along with previous observations demonstrating the potent immunosuppressive activity of <START:ggp> TGF-beta 2 <END> , support a model for a feedback mechanism between the activated <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> astrocytes <END> via <START:ggp> TGF-beta 2 <END> to regulate the immune response . 
Various modes of <START:ggp> basic helix-loop-helix protein <END> -mediated regulation of murine leukemia virus transcription in <START:ana> lymphoid cell lines <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcriptionally regulatory regions <END> of the lymphomagenic Akv and SL3-3 murine leukemia retroviruses ( MLVs ) contain two types of <START:ggp> E-box consensus motifs <END> , CAGATG . 
One type , <START:ggp> EA/S <END> , is located in the <START:ggp> upstream promoter region <END> , and the other , <START:ggp> E ( gre ) <END> , is located in a <START:ggp> tandem repeat <END> with enhancer properties . 
We have examined the requirements of the individual <START:ggp> E-boxes <END> in MLV transcriptional regulation . 
In <START:ana> lymphoid cell lines <END> only , the <START:ggp> E ( gre ) -binding protein complexes <END> included <START:ggp> ALF1 <END> or <START:ggp> HEB <END> and <START:ggp> E2A basic helix-loop-helix proteins <END> . 
Ectopic <START:ggp> ALF1 <END> and <START:ggp> E2A proteins <END> required intact <START:ggp> E ( gre ) motifs <END> for mediating transcriptional activation . 
<START:ggp> ALF1 <END> transactivated transcription of Akv MLV through the two <START:ggp> E ( gre ) motifs <END> equally , whereas <START:ggp> E2A protein <END> required the promoter-proximal <START:ggp> E ( gre ) <END> motif . 
In <START:ana> T- and B-cell lines <END> , the <START:ggp> E ( gre ) motifs <END> were of major importance for Akv MLV transcriptional activity , while the <START:ggp> EA/S motif <END> had some effect . 
In contrast , neither <START:ggp> E ( gre ) <END> nor <START:ggp> EA/S motifs <END> contributed pronouncedly to Akv MLV transcription in <START:ana> NIH 3T3 cells <END> lacking DNA-binding <START:ggp> ALF1 <END> or <START:ggp> HEB <END> and <START:ggp> E2A proteins <END> . 
The Id1 protein was found to repress <START:ggp> ALF1 <END> activity in vitro and in vivo . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> ectopic Id1 <END> repressed <START:ggp> E ( gre ) <END> -directed but not <START:ggp> EA/S <END> -directed MLV transcription in <START:ana> lymphoid cell lines <END> . 
In conclusion , <START:ggp> E ( gre ) <END> motifs and interacting <START:ggp> basic helix-loop-helix proteins <END> are important determinants for MLV transcriptional activity in <START:ana> lymphocytic cell lines <END> . 
Reversal of apoptosis by the leukaemia-associated <START:ggp> E2A-HLF chimaeric transcription factor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> E2A-HLF ( for hepatic leukaemia factor ) fusion gene <END> , formed by action of the <START:ggp> t ( 17 ; 19 ) ( q22 ; p13 ) <END> chromosomal translocation , drives the leukaemic transformation of early <START:ana> B-cell precursors <END> , but the mechanism of this activity remains unknown . 
Here we report that <START:ana> human leukaemia cells <END> carrying the translocation <START:ggp> t ( 17 ; 19 ) <END> rapidly died by apoptosis when programmed to express a dominant-negative suppressor of the fusion protein <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> , indicating that the <START:ggp> chimaeric oncoprotein <END> probably affects cell survival rather than cell growth . 
Moreover , when introduced into <START:ana> murine pro-B lymphocytes <END> , the <START:ggp> oncogenic E2A-HLF fusion protein <END> reversed both interleukin-3-dependent and p53-mediated apoptosis . 
The close homology of the <START:ggp> basic region/leucine zipper <END> ( <START:ggp> bZIP <END> ) DNA-binding and <START:ggp> dimerization domain <END> of <START:ggp> HLF <END> to that of the <START:ggp> CES-2 cell-death specification protein <END> of Caenorhabditis elegans suggests a model of leukaemogenesis in which <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> blocks an early step within an evolutionarily conserved cell-death pathway . 
The role of <START:ggp> early growth response gene 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> egr-1 <END> ) in regulation of the immune response . 
The induction of <START:ggp> immediate early genes <END> in cells of the immune system is critical to determining the ultimate outcome of exposure to antigen . 
The importance of many of these genes relates to the role their <START:ggp> transcription factor products <END> play in dictating patterns of expression of downstream , <START:ggp> function-related genes <END> . 
Evidence from several systems indicates that the <START:ggp> immediate early gene <END> , <START:ggp> egr-1 <END> may be of particular importance in the immune system . 
Recently , the <START:ggp> egr-1 promoter <END> has been shown to be highly responsive to the diverse biochemical signals generated by antigen and <START:ggp> cytokines <END> in cells of the immune system . 
Furthermore , an important role for <START:ggp> egr-1 <END> in determining the differentiation pathway of <START:ana> myeloid cell precursors <END> has been recently elaborated . 
Finally , potential targets of regulation by the <START:ggp> zinc-finger transcription factor <END> encoded by <START:ggp> egr-1 <END> include the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 , CD44 , ICAM-1 , and tumor necrosis factor genes <END> . 
The role of <START:ggp> egr-1 <END> in regulation of the immune response will be discussed in the context of these recent studies . 
Peptide vaccination can lead to enhanced tumor growth through specific T-cell tolerance induction . 
Vaccination with synthetic peptides representing cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) epitopes can lead to a protective CTL-mediated immunity against tumors or viruses . 
We now report that vaccination with a CTL epitope derived from the <START:ggp> human adenovirus type 5 E1A-region <END> ( <START:ggp> Ad5E1A234-243 <END> ) , which can serve as a target for <START:ana> tumor-eradicating CTL <END> , enhances rather than inhibits the growth of Ad5E1A-expressing tumors . 
This adverse effect of peptide vaccination was rapidly evoked , required low doses of peptide ( 10 micrograms ) , and was achieved by a mode of peptide delivery that induces protective T-cell-mediated immunity in other models . 
<START:ggp> Ad5E1A <END> -specific CTL activity could no longer be isolated from mice after injection of Ad5E1A-peptide , indicating that tolerization of <START:ggp> Ad5E1A <END> -specific CTL activity causes the enhanced tumor outgrowth . 
In contrast to peptide vaccination , immunization with adenovirus , expressing <START:ggp> Ad5E1A <END> , induced <START:ggp> Ad5E1A <END> -specific immunity and prevented the outgrowth of <START:ggp> Ad5E1A <END> -expressing tumors . 
These results show that immunization with synthetic peptides can lead to the elimination of anti-tumor CTL responses . 
These findings are important for the design of safe peptide-based vaccines against tumors , allogeneic organ transplants , and T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases . 
[ <START:ggp> NGFI-B/nur77 family <END> involved in T-cell apoptosis ] 
<START:ggp> NGFI-B/nur77 <END> is a member of the <START:ggp> steroid receptor superfamily <END> . 
<START:ggp> NGFI-B/nur77 <END> and its related genes constitute a family and the <START:ggp> NGFI-B/nur77 family <END> consists of three subtypes , named <START:ggp> nur77 alpha <END> , <START:ggp> nur77 beta <END> , <START:ggp> nur77 gamma <END> . 
We cloned human <START:ggp> nur77 beta cDNA <END> , called <START:ggp> TINUR <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> NGFI-B/nur77 <END> is essential for TCR-mediated apoptosis in <START:ggp> T-cell hybridomas <END> , the reports on nur77 knock-out mice and nur77 dominant negative transgenic mice suggest that there is a functional redundancy among <START:ggp> NGFI-B/nur77 family <END> . 
<START:ggp> NGFI-B/nur77 <END> binds to the <START:ggp> response element <END> by monomer or heterodimer with <START:ggp> retinoid X receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> RXR <END> ) . 
Assuming that 9-cis-retinoic acid ( 9-cis-RA ) inhibits TCR-mediated apoptosis , <START:ggp> nur77 <END> may cause apoptosis by monomer in the absence of 9-cis-RA and may inhibit apoptosis by heterodimer with <START:ggp> RXR <END> in the presence of 9-cis-RA . 
Glucocorticoids and <START:ggp> interferon-alpha <END> in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome . 
Some patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) develop glucocorticoid resistance characterized by low receptor affinity ( Kd ) for glucocorticoids in <START:ana> mononuclear <END> , cells and high values of ACTH and cortisol . 
As glucocorticoids regulate <START:ggp> interferon-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN alpha <END> ) production , we hypothesized that <START:ggp> IFN alpha <END> , a <START:ggp> cytokine <END> produced predominantly by <START:ana> monocytes <END> in AIDS , should be increased in cortisol-resistant AIDS , attributing the lack of cortisol inhibition to <START:ggp> IFN alpha <END> production . 
Therefore , we examined <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> characteristics on <START:ana> monocytes <END> by [ 3H ] dexamethasone binding and measured <START:ggp> IFN alpha <END> , cortisol , and ACTH in AIDS patients with ( AIDS-GR ) or without glucocorticoid resistance ( AIDS-C ) and controls ( C ) . 
Monocytes of AIDS-GR patients had a receptor Kd of 10.5 +/- 4.2 nmol/L that was higher than that in the AIDS-C group ( 2.9 +/- 0.8 nmol/L ) and normal subjects ( 2.0 +/- 0.8 nmol/L ; P < 0.01 ) . 
<START:ggp> IFN alpha <END> levels were increased in the AIDS-GR group ( 17 +/- 6 vs . 
4 +/- 1 U/mL in the AIDS-C group and 2 +/- 0.5 U/mL in the C group ; P < 0.01 ) . 
Correlations were found between <START:ggp> plasma IFN alpha <END> and receptor Kd on <START:ana> monocytes <END> of AIDS-GR ( r = 0.77 ) and between <START:ggp> IFN alpha <END> and plasma cortisol in the same group ( r = 0.74 ) . 
The <START:ggp> poly ( I ) -poly ( C ) -induced IFN alpha <END> production by <START:ana> monocytes <END> was inhibited by glucocorticoids in the C and AIDS-C groups ( approximately 80 % inhibition in both groups ) ; the effect was reversed by the receptor antagonist RU-38486 . 
By contrast , glucocorticoids failed to inhibit <START:ggp> IFNalpha <END> production from <START:ana> AIDS-GR monocytes <END> ( approximately 20 % inhibition ) . 
In conclusion , elevated <START:ggp> IFN alpha <END> levels in AIDS-GR may be due to the lack of inhibitory effect of cortisol on <START:ggp> IFN alpha <END> production due to cortisol resistance in <START:ana> monocytes <END> 
<START:ggp> JNK <END> ( <START:ggp> c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase <END> ) is a target for antioxidants in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> AP-1 <END> has been shown to behave as a <START:ggp> redox-sensitive transcription factor <END> that can be activated by both oxidant and antioxidant stimuli . 
However , the mechanisms involved in the activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> by antioxidants are largely unknown . 
In this study we show that the structurally unrelated antioxidant agents pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , butylated hydroxyanisole , and Nacetylcysteine activated <START:ggp> JNK <END> ( <START:ggp> c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase <END> ) in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
This activation differed substantially from that mediated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and Ca2+ ionophore or produced by costimulation with <START:ggp> antibodies <END> against the <START:ggp> T cell receptor-CD3 complex <END> and to <START:ggp> CD28 <END> . 
The activation of <START:ggp> JNK <END> by classical T cell stimuli was transient , whereas that mediated by PDTC and butylated hydroxyanisole ( but not N-acetylcysteine ) was sustained . 
The kinetics of <START:ggp> JNK <END> activation correlated with the expression of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> which was transient after stimulation with PMA plus ionophore and prolonged in response to PDTC , which also transiently induced <START:ggp> c-fos <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> JNK <END> activation by PMA plus ionophore was sensitive to inhibitors of signaling pathways involving Ca2+ , <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> , and tyrosine phosphorylation , which failed to inhibit the activation mediated by PDTC . 
Transfection of <START:ggp> trans-dominant negative expression vectors <END> of <START:ggp> ras <END> and <START:ggp> raf <END> , together with <START:ggp> AP-1-dependent reporter constructs <END> , as well as Western blot analysis using <START:ggp> anti-ERK ( extracellular signal-regulated kinase ) antibodies <END> , indicated that the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway did not appear to mediate the effect of the antioxidant . 
However , the combined treatment with PDTC and PMA , two agents that synergize on <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activation , resulted in the persistent phosphorylation of <START:ggp> ERK-2 <END> . 
In conclusion , our results identify <START:ggp> JNK <END> as a target of antioxidant agents which can be regulated differentially under oxidant and antioxidant conditions . 
[ Molecular mechanisms of age-related lymphocyte dysfunction ] 
Aging is classically accompanied by a dysregulation of the immunologic machinery . 
As a consequence , the immune response developed in senescent organisms is usually inappropriate , often inefficient , sometimes aberrant , and potentially detrimental . 
The age-associated immune dysfunction may be implicated to some degree in the extreme susceptibility of the elderly to infection and neoplasia and may even participate in various aspects of senescence . 
The current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying immunosenescence is still fragmentary . 
The most extensively studied phenomenon is the progressive decline in the proliferative capacities of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> with aging . 
The loss of proliferative potential in response to antigenic challenge is a characteristic feature of immune senescence . 
It is directly implicated in the emergence of the age-related immune deficiency . 
The purpose of this review is to show how the accumulation of various biochemical lesions with advancing age leads to the failure of a critical cell function , namely the activation-induced lymphocyte proliferation . 
The biochemical modifications responsible for the defect in transduction and execution of the proliferative signal are analyzed as a function of age . 
The multiple alterations observed on the various biochemical pathways may appear as a consequence of a unique deleterious mechanism more fundamentally related to the process of senescence such as the inability to cope with oxidative stress . 
Induction of <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression by phosphorylated CREB proteins during B-cell activation and rescue from apoptosis . 
Engagement of surface immunoglobulin on mature B cells leads to rescue from apoptosis and to proliferation . 
Levels of <START:ana> bcl-2 mRNA <END> and protein increase with cross-linking of <START:ggp> surface immunoglobulin <END> . 
We have located the major positive regulatory region for control of <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression in <START:ana> B cells <END> in the <START:ggp> 5'-flanking region <END> . 
The positive region can be divided into an <START:ggp> upstream and a downstream regulatory region <END> . 
The downstream regulatory region contains a <START:ggp> cyclic AMP-responsive element <END> ( <START:ggp> CRE <END> ) . 
We show by antibody supershift experiments and UV cross-linking followed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that both CREB and ATF family members bind to this region in vitro . 
Mutations of the <START:ggp> CRE site <END> that result in loss of <START:ggp> CREB <END> binding also lead to loss of functional activity of the bcl-2 promoter in transient-transfection assays . 
The presence of an active <START:ggp> CRE site <END> in the <START:ggp> bcl-2 promoter <END> implies that the regulation of <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression is linked to a signal transduction pathway in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Treatment of the <START:ana> mature B-cell line BAL-17 <END> with either anti-immunoglobulin M or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate leads to an increase in <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression that is mediated by the <START:ggp> CRE site <END> . 
Treatment of the more <START:ana> immature B-cell line <END> , <START:ana> Ramos <END> , with phorbol esters rescues the cells from calcium-dependent apoptosis . 
<START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression is increased following phorbol ester treatment , and the increased expression is dependent on the <START:ggp> CRE site <END> . 
These stimuli result in phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CREB <END> at serine 133 . 
The phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CREB <END> that results in activation is mediated by <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> rather than by <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> . 
Although the <START:ggp> CRE site <END> is necessary , optimal induction of <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression requires participation of the <START:ggp> upstream regulatory element <END> , suggesting that phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CREB <END> alters its interaction with the <START:ggp> upstream regulatory element <END> . 
The <START:ggp> CRE site <END> in the <START:ggp> bcl-2 promoter <END> appears to play a major role in the induction of <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression during the activation of <START:ana> mature B cells <END> and during the rescue of <START:ana> immature B cells <END> from apoptosis . 
It is possible that the <START:ggp> CRE site <END> is responsible for induction of <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression in other cell types , particularly those in which <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> is involved . 
Characterization of the <START:ggp> human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen gene promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> MNDA <END> ( <START:ggp> myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen <END> ) is an <START:ggp> interferon alpha regulated nuclear protein <END> expressed only in cells of the <START:ana> human myelomonocytic lineage <END> . 
To identify mechanisms responsible for this lineage-specific and interferon-regulated expression , the <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking sequence <END> of the gene has been characterized . 
Two <START:ggp> interferon-stimulated response elements <END> ( <START:ggp> ISRE <END> ) flank a multiple transcription start site region identifying <START:ggp> MNDA <END> as a <START:ggp> TATA-less interferon-regulated gene <END> . 
Other <START:ggp> DNA elements <END> present include a cluster of <START:ggp> Myb sites <END> , several <START:ggp> Ets <END> , an <START:ggp> Ets related PU.1 site <END> and an <START:ggp> Sp1 site <END> located within 600 bp of the <START:ggp> transcription start sites <END> . 
In addition , DNA methylation was revealed as one of the possible factors in establishing <START:ggp> MNDA <END> expression . 
The <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking sequence <END> has promoter activity which is elevated by <START:ggp> interferon alpha <END> . 
The findings indicate that <START:ggp> MNDA <END> expression is regulated by mechanisms similar to other <START:ggp> myelomonocytic cell specific genes <END> and genes up-regulated by <START:ggp> interferon alpha <END> . 
Abnormality of <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> DNA binding in <START:ana> T cells <END> from Sjogren 's syndrome patients . 
Primary Sjogren 's syndrome ( SS ) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease characterized by T cell hypoactivity . 
To understand the diminished T cell response to activation signals , we measured nucleoprotein DNA-binding activities regulating gene expression during T cell activation using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay . 
<START:ana> Peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> from 9/19 SS patients were found to be defective in their ability to bind an <START:ggp> october sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> ) . 
This <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> -binding phenotype remained stable in culture for up to 3 days prior to activation . 
This abnormality was not seen in <START:ana> resting T cells <END> nor <START:ana> T cells <END> from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , or SS accompanied by RA . 
The SS <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> DNA-binding abnormality correlated significantly with an inability of cells to exit the Gzero/G1 cell cycle phase when stimulated in vitro . 
Importantly , nucleoprotein extracts showing decreased DNA-binding activity had normal amounts of <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> proteins as determined by immunoprecipitation , implying a functional defect in the <START:ggp> Oct-1 protein <END> . 
Moreover , defective DNA binding was corrected by treatment with acid phosphatase . 
Characterization of a new isoform of the <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ( <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ) gene family member <START:ggp> NFATc <END> [ published erratum appears in J Biol Chem 1996 Dec 27 ; 271 ( 52 ) : 33705 ] 
The <START:ggp> cyclosporin A ( CsA ) /FK506-sensitive nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) plays a key role in the inducible expression of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> NFAT <END> has been recently shown to be inducible in several <START:ana> non-T immune cells <END> , the <START:ggp> NFAT gene family members <END> characterized to date have been isolated only from <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
To further characterize <START:ggp> NFAT <END> function in <START:ana> human B cells <END> and to demonstrate cytokine gene specificity of <START:ggp> NFAT proteins <END> , we report here the isolation and characterization of a <START:ggp> cDNA clone <END> from the <START:ana> Raji B cell line <END> . 
The <START:ggp> cDNA clone <END> encodes a new isoform , <START:ggp> NFATc.beta <END> , of the <START:ggp> NFAT gene family member <END> <START:ggp> NFATc <END> ( designated here <START:ggp> NFATc.alpha <END> ) . 
The <START:ggp> amino acid sequence <END> of <START:ggp> NFATc.beta <END> differs from that of <START:ggp> NFATc <END> . 
alpha in the first <START:ggp> NH2-terminal 29 residues <END> and contains an additional region of <START:ggp> 142 residues <END> at the <START:ggp> COOH terminus <END> . 
Northern analysis using a probe encompassing a common region of both isoforms showed two <START:ana> mRNA species <END> of <START:ana> 2.7 and 4.5 kilobase pairs <END> , while an <START:ggp> NFATc.beta-specific probe <END> detected only the <START:ana> 4.5-kilobase pair mRNA <END> which was preferentially expressed in the spleen . 
Transient expression of <START:ggp> NFATc.beta <END> was capable of activating an <START:ggp> interleukin-2 NFAT-driven reporter gene <END> in <START:ana> stimulated Jurkat cells <END> in a CsA-sensitive manner . 
However , <START:ggp> NFATc.beta <END> neither bound to the <START:ggp> kappa3 element <END> ( an <START:ggp> NFAT-binding site <END> ) in the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter <END> nor activated the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter <END> in cotransfection assays . 
These data suggest that different members or isoforms of <START:ggp> NFAT gene <END> family may regulate inducible expression of different <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> gene expression . 
Interferon-gamma ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) , also known as <START:ggp> type II interferon <END> , is an important immunoregulatory gene that has multiple effects on the development , maturation , and function of the immune system . 
<START:ana> IFN-gamma mRNA <END> and protein are expressed predominantly by <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> large granular lymphocytes <END> . 
The <START:ana> IFN-gamma mRNA <END> is induced/inhibited in these cell types by a wide variety of extracellular signals , thus implicating a number of diverse , yet convergent signal transduction pathways in its transcriptional control . 
In this review , I describe how DNA methylation and specific <START:ggp> DNA binding proteins <END> may regulate transcription of the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma gene <END> in response to extracellular signals . 
Transcriptional analysis of Epstein-Barr virus gene expression in EBV-positive gastric carcinoma : unique viral latency in the <START:ana> tumour cells <END> . 
Although case-oriented evidence for an association of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) with gastric carcinoma has been accumulating recently , the interaction ( s ) between EBV and <START:ana> gastric epithelial cells <END> is/are largely unknown . 
In this study , we examined seven EBV-positive gastric carcinoma tissues for viral gene expression at the mRNA level , from which studies on the EBV oncogenicity in <START:ana> human epithelial cells <END> will benefit . 
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that all seven EBV-positive tumour tissues constitutively expressed <START:ana> EBV nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) 1 mRNA <END> , but not <START:ana> EBNA2 mRNA <END> . 
The <START:ggp> EBNA <END> transcription was initiated from one of three <START:ggp> EBNA promoters <END> , <START:ggp> Qp <END> : by contrast , both <START:ggp> Cp <END> and <START:ggp> Wp <END> were silent , thus resulting in the lack of <START:ana> EBNA2 mRNA <END> . 
<START:ana> Latent membrane protein ( LMP ) 2A mRNA <END> was detected in three of seven cases ; however , <START:ana> neither LMP1 nor LMP2B mRNA <END> was detected in any of the tumours tested . 
Transcripts from the <START:ggp> BamHI-A region <END> of the <START:ggp> viral genome <END> were detectable in all cases . 
<START:ana> BZLF1 mRNA <END> and the product , an <START:ggp> immediate-early gene <END> for EBV replication , was not expressed in any of them , thereby suggesting that the <START:ana> tumour cells <END> carried <START:ggp> EBV genomes <END> in a tightly latent form . 
These findings further extended our previous data regarding EBV latency in <START:ana> gastric carcinoma cells <END> at the protein level , and have affirmed that the programme of viral gene expression in the tumour more closely resembles 'latency I ' represented by Burkitt 's lymphoma than 'latency II ' represented by the majority of nasopharyngeal carcinomas . 
Characterization of <START:ggp> Grb2-binding proteins <END> in <START:ana> human platelets <END> activated by <START:ggp> Fc gamma RIIA <END> cross-linking . 
<START:ggp> Glutathione-S-transferase ( GST ) -Grb2 fusion proteins <END> have been used to identify the potential role of <START:ggp> Grb2-binding proteins <END> in <START:ana> platelet <END> activation by the <START:ggp> platelet low-affinity IgG receptor <END> , <START:ggp> Fc gamma RIIA <END> . 
Two <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphoproteins <END> of 38 and 63 kD bind to the <START:ggp> SH2 domain <END> of <START:ggp> Grb2 <END> following <START:ggp> Fc gamma RIIA <END> stimulation of <START:ana> platelets <END> . 
Both are located in the particulate fraction following <START:ana> platelet <END> activation and are also able to bind to a <START:ggp> GST-construct <END> containing the <START:ggp> SH2 and SH3 domains <END> of <START:ggp> phospholipase C gamma 1 <END> . 
p38 also forms a complex with the <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase csk <END> in <START:ana> stimulated cells <END> and is a substrate for the <START:ggp> kinase <END> . 
The <START:ggp> SH3 domains <END> of <START:ggp> Grb2 <END> form a stable complex with <START:ggp> SOS1 <END> and two proteins of <START:ggp> 75 kD <END> and <START:ggp> 120 kD <END> , which undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in <START:ana> Fc gamma RIIA stimulated cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> 75-kD protein <END> is recognized by antibodies to <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> , which has recently been isolated from <START:ana> T cells <END> and sequenced . 
Tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> p38 <END> and <START:ggp> p63 <END> is also observed in <START:ana> platelets <END> stimulated by the <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> -linked receptor agonist <START:ggp> collagen <END> and by the <START:ggp> G protein <END> -coupled receptor agonist <START:ggp> thrombin <END> , although phosphorylation of <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> is only observed in <START:ggp> collagen <END> -stimulated <START:ana> platelets <END> . 
<START:ggp> p38 <END> and <START:ggp> p63 <END> may provide a docking site for <START:ggp> Grb2 <END> , thereby linking <START:ggp> Grb2 SH3-binding proteins <END> <START:ggp> SOS1 <END> , <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> , and <START:ggp> p120 <END> to downstream signalling events . 
Constitutive expression of specific <START:ggp> interferon isotypes <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocytes <END> from normal individuals and in <START:ana> promonocytic U937 cells <END> . 
Constitutive expression of <START:ggp> IFN-alpha5 <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> was detected in different <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> including <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> from normal individuals following amplification of <START:ana> IFN mRNA <END> by <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase <END> -polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of the <START:ggp> amplified product <END> . 
The activated form of the <START:ggp> interferon-induced transcription factor complex <END> <START:ggp> ISGF3 <END> was also detected in nuclear extracts from <START:ana> uninduced cells <END> . 
Culture supernatants from <START:ana> uninduced U937 cells <END> were also found to activate an <START:ggp> ISRE <END> cloned upstream of the <START:ggp> luciferase reporter gene <END> , indicating the presence of <START:ggp> endogenous IFN <END> activity equivalent to approximately 0.3 to 0.5 IU/mL . 
This <START:ggp> endogenous IFN <END> was also shown to play a role in maintaining the basal level of expression of the <START:ggp> major histocompatibility class I genes <END> in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> IFN-alpha5 <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> are produced at low levels in normal tissues and play an important role in the regulation of cell function and in the maintenance of homeostasis . 
An <START:ggp> IL-2 response element <END> in the <START:ggp> human IL-2 receptor alpha chain promoter <END> is a <START:ggp> composite element <END> that binds <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> , <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> , <START:ggp> HMG-I ( Y ) <END> and a <START:ggp> GATA family protein <END> . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> human interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor alpha chain gene <END> is potently upregulated by its own ligand , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
In this study , we characterize an essential upstream <START:ggp> IL-2 response element <END> that contains both <START:ggp> consensus and non-consensus GAS motifs <END> , two putative <START:ggp> Ets binding sites <END> ( <START:ggp> EBS <END> ) , one of which overlaps the <START:ggp> consensus GAS motif <END> , and a <START:ggp> GATA motif <END> , which overlaps the <START:ggp> non-consensus GAS motif <END> . 
We demonstrate that although the individual components of this element do not respond to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , together they form a composite element capable of conferring <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> responsiveness to a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> . 
Multiple factors including <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> , <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> , <START:ggp> HMG-I ( Y ) <END> and <START:ggp> GATA family proteins <END> bind to the <START:ggp> IL-2 response element <END> and mutation of any one of these binding sites diminishes the activity of this element . 
An unidentified <START:ggp> Ets family protein <END> binds to the <START:ggp> EBS <END> overlapping the <START:ggp> consensus GAS motif <END> and appears to negatively regulate the <START:ggp> human IL-2R alpha promoter <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha promoter <END> activity requires a <START:ggp> complex upstream element <END> , which appears to contain <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for both <START:ggp> positive and negative regulatory factors <END> . 
<START:ana> Lymphocytes <END> from CML patients lack a <START:ggp> 47 kDa factor <END> having affinity for a <START:ggp> genomic sterol regulatory sequence <END> . 
Deranged cellular cholesterol homeostasis has been widely recognized in the initiation as well as progression of various types of cancers including chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) . 
Since the <START:ggp> human genomic sterol regulatory element <END> ( <START:ggp> SRE <END> ) has been shown to regulate various key genes involved in this phenomenon , the present study revealed the existence of a unique <START:ggp> 47 kDa protein factor <END> having affinity for this <START:ggp> SRE sequence <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> from normal subjects , as well as its absence in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> from untreated CML patients . 
However , this factor appeared when these CML patients achieved complete haematological remission ( CHR ) through <START:ggp> alpha-interferon <END> therapy . 
Furthermore , an inverse relationship was also observed between the <START:ggp> LDL receptor gene <END> expression at the transcriptional level and the binding affinity of this <START:ggp> 47 kDa protein factor <END> to the <START:ggp> SRE sequence <END> . 
Based upon these results we propose that this factor may have a role in pathophysiology of chronic myeloid leukaemia . 
Cloning and characterization of the <START:ggp> beta subunit <END> of <START:ggp> human proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor <END> and its involvement in transcription of <START:ggp> small nuclear RNA genes <END> by <START:ggp> RNA polymerases II and III <END> . 
The <START:ggp> proximal sequence element ( PSE ) -binding transcription factor <END> ( <START:ggp> PTF <END> ) , which binds the <START:ggp> PSE <END> of both <START:ggp> RNA polymerase II -and RNA polymerase III-transcribed mammalian small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) genes <END> , is essential for their transcription . 
We previously reported the purification of <START:ggp> human PTF <END> , a complex of <START:ggp> four subunits <END> , and the molecular cloning and characterization of <START:ggp> PTF gamma and delta subunits <END> . 
Here we describe the isolation and expression of a <START:ggp> cDNA <END> encoding <START:ggp> PTF beta <END> , as well as functional studies using <START:ggp> anti-PTF beta antibodies <END> . 
Native <START:ggp> PTF beta <END> , in either protein fractions or a <START:ggp> PTF-Oct-1-DNA complex <END> , can be recognized by <START:ggp> polyclonal antibodies <END> raised against <START:ggp> recombinant PTF beta <END> . 
Immunodepletion studies show that <START:ggp> PTF beta <END> is required for transcription of both classes of <START:ggp> snRNA genes <END> in vitro . 
In addition , immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate that substantial and similar molar amounts of <START:ggp> TATA-binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> TBP <END> ) and <START:ggp> TFIIIB90 <END> can weakly associate with <START:ggp> PTF <END> at low salt conditions , but this association is dramatically reduced at high salt concentrations . 
Along with our previous demonstration of both physical interactions between <START:ggp> PTF gamma/PTF delta <END> and <START:ggp> TBP <END> and the involvement of <START:ggp> TFIIIB90 <END> in the transcription of <START:ggp> class III snRNA genes <END> , these results are consistent with the notion that a <START:ggp> TBP-containing complex <END> related to <START:ggp> TFIIIB <END> is required for the transcription of <START:ggp> class III snRNA genes <END> , and acts through weak interaction with the <START:ggp> four-subunit PTF <END> . 
Attenuated function of a variant form of the <START:ggp> helix-loop-helix protein <END> , <START:ggp> Id-3 <END> , generated by an alternative splicing mechanism . 
The Id family of <START:ggp> helix-loop-helix proteins <END> function as negative regulators of DNA binding , basic <START:ggp> helix-loop-helix proteins <END> in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation . 
We report here on the identification of a <START:ggp> 17 kDa variant <END> of the <START:ggp> 14 kDa Id-3 <END> protein termed <START:ggp> Id-3L <END> ( long version ) which possesses a unique <START:ggp> 60 amino acid carboxy-terminus <END> generated by read through of a ' <START:ggp> coding intron <END> ' and alternative splicing . 
Northern analysis revealed expression of a minor <START:ana> 1.1 kb Id-3L transcript <END> together with the predominant <START:ana> 0.95 kb Id-3 transcript <END> in the majority of adult human tissues analysed . 
The variant <START:ggp> Id-3L protein <END> is functionally distinguishable from conventional <START:ggp> Id-3 <END> since in in vitro DNA mobility shift assays , it was greatly impaired in its ability to abrogate binding of the basic <START:ggp> helix-loop-helix protein <END> , <START:ggp> E47 <END> , to an <START:ggp> E box recognition sequence <END> . 
Tyloxapol inhibits <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> release , scavenges <START:ggp> HOCI <END> , and reduces viscosity of cystic fibrosis sputum . 
Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients develop progressive <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -mediated inflammatory lung disease , with abundant production of thick , tenacious , <START:ggp> protease <END> -and oxidant-rich purulent airway secretions that are difficult to clear even with physiotherapy . 
In the search for a potential treatment , we have tested tyloxapol , an alkylaryl polyether alcohol polymer detergent previously used as a mucolytic agent in adult chronic bronchitis . 
Tyloxapol inhibits activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NK-kappa B <END> ) , reduces resting secretion of the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> <START:ggp> interleukin-8 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> ) in <START:ana> cultured human monocytes <END> , and inhibits lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated release of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) , <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) , and the eiconsanoids thromboxane A2 and leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) . 
We have previously shown that tyloxapol is a potent antioxidant for hydroxyl radicals ( OH ) . 
Tyloxapol ( 0.05 to 0.1 % wt/vol ) effectively scavenges the oxidant hypochlorous acid ( HOCl ; 1 to 7.5 mM ) in vitro , and protects from HOCl-mediated lung injury in rats . 
Tyloxapol also reduces the viscosity of CF sputum ( from 463 +/- 133 to 128 +/- 52 centipoise ) . 
We conclude that tyloxapol is potentially useful as a new antiinflammatory therapy for CF lung disease , and could possibly promote clearance of secretions in the CF airway . 
Elevated cyclic AMP inhibits <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -mediated transcription in human monocytic cells and endothelial cells . 
The <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> regulates the inducible expression of many genes in <START:ana> activated human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> . 
In this study , we examined the molecular mechanism by which agents that elevate intracellular cAMP inhibit the expression of the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> ) , <START:ggp> tissue factor <END> , <START:ggp> endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 genes <END> . 
Both forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP , which elevate intracellular cAMP by independent mechanisms , inhibited <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> and <START:ggp> tissue factor <END> expression at the level of transcription . 
Induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent gene expression in transiently transfected <START:ana> human monocytic THP-1 cells <END> and <START:ana> human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> was inhibited by elevated cAMP and by overexpression of the <START:ggp> catalytic subunit <END> of <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> ( <START:ggp> PKA <END> ) . 
Elevated cAMP did not prevent nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel/p65 heterodimers <END> , decrease nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> p65 <END> , or significantly modify <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> -induced phosphorylation of <START:ggp> p65 <END> . 
Functional studies demonstrated that transcriptional activation of a <START:ggp> plasmid <END> containing <START:ggp> multimerized kappaB sites <END> by <START:ggp> p65 <END> was inhibited by agents that elevate cAMP and by overexpression of the <START:ggp> catalytic subunit <END> of <START:ggp> PKA <END> . 
This study indicates that activation of <START:ggp> PKA <END> reduces the induction of a distinct set of <START:ggp> genes <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> by inhibiting <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -mediated transcription . 
Molecular mechanisms of steroid action : a novel type of cross-talk between glucocorticoids and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Despite the widespread use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of diseases characterized by inflammation , the molecular mechanism ( s ) by which these hormones exert this beneficial effect in patients with asthma remains to be elucidated . 
Therefore , we have studied the transcriptional regulation of <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ) as <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> are likely to play a causal role in inflammation in promoting cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions . 
We observed that in a <START:ana> monocytic ( U937 ) <END> and a <START:ana> bronchial epithelial ( H292 ) cell-line <END> dexamethasone strongly suppressed basal and induced <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> expression . 
Subsequent analysis of the <START:ggp> human ICAM-1 promoter <END> has revealed that both 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) and <START:ggp> tumour necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) upregulate <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> expression through the presence of a <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF-kappa B ) target sequence <END> ( TGGAAATTCC ) . 
No <START:ggp> glucocorticoid recognition sequences <END> are present in this <START:ggp> promoter region <END> and dexamethasone is still able to repress transcription when the <START:ggp> multimerized NF-kappa B sequence <END> is transactivated by <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> upon transfection in <START:ana> 293 cells <END> . 
We propose that direct interaction between the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> and <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B factors <END> is at least a partial explanation for the effects of this hormone in inflammatory diseases . 
Abnormalities of <START:ggp> p16 , p15 and CDK4 genes <END> in recurrent malignant astrocytomas . 
Abnormalities in the <START:ggp> p16 , p15 and CDK4 genes <END> that regulate transition through the G1 phase of the cell cycle have been implicated in the malignant progression of astrocytomas . 
The results of the present study demonstrate that dysfunction of these <START:ggp> genes <END> also occurs during recurrence of glial tumors that were highly malignant at first presentation . 
Analysis of 10 matched pairs of high grade malignant astrocytomas and their subsequent recurrences identified three distinct groups . 
The primary and recurrent tumors in Group A did not show structural alterations in the <START:ggp> p16 , p15 or CDK4 genes <END> , whereas homozygous codeletion of <START:ggp> p16 <END> and <START:ggp> p15 <END> was observed in both primary and recurrent tumors in Group B . 
The primary tumors in Group C had a normal profile of <START:ggp> p16 <END> , <START:ggp> p15 <END> and <START:ggp> CDK4 <END> at presentation . 
Upon recurrence , however , the tumors sustained either deletion of <START:ggp> p16 <END> alone or codeletion of both <START:ggp> p16 <END> and <START:ggp> p15 <END> or amplification of <START:ggp> CDK4 <END> . 
Analysis of the molecular differences between primary anaplastic astrocytomas/glioblastomas and their subsequent recurrences , which are clinically indistinguishable , may provide better therapeutic options for treatment . 
<START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> , a <START:ggp> POZ/zinc-finger protein <END> , is a <START:ggp> sequence-specific transcriptional repressor <END> . 
Approximately 40 % of diffuse large cell lymphoma are associated with chromosomal translocations that deregulate the expression of the <START:ggp> BCL6 gene <END> by juxtaposing <START:ggp> heterologous promoters <END> to the <START:ggp> BCL-6 coding domain <END> . 
The <START:ggp> BCL6 gene <END> encodes a <START:ggp> 95-kDa protein <END> containing six <START:ggp> C-terminal zinc-finger motifs <END> and an <START:ggp> N-terminal POZ domain <END> , suggesting that it may function as a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
By using a <START:ggp> DNA sequence <END> selected for its ability to bind <START:ggp> recombinant BCL-6 <END> in vitro , we show here that <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> is present in <START:ggp> DNA-binding complexes <END> in nuclear extracts from various <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> . 
In transient transfectin experiments , <START:ggp> BCL6 <END> can repress transcription from <START:ggp> promoters <END> linked to its <START:ggp> DNA target sequence <END> and this activity is dependent upon specific DNA-binding and the presence of an intact <START:ggp> N-terminal half <END> of the protein . 
We demonstrate that this part of the <START:ggp> BCL6 molecule <END> contains an <START:ggp> autonomous transrepressor domain <END> and that two <START:ggp> noncontiguous regions <END> , including the <START:ggp> POZ motif <END> , mediate maximum transrepressive activity . 
These results indicate that the <START:ggp> BCL-6 protein <END> can function as a <START:ggp> sequence-specific transcriptional repressor <END> and have implications for the role of <START:ggp> BCL6 <END> in normal lymphoid development and lymphomagenesis . 
Signals leading to the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B transcription factor <END> are stronger in <START:ana> neonatal than adult T lymphocytes <END> . 
The molecular background of the defects in the immune reactivity of human neonates has not been fully elucidated . 
As the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B transcription factor <END> has a central role in the control of transcription of several <START:ggp> genes <END> involved in immune and inflammatory responses , the authors have analysed the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> human umbilical cord T lymphocytes <END> . 
The activity was tested by quantitating the <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> binding to an oligonucleotide containing the <START:ggp> consensus kappa B binding sequence <END> ( electrophoretic mobility shift assay ) . 
The data obtained demonstrate that phorbol dibutyrate/calcium ionophore A23187 ( PDBu/iono ) combination induced a clearly higher nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> neonatal than adult T cells <END> . 
This higher <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity was restricted to the <START:ana> CD4+ T-cell subset <END> . 
Analysis of the nuclear extracts with <START:ggp> antibodies <END> directed against the major components of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> the <START:ggp> p50 and RelA ( p65 ) proteins <END> , indicated that the composition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was similar in <START:ana> neonatal and adult cells <END> . 
These results suggest that <START:ana> neonatal T cells <END> are exposed to oxidative stress-inducing signals during delivery and/or are inherently more sensitive to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activating signals than <START:ana> adult T cells <END> . 
Dual action of retinoic acid on human embryonic/fetal hematopoiesis : blockade of primitive progenitor proliferation and shift from multipotent/erythroid/monocytic to granulocytic differentiation program . 
In preliminary studies , we have analyzed the <START:ggp> hematopoietic growth factor <END> ( <START:ggp> HGF <END> ) requirement of <START:ana> hematopoietic progenitor cells <END> ( <START:ana> HPCs <END> ) purified from embryonic-fetal liver ( FL ) and grown in fetal calf serum-supplemented ( FCS+ ) clonogenic culture . 
The key role of <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> Epo <END> ) for colony formation by <START:ana> early erythroid progenitors <END> ( <START:ana> burst-forming units-erythroid <END> [ <START:ana> BFU-E <END> ] ) has been confirmed . 
Furthermore , in the absence of exogenous <START:ggp> HGFs <END> , <START:ana> FL monocytic progenitors <END> ( <START:ana> colony-forming unit monocyte <END> [ <START:ana> CFU-M <END> ] ) generate large colonies exclusively composed of monocytes-macrophages ; these colonies are absent in FCS- clonogenic culture . 
On this basis , we have investigated the role of all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and its isomer 9-cis RA in FL hematopoiesis . 
Both compounds modulate the growth of <START:ana> purified FL HPCs <END> , which show a dose-dependent shift from mixed/erythroid/monocytic to granulocytic colony formation . 
Studies on <START:ana> unicellular and paired daughter cell culture <END> unequivocally indicate that the shift is mediated by modulation of the HPC differentiation program to the granulopoietic pathway ( rather than RA-induced down-modulation of multipotent /erythroid/monocytic HPC growth coupled with recruitment of <START:ana> granulocytic HPCs <END> ) . 
ATRA and 9-cis RA also exert their effect on the proliferation of <START:ana> primitive HPCs <END> ( <START:ana> high-proliferative potential colony-forming cells <END> [ <START:ana> HPP-CFCs <END> ] ) and <START:ana> putative hematopoietic stem cells <END> ( <START:ana> HSCs <END> ; assayed in Dexter-type long-term culture ) . 
High concentrations of either compound ( 1 ) drastically reduced the number of primary <START:ana> HPP-CFC colonies <END> and totally abolished their recloning capacity and ( 2 ) inhibited <START:ana> HSC <END> proliferation . 
It is crucial that these results mirror recent observations indicating that murine adult <START:ana> HPCs <END> transduced with dominant negative <START:ggp> ATRA receptor ( RAR ) gene <END> are immortalized and show a selective blockade of granulocytic differentiation . 
Altogether , these results suggest that ATRA/9-cis RA may play a key role in FL hematopoiesis via a dual effect hypothetically mediated by interaction with the <START:ggp> RAR/RXR heterodimer <END> , ie , inhibition of <START:ana> HSC/ primitive HPC <END> proliferation and induction of CFU-GEMM/ BFU-E/CFU-M shift from the multipotent/erythroid/monocytic to the granulocytic-neutrophilic differentiation program . 
Dexamethasone suppression test : <START:ggp> corticosteroid receptors <END> regulation in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> of young and aged subjects . 
The dexamethasone suppression test ( DST ) is considered an indicator of the function of the adrenal pituitary axis . 
The effect of the steroid is mediated by its binding to <START:ggp> corticosteroid receptors <END> . 
We previously suggested that the measurement of <START:ggp> corticosteroid receptors <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> is an index of an analogous pattern in brain . 
In the present study , <START:ggp> corticosteroid Type I and Type II receptors <END> in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> were measured in 10 elderly subjects and in 9 young adults , before and after overnight DST ( 1 mg ) . 
Receptors were measured by radioreceptor assay . 
In all the subjects , dexamethasone was able to suppress plasma cortisol . 
The number of <START:ggp> Type I and Type II receptors <END> before the test was lower in elderly subjects than in adults . 
In the control group , dexamethasone produced a significant depression of <START:ggp> Type I receptors <END> ( from 267 +/- 72 to 169 +/- 71 receptors per cell ) , which can be interpreted as a primary involvement of <START:ggp> Type I receptors <END> in the response to dexamethasone ; <START:ggp> Type II receptors <END> decreased in half the subjects ( from 2849 +/- 703 to 2345 +/- 569 receptors per cell ) . 
In elderly healthy subjects , <START:ggp> Type II receptors <END> were also significantly decreased ( from 1796 +/- 671 to 720 +/- 345 ) . 
We suggest that in young subjects <START:ggp> Type II receptors <END> are initially up-regulated by dexamethasone , and then down-regulated , while in aged subjects an up-regulation can not be achieved , as suggested by the higher values of plasma cortisol usually found in aging subjects . 
Analysis of the <START:ggp> ligand-binding domain <END> of <START:ggp> human retinoic acid receptor alpha <END> by site-directed mutagenesis . 
Three subtypes of <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR <END> ) , termed <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> , <START:ggp> RAR beta <END> , and <START:ggp> RAR gamma <END> , have been described . 
They are composed of different <START:ggp> structural domains <END> , including distinct domains for DNA and ligand binding . 
<START:ggp> RARs <END> specifically bind all-trans-retinoic acid ( RA ) , 9-cis-RA , and retinoid analogs . 
In this study , we examined the functional role of cysteine and arginine residues in the <START:ggp> ligand-binding domain <END> of <START:ggp> hRAR alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> hRAR alpha-LBD <END> , <START:ggp> amino acids 154 to 462 <END> ) . 
All conserved cysteine and arginine residues in this domain were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis , and the <START:ggp> mutant proteins <END> were characterized by blocking reactions , ligand-binding experiments , transactivation assays , and <START:ggp> protease <END> mapping . 
Changes of any cysteine residue of the <START:ggp> hRAR alpha-LBD <END> had no significant influence on the binding of all-trans RA or 9-cis RA . 
Interestingly , residue C-235 is specifically important in antagonist binding . 
With respect to arginine residues , only the two single mutations of R-276 and R-394 to alanine showed a dramatic decrease of agonist and antagonist binding whereas the R272A mutation showed only a slight effect . 
For all other arginine mutations , no differences in affinity were detectable . 
The two mutations R217A and R294A caused an increased binding efficiency for antagonists but no change in agonist binding . 
From these results , we can conclude that electrostatic interactions of retinoids with the <START:ggp> RAR alpha-LBD <END> play a significant role in ligand binding . 
In addition , antagonists show distinctly different requirements for efficient binding , which may contribute to their interference in the ligand-inducible transactivation function of <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL4 and IL13 receptors <END> share the <START:ggp> gamma c chain <END> and activate <START:ggp> STAT6 , STAT3 and STAT5 proteins <END> in <START:ana> normal human B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL13 <END> induces the same biological effects as <START:ggp> IL4 <END> in <START:ana> normal human B cells <END> . 
We show that as in the <START:ggp> IL4R complex <END> , both <START:ggp> IL4R alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL2R gamma c <END> are components of the <START:ggp> IL13R <END> and that both <START:ggp> cytokines <END> induced <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> activation in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
In spite of this similar downstream signalling , <START:ggp> IL4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL13 <END> used a different set of <START:ggp> Janus kinases <END> : <START:ggp> IL13 <END> is unable to activate <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Calcineurin mutants <END> render <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> resistant to cyclosporin A . 
The immunosuppressants cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 have been widely used to prevent and treat graft rejection after human organ and tissue transplantations . 
CsA and FK506 associate with <START:ggp> intracellular binding proteins <END> ( i.e. , CsA with <START:ggp> cyclophilin A <END> and FK506 with <START:ggp> FKBP12 <END> ) to form protein/drug complexes that suppress the immune system by preventing activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> in response to antigen presentation . 
The common target of CsA and FK506 is <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , a <START:ggp> Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated , serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase <END> that regulates the nuclear import of a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , required for expression of <START:ggp> T cell activation genes <END> . 
In previous studies , we identified <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> mutations that block binding by the <START:ggp> cyclophilin A/CsA or FKBP12/FK506 complexes <END> and thereby render yeast cells resistant to the antifungal effects of CsA or FK506 . 
In this report , we demonstrate that the corresponding mutations in murine <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> render the <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> signal transduction cascade CsA resistant in <START:ana> human Jurkat T cells <END> . 
Our findings support the recently determined <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> X-ray crystal structure , provide evidence that <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> is the only <START:ggp> CsA-sensitive component <END> limiting signaling from the <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> to the nucleus , and suggest a means to render cells and tissues resistant to the toxic side effects of CsA and FK506 . 
Epstein-Barr viral latency is disrupted by the <START:ggp> immediate-early BRLF1 protein <END> through a cell-specific mechanism . 
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis , is a human herpesvirus associated with epithelial cell malignancies ( nasopharyngeal carcinoma ) as well as B-cell malignancies . 
Understanding how viral latency is disrupted is a central issue in herpesvirus biology . 
Epithelial cells are the major site of lytic EBV replication within the human host , and viral reactivation occurs in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinomas . 
It is known that expression of a single <START:ggp> viral immediate-early protein <END> , <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> , is sufficient to initiate the switch from latent to lytic infection in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Cellular regulation of <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> transcription is therefore thought to play a key role in regulating the stringency of viral latency . 
Here we show that , unexpectedly , expression of another <START:ggp> viral immediate-early protein <END> , <START:ggp> BRLF1 <END> , can disrupt viral latency in an epithelial cell-specific fashion . 
Therefore , the mechanisms leading to disruption of EBV latency appear to be cell-type specific . 
<START:ana> Eosinophil <END> priming by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> : from cellular signal to in vivo modulation . 
<START:ana> Eosinophils <END> play an important role in the effector phase of allergic inflammation . 
This review will focus on the conversion of the unprimed eosinophil phenotype in the peripheral blood of normal individuals to the primed phenotype found in the peripheral blood and tissues of allergic patients , a phenomenon called priming . 
Recent data on the signals initiated after <START:ggp> cytokine receptor <END> activation on <START:ana> eosinophils <END> will be reviewed . 
CTL recognition of an altered peptide associated with asparagine bond rearrangement . 
Implications for immunity and vaccine design . 
The extent to which peptides containing chemically and post-translationally modified <START:ggp> amino acid side chains <END> are recognized by <START:ana> primed CTL <END> has not been clearly defined . 
We report on the CTL recognition of a MHC class I-restricted peptide containing a cyclized asparagine ( succinimide ) residue . 
This modification of the asparagine side chain is a common intermediate structure during deamidation , isomerization , and bond rearrangements of amide-containing amino acids and also occurs as a side reaction in peptide synthesis . 
The <START:ana> CTL <END> specifically recognized the succinimide-containing peptide showing only weak cross-reactivity at high concentrations of the parent peptide containing unmodified asparagine . 
Similarly , <START:ana> CTL <END> raised against the parent peptide did not recognize the succinimide derivative of this peptide . 
Naturally processed forms of these structures are likely to occur given the importance and frequency of deamidation both in vitro and in vivo . 
Moreover , since succinimide intermediates of deamidated peptides can occasionally be very stable , these peptides have the potential to act as altered self-Ags with significant implications for autoimmunity . 
In addition , unwanted and potentially hazardous specificities may be elicited when using synthetic peptides in subunit vaccines in which succinimide residues may form spontaneously during storage or chemical synthesis . 
A 3 ' -- > 5 ' <START:ggp> XPB helicase <END> defect in <START:ggp> repair/transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> TFIIH <END> of xeroderma pigmentosum group B affects both DNA repair and transcription . 
<START:ggp> XPB <END> is a subunit of the basal <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> TFIIH <END> , which is also involved in nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and potentially in cell cycle regulation . 
A frameshift mutation in the 3'-end of the <START:ggp> XPB gene <END> is responsible for a concurrence of two disorders : xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) and Cockayne 's syndrome ( CS ) . 
We have isolated <START:ggp> TFIIH <END> from cells derived from a patient ( XP11BE ) who carries this frameshift mutation ( <START:ggp> TFIIHmut <END> ) and from the mother of this patient ( <START:ggp> TFIIHwt <END> ) to determine the biochemical consequences of the mutation . 
Although identical in composition and stoichiometry to <START:ggp> TFIIHwt <END> , <START:ggp> TFIIHmut <END> shows a reduced 3 ' -- > 5 ' <START:ggp> XPB <END> helicase activity . 
A decrease in helicase and <START:ggp> DNA-dependent ATPase <END> activities was also observed with the mutated recombinant <START:ggp> XPB protein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> XPB <END> mutation causes a severe NER defect . 
In addition , we provide evidence for a decrease in basal transcription activity in vitro . 
The latter defect may provide an explanation for many of the XP and CS symptoms that are difficult to rationalize based solely on an NER defect . 
Thus , this work presents the first detailed analysis of a naturally occurring mutation in a <START:ggp> basal transcription factor <END> and supports the concept that the combined XP/CS clinical entity is actually the result of a combined transcription/repair deficiency . 
The Ets protein <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> is expressed exclusively in <START:ana> B cells <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> during development . 
<START:ggp> Spi-B <END> and <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> are <START:ggp> hematopoietic-specific transcription factors <END> that constitute a subfamily of the <START:ggp> Ets family <END> of <START:ggp> DNA-binding proteins <END> . 
Here we show that contrary to previous reports , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> and <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> have very different expression patterns . 
<START:ggp> PU.1 <END> is expressed at high levels in <START:ana> B cells <END> , <START:ana> mast cells <END> , <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> , <START:ana> macrophages <END> , <START:ana> neutrophils <END> , and <START:ana> immature erythroid cells <END> and at lower levels in <START:ana> mature erythrocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> PU.1 <END> is completely absent from <START:ana> peripheral T cells <END> and most <START:ana> T cell lines <END> based on sensitive RT-PCR assays . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> is expressed exclusively in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> and can be detected in early fetal thymus and spleen . 
In situ hybridizations of adult murine tissues demonstrate <START:ana> Spi-B mRNA <END> in the medulla of the thymus , the white pulp of the spleen , and the germinal centers of lymph nodes . 
<START:ggp> Spi-B <END> expression is very abundant in <START:ana> B cells <END> and both <START:ana> Spi-B mRNA <END> and protein are detected in some <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
In situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis suggest that <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> gene expression increases during B cell maturation and decreases during T cell maturation . 
Gel-retardation experiments show that <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> can bind to all <START:ggp> putative PU.1 binding sites <END> , but do not reveal any preferred <START:ggp> Spi-B binding site <END> . 
Finally , both <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> and <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> function as transcriptional activators of the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin light-chain enhancer E lambda 2.4 <END> when coexpressed with <START:ggp> Pip <END> ( <START:ggp> PU.1-interaction partner <END> ) in <START:ana> NIH-3T3 cells <END> . 
Taken together , these data suggest that differences in patterns of expression between <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> and <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> distinguish the function of each protein during development of the immune system . 
A critical role of <START:ggp> Sp1- and Ets-related transcription factors <END> in maintaining CTL-specific expression of the <START:ggp> mouse perforin gene <END> . 
This study was designed to determine the potential <START:ggp> cis-elements <END> involved in transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> mouse perforin gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> DNase I hypersensitive site <END> ( <START:ggp> DHS <END> ) mapping revealed that the <START:ggp> perforin locus <END> contained six <START:ggp> DHS <END> within 7.0 kb of the <START:ggp> 5 ' upstream sequence <END> ( -7.0 kb ) and two <START:ggp> DHS <END> in <START:ggp> intron 2 <END> . 
The six <START:ggp> 5 ' upstream <END> and one <START:ggp> intronic DHS <END> were detected in only <START:ana> perforin-expressing lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase <END> ( <START:ggp> CAT <END> ) activities directed by <START:ggp> 5 ' upstream promoter <END> were detected preferentially in <START:ana> perforin-expressing cell lines <END> . 
A construct termed <START:ggp> PFP5a <END> containing <START:ggp> -795 bp <END> exhibited the highest <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity , and <START:ggp> PFP9a20 <END> containing only <START:ggp> -73 bp <END> also produced significantly high <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity in <START:ana> CTLL-R8 cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> proximal region <END> in <START:ggp> PFP9a20 <END> contained two potential <START:ggp> Sp1 binding sites <END> ( <START:ggp> GC box <END> and <START:ggp> GT box <END> ) and one <START:ggp> Ets binding site <END> ( <START:ggp> EBS <END> ) . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that each of the <START:ggp> cis-elements <END> bound specific <START:ggp> protein factors <END> . 
When single-point mutation was introduced to each <START:ggp> GC box <END> , <START:ggp> EBS <END> , and <START:ggp> GT box <END> in <START:ggp> PFP9a20 <END> , at least 3-fold less <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity was observed in <START:ana> CTLL-R8 cells <END> . 
To confirm the importance of the three <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> in the <START:ggp> perforin gene <END> expression , point mutation was introduced again to each <START:ggp> proximal GC box <END> , <START:ggp> EBS <END> , and <START:ggp> GT box <END> of <START:ggp> PFP5a <END> . 
The point mutations resulted in a 2.5- to 3-fold reduction of <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity . 
The results suggest that a combination of the three proximal <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> may constitute a minimal region responsible for CTL-specific expression of <START:ggp> perforin <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Oct-2 transcription factor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Oct-2 transcription factor <END> is a member of the <START:ggp> POU ( Pit-Oct-Unc ) family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> and is expressed only in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> and in <START:ana> neuronal cells <END> but not in other cell types . 
The <START:ana> primary RNA transcript <END> of the gene is subject to alternative splicing to yield different variants which can either activate or repress gene expression . 
The forms produced in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> have a predominantly activating effect on gene expression whereas those produced in <START:ana> neuronal cells <END> have a predominantly inhibitory effect and can repress the expression of both the <START:ggp> herpes simplex virus immediate-early genes <END> and the <START:ggp> cellular tyrosine hydroxylase gene <END> . 
Thus <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> plays an important role in the regulation of cellular gene expression in both <START:ana> B cells <END> and <START:ana> neuronal cells <END> as well as in the control of viral latency . 
Cell-type-specific regulation of the <START:ggp> human tumor necrosis factor alpha gene <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> by <START:ggp> NFATp <END> and <START:ggp> ATF-2/JUN <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) gene <END> is one of the earliest genes transcribed after the stimulation of a <START:ana> B cell <END> through its <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> or via the CD-40 pathway . 
In both cases , induction of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha gene <END> transcription can be blocked by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK506 , which suggested a role for the <START:ggp> NFAT family <END> of proteins in the regulation of the gene in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Furthermore , in <START:ana> T cells <END> , two molecules of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> bind to the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha promoter element kappa 3 <END> in association with <START:ggp> ATF-2 <END> and <START:ggp> Jun proteins <END> bound to an immediately adjacent <START:ggp> cyclic AMP response element ( CRE ) site <END> . 
Here , using the <START:ana> murine B-cell lymphoma cell line <END> <START:ana> A20 <END> , we show that the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha gene <END> is regulated in a cell-type-specific manner . 
In <START:ana> A20 B cells <END> , the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha gene <END> is not regulated by <START:ggp> NFATp <END> bound to the <START:ggp> kappa 3 element <END> . 
Instead , <START:ggp> ATF-2 <END> and <START:ggp> Jun proteins <END> bind to the <START:ggp> composite kappa 3/CRE site <END> and <START:ggp> NFATp <END> binds to a newly identified second <START:ggp> NFAT site <END> centered at <START:ggp> -76 nucleotides <END> relative to the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha transcription start site <END> . 
This new site plays a critical role in the calcium-mediated , cyclosporin A-sensitive induction of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> in both <START:ana> A20 B cells <END> and <START:ana> Ar-5 cells <END> . 
Consistent with these results , quantitative <START:ggp> DNase <END> footprinting of the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha promoter <END> using increasing amounts of recombinant <START:ggp> NFATp <END> demonstrated that the <START:ggp> -76 site <END> binds to <START:ggp> NFATp <END> with a higher affinity than the <START:ggp> kappa 3 site <END> . 
Two other previously unrecognized <START:ggp> NFATp-binding sites <END> in the proximal <START:ggp> TNF-alpha promoter <END> were also identified by this analysis . 
Thus , through the differential use of the same <START:ggp> promoter element <END> , the <START:ggp> composite kappa 3/CRE site <END> , the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha gene <END> is regulated in a cell-type-specific manner in response to the same extracellular signal . 
Activation of <START:ggp> Stat 5b <END> in <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> correlates with the ability of <START:ggp> ErbB <END> to induce sustained cell proliferation . 
Self renewal of normal <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> is induced by the <START:ggp> receptor tyrosine kinase <END> <START:ggp> c-ErbB <END> , whereas other <START:ggp> receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> c-Kit/Epo-R <END> ) regulate erythroid differentiation . 
To address possible mechanisms that could explain this selective activity of <START:ggp> c-ErbB <END> , we analyzed the ability of these receptors to activate the different members of the <START:ggp> Stat transcription factor family <END> . 
Ligand activation of <START:ggp> c-ErbB <END> induced the tyrosine phosphorylation , DNA-binding , and <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> transcription of <START:ggp> Stat 5b <END> in <START:ana> erythroblasts <END> . 
In contrast , ligand activation of <START:ggp> c-Kit <END> was unable to induce any of these effects in the same cells . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> erythropoietin receptor <END> caused specific DNA-binding of <START:ggp> Stat 5b <END> , but failed to induce <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> transcription . 
These biochemical findings correlate perfectly with the selective ability of <START:ggp> c-ErbB <END> to cause sustained self renewal in <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> . 
Defective transcription of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> is associated with impaired expression of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , <START:ggp> FosB <END> , and <START:ggp> JunB <END> in <START:ana> anergic T helper 1 cells <END> . 
<START:ana> Anergic CD4+ Th cells <END> do not produce <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> when challenged with <START:ana> Ag-pulsed accessory cells <END> because of a transcriptional defect . 
In this work , we report that these <START:ana> anergic T cells <END> are defective in their ability to up-regulate protein binding and transactivation at two critical <START:ggp> IL-2 DNA enhancer elements <END> : <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ( <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ; a sequence that binds a <START:ggp> heterotrimeric NFATp , Fos , and Jun protein complex <END> ) and <START:ggp> Activator Protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) ( that binds <START:ggp> Fos and Jun heterodimers <END> ) . 
Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts showed that the impaired DNA-protein interactions in <START:ana> anergic T cells <END> were associated with poor expression of the inducible <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> family members <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , <START:ggp> FosB <END> , and <START:ggp> JunB <END> . 
However , the reduced expression of these proteins was not the result of a global <START:ggp> TCR/CD3 <END> -signaling defect because <START:ggp> CD3 <END> cross-linking induced an equivalent increase in intracellular-free calcium ions , as well as <START:ggp> NFATp <END> dephosphorylation , translocation to the nucleus , and DNA binding in both <START:ana> normal <END> and <START:ana> anergic T cells <END> . 
Thus , defective <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> transcription appears to be due , at least in part , to a selective block in the expression of the <START:ggp> AP-1 Fos and Jun family members <END> in <START:ana> anergic T cells <END> . 
Sequence-specific DNA binding of the <START:ggp> B-cell-specific coactivator <END> <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> . 
B-cell-specific transcription of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin genes <END> is mediated by the interaction of a <START:ggp> POU domain <END> containing <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> or <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , with the <START:ggp> B-cell-specific coactivator <END> <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> ( <START:ggp> Bob-1 <END> , <START:ggp> OBF-1 <END> ) and a <START:ggp> prototype octamer element <END> . 
We find that <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> binds DNA directly in the major groove between the two subdomains of the <START:ggp> POU domain <END> , requiring both an A at the <START:ggp> fifth position <END> of the <START:ggp> octamer element <END> and contact with the <START:ggp> POU domain <END> . 
An <START:ggp> amino-terminal fragment <END> of <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> binds the <START:ggp> octamer site <END> in the absence of a <START:ggp> POU domain <END> with the same sequence specificity . 
Coactivator <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> may undergo a POU-dependent conformational change that exposes its amino terminus , allowing it to recognize specific <START:ggp> DNA sequences <END> in the major groove within the binding site for <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> or <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> . 
The recognition of both the <START:ggp> POU domain <END> and the <START:ggp> octamer sequence <END> by <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> provides a mechanism for differential regulation of <START:ggp> octamer sites <END> containing genes by the <START:ggp> ubiquitous factor <END> <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> . 
Uneven <START:ggp> X <END> inactivation in a female monozygotic twin pair with Fabry disease and discordant expression of a novel mutation in the <START:ggp> alpha-galactosidase A gene <END> . 
We describe two female monozygotic ( MZ ) twins heterozygous for Fabry disease , an X linked disorder resulting from the deficient activity of <START:ggp> alpha-galactosidase A <END> . 
While one of the twins was clinically affected , the other was asymptomatic . 
Enzymatic assay of <START:ggp> alpha-galactosidase <END> in <START:ana> blood leucocytes <END> , <START:ana> skin fibroblasts <END> , <START:ana> Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphoid cell lines <END> , and hair follicles of the twins and their parents confirmed the heterozygous status of the twins and indicated that Fabry disease had occurred as a result of a de novo mutation . 
The son of the unaffected twin sister was shown to be hemizygous . 
Molecular analysis of the <START:ggp> alpha-galactosidase A gene <END> permitted the identification of an as yet undescribed point mutation at <START:ggp> position 10182 of exon 5 <END> which causes an Asp to Asn substitution at <START:ggp> codon 231 <END> . 
Single strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis again showed the heterozygous status of the twins and a normal pattern in their parents . 
The basis for the discordant expression of this d novo mutation in the twins was investigated by studying their X inactivation status . 
Analysis of the <START:ggp> inactive X <END> specific methylation at the <START:ggp> androgen receptor gene <END> showed unbalanced inactivation in the twins ' fibroblasts and in opposite directions . 
While the <START:ggp> maternally derived X chromosome <END> was preferentially active in the asymptomatic twin , the <START:ggp> paternal X chromosome <END> was active in the other , affected twin and was found in her hemizygotic nephew . 
These data suggest that the <START:ggp> paternal X chromosome <END> carries the de novo <START:ggp> alpha-galactosidase A <END> mutation and that uneven X inactivation is the underlying mechanism for disease expression in this novel female MZ twin pair . 
This is the first documented case of female twins discordant for Fabry disease . 
Precise <START:ggp> alignment of sites <END> required for <START:ggp> mu enhancer <END> activation in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> lymphocyte-specific immunoglobulin mu heavy-chain gene intronic enhancer <END> is regulated by multiple <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> . 
The previously defined <START:ggp> minimal enhancer <END> containing the <START:ggp> muA , muE3 , and muB sites <END> is transactivated by a combination of the <START:ggp> ETS-domain proteins <END> <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> and <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> in <START:ana> nonlymphoid cells <END> . 
The core GGAAs of the <START:ggp> muA and muB sites <END> are separated by 30 nucleotides , suggesting that <START:ggp> ETS proteins <END> bind to these sites from these same side of the DNA helix . 
We tested the necessity for appropriate spatial alignment of these <START:ggp> elements <END> by using <START:ggp> mutated enhancers <END> with altered spacings . 
A 4- or 10-bp insertion between <START:ggp> muE3 <END> and <START:ggp> muB <END> inactivated the <START:ggp> mu enhancer <END> in <START:ana> S194 plasma cells <END> but did not affect in vitro binding of Ets-1 , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , or the <START:ggp> muE3-binding protein <END> <START:ggp> TFE3 <END> , alone or in pairwise combinations . 
Circular permutation and phasing analyses demonstrated that <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> binding but not <START:ggp> TFE3 <END> or <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> bends <START:ggp> mu enhancer DNA <END> toward the major groove . 
We propose that the requirement for precise spacing of the <START:ggp> muA and muB elements <END> is due in part to a directed DNA bend induced by <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> . 
[ Cortisone-resistant bronchial asthma ] 
There is general agreement on the inflammatory pathogenesis of bronchial asthma : an accumulation of <START:ana> activated eosinophils <END> , <START:ana> degranulated mast cells <END> , <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> and in very severe forms , <START:ana> granulocytes <END> has constantly been found in the bronchial mucosa . 
In allergic bronchial asthma , inflammation seems to be orchestrated predominantly by a subset of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , with a phenotype similar to the <START:ana> Th2 subset <END> able to produce <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> . 
Although corticosteroids are the most potent therapeutic agents used for this disease , their anti-inflammatory effect differs from patient to patient . 
Some criteria which can be used to define steroid-resistant bronchial asthma are listed here . 
This review analyzes various molecular alterations responsible for the deficient response to corticosteroid treatment observed in steroid-resistant bronchial asthmatic subjects . 
New knowledge on the mechanism of steroid resistance may have important implications for the treatment of chronic asthma and other diseases . 
Mechanisms of transactivation by <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor of activated T cells-family proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT1/NFATp <END> , <START:ggp> NFATc <END> , <START:ggp> NFAT3 <END> , and <START:ggp> NFAT4/NFATx/NFATc3 <END> ) play a key role in the transcription of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> and other genes during the immune response . 
We have defined the mechanisms of transactivation by <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> possesses two <START:ggp> transactivation domains <END> whose sequences are not conserved in the other <START:ggp> NFAT-family proteins <END> , and a conserved <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> that mediates the recruitment of cooperating <START:ggp> nuclear transcription factors <END> even when it is expressed in the absence of other regions of the protein . 
The activity of the <START:ggp> NH2-terminal transactivation domain <END> is modulated by an adjacent <START:ggp> regulatory region <END> that contains several <START:ggp> conserved sequence motifs <END> represented only in the <START:ggp> NFAT family <END> . 
Our results emphasize the multiple levels at which NFAT-dependent transactivation is regulated , and predict significant differences in the architecture of cooperative <START:ggp> transcription complexes <END> containing different <START:ggp> NFAT-family proteins <END> . 
Induction of <START:ggp> activator protein ( AP ) -1 <END> and <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> by <START:ggp> CD28 <END> stimulation involves both <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> and <START:ggp> acidic sphingomyelinase <END> signals . 
A major obstacle in understanding the signaling events that follow <START:ggp> CD28 <END> receptor ligation arises from the fact that <START:ggp> CD28 <END> acts as a costimulus to <START:ggp> TCR <END> engagement , making it difficult to assess the relative contribution of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> signals as distinct from those of the <START:ggp> TCR <END> . 
To overcome this problem , we have exploited the observation that activated <START:ana> human T cell blasts <END> can be stimulated via the <START:ggp> CD28 surface molecule <END> in the absence of antigenic challenge ; thus , we have been able to observe the response of <START:ana> normal T cells <END> to <START:ggp> CD28 <END> activation in isolation . 
Using this system , we observed that <START:ggp> CD28 <END> stimulation by <START:ana> B7-transfected CHO cells <END> induced a proliferative response in <START:ana> T cells <END> that was not accompanied by measurable <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production . 
However , subsequent analysis of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> generation revealed that B7 stimulation induced both <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) complexes <END> , but not <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
In contrast , engagement of the <START:ggp> TCR <END> by <START:ggp> class II MHC/superantigen <END> , either with or without <START:ggp> CD28 <END> ligation , resulted in the induction of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> as well as <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production . 
Using selective inhibitors , we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -mediated induction of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
This revealed that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> generation was sensitive to chloroquine , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> acidic sphingomyelinase <END> , but not to the <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> inhibitor , wortmannin . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> generation was inhibited by wortmannin and was also variably sensitive to chloroquine . 
These data suggest that in activated <START:ana> normal T cells <END> , <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -derived signals can stimulate proliferation at least in part via NF-kappaB and AP-1 generation , and that this response uses both <START:ggp> acidic sphingomyelinase <END> and <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> -linked pathways . 
Presence of a variant form of the <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> from normal individuals and lupus patients . 
Estrogen may participate in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) via its <START:ggp> intracellular receptor <END> . 
To investigate the presence of various isoforms of the <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) in SLE we isolated RNA from <START:ana> mononuclear cells <END> of lupus patients and normal controls . 
Using RT-PCR we were able to identify both the <START:ggp> full length wild-type form <END> and an isoform of the <START:ggp> ER <END> which precisely lacks <START:ggp> exon V <END> in both patient and normal individuals . 
Our results , although limited , suggest that normal individuals can express both the wild-type and truncated version at the same time , whereas lupus patients only express either the <START:ggp> wild-type or the truncated ER <END> . 
This finding may lead to a better understanding of the reasons for the prevalence of lupus in females and of the estrogenic effects on SLE disease activity . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> sialoadhesin <END> expression on <START:ana> rat macrophages <END> . 
Induction by glucocorticoids and enhancement by <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> , <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , and lipopolysaccharide . 
<START:ggp> Sialoadhesin <END> is a <START:ggp> macrophage-restricted member <END> of the <START:ggp> Ig superfamily <END> that mediates adhesion with <START:ana> lymphoid and myeloid cells <END> . 
It is expressed on a subpopulation of <START:ana> macrophages <END> in lymphoid tissues and in chronic inflammation ( e.g. , during autoimmune diseases ) . 
We have studied the regulation of <START:ggp> sialoadhesin <END> expression in vitro and show that glucocorticoids ( GC ) induce <START:ggp> sialoadhesin <END> expression on freshly isolated <START:ana> rat macrophages <END> and the <START:ana> rat macrophage cell line R2 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> cytokines <END> <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> , <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , and LPS , although unable to induce <START:ggp> sialoadhesin <END> expression by themselves , were able to enhance GC-mediated induction of <START:ggp> sialoadhesin <END> . 
<START:ggp> Sialoadhesin <END> expression was functional as shown by cell adhesion assays with <START:ana> human RBCs <END> . 
Northern blotting experiments indicated that regulation predominantly occurred at the mRNA level . 
Comparison of the different combinations of GC and <START:ggp> cytokines <END> /LPS revealed differences in the level of GC-dependent enhancement of <START:ggp> sialoadhesin <END> expression , with <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> being more potent than <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and LPS . 
Moreover , the effects of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and LPS could be reproduced by priming , whereas <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> were required simultaneously with GC . 
The regulation of <START:ggp> sialoadhesin <END> expression was mediated by the <START:ggp> GC receptor <END> , and not by <START:ggp> mineralocorticoid receptor <END> , as shown by inhibition experiments with specific antagonists . 
Finally , it is demonstrated that <START:ana> macrophages <END> in the adrenal gland , the major site of endogenous GC production , express <START:ggp> sialoadhesin <END> . 
This study demonstrates that GC act as a primary inducer of <START:ggp> sialoadhesin <END> expression on <START:ana> rat macrophages <END> , and that the response can be enhanced by <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> , <START:ggp> T cell-derived cytokines <END> , or LPS . 
Apoptosis mediated by <START:ggp> HIV protease <END> is preceded by cleavage of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV ) protease <END> in <START:ana> cultured cells <END> leads to apoptosis , preceded by cleavage of <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> , a key negative regulator of cell death . 
In contrast , a high level of <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> protects cells in vitro and in vivo from the <START:ggp> viral protease <END> and prevents cell death following HIV infection of <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> , while reducing the yields of <START:ggp> viral structural proteins <END> , infectivity , and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> . 
We present a model for HIV replication in which the <START:ggp> viral protease <END> depletes the infected cells of <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> , leading to oxidative stress-dependent activation of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> , a <START:ggp> cellular factor <END> required for HIV transcription , and ultimately to cell death . 
Purified <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> is cleaved by <START:ggp> HIV protease <END> between phenylalanine 112 and alanine 113 . 
The results suggest a new option for HIV gene therapy ; <START:ggp> bcl-2 muteins <END> that have <START:ggp> noncleavable alterations <END> surrounding the <START:ggp> HIV protease cleavage site <END> . 
<START:ggp> Alpha 4 beta 1 ( CD49d/CD29 ) integrin <END> costimulation of <START:ana> human T cells <END> enhances <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> and cytokine induction in the absence of altered sensitivity to <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> stimulation . 
The <START:ggp> integrin alpha 4 beta 1 <END> can provide a costimulus to induce <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion and <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> expression leading to enhanced proliferation of purified , <START:ana> peripheral blood T cells <END> . 
Similar to expression of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , we demonstrated that <START:ggp> recombinant vascular-cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> , when co-immobilized with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 mAb <END> , significantly enhanced the induction of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> as determined by electromobility shift assays . 
<START:ggp> alpha 4 beta 1 <END> ligation alone had no effect on <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> binding . 
The requirements for induction of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> reflected the requirements for the secretion of multiple <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , including <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , and <START:ggp> granulocyte macrophage-CSF <END> . 
In contrast to <START:ana> freshly isolated T cells <END> , in <START:ana> vitro-cultured T cells <END> did not require costimulation for <START:ggp> cytokine <END> secretion in response to <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> alone . 
Comparison of the dose response to <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> stimulation demonstrated that half-maximal induction of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> was achieved using the same dose of <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> for both <START:ana> freshly isolated <END> and <START:ana> cultured T cells <END> . 
Furthermore , the dose of <START:ggp> OKT3 <END> required to achieve half-maximal activation was the same using PMA or different concentrations of <START:ggp> alpha 4 beta 1 <END> ligands . 
Therefore , costimulation by <START:ggp> alpha 4 beta 1 <END> ligands was not due to stabilization of the interaction of the cells with its substrate . 
We conclude , rather , that <START:ggp> alpha 4 beta 1 <END> in <START:ana> freshly isolated T cells <END> delivers a distinct signal that synergizes early with signals initiated by <START:ggp> TCR/CD3 <END> ligation to induce DNA binding of multiple <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> required for <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> induction . 
Inhibition of <START:ana> T lymphocyte <END> activation by cAMP is associated with down-regulation of two parallel mitogen-activated <START:ggp> protein kinase <END> pathways , the <START:ggp> extracellular signal-related kinase <END> and <START:ggp> c-Jun N-terminal kinase <END> . 
The induction of T cell proliferation requires signals from the <START:ggp> TCR <END> and a <START:ggp> co-receptor molecule <END> , such as <START:ggp> CD28 <END> , that activate parallel and partially cross-reactive signaling pathways . 
These pathways are disrupted by agonists that utilize <START:ggp> adenylate cyclase <END> and <START:ggp> cAMP-dependent protein kinase A <END> ( <START:ggp> PKA <END> ) . 
We found that the <START:ggp> adenylate cyclase <END> activator , forskolin , inhibits <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> -induced shift in <START:ggp> Lck <END> electrophoretic mobility , suggesting an intervention at the <START:ggp> TCR <END> -coupled phosphoinositide turnover that precedes the activation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> . 
The shift of <START:ggp> Lck <END> following direct <START:ggp> PKC <END> activation by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate , which bypasses early receptor-triggered biochemical events , is insensitive to forskolin . 
Nevertheless , forskolin also inhibits <START:ggp> PKC <END> downstream events , such as <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression , which is critical for the activation process of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
To further analyze potential cross points between positively and negatively regulating signaling pathways in <START:ana> T cells <END> , we tested the effects of activators of the <START:ggp> adenylate cyclase <END> or <START:ggp> PKA <END> on two parallel mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways mediated by <START:ggp> extracellular signal-regulated kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> ERK <END> ) and <START:ggp> c-Jun N-terminal kinase <END> . 
Using a <START:ggp> PKC <END> -specific inhibitor , GF109203X , or <START:ana> PKC-depleted T cells <END> , we found that a large part of the <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> -induced <START:ggp> ERK <END> activation is <START:ggp> PKC <END> dependent . 
Both PKC- dependent and -independent activation of <START:ggp> ERK <END> were sensitive to inhibition by forskolin or a cell-permeable cAMP analogue , dbcAMP . 
Furthermore , the effect of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate and ionomycin , which synergized to fully activate <START:ggp> c-Jun N-terminal kinase <END> , was also sensitive to inhibition by forskolin . 
Our results suggest that <START:ggp> PKA <END> inhibits T cell activation by interfering with multiple events along the two signaling pathways operating downstream of the <START:ggp> TCR <END> and the <START:ggp> CD28 co-receptor molecules <END> . 
Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of <START:ggp> erythroid gene <END> expression in anthracycline-induced differentiation of <START:ana> human erythroleukemic cells <END> . 
Aclacinomycin ( ACLA ) and doxorubicin ( DOX ) were used at subtoxic concentrations to induce erythroid differentiation in the <START:ana> human leukemic cell line K562 <END> . 
Cell hemoglobinization was accompanied by the increased expression of <START:ggp> genes <END> encoding <START:ggp> gamma-globin and porphobilinogen deaminase <END> ( <START:ggp> PBGD <END> ) , an enzyme of heme synthesis . 
By using run-on assays , ACLA was shown to induce an enhancement of the transcription of <START:ggp> erythroid genes <END> , including <START:ggp> gamma-globin <END> , <START:ggp> PBGD <END> , <START:ggp> erythropoietin receptor <END> , and <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
In contrast , in <START:ana> DOX-treated cells <END> , the transcription rate of these <START:ggp> genes <END> was unchanged in comparison with <START:ana> control cells <END> . 
In addition , inhibition of <START:ana> mRNA <END> synthesis with actinomycin D indicated that DOX induced an increased stability of <START:ana> PBGD and GATA-1 mRNAs <END> , whereas ACLA did not affect the half-lives of these <START:ana> mRNAs <END> . 
Because the increase in <START:ana> erythroid mRNA <END> steady-state level in <START:ana> anthracycline-treated cells <END> was inhibited by cycloheximide , this suggests that transcriptional activation in <START:ana> ACLA-treated cells <END> and mRNA stabilization in <START:ana> DOX-treated cells <END> were dependent on de novo protein synthesis . 
Finally , <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> protein level was shown to be increased in <START:ana> ACLA-treated but not in DOX-treated cells <END> . 
These two anthracyclines , although closely related in their structures , appeared to act as differentiation inducers by distinct mechanisms . 
Indeed , <START:ggp> erythroid gene <END> expression was demonstrated to be regulated transcriptionally by ACLA and mainly posttranscriptionally by DOX . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-7 <END> signaling in <START:ana> human B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells <END> and <START:ana> murine BAF3 cells <END> involves activation of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> mediated via the <START:ggp> interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-7 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> ) stimulates the proliferation of <START:ana> normal and leukemic B and T cell precursors and T lymphocytes <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> /STAT <END> pathway has been implicated in <START:ggp> IL-7R <END> signaling . 
We investigated which <START:ggp> STAT complexes <END> are formed upon stimulation of <START:ana> B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( BCP-ALL ) cells <END> with <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> . 
Gel retardation assays with STAT-binding oligonucleotides showed that <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> induces the formation of two major <START:ggp> STAT complexes <END> in <START:ana> BCP-ALL cells <END> . 
Supershifts with anti-STAT antibodies identified these as <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 complexes <END> . 
This pattern of <START:ggp> STAT <END> activation was seen in all BCP-ALL cases that respond to <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> in proliferation assays . 
<START:ggp> IL-7 <END> also induced <START:ggp> STAT <END> /DNA binding in BCP-ALL cases that failed to proliferate in response to <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> , suggesting that the ability of <START:ggp> IL-7R <END> to activate the <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> /STAT <END> pathway per se is not sufficient for proliferation induction . 
To determine the contribution of the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-7 receptor alpha chain <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-7R alpha <END> ) to activation of <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> , transfectants of the <START:ana> murine pro-B cell line BAF3 <END> were made that express <START:ggp> chimeric receptors <END> consisting of the <START:ggp> extracellular domain <END> of <START:ggp> human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> G-CSF-R <END> ) and the <START:ggp> transmembrane and intracellular domains <END> of <START:ggp> human IL-7R alpha <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> chimeric G-CSF-R/IL-7R alpha <END> with <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> resulted in a full proliferative response and induced the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> but not <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> . 
Major <START:ggp> STAT complexes <END> activated by <START:ggp> G-CSF-R/IL-7R alpha <END> contained <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> or <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> , while some formation of <START:ggp> STAT3-containing complexes <END> was also seen . 
These findings establish that <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> , and possibly <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> , are activated upon stimulation of <START:ana> precursor B cells <END> with <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> . 
The data further indicate that the <START:ggp> IL-7R alpha chains <END> are directly involved in the activation of <START:ggp> JAKs <END> and <START:ggp> STATs <END> and have a major role in proliferative signaling in <START:ana> precursor B cells <END> . 
Stimulation of human lymphocyte proliferation and <START:ggp> CD40 <END> antigen expression by phosphorothioate oligonucleotides complementary to <START:ggp> hepatitis B virus genome <END> . 
We have studied the proliferation and <START:ggp> CD40 <END> antigen expression of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , and the cytotoxicity to <START:ana> monocytes <END> , of antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the <START:ggp> SP II promoter <END> of <START:ana> HBV mRNA <END> ( sequence I ) and the <START:ggp> X gene <END> ( sequence II ) in patients with chronic hepatitis B . 
The oligo sequence I stimulated proliferation of both <START:ana> T and , to a lesser extent , B cells <END> . 
The percentage of cells expressing <START:ggp> CD40 <END> in <START:ana> T and B cell co-cultures <END> increased from 4.2 % to 13.8 % after oligo stimulation in patients , while it increased form 4.7 % to 48.6 % in healthy controls . 
The sense sequence ( sequence III ) of the <START:ggp> X gene <END> also enhanced the expression of <START:ggp> CD40 antigen <END> in patients with hepatitis B . 
The proportion of <START:ana> CD40 cells <END> ( 26 % ) in a <START:ana> resting B-cell preparation <END> from hepatitis B patients decreased to zero after a 5-day culture with sequence I , but IgG levels in the culture supernatant increased . 
The cytotoxic properties of <START:ana> monocytes <END> were not influenced by the oligos . 
These findings indicate that antisense oligos against hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) have mitogenic effects on the proliferation of <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> in a non-specific manner and may activate <START:ana> T cells <END> to express <START:ggp> CD40 antigen <END> . 
<START:ggp> Activation protein 1 <END> -dependent transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> interleukin 2 gene <END> by <START:ggp> Ca2+/calmodulin kinase type IV/Gr <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) type IV/Gr <END> is selectively expressed in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> and is activated after signaling via the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) , indicating that it mediates some of the Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent transcriptional events that follow <START:ggp> TCR <END> engagement . 
Here we show that <START:ggp> CaMKIV/Gr <END> induces the <START:ggp> transcription factor activation protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) alone or in synergy with <START:ggp> T cell mitogens <END> and with the <START:ggp> p21ras oncoprotein <END> . 
<START:ggp> CaMKIV/ Gr <END> signaling is associated with transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> but is independent of <START:ggp> p21ras <END> or <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
<START:ggp> AP-1 <END> is an integral component of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) transcriptional complex <END> , which is required for <START:ggp> interleukin 2 gene <END> expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
We demonstrate that <START:ggp> CaMKIV/Gr <END> reconstitutes the capacity of the cytosolic component of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> to direct transcription from <START:ggp> NFAT sites <END> in non- <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
These results reveal a central role for <START:ggp> CaMKIV/Gr <END> as a Ca ( 2+ ) -regulated activator of gene transcription in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-12 <END> -induced activation of <START:ana> NK and T cells <END> occurs in the absence of <START:ggp> immediate-early activation gene <END> expression . 
The responses of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , involving proliferation , differentiation , and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production , are only partially overlapping , and may depend on induced differential expression of specific sets of <START:ggp> genes <END> . 
Using reverse-transcription PCR differential display , we isolated an <START:ana> mRNA species <END> expressed in <START:ana> IL-2 -but not IL-12-stimulated NK cells <END> . 
This was identified as the <START:ana> mRNA <END> encoding the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> egr-1 <END> , which is expressed with fast kinetics in <START:ana> T and NK cells <END> upon <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , but not <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , stimulation . 
Analysis of the accumulation of <START:ggp> mRNA-encoding members <END> of the <START:ggp> AP-1 transcription factor family <END> demonstrated that <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> junB <END> are also expressed upon stimulation of <START:ana> NK and T cells <END> with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , but not <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , whereas expression of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and <START:ggp> junD <END> is not modified by either <START:ggp> cytokine <END> . 
Accordingly , increased <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> DNA-binding activity and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -dependent transcriptional activity were detected exclusively in <START:ana> IL-2-stimulated cells <END> . 
Analysis of the expression of <START:ggp> genes <END> reported to regulate <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -induced proliferation demonstrated that both <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> induce <START:ana> c-myc mRNA <END> accumulation in <START:ana> NK and T cells <END> , whereas only <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induces <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression . 
Our data provide the first demonstration that <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> -mediated activation of <START:ana> T and NK cells <END> does not involve expression of members of the <START:ggp> immediate-early activation genes family <END> ( <START:ggp> egr-1 <END> , <START:ggp> c-fos <END> , and <START:ggp> junB <END> ) , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> transcriptional activity , or <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression . 
This indicates that functional differences observed in <START:ana> IL-2- and IL-12-stimulated cells <END> may depend , at least in part , on differential gene regulation . 
Active suppression of the <START:ggp> class II transactivator-encoding AIR-1 locus <END> is responsible for the lack of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex class II gene <END> expression observed during differentiation from <START:ana> B cells <END> to <START:ana> plasma cells <END> . 
In this study the genetic control of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II gene <END> expression during the transition from <START:ana> B cell <END> to <START:ana> plasma cell <END> has been analyzed . 
<START:ggp> Class II molecules <END> are not expressed in <START:ana> plasma cells <END> because of an active suppression resulting in the abrogation of <START:ggp> class II gene <END> transcription . 
We show here that the plasma cell-specific repressor function , designated <START:ggp> SIR <END> ( <START:ggp> suppressor of immune response genes <END> ) , does not act directly on the transcription of <START:ggp> class II genes <END> , but instead on the transcription of the <START:ggp> AIR-1 gene <END> , whose product , the <START:ggp> class II transactivator <END> ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) , is fundamental for the regulation of the constitutive and inducible expression of <START:ggp> MHC class II genes <END> . 
This was unambiguously demonstrated by the fact that <START:ana> plasmacytoma x B cell hybrids <END> carrying an <START:ggp> AIR-1 locus <END> derived from <START:ana> CIITA-expressing cells <END> do not express <START:ana> CIITA-specific transcripts <END> . 
Transfection of a cDNA containing the <START:ggp> human CIITA coding sequence <END> under the control of an <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> restores expression of <START:ggp> human MHC class II genes <END> in the hybrids and is responsible for de novo expression of <START:ggp> mouse MHC class II genes <END> in both the <START:ana> mouse plasmacytoma cell line <END> and the <START:ana> hybrids <END> . 
These results confirm and extend the notion of the functional conservation of the <START:ggp> AIR-1 gene product <END> across species barriers . 
Interestingly , in <START:ana> CIITA-transfected cell hybrids <END> , cell surface expression of the <START:ggp> human HLA-DQ heterodimer <END> was not observed . 
This result was not attributable to lack of HLA-DQ alpha or -DQ beta transcription , because both transcripts were present in the <START:ana> CIITA-transfected hybrids <END> , although at reduced levels . 
These findings further support our previous observations on the distinct regulation of expression of the <START:ggp> human HLA-DQ class II subset <END> , which may be thus controlled at the posttranscriptional level by a <START:ggp> CIITA <END> -independent mechanism . 
Requirements for induction of vitamin D-mediated gene regulation in <START:ana> normal human B lymphocytes <END> . 
Mature <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> are unique targets of 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) in that <START:ggp> vitamin D receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) are not constitutively expressed , and specific cellular activation signals are required for both the up-regulation of <START:ggp> VDR <END> and establishment of reactivity to the lipophilic ligand . 
Treatment of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> with the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) , in the absence of prior activation , induces a weak up-regulation of <START:ggp> VDR <END> expression but fails to generate <START:ggp> vitamin D-responsive element ( VDRE ) -reactive nuclear protein complexes <END> or to initiate the genomic transcription of <START:ggp> 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> by either ligation of <START:ggp> CD40 Ag <END> or cross-linking the <START:ggp> Ig receptor <END> is also insufficient to render <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> responsive to 1 alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . 
However , this apparent lack of response to the secosterol can be overcome by stimulation of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> with a combination of these cellular activation signals , which are sufficient to lead to G1 cell cycle progression . 
In the presence of 1 alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 , cellular activation associated with stimulation of such a progression appears to be sufficient for the up-regulation of <START:ggp> VDR <END> message and protein and necessary for the establishment of <START:ggp> VDRE binding complexes <END> and the induction of <START:ggp> 24-hydroxylase <END> message . 
Furthermore , biologic functions are modulated , in that the hormone inhibits proliferation in a subset of the activated <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
These observations suggest that reactivity to 1 alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 is tightly regulated in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> , requiring specific signals for its initiation . 
Cross talk between cell death and cell cycle progression : <START:ggp> BCL-2 <END> regulates <START:ggp> NFAT <END> -mediated activation . 
<START:ana> BCL-2-deficient T cells <END> demonstrate accelerated cell cycle progression and increased apoptosis following activation . 
Increasing the levels of <START:ggp> BCL-2 <END> retarded the G0 -- > S transition , sustained the levels of <START:ggp> cyclin-dependent kinase <END> inhibitor p27Kip1 , and repressed postactivation death . 
Proximal signal transduction events and <START:ggp> immediate early gene <END> transcription were unaffected . 
However , the transcription and synthesis of <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> and other delayed early <START:ggp> cytokines <END> were markedly attenuated by <START:ggp> BCL-2 <END> . 
In contrast , a cysteine protease inhibitor that also blocks apoptosis had no substantial affect upon <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production . 
<START:ggp> InterleUkin 2 <END> expression requires several <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> of which nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ( <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ) and <START:ggp> NFAT <END> -mediated transactivation were impaired by <START:ggp> BCL-2 <END> . 
Thus , select genetic aberrations in the apoptotic pathway reveal a cell autonomous coregulation of activation . 
Interaction of the <START:ggp> human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 tax transactivator <END> with <START:ggp> transcription factor IIA <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Tax protein <END> of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is a <START:ggp> 40-kDa transcriptional activator <END> which is critical for HTLV-1 gene regulation and virus-induced cellular transformation . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> is localized to the DNA through its interaction with the <START:ggp> site-specific activators <END> <START:ggp> cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , and <START:ggp> serum response factor <END> . 
It has been suggested that the recruitment of <START:ggp> Tax <END> to the DNA positions <START:ggp> Tax <END> for interaction with the basal transcriptional machinery . 
On the basis of several independent assays , we now report a physical and functional interaction between <START:ggp> Tax <END> and the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> TFIIA <END> . 
First , <START:ggp> Tax <END> was found to interact with the <START:ggp> 35-kDa ( alpha ) subunit <END> of <START:ggp> TFIIA <END> in the yeast two-hybrid interaction system . 
Importantly , two previously characterized <START:ggp> mutants <END> with point mutations in <START:ggp> Tax <END> , <START:ggp> M32 <END> ( Y196A , K197S ) and <START:ggp> M41 <END> ( H287A , P288S ) , which were shown to be defective in <START:ggp> Tax <END> -activated transcription were unable to interact with <START:ggp> TFIIA <END> in this assay . 
Second , a glutathione-S-transferase ( <START:ggp> GST <END> ) affinity-binding assay showed that the interaction of holo- <START:ggp> TFIIA <END> with <START:ggp> GST-Tax <END> was 20-fold higher than that observed with either the <START:ggp> GST-Tax M32 activation mutant <END> or the GST control . 
Third , a coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that in <START:ana> HTLV-1-infected human T lymphocytes <END> , <START:ggp> Tax <END> and <START:ggp> TFIIA <END> were associated . 
Finally , <START:ggp> TFIIA <END> facilitates <START:ggp> Tax <END> transactivation in vitro and in vivo . 
In vitro transcription studies showed reduced levels of <START:ggp> Tax <END> -activated transcription in cell extracts depleted of <START:ggp> TFIIA <END> . 
In addition , transfection of <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> with <START:ggp> TFIIA expression vectors <END> enhanced <START:ggp> Tax <END> -activated transcription of an <START:ggp> HTLV-1 long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct <END> . 
Our study suggests that the interaction of <START:ggp> Tax <END> with the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> TFIIA <END> may play a role in <START:ggp> Tax <END> -mediated transcriptional activation . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> activity in <START:ana> mononuclear cell cultures <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> by the cyclic AMP signaling pathway . 
Activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> results in a cascade of gene activation and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into effector phenotypes . 
The regulation of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> belonging to the <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) family <END> was analyzed in <START:ana> PHA-activated mononuclear cells <END> and in <START:ana> purified T cells <END> activated by cross-linking <START:ggp> cell surface CD3 <END> . 
Cell activation resulted in a delayed induction of <START:ggp> STAT <END> DNA-binding activity , which was sustained for several days , was composed predominantly of <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> , and was blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D . 
Increased Stat1 and Stat3 mRNA and protein levels were detected , respectively 4 and 24 h after activation . 
Stimulation of the cAMP signal transduction pathway , which skews <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production toward a Th2 pattern , resulted in the preferential suppression of <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> activity . 
cAMP inhibited the induction of expression of <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor components <END> , but did not inhibit <START:ggp> IL-4 receptor alpha-chain <END> and <START:ggp> CD69 <END> expression or the induction of <START:ggp> activator protein 1 transcription factors <END> . 
cAMP signaling inhibited <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> at several different levels , including suppression of DNA binding and down-regulation of Stat1 protein and mRNA levels . 
Our results demonstrate the regulation of <START:ggp> STAT <END> activity by a signaling pathway that regulates the T cell functional phenotype and is distinct from the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -activated <START:ggp> Janus kinase <END> <START:ggp> -STAT <END> signaling pathway . 
Suppression of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> by antisense oligonucleotides inhibits cell adhesion but not respiratory burst during phorbol ester-induced differentiation of <START:ana> U937 human monoblastic cells <END> . 
We studied the role of the <START:ggp> immediate early gene <END> <START:ggp> c-jun <END> in cell proliferation and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -induced differentiation in <START:ana> U937 human monoblastic cells <END> , using <START:ggp> c-jun <END> -specific antisense ( AS ) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides . 
In selecting the most specific and potent oligonucleotide sequence , we performed extensive analyses for the binding specificity between all candidates of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> AS oligonucleotides and the whole sequences in GenBank database , using a computer program . 
Among the 20 selected oligonucleotides , two potent 15-mer AS oligonucleotides ( C-JUN AS oligonucleotides ) exhibited significant inhibition of cell growth in a dose-dependent manner between 2 and 10 microM . 
Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that 10 microM of C-JUN AS oligonucleotides reduced <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression at both the <START:ana> mRNA <END> and protein levels . 
More importantly , C-JUN AS oligonucleotides showed distinct effects on two markers of PMA-induced differentiation ; the C-JUN AS oligonucleotides inhibited cell adhesion , whereas they did not affect another marker of differentiation , respiratory burst ( measured by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay ) . 
These results suggest a critical role of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> in both cell proliferation and PMA-induced cell adhesion but not in PMA-induced respiratory burst in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
Effects of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> on LPS-induced <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) which are involved in <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> regulation . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-10 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ) , like <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , is known to inhibit <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression in <START:ana> activated human monocytes <END> . 
We showed that both <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> inhibit <START:ana> LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA <END> and protein expression by inhibiting the transcription rate of the <START:ggp> IL-6 gene <END> . 
The strong inhibition of the <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> transcription rate prompted us to study the effect of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> on the expression of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
We questioned whether or not <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> affected the expression of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that are known to be involved in the control of the <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> transcription rate , namely activator protein-1 ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) , <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> ) , and <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) . 
In electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) we showed that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> inhibited LPS-induced <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding activity . 
The inhibiting effect of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> was slightly more pronounced than that of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> . 
Downregulation of <START:ggp> LPS-induced AP-1 <END> was accompanied , and thus possibly explained , by a reduced expression at <START:ana> mRNA <END> level of the two major components of the <START:ggp> AP-1 complex <END> , namely <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> as determined by Northern experiments . 
Binding activity of <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> was also strongly inhibited by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> whereas <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> showed no effect . 
<START:ana> NF-IL6 mRNA <END> levels were not affected by <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , suggesting that <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> affects binding activity of preexisting <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> . 
Neither <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> nor <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> inhibited LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity . 
In agreement with this finding , Northern experiments where p65 and p105 mRNA levels were determined , demonstrated that expression of these components of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> transcription factor were not affected by <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> . 
Furthermore , neither <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> nor <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> showed any effect on <START:ana> I-kappa B mRNA <END> expression as determined by Northern experiments . 
Thus , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> similarly affect <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> expression . 
However , for <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> this was accompanied with a reduction of AP-1 and NF-IL6 binding activity whereas <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> only inhibited <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding activity . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> transcription by <START:ggp> core-binding factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> activation in <START:ana> T cells <END> is known to involve the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , and Sp1 . 
Here we demonstrate that the <START:ggp> human GM-CSF promoter and enhancer <END> also encompass binding sites for <START:ggp> core-binding factor <END> ( <START:ggp> CBF <END> ) . 
Significantly , the <START:ggp> CBF sites <END> are in each case contained within the minimum <START:ggp> essential core regions <END> required for inducible activation of transcription . 
Furthermore , these core regions of the enhancer and promoter each encompass <START:ggp> closely linked binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> CBF <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> NFATp <END> . 
The <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter CBF site <END> TGTGGTCA is located <START:ggp> 51 bp upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> and also overlaps a <START:ggp> YY-1 binding site <END> . 
A <START:ggp> 2-bp mutation <END> within the <START:ggp> CBF <END> site resulted in a 2-3-fold decrease in the activities of both a <START:ggp> 69-bp proximal promoter fragment <END> and a <START:ggp> 627-bp full-length promoter fragment <END> . 
Stepwise deletions into the <START:ggp> proximal promoter <END> also revealed that the <START:ggp> CBF <END> site , but not the <START:ggp> YY-1 site <END> , was required for efficient induction of transcriptional activation . 
The <START:ggp> AML1 and CBF beta genes <END> that encode <START:ggp> CBF <END> each have the ability to influence cell growth and differentiation and have been implicated as <START:ggp> proto-oncogenes <END> in acute myeloid leukemia . 
This study adds <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> to a growing list of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and receptors that are regulated by <START:ggp> CBF <END> and which control the growth , differentiation , and activation of <START:ana> hemopoietic cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> GM-CSF locus <END> may represent one of several target <START:ggp> genes <END> that are dysregulated in acute myeloid leukemia . 
Sublethal levels of oxidative stress stimulate transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and suppress <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activation in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
Sublethal levels of oxidative stress are well known to alter T cell functional responses , but the underlying mechanisms are unknown . 
The current study examined the effects of oxidative stress on transcriptional activities mediated by <START:ggp> c-Fos/c-Jun <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) . 
The present results show that <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> acutely exposed to micromolar concentrations of H2O2 exhibit substantial increases in <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding activity and the expression of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> but not <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> . 
The preferential induction of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> by H2O2 did not represent redox stabilization of <START:ana> mRNA transcripts <END> , and oxidative signals closely resembled PHA/PMA stimulation by effectively transactivating the full length <START:ggp> c-jun <END> promoter via the <START:ggp> proximal jun1 tumor promoter-responsive element ( TRE ) -like promoter element <END> . 
Similarly , the complexes binding the <START:ggp> consensus AP-1 TRE <END> and <START:ggp> jun TRE-like motifs <END> in cells exposed to oxidative signals or PHA/PMA were indistinguishable , being composed of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> , and <START:ggp> JunD <END> . 
However , PHA/PMA but not oxidative signals induced the coordinate activation of <START:ggp> reporter constructs <END> containing the <START:ggp> AP-1-TRE , NF-AT , and IL-2 promoter regions <END> along with <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> expression . 
Furthermore , sublethal levels of H2O2 actively suppressed the transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 reporters <END> as well as the expression of <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> in cells stimulated with PHA/PMA . 
Gel shift analysis revealed that oxidative suppression of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> represented inhibition in the early generation of <START:ggp> NFAT complexes <END> rather than the binding of preformed <START:ggp> NF-AT complexes <END> . 
These results suggest that oxidative signals can positively and negatively regulate <START:ana> T cell <END> transcriptional events and that changes in cellular redox can uncouple <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> regulation of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> from transcriptional up-regulation of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> via <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
Inorganic lead activates <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes <END> . 
Inorganic lead ( Pb ) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that produces a variety of effects on humoral and cell mediated immune responses . 
The underlying molecular mechanism for Pb 's complex effects on the immune system remain obscure . 
Many of Pb 's effects on the immune system could be explained through activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is critical for T lymphocyte function and is a strong inducer of <START:ggp> HIV-LTR <END> activation . 
We demonstrate that Pb at physiologically relevant concentrations activates <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes <END> . 
Pb-induced activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is blocked by <START:ggp> antibodies <END> for <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> p50 <END> subunits but not <START:ggp> cRel <END> , indicating that the <START:ggp> p65 : p50 heterodimer <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) is involved . 
Functional activation of gene expression by Pb was confirmed using <START:ana> primary CD4+ T cells <END> transfected with an <START:ggp> NF-kappa B dependent reporter gene construct <END> . 
Pb did not activate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in 4 different <START:ana> T cell lines <END> , suggesting that lymphoid cell lines may not be reliable surrogates for the study of transcriptional activation in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> may be an important molecular mediator of Pb-induced immunotoxicity . 
<START:ggp> Tyrosine kinase <END> and <START:ggp> cAMP-dependent protein kinase <END> activities in <START:ana> CD40-activated human B lymphocytes <END> . 
In vitro , <START:ana> human B lymphocytes <END> undergo long-term proliferation when activated through <START:ggp> CD40 <END> , a protein expressed on their cell surface . 
The nature of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -dependent signals in proliferating fresh <START:ana> human Epstein-Barr virus-negative B lymphocytes <END> is currently unknown . 
In this study , a <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -dependent B cell culture system was used to examine the role of different <START:ggp> signal transduction elements <END> . 
Protein kinase C ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) depletion generated by a long-term phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate treatment had weak effects on proliferation . 
Rather , tyrosine phosphorylation was shown to be directly involved in mediating <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -dependent signals . 
The use of the <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PTK <END> ) -specific inhibitor herbimycin A dramatically decreased cellular proliferation without altering the activity of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus-1 long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> ) , a <START:ggp> promoter <END> largely dependent on the binding of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF- kappa B <END> ) . 
In contrast , the <START:ggp> cAMP-dependent protein kinase <END> specific inhibitor H-89 totally inhibited <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> activity at a concentration as low as 100 nM without affecting cellular proliferation . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) and supershift assay using an <START:ggp> NF-kappa B binding sequence <END> from the <START:ggp> kappa light chain <END> as a probe , revealed that both <START:ggp> p65 <END> ( <START:ggp> RelA <END> ) and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> were present in <START:ana> CD40-stimulated B cells <END> . 
While <START:ggp> PKC <END> depletion did not alter the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> level , treatment of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> with H-89 or herbimycin A provoked a decrease in the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> level . 
These observations establish the importance of different signal transducing pathways leading to <START:ggp> CD40 <END> activation of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interferons <END> induce normal and aberrant <START:ggp> retinoic-acid receptors type alpha <END> in <START:ana> acute promyelocytic leukemia cells <END> : potentiation of the induction of retinoid-dependent <START:ggp> differentiation markers <END> . 
Treatment of the <START:ana> acute promyelocytic ( APL ) cell line <END> <START:ana> NB4 <END> with <START:ggp> interferon alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN ( alpha ) <END> ) , as well as <START:ggp> IFN ( beta ) and gamma <END> , results in an increased expression of the transcripts coding for <START:ggp> retinoic-acid receptor type alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR ( alpha ) <END> ) and the <START:ggp> leukemia-specific retinoic acid receptor <END> <START:ggp> PML-RAR <END> . 
Transcriptional induction of the <START:ana> RAR ( alpha ) and PML-RAR mRNAs <END> is rapid and it is parallelled by an increase in the corresponding proteins . 
Up-regulation of <START:ggp> RAR ( alpha ) <END> and <START:ggp> PML-RAR <END> gene expression by <START:ggp> IFN ( alpha ) <END> is accompanied by a strong potentiation in the induction of 2 <START:ggp> retinoid-dependent granulocytic markers <END> , i.e. , <START:ana> granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor receptor mRNA <END> and <START:ggp> leukocyte alkaline phosphatase <END> . 
However , <START:ggp> IFN ( alpha ) <END> does not have any effects on the retinoid-dependent regulation of the <START:ggp> myeloid surface markers <END> <START:ggp> CD11b <END> and <START:ggp> CD33 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> IFN <END> -dependent increase in <START:ggp> RAR ( alpha ) <END> levels and the enhancing effect of the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> on <START:ggp> retinoid-dependent granulocytic markers <END> expression may be a characteristic of <START:ana> PML-RAR positive cells <END> , since the phenomena are not observed in <START:ana> HL-60 promyelocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interferons <END> as well as retinoids inhibit the growth of <START:ana> NB4 cells <END> , although the 2 classes of compounds do not significantly interact in terms of anti-proliferative activity . 
These results suggest the possible use of combinations between <START:ggp> IFNs <END> and retinoic acid in the cyto-differentiating treatment of APL patients . 
Modulatory effects of glucocorticoids and catecholamines on human <START:ggp> interleukin <END> -12 and <START:ggp> interleukin <END> -10 production : clinical implications . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-12 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> ) is a key inducer of differentiation of <START:ana> uncommitted T helper ( TH ) cells <END> toward the TH1 phenotype , which regulates cellular immunity , whereas <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibits TH1 functions and potentiates TH2-regulated responses ( i.e. , humoral immunity ) . 
To examine the potential effects of stress on TH1/TH2 balance , we studied the ability of three prototype stress hormones-dexamethasone ( a synthetic glucocorticoid ) and the catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine-to alter the production of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> ( <START:ggp> p70 <END> ) and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) in human whole blood . 
Dexamethasone inhibited LPS-induced bioactive <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> production in a dose-dependent fashion and at physiologically relevant concentrations ; it had no effect on <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> secretion . 
The glucocorticoid-induced reduction of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> production was antagonized by RU 486 , a glucocorticoid-receptor antagonist , suggesting that it was mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor . 
Norepinephrine and epinephrine also suppressed <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> production in a dose-dependent fashion and at physiological concentrations ; both catecholamines , however , dose-dependently increased the production of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> . 
The effects of either catecholamine on <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> secretion were blocked completely by propranolol , a beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist , indicating that they were mediated by the <START:ggp> beta-adrenergic receptor <END> . 
These findings suggest that the central nervous system may regulate IL-12 and IL-10 secretion and , hence , TH1/TH2 balance via the peripheral end-effectors of the stress system . 
Thus , stress may cause a selective suppression of TH1 functions and a shift toward a <START:ggp> TH2 cytokine <END> pattern rather than generalized TH suppression . 
The TH1-to-TH2 shift may be responsible for the stress-induced susceptibility of the organism to certain infections . 
Through the same or a reciprocal mechanism , states associated with chronic hyperactivity or hypoactivity of the stress system might influence the susceptibility of an individual to certain autoimmune , allergic , infectious , or neoplastic diseases . 
Activation of <START:ana> human monocytic cells <END> by <START:ggp> Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi lipoproteins <END> and synthetic lipopeptides proceeds via a pathway distinct from that of lipopolysaccharide but involves the transcriptional activator <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
There is increasing evidence that <START:ggp> lipoproteins <END> of Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi are key inflammatory mediators during syphilis and Lyme disease . 
A principal objective of the present study was to identify more precisely similarities and divergences among lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - and lipoprotein-lipopeptide-induced immune cell signaling events . 
Like LPS , <START:ggp> purified native B. burgdorferi OspA <END> and synthetic analogs of <START:ggp> OspA <END> , <START:ggp> OspB <END> , and two <START:ggp> T. pallidum lipoproteins <END> ( <START:ggp> Tpp47 <END> and <START:ggp> Tpp17 <END> ) all induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation in <START:ana> THP-1 human monocytoid cells <END> . 
Acylation of <START:ggp> OspA <END> and the synthetic peptides was requisite for cell activation . 
Polymyxin B abrogated only the response to LPS . 
By using <START:ana> 70Z/3-derived pre-B-cell lines <END> either lacking or expressing <START:ggp> human CD14 <END> ( the <START:ggp> LPS receptor <END> ) , it was observed that expression of <START:ggp> human CD14 <END> imparted responsiveness to LPS but not to <START:ggp> OspA <END> or <START:ggp> spirochetal lipopeptides <END> ( assessed by induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and expression of <START:ggp> surface immunoglobulin M <END> ) . 
Finally , the biological relevance of the observation that <START:ggp> T. pallidum lipoproteins <END> -lipopeptides induce both <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production in <START:ana> monocytes <END> was supported by the ability of the synthetic analogs to promote human immunodeficiency virus replication in chronically infected U1 monocytoid cells ; these observations also suggest a potential mechanism whereby a syphilitic chancre can serve as a cofactor for human immunodeficiency virus transmission . 
The combined data lend additional support to the proposal that <START:ggp> spirochetal lipoproteins <END> and LPS initiate monocyte activation via different cell surface events but that the signaling pathways ultimately converge to produce qualitatively similar cellular responses . 
<START:ggp> LYSP100 <END> -associated nuclear domains ( LANDs ) : description of a new class of subnuclear structures and their relationship to PML nuclear bodies . 
The <START:ggp> PML gene <END> is fused to the <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR alpha ) gene <END> in t ( 15 ; 17 ) acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) , creating a <START:ggp> PML-RAR alpha fusion oncoprotein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> PML gene product <END> has been localized to <START:ana> subnuclear dot-like structures <END> variously termed PODs , ND10s , Kr bodies , or PML nuclear bodies ( PML NBs ) . 
The present study describes the cloning of a <START:ggp> lymphoid-restricted gene <END> , <START:ggp> LYSP100 <END> , that is homologous to another protein that localizes to PML NBs , <START:ggp> SP100 <END> . 
In addition to <START:ggp> SP100 homology regions <END> , one <START:ggp> LYSP100 cDNA isoform <END> contains a <START:ggp> bromodomain <END> and a <START:ggp> PHD/TTC domain <END> , which are present in a variety of <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory proteins <END> . 
By immunofluorescence , <START:ggp> LYSP100 <END> was localized to nuclear dots that were surprisingly largely nonoverlapping with PML NBs . 
However , a minority of <START:ggp> LYSP100 <END> nuclear dots exactly colocalized with <START:ana> PML <END> and <START:ggp> SP100 <END> . 
We term the <START:ggp> LYSP100 <END> structures `` LANDs , '' for <START:ggp> LYSP100 <END> -associated nuclear domains . 
Although <START:ggp> LYSP100 <END> is expressed only in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> , LANDs could be visualized in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> by transfection of a <START:ggp> LYSP100 cDNA <END> . 
Immunoelectron microscopy revealed LANDs to be globular , electron-dense structures morphologically distinct from the annular structures characteristic of PML NBs . 
LANDs were most often found in the nucleoplasm , but were also found at the nuclear membrane and in the cytoplasm , suggesting that these structures may traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleus . 
By double-immunogold labeling of <START:ana> PML <END> and <START:ggp> LYSP100 <END> , some LANDs were shown to contain both <START:ana> PML <END> and <START:ggp> LYSP100 <END> . 
Thus , <START:ana> PML <END> is localized to a second subnuclear domain that is morphologically and biochemically distinct from <START:ana> PML <END> NBs . 
Transcriptional control of steroid-regulated apoptosis in <START:ana> murine thymoma cells <END> . 
Early studies in murine <START:ana> T cell lines <END> indicated that transcriptional transactivation functions encoded in the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) N-terminal domain <END> are required for glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis . 
However , more recent studies in <START:ana> human T cell lines <END> have suggested that the <START:ggp> N-terminal domain <END> is not necessary for steroid-regulated apoptosis and that <START:ggp> GR <END> -mediated transrepression may be the more critical mechanism . 
To better understand the contribution of the <START:ggp> GR N-terminal transactivation domain <END> in mediating murine thymocyte apoptosis , we stably transfected <START:ggp> GR <END> , <START:ggp> GR variants <END> , and the <START:ggp> androgen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> AR <END> ) into <START:ana> receptor-negative S49 murine thymoma cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> GR <END> expression levels were shown to be rate-limiting for initiating the apoptotic pathway , and a positive correlation between steroid sensitivity and <START:ggp> GR <END> -mediated induction of an integrated <START:ggp> mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) LTR reporter gene <END> was observed . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> GR chimeric receptors <END> containing the potent <START:ggp> VP16 and E1A viral transactivation domains <END> in place of the <START:ggp> GR N terminus <END> revealed that even low level expression of these receptors resulted in both enhanced steroid sensitivity and MMTV induction , thus supporting a role for transactivation in apoptosis . 
In contrast , we found that <START:ggp> AR <END> can initiate apoptosis in <START:ana> S49 cells <END> after treatment with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone , despite its relative inability to induce high level expression of MMTV . 
To investigate this further , we examined the steroid-regulated expression of an endogenous <START:ggp> thymocyte-specific gene <END> called <START:ggp> GIG18 <END> . 
We found that <START:ggp> GIG18 <END> was rapidly induced to comparable levels by both <START:ggp> AR <END> and <START:ggp> GR <END> , demonstrating that <START:ggp> AR <END> can indeed function as a transcriptional activator in <START:ana> S49 cells <END> and , moreover , that <START:ggp> GIG18 <END> induction may be a marker of early apoptotic events in steroid-treated cells . 
Taken together , these results support our conclusion that transcriptional transactivation is a necessary signaling component of S49 cell apoptosis , although an additional role for <START:ggp> GR <END> -mediated transrepression can not be excluded . 
Multiple <START:ggp> p21ras <END> effector pathways regulate nuclear factor of <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) is a major target for <START:ggp> p21ras <END> and calcium signalling pathways in the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> and is induced by <START:ggp> p21ras <END> signals acting in synergy with calcium <START:ggp> /calcineurin <END> signals . 
One <START:ggp> p21ras <END> effector pathway involves the <START:ggp> MAP kinase <END> <START:ggp> ERK-2 <END> , and we have examined its role in <START:ggp> NFAT <END> regulation . 
Expression of <START:ggp> dominant negative MAPKK-1 <END> prevents <START:ggp> NFAT <END> induction . 
Constitutively active <START:ggp> MAPKK-1 <END> fully activates <START:ggp> ERK-2 <END> and the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Elk-1 <END> , but does not substitute for activated <START:ggp> p21ras <END> and synergize with calcium <START:ggp> /calcineurin <END> signals to induce <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> dominant negative N17Rac <END> also prevents <START:ggp> TCR <END> and <START:ggp> p21ras <END> activation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , but without interfering with the <START:ggp> ERK-2 <END> pathway . 
The transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> NFAT binding site <END> is mediated by a complex comprising a member of the <START:ggp> NFAT <END> group and <START:ggp> AP-1 family proteins <END> . 
The induction of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> by <START:ggp> p21ras <END> also requires <START:ggp> Rac-1 <END> function . 
<START:ggp> Activated Rac-1 <END> could mimic <START:ggp> activated p21ras <END> to induce <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> but not to induce <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
Moreover , the combination of activated <START:ggp> MAPKK-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Rac-1 <END> could not substitute for activated <START:ggp> p21ras <END> and synergize with calcium signals to induce <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> p21ras <END> regulation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> requires the activity of multiple effector pathways including those regulated by <START:ggp> MAPKK-1 <END> <START:ggp> /ERK-2 <END> and <START:ggp> Rac-1 <END> . 
Retinoid differentiation therapy in promyelocytic leukemia . 
Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is a specific type of acute myeloid leukemia characterized by the morphology of the <START:ana> blast cells <END> , a specific t ( 15 ; 17 ) translocation , and risks of definite coagulopathy . 
Recently this leukemia was further characterized by an exquisite sensitivity to all-trans retinoic acid 's differentiation effect and the production of a <START:ggp> fusion gene <END> altering the gene of <START:ggp> RARalpha <END> and a <START:ggp> novel gene PML <END> . 
In vivo differentiation therapy with retinoids in APL patients follows strict guidelines related both to the APL cell and the biodisposal of all-trans retinoic acid . 
Differential utilization of <START:ggp> Janus kinase <END> -signal transducer activator of transcription signaling pathways in the stimulation of <START:ana> human natural killer cells <END> by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , and <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> . 
IL-2- , IL-12- , and IFN-alpha-mediated signaling pathways were analyzed in <START:ana> primary NK cells <END> and in the <START:ana> NK3.3 cell line <END> . 
Gel mobility shift and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that in addition to activating <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> ( <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 <END> ) and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induced tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> , which formed <START:ggp> IFN-gamma-activated sequence-binding complexes <END> by itself and with <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> activated <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> predominantly activated <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> , while <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> predominantly activated <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induced less <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> activation and <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> induced greater <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> activation in <START:ana> NK3.3 cells <END> compared with <START:ana> preactivated primary NK cells <END> . 
In <START:ana> NK3.3 cells <END> , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induced comparable formation of <START:ggp> c-fos promoter sis-inducible element IFN-gamma-activated sequence-binding complexes <END> containing <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> alone with complexes containing <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> , while in <START:ana> preactivated primary NK cells <END> , it preferentially induced complexes containing <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> . 
Thus , signaling in <START:ana> NK3.3 cells <END> is not always identical with that in <START:ana> primary NK cells <END> . 
In contrast to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> and variable weak phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> . 
However , supershift analyses using the <START:ggp> c-fos promoter sis-inducible element probe <END> showed that <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> activated <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> , and induced complexes containing <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> only , <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> with <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> , <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> with <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> , or <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> only in <START:ana> preactivated primary NK cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> activation by <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> correlated with increased phosphorylation of serine , but not tyrosine . 
Finally , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> , while <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> induced phosphorylation of <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> and <START:ggp> TYK2 <END> in both <START:ana> preactivated primary NK and NK3.3 cells <END> . 
Differential phosphorylation and consequent differential activation of both separate and overlapping <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , and <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> may provide a molecular basis for the similarities and differences in the actions of these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> on <START:ana> NK cells <END> . 
The suppression of <START:ana> T cell <END> function and <START:ggp> NF ( kappa ) B <END> expression by serine protease inhibitors is blocked by N-acetylcysteine . 
Direct evidence that N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) enhances the immune response of <START:ana> peripheral blood T cells <END> at the level of <START:ggp> NF ( kappa ) B <END> is presented . 
In addition , NAC blocks the suppression of T cell mitogenesis and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production by protease inhibitors such as N-tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone ( TPCK ) . 
The proliferative responses of <START:ana> purified CD4+ or CD8+ T cells <END> are suppressed more strongly by TPCK when <START:ggp> anti-CD28 <END> rather than the phorbol ester PMA is used as the mitogenic <START:ggp> coactivator <END> . 
<START:ggp> Cytokine <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , <START:ggp> INF-gamma <END> ) production is inhibited 95-100 % by concentrations of TPCK that totally suppress the mitogenesis of <START:ana> CD4+ or CD8+ cells <END> . 
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we find that TPCK virtually abolishes ( to less than 1 % ) the levels of <START:ggp> NF ( kappa ) B <END> ( but not <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> ) found in nuclear and whole cell extracts of <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
Strikingly , the immunosuppressive effects of TPCK are blocked when <START:ana> T cells <END> are pretreated for 15 min with 5 mM NAC . 
NAC not only blocks the effect of TPCK but enhances mitogenesis and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production ( > 2.5-fold in some cases ) upon activation of <START:ana> unsuppressed T cells <END> . 
Our data support the notion that <START:ggp> NF ( kappa ) B <END> and <START:ggp> I ( kappa ) B proteases <END> play obligate roles in T cell activation and mitogenesis , roles that are enhanced significantly by NAC . 
Signaling by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and related <START:ggp> cytokines <END> : <START:ggp> JAKs <END> , <START:ggp> STATs <END> , and relationship to immunodeficiency . 
<START:ggp> Cytokines <END> that bind to the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor common gamma chain <END> ( <START:ggp> gamma c <END> ) , including <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> , are important for the growth and differentiation of <START:ana> T and B lymphocytes <END> , <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> , <START:ana> macrophages <END> , and <START:ana> monoctyes <END> . 
These <START:ggp> cytokines <END> have overlapping biological effects that in part result from the use of the <START:ggp> shared receptor subunit gamma c <END> . 
Recently it has become clear that these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> activate a number of important <START:ggp> intracellular signaling molecules <END> , including the <START:ggp> Janus kinases <END> <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> and members of the <START:ggp> transcription factor family <END> of <START:ggp> signal transducers <END> and <START:ggp> activators of transcription <END> ( <START:ggp> STATs <END> ) . 
The discovery of these signaling pathways has led to important new insights into their role in lymphocyte maturation , as it has emerged that mutations in the genes encoding both <START:ggp> gamma c <END> and <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> result in similar forms of severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) . 
In this review we examine the structure and function of <START:ggp> cytokine receptors <END> and the signaling pathways involved in their regulation of gene expression . 
Furthermore , we discuss recent advances that have led to a better understanding of how <START:ggp> cytokines <END> elicit intracellular responses , as well as their role in normal lymphoid development . 
Cytomegalovirus modulates <START:ggp> interleukin-6 gene <END> expression . 
Complications after lung transplantation include the development of rejection and an increased incidence of infection , particularly with cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) . 
Several recent studies have suggested that interleukin ( IL ) -6 may be used to detect both infection and rejection after lung transplantation . 
In addition , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> may play a role in the development of bronchiolitis obliterans after transplantation . 
Because CMV is also associated with the development of bronchiolitis obliterans after transplantation , we determined whether CMV induces <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> gene expression . 
We demonstrated that CMV infection increased both <START:ggp> IL-6 protein <END> and <START:ana> mRNA <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
We also demonstrated that the <START:ggp> CMV immediate early 1 gene product <END> increased expression of the <START:ggp> IL-6 promoter <END> . 
This effect of the <START:ggp> CMV immediate early 1 gene product <END> was dependent upon the presence of specific <START:ggp> transcription factor binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-6 promoter <END> . 
These studies demonstrate that CMV may be an important cofactor in the development of rejection and infection after transplantation through its effects on <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> . 
Vitamin D3- and retinoic acid-induced monocytic differentiation : interactions between the <START:ggp> endogenous vitamin D3 receptor <END> , <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptors <END> , and <START:ggp> retinoid X receptors <END> in <START:ana> U-937 cells <END> . 
Retinoic acid ( RA ) and 1 , 25 alpha-dihydroxycholecalciferol ( VitD3 ) are potent regulators of hematopoletic differentiation . 
Yet , little is known as to how the <START:ggp> RA and VitD3 receptor network <END> operates in <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> , and whether receptor interactions can explain the interplay between the RA -and VitD3-signaling pathways during differentiation . 
Therefore , we analyzed the expression , DNA binding , and transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> endogenous RA and VitD3 receptors <END> [ <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RARs <END> ) , <START:ggp> retinoid X receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RXRs <END> ) , and <START:ggp> VitD3 receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) ] in the <START:ana> U-937 cell line <END> , in which RA and VitD3 induce distinct monocytic differentiation pathways . 
VitD3 induction resulted in the formation of <START:ggp> VDR/RXR DNA-binding complexes <END> on both <START:ggp> VitD3 response elements <END> and <START:ggp> RA response elements <END> ( <START:ggp> RAREs <END> ) . 
However , transcriptional activation was only observed from a <START:ggp> VitD3 response element-driven reporter construct <END> . 
Several <START:ggp> DNA-binding complexes <END> were detected on <START:ggp> RAREs <END> in <START:ana> undifferentiated cells <END> . 
Stimulation by RA resulted in increased <START:ggp> RAR beta <END> <START:ggp> /RXR <END> DNA binding , activated <START:ggp> RARE <END> -dependent transcription , and increased expression of <START:ggp> RAR-beta <END> . 
Concomitant stimulation by VitD3 inhibited the RA-stimulated formation of <START:ggp> RAR beta/RXR heterodimers <END> , favoring <START:ggp> VDR <END> <START:ggp> /RXR <END> binding to the <START:ggp> RARE <END> . 
Also , VitD3 inhibited the expression of <START:ggp> CD23 <END> and <START:ggp> CD49f <END> , characteristic markers of retinoid-induced <START:ana> U-937 cell <END> differentiation . 
In contrast , neither the RA-stimulated , <START:ggp> RARE <END> -mediated transcription nor the induced <START:ggp> RAR-beta <END> expression was suppressed by VitD3 , suggesting that VitD3 selectively inhibited the retinoid-induced differentiation program but not the <START:ggp> RARE <END> -mediated signal . 
These results demonstrate a complex role for VitD3 in modifying the retinoid differentiation pathway and may have implications for differentiation-inducing therapy of hematopoietic tumors . 
The <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 posttranscriptional trans-activator <END> <START:ggp> Rex <END> contains a <START:ggp> nuclear export signal <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Rex protein <END> of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 is required for the nuclear export of <START:ana> unspliced viral mRNA <END> and , therefore , for virus replication . 
In this manuscript , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> Rex <END> shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that its <START:ggp> activation domain <END> constitutes a <START:ggp> nuclear export signal <END> that specifies efficient transport to the cytoplasm . 
These findings are consistent with a model for <START:ggp> Rex <END> -mediated trans-activation in which <START:ggp> Rex-viral mRNA complexes <END> are targeted for nuclear export by the direct action of the <START:ggp> activation domain <END> . 
<START:ggp> Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> preferentially activates the <START:ggp> 94-kD STAT5A <END> and an <START:ggp> 80-kD STAT5A isoform <END> in human peripheral blood monocytes . 
<START:ggp> Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) induces immediate effects in monocytes by activation of the <START:ggp> Janus kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> ) and <START:ggp> STAT transcription factor <END> ( <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> ) pathway . 
Recent studies have identified homologues of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT5A <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT5B <END> , as well as lower molecular weight variants of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> . 
To define the activation of the <START:ggp> STAT5 homologues <END> and lower molecular weight variant in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> differentiated into <START:ana> macrophages <END> by culture in <START:ggp> macrophage-CSF <END> ( <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> ) , we measured the <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT5A <END> , <START:ggp> STAT5B <END> , and any lower molecular weight <START:ggp> STAT5 isoforms <END> . 
Freshly isolated monocytes expressed <START:ggp> 94-kD STAT5A <END> , 92-kD <START:ggp> STAT5B <END> , and an <START:ggp> 80-kD STAT5A molecule <END> . 
Whereas <START:ggp> 94-kD STAT5A <END> was clearly tyrosine phosphorylated and bound to the <START:ggp> enhancer element <END> , the <START:ggp> gamma response region <END> ( <START:ggp> GRR <END> ) , of the <START:ggp> Fc gamma RI gene <END> , substantially less tyrosine phosphorylated <START:ggp> STAT5B <END> bound to the immobilized <START:ggp> GRR element <END> . 
Macrophages lost their ability to express the <START:ggp> 80-kD STAT5A protein <END> , but retained their ability to activate <START:ggp> STAT5A <END> . 
<START:ggp> STAT5A-STAT5A homodimers <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5A-STAT5B heterodimers <END> formed in response to <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> . 
Therefore , activation of <START:ggp> STAT5A <END> predominates compared to <START:ggp> STAT5B <END> when assayed by direct immunoprecipitation and by evaluation of bound <START:ggp> STATs <END> to immobilized <START:ggp> GRR <END> . 
Selective activation of <START:ggp> STAT5 homologues <END> in addition to generation of lower molecular isoforms may provide specificity and control to genes expressed in response to <START:ggp> cytokines <END> such as <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> . 
<START:ggp> Translocation ( 3 ; 14 ) ( q27 ; q11 ) <END> : a new variant translocation in a patient with non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma of B-cell type with <START:ggp> BCL6 <END> rearrangement . 
We report a 65-year-old woman with non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) carrying a <START:ggp> t ( 3 ; 14 ) ( q27 ; q11 ) <END> and <START:ggp> BCL6 <END> rearrangement in the <START:ana> affected cells <END> . 
She had generalized lymphadenopathy and the bone marrow was infiltrated by <START:ana> lymphoma cells <END> at presentation . 
Histological diagnosis was `` malignant lymphoma , diffuse , large cell '' type according to an International Working Formulation . 
Chromosome analysis revealed a <START:ggp> t ( 3 ; 14 ) ( q27 ; q11 ) <END> , which is a new variant translocation of <START:ggp> t ( 3 ; 14 ) ( q27 ; q32 ) <END> . 
Southern blot analysis showed rearrangement of <START:ggp> BCL6 <END> , <START:ggp> JH <END> , and <START:ggp> TCR beta <END> but not of <START:ggp> TCR delta <END> . 
<START:ggp> Cosmid probe <END> of <START:ggp> BCL6 <END> hybridized to <START:ggp> 14q11 <END> and <START:ggp> 3q27 <END> by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . 
Although the <START:ggp> band 14q11 <END> is a locus of <START:ggp> T-cell receptor alpha- and delta-chains <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR alpha/delta <END> ) , <START:ana> lymphoma cells <END> expressed <START:ana> B-cell , IgGk phenotype <END> . 
The findings suggest that a <START:ggp> novel proto-oncogene <END> in the vicinity of <START:ggp> TCR alpha/delta <END> is involved in this translocation . 
Transgenic expression of <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha <END> impairs myelopoiesis . 
The translocation found in acute promyelocytic leukemia rearranges the <START:ggp> promyelocytic leukemia gene <END> ( <START:ggp> PML <END> ) on <START:ggp> chromosome 15 <END> with the <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> RARalpha <END> ) on <START:ggp> chromosome 17 <END> . 
This yields a fusion transcript , <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha <END> , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> with reported dominant negative functions in the absence of hormone . 
Clinical remissions induced with all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia are linked to <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha <END> expression in <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> . 
To evaluate the <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha <END> role in myelopoiesis , transgenic mice expressing <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha <END> were engineered . 
A full-length <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha cDNA <END> driven by the <START:ggp> CD11b promoter <END> was expressed in transgenic mice . 
Expression was confirmed in the bone marrow with a reverse transcription PCR assay . 
Basal total white blood cell and granulocyte counts did not appreciably differ between <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha <END> transgenic and control mice . 
Cell sorter analysis of <START:ana> CD11b+ bone marrow cells <END> revealed similar <START:ana> CD11b+ populations <END> in transgenic and control mice . 
However , in vitro clonal growth assays performed on peripheral blood from transgenic versus control mice revealed a marked reduction of <START:ana> myeloid progenitors <END> , especially in those responding to <START:ggp> granulocyte/ macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> and kit ligand cotreatment did not overcome this inhibition . 
Impaired myelopoiesis in vivo was shown by stressing these mice with sublethal irradiation . 
Following irradiation , <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha <END> transgenic mice , as compared with controls , more rapidly depressed peripheral white blood cell and granulocyte counts . 
As expected , nearly all control mice ( 94.4 % ) survived irradiation , yet this irradiation was lethal to 45.8 % of <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha <END> transgenic mice . 
Lethality was associated with more severe leukopenia in transgenic versus control mice . 
Retinoic acid treatment of irradiated <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha <END> mice enhanced <START:ana> granulocyte <END> recovery . 
These data suggest that abnormal myelopoiesis due to <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha <END> expression is an early event in oncogenic transformation . 
<START:ggp> C/EBP activators <END> are required for HIV-1 replication and proviral induction in <START:ana> monocytic cell lines <END> . 
Previous work has shown that <START:ggp> C/EBP sites <END> and <START:ggp> C/EBP transcriptional activators <END> are necessary for <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> activity in <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> . 
We have investigated the role that <START:ggp> C/EBP proteins <END> play in induction and replication of HIV-1 . 
Ectopic expression of the dominant negative <START:ggp> C/EBP protein LIP <END> inhibited HIV-1 mRNA and virus production in <START:ana> activated U1 cells <END> , demonstrating that <START:ggp> C/EBP proteins <END> are required for provirus induction . 
<START:ana> U1 lines <END> overexpressing <START:ggp> C/EBP activator <END> <START:ggp> NF-IL-6 <END> produced more <START:ana> viral mRNA <END> and virus particles following cellular activation than <START:ana> control lines <END> , demonstrating that <START:ggp> C/EBP proteins <END> are limiting for virus transcription . 
HIV-1 harboring mutations within two <START:ggp> C/EBP sites <END> were crippled in their ability to replicate in <START:ana> U937 promonocytic cells <END> , indicating that these sites are required for replication . 
These data identify <START:ggp> C/EBP proteins <END> as regulators of HIV-1 expression in <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> . 
<START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 <END> and <START:ggp> latent membrane protein <END> independently transactivate <START:ggp> p53 <END> through induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity . 
<START:ana> B-cell <END> immortalization by Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is dependent on permanent control of the cellular processes which normally regulate cell division and apoptosis , functions possessed by <START:ggp> p53 <END> in a number of normal cell types . 
In studies initiated to evaluate relationships between <START:ggp> EBV latent genes <END> and <START:ggp> p53 <END> , <START:ggp> p53 <END> levels were found to increase approximately 10-fold 4 to 5 days after EBV infection of purified <START:ana> resting human B cells <END> ; the induced <START:ggp> p53 <END> was transcriptionally active . 
<START:ggp> Latent membrane protein 1 <END> and , to a lesser extent , <START:ggp> EBV nuclear antigen 2 <END> mediated the increase in <START:ggp> p53 <END> levels via activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
Cooperation between <START:ggp> core binding factor <END> and <START:ggp> adjacent promoter elements <END> contributes to the tissue-specific expression of <START:ggp> interleukin-3 <END> . 
Tissue-specific expression of <START:ggp> interleukin-3 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> ) is mediated via <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> located within 315 base pairs of the <START:ggp> transcription start <END> . 
This is achieved in part through the positive activities of the <START:ggp> AP-1 and Elf-1 sites <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-3 promoter <END> . 
The contribution to T cell-specific expression by other <START:ggp> promoter sites <END> was assessed in a transient expression assay with <START:ggp> IL-3 promoter constructs <END> linked to a <START:ggp> luciferase gene <END> , focusing initially on the <START:ggp> core binding factor ( CBF ) site <END> , which is footprinted in vivo upon T cell activation . 
Activity of the <START:ggp> CBF site <END> is shown to be critically dependent on the <START:ggp> adjacent activator site Act-1 <END> . 
Together the <START:ggp> Act-1 <END> and <START:ggp> CBF sites <END> form a <START:ggp> functional unit <END> ( <START:ggp> AC unit <END> ) with dual activity . 
The <START:ggp> AC unit <END> is demonstrated to enhance basal activity of promoters both in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
This activity is further inducible in activated <START:ana> T cells <END> , but not in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
In addition to the already identified <START:ggp> NIP repressor site <END> , evidence is presented for a <START:ggp> second repressor region <END> that restricts promoter activity in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
Finally , a novel <START:ggp> positive regulatory element <END> has been mapped in the <START:ggp> IL-3 promoter <END> between nucleotide -180 and -210 that leads to increased expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Together these results demonstrate that T cell expression of <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> is not specified by the activity of a single <START:ggp> tissue-specific element <END> , but instead involves multiple <START:ggp> interacting elements <END> that provide both specific positive regulation in <START:ana> T cells <END> and specific negative regulation in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
Modulation of the expression of the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma receptor beta-chain <END> controls responsiveness to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> in <START:ana> human peripheral blood T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> has potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in <START:ana> T cells <END> that are important in determining T cell development and polarized differentiation . 
Therefore , any event that enables <START:ana> T cells <END> to become less responsive to <START:ggp> IFN- gamma <END> may potentially alter immune responsiveness to <START:ggp> Ag <END> . 
In this work , we show that <START:ana> human peripheral blood T cells <END> that are stimulated through the <START:ggp> TCR <END> and expanded with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> are unresponsive to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , as determined by a lack of activation of <START:ggp> jak kinases <END> and the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> STAT1 ( alpha ) <END> , a signal transducer and activator of transcription . 
This nonresponsiveness occurs because of a lack of expression of the <START:ggp> beta- chain <END> ( accessory factor ) of the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma receptor <END> , while at the same time maintaining <START:ggp> IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain <END> expression . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> beta-chain <END> can be restored by secondary <START:ggp> TCR <END> ligation or PMA treatment . 
<START:ana> T cell blasts <END> treated with PMA are now responsive to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
When freshly isolated , highly enriched ( > 98 % ) <START:ana> T cells <END> are examined for <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> responsiveness ; these cells can respond to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and express <START:ggp> beta-chain <END> . 
Therefore , as <START:ana> T cells <END> progress from primary <START:ggp> TCR <END> activation through <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -dependent proliferation , followed by secondary <START:ggp> TCR <END> stimulation , their responsiveness to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> varies , and this may affect their ability to participate in an ongoing immune response . 
Age-related decreases in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production by <START:ana> human T cells <END> are associated with impaired activation of <START:ggp> nuclear transcriptional factors <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> transcriptional factors <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) are important for the normal induction of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , it is unknown if the age-related decline in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production by activated <START:ana> human T cells <END> may be associated with aberrancies in <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory proteins <END> . 
In the current studies , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production by <START:ana> T cells <END> from elderly ( mean 78 years ) and young ( mean 37 years ) humans was measured in cultures stimulated with <START:ggp> PHA <END> , <START:ggp> PHA <END> plus PMA , crosslinked anti-CD3 mAB OKT3 plus PMA , or PMA plus ionomycin . 
Substantial decreases of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production were observed for cell cultures from 7 of 12 elderly individuals in response to the different stimuli , whereas the levels of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> produced by stimulated <START:ana> T cells <END> from other elderly individuals were equivalent to those observed for stimulated T cells of young subjects . 
Analyses of nuclear extracts by electrophoretic DNA mobility shift assays showed that decreased <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production by <START:ana> stimulated T cells <END> of elderly individuals was closely associated with impairments in the activation of both <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
By contrast , <START:ana> T cells <END> from elderly subjects with normal levels of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production exhibited normal activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
In addition , the results of competition experiments analyzing the normal components of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> showed that the age-related reductions in stimulus-dependent <START:ggp> NF-AT complexes <END> corresponded to the slow migrating complexes that were composed of <START:ggp> c-Fos/c-Jun <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
The resting and stimulated levels of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> were reduced in <START:ana> T cells <END> from certain elderly individuals ; however , alterations of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> did not correlate with changes in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression . 
Thus , these results show that age-related impairments in the activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> are closely associated with decreased expression of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and further suggest that aberrancies in the signaling pathways important for the induction of transcriptionally active <START:ggp> c-Fos/c-Jun <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> may contribute to the impaired activation of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-13 <END> induces phosphorylation and activation of <START:ggp> JAK2 Janus kinase <END> in <START:ana> human colon carcinoma cell lines <END> : similarities between <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> signaling . 
We have recently reported that <START:ggp> IL-13R <END> may share a component with <START:ggp> IL-4R <END> . Here we report that both <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> share signaling events in <START:ana> human colon carcinoma cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> HT-29 <END> and <START:ana> WiDr <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> IL-13 <END> caused rapid phosphorylation of the three out of four members of the known <START:ggp> Janus family of kinases <END> ( <START:ggp> JAKs <END> ) . 
We show that <START:ggp> JAK2 kinase <END> is rapidly phosphorylated and activated in response to <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> . 
Within 1 min of activation , <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> was phosphorylated , and peaked in 10 min . 
In addition , <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> phosphorylated <START:ggp> insulin response substrate-1 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4R p140 <END> , <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> , and <START:ggp> Tyk2 <END> , but not <START:ggp> JAK3 kinase <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> also stimulated all three <START:ggp> kinases <END> and substrates , but unlike in <START:ana> immune cells <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> did not involve <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> activation for its signaling in <START:ana> colon cancer cell lines <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> associated with the <START:ggp> IL-4R p140 <END> before and after stimulation with <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> induced phosphorylation of <START:ggp> IL-4 STAT <END> ( <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> ) but not <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> , or <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> . 
<START:ggp> 125I-IL-13 <END> did not bind to <START:ana> colon cancer cell lines <END> , but unlabeled <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> competed for the binding of <START:ggp> 125I-IL-4 <END> . 
Our data suggest that <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> utilizes <START:ggp> IL-4R <END> and its signaling pathway , and <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> may play an important role in the function of <START:ggp> IL-4R <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13R <END> in <START:ana> colon cancer cells <END> . 
Differential regulation of <START:ggp> IL-6 gene <END> transcription and expression by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> in <START:ana> human monocytic cell lines <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibit the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production and mRNA expression by <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> . 
To investigate the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory effect on transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of <START:ggp> IL-6 gene <END> expression by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , we studied <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> production , expression level of <START:ana> IL-6 mRNA <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> promoter activity , transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> NF-IL-6 <END> , and <START:ana> IL-6 mRNA <END> stability in <START:ana> human monocytic cell lines <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 <END> and <START:ana> U937 <END> , stimulated by PMA and LPS in the absence or the presence of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> were seen to inhibit <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> production and the expression of <START:ana> IL-6 mRNA <END> in both <START:ana> monocytic cell lines <END> studied . 
In <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase <END> assays , utilizing the transient transfection of a <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid <END> containing the <START:ggp> IL-6 gene promoter <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , but not <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , suppressed the transcriptional activity of the IL-6 gene promoter stimulated by PMA and LPS . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , but not <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , inhibited nuclear <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity , and that <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> did not affect NF- <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> activity . 
On the other hand , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> enhanced the degradation of <START:ana> IL-6 mRNA <END> in a mRNA stability assay . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> may inhibit the transcription of the <START:ggp> IL-6 gene <END> by affecting <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding activity , while <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> may inhibit the <START:ana> IL-6 mRNA <END> levels post-transcriptionally , without suppressing promoter activity . 
Therefore , we conclude that <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibit <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> production by different mechanisms in <START:ana> human monocytic cell lines <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> in a cyclosporin A-resistant pathway . 
The mechanism of action of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A ( CsA ) is the inactivation of the <START:ggp> Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> by the <START:ggp> drug-immunophilin complex <END> . 
Inactive <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> is unable to activate the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> required for expression of the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production by <START:ana> CsA-treated cells <END> is therefore dramatically reduced . 
We demonstrate here , however , that <START:ggp> NFAT <END> can be activated , and significant levels of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> can be produced by the CsA-resistant <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -signaling pathway . 
In transient transfection assays , both multicopy <START:ggp> NFAT <END> -and <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter-beta-galactosidase reporter gene constructs <END> could be activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) /alpha- <START:ggp> CD28 <END> stimulation , and this activation was resistant to CsA . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed the induction of a <START:ggp> CsA-resistant NFAT complex <END> in the nuclear extracts of <START:ana> peripheral blood T cells <END> stimulated with PMA plus <START:ggp> alphaCD28 <END> . 
<START:ana> Peripheral blood T cells <END> stimulated with PMA <START:ggp> /alphaCD28 <END> produced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in the presence of CsA . 
Collectively , these data suggest that <START:ggp> NFAT <END> can be activated and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> can be produced in a <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> independent manner . 
Effects of <START:ggp> interleukin-10 <END> on <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cell <END> responses to Cryptococcus neoformans , Candida albicans , and lipopolysaccharide . 
Deactivation of <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> is critical to limit the inflammatory response but can be detrimental in the face of progressive infection . 
We compared the effects of the <START:ggp> deactivating cytokine <END> <START:ggp> interleukin 10 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ) on <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cell <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) responses to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , Cryptococcus neoformans , and Candida albicans . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> effected dose-dependent inhibition of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) release in <START:ana> PBMC <END> stimulated by LPS and C. neoformans , with significant inhibition seen with 0.1 U/ml and greater than 90 % inhibition noted with 10 U/ml . 
In contrast , even at doses as high as 100 U/ml , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibited <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release in response to C. albicans by only 50 % . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> profoundly inhibited release of <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> from <START:ana> PBMC <END> stimulated by all three stimuli . 
<START:ana> TNF-alpha mRNA <END> and release was inhibited even if <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> was added up to 8 h after cryptococcal stimulation . 
In contrast , inhibition of <START:ana> IL-1 beta mRNA <END> was of lesser magnitude and occurred only when <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> was added within 2 h of cryptococcal stimulation . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibited translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in response to LPS but not the fungal stimuli . 
All three stimuli induced <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> production in <START:ana> PBMC <END> , although over 10-fold less <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> was released in response to C. neoformans compared with LPS and C. albicans . 
Thus , while <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> has deactivating effects on <START:ana> PBMC <END> responses to all three stimuli , disparate stimulus- and response-specific patterns of deactivation are seen . 
Inhibition by <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> of <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokine <END> release appears to occur at the level of gene transcription for <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally for <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> . 
Characterization and purification of a <START:ggp> protein kinase C substrate <END> in <START:ana> human B cells <END> . 
Identification as <START:ggp> lymphocyte-specific protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> LSP1 <END> ) . 
Incubation of <START:ana> B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) cells <END> with phorbol esters resulted in the phosphorylation of two major <START:ggp> PKC substrates <END> , <START:ggp> MARCKS <END> ( <START:ggp> myristoylated , alanine-rich C kinase substrate <END> ) and <START:ggp> MRP <END> ( <START:ggp> MARCKS-related protein <END> ) , and of a third protein , with an apparent m.w. of 60 , 000 that was the most prominent <START:ggp> protein kinase C substrate <END> in these cells . 
<START:ggp> p60 <END> phosphorylation was time and PMA dose dependent , and was induced by cell-permeable diacylglycerol , but not by inactive phorbol esters . 
Two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of the protein phosphorylation pattern from the <START:ana> B cell line CESS <END> demonstrated the identity between the <START:ggp> p60 protein <END> expressed in this cell line and that expressed in <START:ana> B-CLL cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> p60 <END> was purified from <START:ana> CESS cells <END> and peptide microsequencing of this protein revealed that it was <START:ggp> lymphocyte-specific protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> LSP1 <END> ) , that is here characterized as the most prominent <START:ggp> protein kinase C substrate <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factors <END> of <START:ana> T and B lymphocytes <END> -- basic research and clinical perspectives for gastroenterology . 
Tissue specific regulation of gene expression by <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> is a fascinating new field in molecular immunology . 
This review summarizes data on specific regulation of <START:ggp> promoters <END> and <START:ggp> enhancers <END> by <START:ggp> nuclear trans-acting factors <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
The structural classes of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are described and basic methods for detection and analysis of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are detailed . 
Furthermore , the most important <START:ggp> trans-acting factors <END> of <START:ana> T and B lymphocytes <END> ( e.g . <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> , <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> and <START:ggp> STAT families <END> ) and their functional importance are described . 
Several methods for specific down-regulation of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are shown that may be relevant to treatment of human disease . 
The data are discussed with regard to their potential clinical relevance for gastroenterology . 
Selective effects of DNA damaging agents on <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> activation and virus replication in vitro . 
Much attention has recently focused on the observation that UV light can activate the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 
Although the mechanism of <START:ggp> LTR <END> activation remains obscure , several lines of investigation have suggested that it is a result of activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> ( s ) following signaling events related to generalized DNA damage . 
In this report , we present data demonstrating that HIV <START:ggp> LTR <END> activation is not a general consequence of <START:ggp> cellular DNA <END> damage , but rather a process unique to specific genotoxic stimuli , and that it does not necessarily depend on activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Furthermore , we demonstrate that several of these agents can significantly increase HIV replication and accelerate <START:ggp> CD4 <END> -positive lymphocyte cytotoxicity in vitro . 
These findings , therefore , could have clinical significance to AIDS patients with malignancies who are undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy . 
Receptors for <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -10 and IL-6-type cytokines <END> use similar signaling mechanisms for inducing transcription through <START:ggp> IL-6 response elements <END> . 
The <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> of the receptor for <START:ggp> interleukin 10 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-10R <END> ) contains two <START:ggp> box 3 sequence motifs <END> that have been identified in the <START:ggp> signal-transducing receptor subunits <END> for <START:ggp> IL-6-type cytokines <END> and noted to be required for activating <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> and inducing transcription through <START:ggp> IL-6-responsive elements <END> . 
To determine whether the <START:ggp> IL-10R <END> has signaling functions similar to <START:ggp> IL-6R <END> in cells normally expressing these receptors , <START:ana> leukocytes <END> of the <START:ana> B- , T- , and NK-cell lineages <END> were treated with either cytokine . 
Both <START:ggp> cytokines <END> activated factors that bound to the <START:ggp> sis-inducible element <END> and included <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> . 
The cell response to <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> characteristically differed from that to <START:ggp> IL-2/IL-15 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , and <START:ggp> interferon gamma <END> . 
The signaling capabilities of the <START:ggp> IL-10R <END> for activating specific <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> and inducing gene transcription were defined by reconstitution of receptor functions in <START:ana> transfected tissue culture cells <END> . 
<START:ana> COS-1 cells <END> , co-expressing the human <START:ggp> IL-10R <END> and individual <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> , confirmed a preference of the <START:ggp> IL-10R <END> for <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> . 
Unlike many <START:ggp> hematopoietin receptors <END> , the <START:ggp> IL-10R <END> did not detectably activate <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> IL-10R <END> , together with reporter gene constructs containing different <START:ggp> IL-6-responsive gene elements <END> , reconstituted in <START:ana> hepatoma cells <END> an induction of transcription by <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> that was comparable to that by <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> . 
This regulation could not be appreciably modified by enhanced expression of <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> . 
The similar actions of <START:ggp> IL-10R <END> and <START:ggp> IL-6R <END> on the induction of endogenous <START:ggp> IL-6-responsive genes <END> were demonstrated in <START:ana> hepatoma cells <END> stably expressing the <START:ggp> IL-10R <END> . 
These receptor functions required the presence of the <START:ggp> box 3 motifs <END> , as shown by the analysis of the mouse <START:ggp> IL-10R <END> constructs containing <START:ggp> progressively truncated cytoplasmic domains <END> . 
The data demonstrate that the <START:ggp> IL-10R <END> , unlike other members of the interferon receptor family , is highly effective in recruiting the signaling pathways of <START:ggp> IL-6-type cytokine receptors <END> . 
Induction of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> and modification of in vivo <START:ggp> HLA-DR promoter <END> occupancy in <START:ana> normal thymic epithelial cells <END> treated with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> : similarities and distinctions with respect to <START:ana> HLA-DR-constitutive B cells <END> . 
In this study , the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induction of <START:ggp> MHC class II gene <END> expression in primary cultures of <START:ana> thymic epithelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> TEC <END> ) was analyzed . 
This cellular system offers the advantage that <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> induction is studied in a <START:ana> `` physiologic '' cell lineage <END> that , as a result of this expression within the thymus , is thought to participate to the selection and maturation of the <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
It was found that the <START:ggp> MHC class II gene <END> expression was associated with the de novo transcription of the gene encoding the <START:ggp> CIITA trans-activator <END> , a crucial <START:ggp> MHC class II gene regulatory factor <END> . 
Furthermore , the anatomy of interaction between the <START:ggp> MHC class II DRA promoter <END> and corresponding <START:ggp> binding factors <END> was analyzed by in vivo <START:ggp> DNAse I <END> footprint . 
It was found that treatment with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induces changes in the occupancy of the <START:ggp> DRA gene regulatory sequences <END> by <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> . 
The resulting occupancy displays strong similarities with the one observed in the <START:ana> MHC class II-constitutive B cells <END> , represented by both the <START:ana> Burkitt lymphoma line Raji <END> and <START:ana> normal tonsil- derived B cells <END> . 
However , some peculiar differences were observed between the <START:ana> TEC <END> , either <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -induced or not , and the constitutive <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
These results suggest that both common mechanisms , such as the one mediated by the <START:ggp> CIITA trans-activator <END> , and distinct tissue-specific constraints contribute to the transcriptional control of constitutive and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -induced <START:ggp> MHC class II gene <END> expression . 
Inhibitory effect of E3330 , a novel quinone derivative able to suppress <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> generation , on activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> . 
( 2E ) -3- [ 5- ( 2 , 3-Dimethoxy-6-methyl-1 , 4-benzoquinoyl ) ] -2-nonyl-2- propenoic acid ( E3330 ) , is a novel agent with hepatoprotective activity . 
We report the effect of E3330 on transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha gene <END> and on <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> activation . 
Nuclear run-on experiments showed that E3330 decreases transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha gene <END> induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation in <START:ana> human peripheral monocytes <END> . 
To investigate the inhibitory mechanisms , we constructed a <START:ggp> secreted-type placental alkaline phosphatase ( PLAP ) reporter gene <END> whose transcription is controlled by a <START:ggp> 1.4-kb human TNF-alpha promoter <END> . 
A stable transformant of the <START:ggp> PLAP reporter gene <END> derived from <START:ana> human monocytic cell line <END> showed very little activity on the promoter before stimulation , whereas LPS stimulation led to a dramatic increase in <START:ggp> PLAP <END> activity . 
E3330 inhibited this induced promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner . 
There are four putative <START:ggp> NF-kappa B binding sites <END> ( <START:ggp> kappa B-1 <END> , <START:ggp> kappa B-2 <END> , <START:ggp> kappa B-3 <END> , <START:ggp> kappa B-4 <END> ) in <START:ggp> human TNF-alpha promoter <END> . 
By using <START:ggp> mutated promoter-PLAP plasmids <END> , we established that these <START:ggp> NF-kappa B sites <END> were necessary for induction of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> transcription on stimulation with LPS . 
A gel retardation experiment with synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides showed that activated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> consisting of <START:ggp> p50/p65 heterodimer <END> bound to all four putative <START:ggp> NF-kappa B DNA probes <END> , suggesting that all four putative <START:ggp> NF-kappa B recognition sites <END> play an important role in inducible <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> expression . 
E3330 decreased activated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in nuclei , suggesting that E3330 inhibits <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation and/or translocation of the nuclei . 
Western blotting analysis with <START:ggp> anti-I kappa B-alpha antibody <END> indicated that E3330 inhibited degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> , which is an <START:ggp> inhibitory protein <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , in <START:ana> LPS-stimulated monocytes <END> . 
E3330 may suppress the production of active oxygen species serving as common messengers to activate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
<START:ggp> C-terminal activating and inhibitory domains <END> determine the transactivation potential of <START:ggp> BSAP <END> ( <START:ggp> Pax-5 <END> ) , <START:ggp> Pax-2 <END> and <START:ggp> Pax-8 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Pax-5 <END> encodes the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> BSAP <END> which plays an essential role in early B cell development and midbrain patterning . 
In this study we have analysed the structural requirements for transcriptional activation by <START:ggp> BSAP <END> . 
In vitro mutagenesis and transient transfection experiments indicate that the <START:ggp> C-terminal serine/threonine/proline-rich region <END> of <START:ggp> BSAP <END> contains a potent <START:ggp> transactivation domain <END> of 55 amino acids which is active from <START:ggp> promoter and enhancer positions <END> . 
This <START:ggp> transactivation domain <END> was found to be inactivated by a naturally occurring frameshift mutation in one <START:ggp> PAX-5 allele <END> of the <START:ana> acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line REH <END> . 
The function of the <START:ggp> transactivation domain <END> is negatively regulated by adjacent sequences from the <START:ggp> extreme C-terminus <END> . 
The activating and inhibitory domains function together as an independent regulatory module in different cell types as shown by fusion to the <START:ggp> GAL4 DNA binding domain <END> . 
The same arrangement of <START:ggp> positively and negatively acting sequences <END> has been conserved in the <START:ggp> mammalian Pax-2 <END> and <START:ggp> Pax-8 <END> , the <START:ggp> zebrafish Pax-b <END> as well as the <START:ggp> sea urchin Pax-258 proteins <END> . 
These data demonstrate that the transcriptional competence of a subfamily of <START:ggp> Pax proteins <END> is determined by a <START:ggp> C-terminal regulatory module <END> composed of <START:ggp> activating and inhibitory sequences <END> . 
Second messenger up-regulation of <START:ggp> androgen receptor gene <END> transcription is absent in <START:ana> androgen insensitive human prostatic carcinoma cell lines <END> , <START:ana> PC-3 <END> and <START:ana> DU-145 <END> . 
A theoretical pathway of transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> androgen receptor ( AR ) gene <END> is via a <START:ggp> cAMP response element <END> ( <START:ggp> CRE <END> ) present in its <START:ggp> promoter region <END> ( -508 to -501 ) . 
After 20 h of stimulation with 8-bromo-cAMP , <START:ana> AR mRNA <END> was upregulated in <START:ana> LNCaP <END> but not in either <START:ana> PC-3 <END> or <START:ana> DU-145 cell lines <END> . 
We have demonstrated that the level of <START:ggp> CRE binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> CREB <END> ) was the same in all cell lines and that the putative <START:ggp> AR-CRE <END> forms specific and compatible protein interactions with <START:ggp> CREB <END> . 
The ability to regulate <START:ggp> AR gene <END> transcription via the second messenger pathway is lost in the <START:ana> PC-3 and DU-145 cell lines <END> . 
This may be an important primary mechanism of androgen insensitivity in prostate cancer . 
Structural and functional characterization of the <START:ggp> human CD36 gene promoter <END> : identification of a proximal <START:ggp> PEBP2/CBF site <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD36 <END> is a cell surface <START:ggp> glycoprotein <END> composed of a single polypeptide chain , which interacts with <START:ggp> thrombospondin <END> , <START:ggp> collagens type I and IV <END> , oxidized <START:ggp> low density lipoprotein <END> , fatty acids , anionic phospholipids , and <START:ana> erythrocytes <END> parasitized with Plasmodium falciparum . 
Its expression is restricted to a few cell types , including <START:ana> monocyte/macrophages <END> . 
In these cells , <START:ggp> CD36 <END> is involved in phagocytosis of <START:ana> apoptotic cells <END> , and foam cell formation by uptake of <START:ggp> oxidized low density lipoprotein <END> . 
To study the molecular mechanisms that control the transcription of the <START:ggp> CD36 <END> gene in monocytic cells we have isolated and analyzed the <START:ggp> CD36 promoter <END> . 
Transient expression experiments of <START:ggp> 5'-deletion fragments <END> of the <START:ggp> CD36 promoter <END> coupled to <START:ggp> luciferase <END> demonstrated that as few as <START:ggp> 158 base pairs upstream <END> from the <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> were sufficient to direct the monocyte-specific transcription of the <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> . 
Within the above region , the fragment spanning <START:ggp> nucleotides -158 to -90 <END> was required for optimal transcription in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
Biochemical analysis of the region <START:ggp> -158/-90 <END> revealed a binding site for <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> of the <START:ggp> polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2/core-binding factor ( PEBP2/CBF ) family <END> at <START:ggp> position -103 <END> . 
Disruption of the <START:ggp> PEBP2/CBF site <END> markedly diminished the role of the <START:ggp> PEBP2/CBF factors <END> in the constitutive transcription of the <START:ggp> CD36 gene <END> . 
The involvement of members of the <START:ggp> PEBP2/CBF family <END> in chromosome translocations associated with acute myeloid leukemia , and in the transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> myeloid-specific genes <END> encoding for <START:ggp> myeloperoxidase <END> , <START:ggp> elastase <END> , and the <START:ggp> colony-stimulating factor receptor <END> , highlights the relevance of the regulation of the <START:ggp> CD36 gene promoter <END> in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> by members of the <START:ggp> PEBP2/CBF family <END> . 
<START:ggp> HLA-DQB1 codon 57 <END> is critical for peptide binding and recognition . 
The association of specific <START:ggp> HLA-DQ alleles <END> with autoimmunity is correlated with discrete polymorphisms in the <START:ggp> HLA-DQ sequence <END> that are localized within sites suitable for peptide recognition . 
The polymorphism at residue 57 of the DQB1 polypeptide is of particular interest since it may play a major structural role in the formation of a <START:ggp> salt bridge structure <END> at one end of the <START:ggp> peptide-binding cleft <END> of the DQ molecules . 
This polymorphism at residue 57 is a recurrent feature of HLA-DQ evolution , occurring in multiple distinct allelic families , which implies a functional selection for maintaining variation at this position in the <START:ggp> class II molecule <END> . 
We directly tested the amino acid polymorphism at this site as a determinant for peptide binding and for antigen-specific T cell stimulation . 
We found that a single Ala -- > Asp amino acid 57 substitution in an HLA-DQ3.2 molecule regulated binding of an HSV-2 VP-16-derived peptide . 
A complementary single-residue substitution in the peptide abolished its binding to DQ3.2 and converted it to a peptide that can bind to DQ3.1 and <START:ggp> DQ3.3 Asp-57-positive MHC molecules <END> . 
These binding studies were paralleled by specific T cell recognition of the <START:ggp> class II-peptide complex <END> , in which the substituted peptide abolished T cell reactivity , which was directed to the <START:ggp> DQ3.2-peptide complex <END> , whereas the same <START:ana> T cell clone <END> recognized the substituted peptide presented by DQ3.3 , a class II restriction element differing from DQ3.2 only at residue 57 . 
This structural and functional complementarity for residue 57 and a specific peptide residue identifies this interaction as a key controlling determinant of restricted recognition in HLA-DQ-specific immune response . 
Autocrine activation by <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> of <START:ggp> STAT factors <END> following T cell activation . 
The activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> requires engagement of the <START:ggp> T cell receptor/CD3 complex <END> and <START:ggp> co-stimulatory molecules <END> , and results in the triggering of several signaling pathways which lead rapidly to the nuclear translocation of several <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , such as <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
A result of this activation process is the induction of a number of genes , including those encoding <START:ggp> cytokines <END> such as <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> , <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> , and <START:ggp> interferon ( IFN ) -gamma <END> which have important <START:ggp> immunoregulatory <END> effects . 
We report here that a <START:ggp> DNA-binding factor <END> containing <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> also becomes activated in <START:ana> human peripheral blood T lymphocytes <END> or <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , although not until 1-2 h after stimulation . 
Activation is delayed a further 1-2 hr when <START:ana> mononuclear cell cultures <END> are stimulated by an antigen which requires processing . 
Appearance of the <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> factor is significantly reduced in the presence of cyclosporin A , and blocked by cycloheximide , indicating that its activation is dependent upon a protein ( s ) synthesized in response to initial signaling events . 
Neutralizing antiserum against <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , but not other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> tested , blocked activation of the factor almost completely , and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> was found in the culture supernatants of <START:ana> stimulated cells <END> at levels at which recombinant <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> could activate the factor in <START:ana> naive cells <END> . 
Therefore , a <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> is activated by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> synthesized and released upon stimulation of <START:ana> T lymphocyte populations <END> . 
While <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> both secrete and respond to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> in an autocrine loop , it seems likely that the responding cells may differ from those synthesizing this <START:ggp> cytokine <END> in the <START:ana> mononuclear cell cultures <END> in the light of the recent report that <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> lack the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> receptor chain necessary for activation of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> ( Pernis , A. , Gupta , S. , Gollob , K.J. , Garfein , E. , Coffman , R.L. , Schindler , C. , and Rothman , P. , Science 1995. 269 : 245 ) . 
Absence of <START:ggp> T-cell- and B-cell-specific transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> , <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> , and <START:ggp> BSAP <END> in <START:ana> Hodgkin 's Reed-Sternberg cells <END> . 
Based on the presence of <START:ggp> T cell receptor-beta ( TcR-beta ) gene rearrangements <END> in <START:ana> L428 and HDLM-1 cells <END> , the expression of <START:ggp> CD2 <END> in <START:ana> HDLM-1 cells <END> , and the presence of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) gene rearrangement <END> in <START:ana> KM-H2 cells <END> , some researchers have concluded that these <START:ana> long-term cell lines <END> derived from patients with Hodgkin 's disease are lymphoid in nature . 
The information obtained from these <START:ana> cell lines <END> has also been used in arguments for a lymphoid origin of <START:ana> H-RS cells <END> in tissue despite the frequent absence of <START:ggp> lymphoid markers <END> and <START:ggp> Ig/TcR gene rearrangements <END> in these cells . 
We questioned whether one can use the limited expression of <START:ggp> lymphoid markers <END> or the limited gene rearrangement to conclude that <START:ana> H-RS cells <END> have a lymphoid origin , because these markers may be aberrant in <START:ana> tumor cells <END> . 
In this study , we examined the expression of two <START:ggp> T-cell-specific transcription factors <END> ( <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> ) and one <START:ggp> B-cell-specific transcription factor <END> ( <START:ggp> BSAP <END> ) in <START:ana> cultured H-RS cells <END> by using a gel mobility shift assay . 
The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for determination of <START:ana> cell lineage <END> have been established in a large number of <START:ana> cultured human and murine cell lines <END> . 
All three types of <START:ana> H-RS cell lines <END> were consistently negative for <START:ggp> BSAP <END> , <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> . 
The absence of <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> was confirmed in <START:ana> H-RS cells <END> in tissues by an in situ hybridization technique . 
Virtually all <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> , with the exception of some <START:ana> myeloma cell lines <END> , are positive for <START:ggp> BSAP <END> , which is the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> for <START:ggp> promoters <END> for several <START:ggp> B-cell markers <END> , including <START:ggp> VpreB1 <END> , <START:ggp> lambda 5 <END> , <START:ggp> CD19 <END> , and <START:ggp> CD20 <END> . 
All <START:ana> T-cell lines <END> tested were positive for <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> , which are the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> for promoters for several <START:ggp> T-cell-restricted markers <END> , including <START:ggp> CD2 <END> , <START:ggp> CD3 <END> , <START:ggp> TcR <END> , and <START:ggp> lck <END> . 
The absence of <START:ggp> BSAP <END> , <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> clearly indicates an underlying difference between <START:ana> H-RS cells <END> and <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> MEK1 <END> and the <START:ggp> extracellular signal-regulated kinases <END> are required for the stimulation of <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> transcription in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> TCR <END> engagement stimulates the activation of the <START:ggp> protein kinase <END> <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> . 
Active <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> phosphorylates and activates the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> MEK1 <END> ) , which in turn phosphorylates and activates the <START:ggp> MAP kinases/extracellular signal regulated kinases <END> , <START:ggp> ERK1 <END> and <START:ggp> ERK2 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> activity promotes IL-2 production in activated <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Therefore , we sought to determine whether <START:ggp> MEK1 <END> and <START:ggp> ERK <END> activities also stimulate <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> transcription . 
Expression of constitutively active <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> or <START:ggp> MEK1 <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> enhanced the stimulation of <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> -driven transcription stimulated by a calcium ionophore and PMA , and together with a calcium ionophore the expression of each protein was sufficient to stimulate <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> activity . 
Expression of <START:ggp> MEK1-interfering mutants <END> inhibited the stimulation of <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> -driven transcription and blocked the ability of constitutively active <START:ggp> Ras <END> and <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> to costimulate <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> activity with a calcium ionophore . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> MAP kinase-specific phosphatase <END> , <START:ggp> MKP-1 <END> , which blocks <START:ggp> ERK <END> activation , inhibited <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> -driven transcription stimulated by a calcium ionophore and PMA , and in addition , <START:ggp> MKP-1 <END> neutralized the transcriptional enhancement caused by active Raf-1 and MEK1 expression . 
We conclude that the <START:ggp> MAP kinase <END> signal transduction pathway consisting of <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> , <START:ggp> MEK1 <END> , and <START:ggp> ERK1 <END> and <START:ggp> ERK2 <END> functions in the stimulation <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> transcription in activated <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Multiple <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are required for activation of <START:ggp> human interleukin 9 gene <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The genetic elements and regulatory mechanisms responsible for <START:ggp> human interleukin 9 ( IL-9 ) gene <END> expression in a <START:ana> human T cell leukemia virus type I-transformed human T cell line <END> , <START:ana> C5MJ2 <END> , were investigated . 
We demonstrated that <START:ggp> IL-9 gene <END> expression is controlled , at least in part , by transcriptional activation . 
Transient expression of the <START:ggp> luciferase reporter gene <END> linked to serially deleted sequences of the <START:ggp> 5'-flanking region <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-9 gene <END> has revealed several positive and <START:ggp> negative regulatory elements <END> involved in the basal and inducible expression of the <START:ggp> IL-9 gene <END> in <START:ana> C5MJ2 cells <END> . 
An AP-1 site at -146 to -140 was shown to be involved in the expression of the <START:ggp> IL-9 gene <END> . 
A <START:ggp> proximal region <END> between <START:ggp> -46 and -80 <END> was identified as the minimum sequence for the basal and inducible expression of the <START:ggp> IL-9 gene <END> in <START:ana> C5MJ2 cells <END> . 
Within this region , an <START:ggp> NF-kappaB site <END> at <START:ggp> -59 to -50 <END> and its adjacent <START:ggp> 20-base pair upstream sequence <END> were demonstrated to play a critical role for the <START:ggp> IL-9 promoter <END> activity . 
DNA-protein binding studies indicated that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> , and potentially <START:ggp> novel proteins <END> ( around <START:ggp> 35 kDa <END> ) can bind to this important sequence . 
Mutations at different sites within this <START:ggp> proximal promoter region <END> abolished the promoter activity as well as the DNA binding . 
Taken together , these results suggest that the cooperation of different <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> is essential for <START:ggp> IL-9 gene <END> expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
DNA triplex formation selectively inhibits <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene <END> expression in human T cells . 
<START:ggp> Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) is a hemopoietic growth factor that is expressed in activated T cells , fibroblasts , macrophages , and endothelial cells . 
Although <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> does not appear to be essential for normal hemopoiesis , overexpression of GM-CSF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some diseases such as myeloid leukemia and chronic inflammation . 
An <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> /Rel binding site within the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> , termed the kappaB element appears to be important for controlling expression in <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> assays in response to a number of stimuli in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
We investigated oligonucleotide-directed triple helix formation across this <START:ggp> regulatory sequence <END> as a potential tool to inhibit <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> gene transcription . 
A 15-base oligonucleotide , GM3 , was targeted to a <START:ggp> purine-rich region <END> in the <START:ggp> GM-CSF proximal promoter <END> , which overlaps the <START:ggp> kappaB element <END> . 
Gel mobility shift assays and <START:ggp> DNase I <END> footprinting demonstrated that GM3 formed a sequence-specific collinear triplex with its <START:ggp> double-stranded DNA target <END> . 
Triplex formation by GM3 blocked <START:ggp> recombinant and nuclear NF-kappaB proteins <END> binding to the <START:ggp> GM-CSF element <END> . 
GM3 also caused selective inhibition of the <START:ggp> human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 Tax <END> transactivator-induced <START:ggp> luciferase <END> activity from a reporter construct driven by the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
Finally , GM3 greatly reduced the concentration of endogenous <START:ana> GM-CSF mRNA <END> induced by different stimuli in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> but did not affect <START:ana> interleukin 3 mRNA <END> levels in the same cells . 
We conclude that the <START:ggp> kappaB element <END> in the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> plays a central role in the transcriptional activation of the endogenous <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> . 
Colinear triplex formation acts as a selective transcriptional repressor of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> and may have potential therapeutic application in cases of undesirable overexpression of this protein . 
Reversible differentiation of <START:ana> human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells <END> by ML-9 , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> myosin light chain kinase <END> . 
<START:ana> Human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells <END> are induced to differentiate into <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> by various agents . 
We have shown that 1- ( 5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl ) -1H-hexahydro-1 , 4-diazepine hydrochloride ( ML-9 ) , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> myosin light chain kinase <END> , induces differentiation of <START:ana> monocytoid leukemia cell lines <END> <START:ana> U937 <END> and <START:ana> THP-1 <END> but not of <START:ana> myeloblastic leukemic ML-1 cell <END> or <START:ana> erythroleukemia K562 cells <END> . 
In the present study , we further analyzed the effect of ML-9 in comparison with that of 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VD3 ) a typical inducer of monocytic differentiation . 
ML-9 induced nitroblue tetrazolium ( NBT ) -reducing activity of <START:ana> U937 cell <END> more rapidly than VD3 : This differentiation marker was induced significantly after incubation with ML-9 and VD3 for 4 hours and 1 day , respectively . 
ML-9 also induced <START:ggp> alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase <END> ( <START:ggp> ANAE <END> ) activity , another monocytic differentiation marker , more rapidly than VD3 . 
The maximum levels of these markers induced by ML-9 were comparable to those induced by VD3 , but after removal of ML-9 from the medium by washing the cells , the expressions of theses markers decreased within 4 hours and reached basal levels in 1 day , indicating that ML-9 's induction of expression of differentiation-associated phenotypes was reversible . 
The growth inhibition of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> by ML-9 was also reversible . 
Similar effects were observed in another line of <START:ana> human monoblastic cells <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 <END> . 
ML-9 had little or no effect on the morphology of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> but increased the expression of <START:ggp> monocyte-macrophage lineage-associated surface antigen <END> , <START:ggp> CD14 <END> , to some extent . 
Irreversible terminal differentiation induced by VD3 is associated with down regulation of the expression of c-myc and upregulation of the expression of c-fos and c-jun , but ML-9 did not affect the expression of these oncogenes appreciably . 
ML-9-induced differentiation was also reversible when the cells were cultured with cultured with ML-9 plus an anti-cancer drug such as 1-beta-D-arabino-furanosylcytosine or daunomycin . 
it became irreversible , however , upon simultaneous treatment with dexamethasone and <START:ggp> transforming growth factor-beta 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> TGF-beta 1 <END> ) , which did not induce differentiation of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> but caused growth arrest of the cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle . 
These results suggest that ML-9 should be useful for studying the mechanisms of monocytic differentiation . 
Modulation of endogenous <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor <END> antagonist results in opposing effects on HIV expression in <START:ana> chronically infected monocytic cells <END> . 
A proportion of HIV-infected individuals experience episodes of localized or systemic bacterial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria . 
Many of the clinical side effects of these infections are associated with the production of <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> , which are induced primarily by LPS , a constituent of the bacterial cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria . 
The present study examines the mechanisms involved in LPS-mediated induction of HIV expression in <START:ana> U1 cells <END> , a <START:ana> promonocytic cell line <END> chronically infected with HIV . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> U1 cells <END> by LPS alone induced minimal levels of HIV expression , which was significantly enhanced by <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) . 
Costimulation of <START:ana> U1 cells <END> with LPS plus <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> resulted in the accumulation of steady-state levels of <START:ana> HIV RNA <END> ; however , only a weak induction of <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> -driven transcription , which was not associated with the activation of the <START:ggp> cellular transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> , was noted . 
Costimulation of cells with LPS plus <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> induced the production of <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> and <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , but not <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-1 receptor <END> antagonist ( ra ) inhibited LPS enhancement of HIV expression in <START:ana> GM-CSF-stimulated cells <END> , suggesting that <START:ggp> endogenous IL-1 <END> was involved in LPS-mediated viral production . 
In this regard , <START:ggp> anti-inflammatory cytokines <END> inhibited LPS plus <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> -stimulated HIV expression , and this effect closely correlated with inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> release and , in particular , with up-regulation of endogenous IL-1ra production . 
Thus , the balance between an <START:ggp> endogenously produced viral inducer <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> ) and an inhibitor ( <START:ggp> IL-1ra <END> ) may represent an important pathway leading to modulation of HIV expression from <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
<START:ana> Herpesvirus saimiri immortalized gamma delta T cell line <END> activated by <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-12 <END> is a novel <START:ggp> heterodimeric cytokine <END> important for the regulation and differentiation of lymphocytes and NK cells . 
Like other cytokines , <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> mediates its biologic activity through high-affinity receptors expressed on <START:ana> responsive cells <END> . 
To date , a large number of receptors for <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> have been found only on <START:ana> PBMC <END> following activation with <START:ggp> PHA <END> or <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
To gain further knowledge of the <START:ggp> IL-12R complex <END> and the <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> signal transduction pathway in <START:ana> cytotoxic T cells <END> , we studied a number of <START:ana> human T cell lines <END> that had been transformed to permanent growth with Herpesvirus saimiri , an oncogenic virus of nonhuman primates . 
This paper reports the expression of <START:ggp> IL-12R <END> on a <START:ana> human gamma delta T cell line <END> that responds to <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> with enhanced cytolytic activity and increased expression of <START:ggp> cytolytic effector molecules <END> <START:ggp> granzyme B <END> and <START:ggp> perforin <END> . 
Using these <START:ana> T cells <END> as a model of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> signal transduction , we confirmed that these events involve members of the <START:ggp> Janus kinase family <END> of <START:ggp> nonreceptor tyrosine kinases <END> <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> , <START:ggp> TYK2 <END> , and <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 <END> . 
Regulation of gene expression at early stages of B-cell and T-cell differentiation . 
The expression of distinct sets of genes at different stages of B-lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte differentiation is controlled at the level of transcription . 
A number of recent studies have described interactions between <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in lymphocytes that provide new insights into mechanisms regulating gene expression . 
These mechanisms include the assembly of <START:ggp> higher order nucleoprotein complexes <END> and other protein-protein interactions that enhance the functional specificity of <START:ggp> transcriptional regulators <END> in lymphocytes . 
Identification of a <START:ggp> human LIM-Hox gene <END> , <START:ggp> hLH-2 <END> , aberrantly expressed in chronic myelogenous leukaemia and located on <START:ggp> 9q33-34.1 <END> . 
We describe the isolation of <START:ggp> human LH-2 <END> , a <START:ggp> putative transcription factor <END> containing two <START:ggp> cysteine-rich regions <END> ( <START:ggp> LIM domains <END> ) and a <START:ggp> homeobox ( Hox ) DNA-binding domain <END> . 
High levels of <START:ggp> hLH-2 <END> expression were observed in all cases of chronic myelogenous leukaemia ( CML ) tested , regardless of disease status . 
<START:ggp> hLH-2 <END> was mapped to <START:ggp> chromosome 9Q33-34.1 <END> , in the same region as the reciprocal translocation that creates the <START:ggp> BCR-ABL chimera <END> of the Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ' ) , the hallmark of CML ; <START:ggp> hLH-2 <END> was retained on the <START:ggp> derivative 9 chromosome <END> and is therefore centromeric of <START:ggp> c-ABL <END> . 
The proximity of <START:ggp> hLH-2 <END> to the breakpoint on <START:ggp> chromosome 9 <END> raises the possibility of cis-activation by the <START:ggp> t ( 9 ; 22 ) ( q34 ; q11 ) translocation <END> . 
In addition to finding <START:ggp> hLH-2 <END> expression in all cases of CML , expression was observed in lymphoid malignancies and <START:ana> myeloid cell lines <END> , but not in primary cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia . 
The role of <START:ggp> hLH-2 <END> in the development or progression of leukaemia is not known . 
However , <START:ggp> hLH-2 <END> may prove useful as a marker of CML for monitoring residual disease . 
Lymphoid cell resistance to glucocorticoids in HIV infection . 
In humans infected with the HIV-1 virus there may be a disproportionate severity of signs and symptoms of illness compared to the fraction of <START:ana> CD4+ infected T-lymphoid cells <END> . 
In part , this may be due to altered intercellular signalling systems and intracellular signal transduction . 
Glucocorticoids are well known for their effects on the vitality and function of <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
Patients with HIV infections often show elevated circulating levels of cortisol , suggesting some misfunction in the regulatory systems that maintain the levels of this critical hormone . 
At the cellular level , it is known that both acute HIV infection and glucocorticoids can cause apoptotic cell death in <START:ana> thymic lymphocytes <END> . 
However , <START:ana> chronically HIV-infected cells <END> appear to be resistant to glucocorticoid-evoked cell death . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptor <END> -ligand binding studies on patients ' cells have shown reduced affinity between the <START:ggp> receptor binding sites <END> and test steroids . 
In vitro , <START:ana> chronically HIV-infected cells <END> of the <START:ana> lymphoid CEM line <END> displayed resistance to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis . 
These cells showed reduced numbers of <START:ggp> binding sites <END> with little alteration in apparent affinity between ligand and receptor . 
Thus it appears that there may often be malfunction of the normal glucocorticoid response in <START:ana> HIV-infected cells <END> probably due to altered interactions between the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> and its hormone . 
Such alterations may have clinical consequences , including the possibility of a relatively longer life span of <START:ana> infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes <END> , as well as systemic effects of chronically elevated cortisol level . 
Abundant expression of <START:ana> erythroid transcription factor P45 NF-E2 mRNA <END> in <START:ana> human peripheral granurocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor NF-E2 <END> is crucial for regulation of erythroid-specific gene expression . 
<START:ggp> p45 subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-E2 <END> contains a <START:ggp> basic-leucine zipper domain <END> and dimerizes with the <START:ggp> small Maf family protein <END> to form functional <START:ggp> NF-E2 complex <END> . 
While <START:ggp> p45 <END> expression was shown to be restricted to <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> , <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> and <START:ana> mast cells <END> in hematopoietic lineage , we found in this study that <START:ana> p45 mRNA <END> is abundantly transcribed in the <START:ana> granulocyte fraction <END> of <START:ana> human peripheral blood cells <END> . 
As <START:ana> neutrophils <END> occupy approximately 92 % of the cells in <START:ana> granulocyte fraction <END> of <START:ana> human peripheral blood cells <END> . 
As <START:ana> neutrophils <END> occupy approximately 92 % of the cells in this fraction , the cells expressing <START:ggp> p45 <END> is most likely to be <START:ana> neutrophils <END> . 
<START:ana> p45 mRNA <END> is also expressed in <START:ana> HL-60 promyelocytes <END> , albeit the expression level is much lower than that of the <START:ana> granulocyte fraction <END> . 
<START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> were found to express <START:ana> mafK mRNA <END> , indicating the presence of genuine <START:ggp> NF-E2 complex <END> in the cells . 
Although <START:ana> p45 mRNA <END> is transcribed from two different promoters , <START:ggp> aNF-E2 promoter <END> and <START:ggp> fNF-E2 promoter <END> , in <START:ana> erythroid and megakaryocytic lineage cells <END> , <START:ana> p45 mRNA <END> is transcribed only from <START:ggp> aNF-E2 promoter <END> . 
The expression of <START:ggp> p45 <END> <START:ana> megakaryocytic lineage cells <END> , <START:ana> p45 mRNA <END> is transcribed only from <START:ggp> aNF-E2 promoter <END> . 
The expression of <START:ana> p45 mRNA <END> in the <START:ana> neutrophils <END> declined rapidly after transfer of the cells to in vitro culture and <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> could not sustain the expression from the down-regulation , suggesting the <START:ggp> E2 <END> may also participate in the regulation of neutrophil-specific gene expression . 
Expression of <START:ggp> c-fos and c-jun proteins <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding activity during cell cycle progression of <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> and <START:ana> phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes <END> . 
The protein products of the <START:ggp> c-fos <END> ( <START:ggp> p62c-fos <END> ) and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> ( <START:ggp> p39c-jun <END> ) genes are members of the <START:ggp> AP-1 transcription factor family <END> and are thought to play important roles in the regulation of gene expression during the cell cycle . 
Most studies on the expression of these proteins in relation to the cell cycle have been performed at the mRNA level , and therefore do not give direct information about the presence of the proteins during the cell cycle . 
We have used Western blotting to investigate the presence of these proteins during the cell cycles of two different <START:ana> cellular systems <END> : a <START:ana> continuously growing myeloid leukemic cell line <END> , <START:ana> HL60 <END> , and <START:ana> normal cells <END> stimulated into cycle , <START:ana> phyto- hemagglutinin ( PHA ) -stimulated normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBL <END> ) . 
The binding activity of transcription factor <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , which consists of dimers of <START:ggp> Fos and Jun family proteins <END> , was also studied using a gel shift assay . 
We found nuclear <START:ggp> p62c-fos <END> , <START:ggp> p39c-jun <END> , and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding activity throughout the cell cycle both in <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> and in <START:ana> PHA-stimulated PBL <END> , and we postulate that these proteins are required throughout the cell cycle and not transiently in the G0 to G1 transition as previous mRNA studies have indicated . 
We demonstrated an uncoupling of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding activity from <START:ggp> p62c-fos <END> , and <START:ggp> p39c-jun <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity was expressed more strongly in the G1- and G2/M-phase enriched samples than in the S-phase enriched samples of <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> , while levels of <START:ggp> nuclear p62c-fos and p39c-jun <END> were constant . 
Nuclei of <START:ana> unstimulated PBL <END> from different donors expressed <START:ggp> p62c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> p39c-jun <END> , but <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> was not detected in the majority of samples . 
Following <START:ggp> PHA <END> stimulation of <START:ana> PBL <END> , the increase in <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity was delayed with respect to the augmentation of <START:ggp> p39c-jun <END> expression . 
We also observed that <START:ggp> cytoplasmic p62c-fos and p39c-jun <END> were present in <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> and <START:ana> PHA-stimulated PBL <END> . 
However , no <START:ggp> cytoplasmic p62c-fos <END> was detected in <START:ana> unstimulated PBL <END> , although in some cases <START:ggp> cytoplasmic p39c-jun <END> was detected , suggesting that subcellular compartmentalization of these <START:ggp> proteins <END> may occur under certain circumstances . 
<START:ggp> Octamer binding factors <END> and their <START:ggp> coactivator <END> can activate the <START:ggp> murine PU.1 ( spi-1 ) promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> PU.1 <END> ( <START:ggp> spi-1 <END> ) , a member of the <START:ggp> Ets transcription factor family <END> , is predominantly expressed in <START:ana> myeloid and B cells <END> , activates many <START:ggp> B cell and myeloid genes <END> , and is critical for development of both of these lineages . 
Our previous studies ( Chen , H.M. , Ray-Gallet , D. , Zhang , P. , Hetherington , C.J. , Gonzalez , D.A. , Zhang , D.-E. , Moreau-Gachelin , F. , and Tenen , D.G. ( 1995 ) Oncogene 11 , 1549-1560 ) demonstrate that the <START:ggp> PU.1 promoter <END> directs <START:ggp> cell type-specific reporter gene <END> expression in myeloid cell lines , and that <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> activates its own promoter in an autoregulatory loop . 
Here we show that the <START:ggp> murine PU.1 promoter <END> is also specifically and highly functional in <START:ana> B cell lines <END> as well . 
<START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> can bind specifically to a site at base pair -55 in vitro , and this site is specifically protected in <START:ana> B cells <END> in vivo . 
We also demonstrate that two other sites contribute to promoter activity in <START:ana> B cells <END> ; an <START:ggp> Sp1 binding site <END> adjacent to the <START:ggp> octamer site <END> , and the <START:ggp> PU.1 autoregulatory site <END> . 
Finally , we show that the B cell <START:ggp> coactivator <END> <START:ggp> OBF-1/Bob1/OCA-B <END> is only expressed in <START:ana> B cells <END> and not in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> , and that <START:ggp> OBF-1/Bob1/OCA-B <END> can transactivate the <START:ggp> PU.1 promoter <END> in <START:ana> HeLa <END> and <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> . 
This <START:ggp> B cell restricted coactivator <END> may be responsible for the B cell specific expression of <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> mediated by the <START:ggp> octamer site <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> p105 <END> processing by <START:ggp> NF-kappaB proteins <END> in <START:ana> transiently transfected cells <END> . 
Regulation of the transcription factor <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> involves proteasome-mediated processing of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB1 p105 precursor protein <END> , which generates the <START:ggp> p50 subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
The processing of <START:ggp> p105 <END> occurs constitutively in vivo but can be markedly enhanced by various cellular activation agents , although the underlying regulatory mechanism is not yet clear . 
In the present study , we demonstrate that signal-mediated induction of <START:ggp> p105 <END> processing in <START:ana> human T cells <END> is associated with de novo synthesis of this <START:ggp> precursor protein <END> . 
Transient transfection studies performed in <START:ana> COS7 cells <END> revealed that the newly synthesized <START:ggp> p105 <END> protein appears to be more rapidly processed compared to its accumulated form that is already associated with the processed product <START:ggp> p50 <END> . 
Interestingly , the processing rate of <START:ggp> p105 <END> is markedly inhibited in cells co-transfected with <START:ggp> p50 <END> or other <START:ggp> NF-kappaB subunits <END> , including <START:ggp> RelA <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , that physically interact with <START:ggp> p105 <END> . 
These findings suggest that the processing of <START:ggp> p105 <END> is subject to negative regulation by the various <START:ggp> NF-kappaB subunits <END> . 
We further demonstrate that <START:ggp> p105 <END> undergoes degradation in <START:ana> lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytic cells <END> . 
However , the inducible degradation of <START:ggp> p105 <END> is not coupled with the generation of <START:ggp> p50 <END> . 
Together , these studies demonstrate that the processing and inducible degradation of <START:ggp> p105 <END> are differentially regulated . 
Identification of an <START:ggp> inducible regulator <END> of <START:ggp> c-myb <END> expression during <START:ana> T-cell <END> activation . 
<START:ana> Resting T cells <END> express very low levels of <START:ggp> c-Myb protein <END> . 
During T-cell activation , <START:ggp> c-myb <END> expression is induced and much of the increase in expression occurs at the transcriptional level . 
We identified a region of the <START:ggp> c-myb 5 ' flanking sequence <END> that increased <START:ggp> c-myb <END> expression during T-cell activation . 
In vivo footprinting by ligation-mediated PCR was performed to correlate in vivo protein binding with functional activity . 
A protein footprint was visible over this region of the <START:ggp> c-myb 5 ' flanking sequence <END> in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> but not in <START:ana> unactivated T cells <END> . 
An electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) with nuclear extract from <START:ana> activated T cells <END> and an oligonucleotide of this binding site demonstrated a new <START:ggp> protein-DNA complex <END> , referred to as <START:ggp> CMAT <END> for <START:ggp> c-myb in activated T cells <END> ; this complex was not present in <START:ana> unactivated T cells <END> . 
Because the <START:ggp> binding site <END> showed some sequence similarity with the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) binding site <END> , we compared the kinetics of induction of the two binding complexes and the molecular masses of the two proteins . 
Studies of the kinetics of induction showed that the <START:ggp> NFAT EMSA binding complex <END> appeared earlier than the <START:ggp> CMAT complex <END> . 
The <START:ggp> NFAT <END> protein migrated more slowly in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel than the <START:ggp> CMAT protein <END> did . 
In addition , an antibody against <START:ggp> NFAT <END> did not cross-react with the <START:ggp> CMAT protein <END> . 
The appearance of the <START:ggp> CMAT binding complex <END> was inhibited by both cyclosporin A and rapamycin . 
The <START:ggp> CMAT <END> protein appears to be a novel inducible protein involved in the regulation of <START:ggp> c-myb <END> expression during T-cell activation . 
CNI-1493 inhibits <START:ggp> monocyte/macrophage tumor necrosis factor <END> by suppression of translation efficiency . 
<START:ggp> Tumor necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) mediates a wide variety of disease states including septic shock , acute and chronic inflammation , and cachexia . 
Recently , a multivalent guanylhydrazone ( CNI-1493 ) developed as an inhibitor of macrophage activation was shown to suppress <START:ggp> TNF <END> production and protect against tissue inflammation and endotoxin lethality [ Bianchi , M. , Ulrich , P. , Bloom , O. , Meistrell , M. , Zimmerman , G.A. , Schmidtmayerova , H. , Bukrinsky , M. , Donnelley , T. , Bucala , R. , Sherry , B. , Manogue , K.R. , Tortolani , A.J. , Cerami , A. & Tracey , K.J. ( 1995 ) Mol.Med.1 , 254-266 , and Bianchi , M. , Bloom , O. , Raabe , T. , Cohen , P. S. , Chesney , J. , Sherry , B. , Schmidtmayerova , H. , Zhang , X. , Bukrinsky , M. , Ulrich , P. , Cerami , A. & Tracey , J. ( 1996 ) J.Exp.Med. , in press ] . 
We have now elucidated the mechanism by which CNI-1493 inhibits macrophage <START:ggp> TNF <END> synthesis and show here that it acts through suppression of <START:ggp> TNF <END> translation efficiency . 
CNI-1493 blocked neither the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced increases in the expression of <START:ana> TNF mRNA <END> nor the translocation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor NF-kappa B <END> to the nucleus in <START:ana> macrophages <END> activated by 15 min of LPS stimulation , indicating that CNI-1493 does not interfere with early <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -mediated transcriptional regulation of <START:ggp> TNF <END> . 
However , synthesis of the <START:ggp> 26-kDa membrane form <END> of <START:ggp> TNF <END> was effectively blocked by CNI-1493 . 
Further evidence for the translational suppression of <START:ggp> TNF <END> is given by experiments using <START:ggp> chloram-phenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) constructs <END> containing elements of the <START:ggp> TNF gene <END> that are involved in <START:ggp> TNF <END> translational regulation . 
Both the <START:ggp> 5 ' and 3 ' untranslated regions <END> of the <START:ggp> TNF gene <END> were required to elicit maximal translational suppression by CNI-1493 . 
Identification of the molecular target through which CNI- 1493 inhibits <START:ggp> TNF <END> translation should provide insight into the regulation of macrophage activation and mechanisms of inflammation . 
<START:ggp> Soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors <END> inhibit phorbol myristate acetate and cytokine-induced HIV-1 expression chronically <START:ana> infected U1 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) binding protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> r-h TBP-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> recombinant human soluble dimeric TNF receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> rhu TNFR : Fc <END> ) were used to determine the relative contributions of <START:ggp> TNF <END> to phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) and cytokine-induced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication in chronically infected cell lines . 
Treatment of <START:ana> HIV-1-infected promonocytic U1 cells <END> with <START:ggp> r-h-TBP-1 <END> or <START:ggp> rhu TNFR : Fc <END> reduced PMA-induced <START:ggp> HIV-1 p24 antigen <END> production in a concentration-dependent manner , with a maximal inhibition of approximately 90 % . 
Maximal inhibition of <START:ggp> p24 antigen <END> production in <START:ana> T-lymphocytic ACH-2 cells <END> was 47 % with <START:ggp> r-hTBP-1 <END> and 42 % with <START:ggp> rhu TNFR : Fc <END> . 
<START:ggp> r-hTBP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> rhu TNFR : Fc <END> also decreased <START:ggp> p24 antigen <END> synthesized by <START:ana> U1 cells <END> in response to other stimuli , including <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) -induced supernatant <END> , <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> , and <START:ggp> TNF <END> . 
Addition of <START:ggp> r-hTBP-1 <END> to <START:ana> U1 cells <END> during the last 4 h of a 24 h incubation with PMA still inhibited <START:ggp> p24 antigen <END> production by 15 % . 
<START:ana> U1 cells <END> stimulated with 10 ( -7 ) M PMA released approximately 1 ng/ml <START:ggp> endogenous TBP-1 <END> with an initial peak observed at 1 h and a second peak at 24 h after PMA stimulation . 
<START:ggp> r-hTBP-1 <END> also partially reversed inhibition of U1 cellular proliferation caused by PMA . 
Both <START:ggp> r-hTBP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> rhu TNFR : Fc <END> blocked PMA induction of <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NK ) - kappa B <END> DNA-binding activity in <START:ana> U1 cells <END> in association with decreases in HIV-1 replication . 
We conclude that soluble TNF receptors can inhibit stimuli-induced HIV-1 expression and <START:ggp> NK- kappa B <END> DNA-binding activity in chronically <START:ana> infected U1 cells <END> . 
Transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> RNA polymerase III-dependent genes <END> by the <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 tax protein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus-encoded tax protein <END> is a potent activator of many <START:ggp> viral and cellular genes <END> transcribed by <START:ggp> RNA polymerase II <END> . 
We find that both <START:ggp> chromatin <END> and cell extracts derived from <START:ana> human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-infected human T lymphocytes <END> support higher levels of 5S rRNA and tRNA gene transcription than <START:ggp> chromatin <END> or extracts from <START:ana> uninfected T lymphocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> viral protein Tax <END> was likely responsible for this higher level of <START:ggp> class II gene <END> transcription , as <START:ggp> purified Tax <END> was found to stimulate both genes when added to the uninfected cell extract or in reconstituted systems . 
Both limiting-component transcription assays and DNA binding assays identified the <START:ggp> class III gene transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> TFIIIB <END> as the principle target of <START:ggp> Tax <END> activity . 
Surprisingly , we find that <START:ggp> Tax <END> increases the effective concentration of <START:ggp> active TFIIIB molecules <END> . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> Tax <END> stimulates <START:ggp> RNA polymerase III-dependent gene <END> expression by accelerating the rate and/or extent of <START:ggp> transcription initiation complex <END> assembly . 
Expression of <START:ggp> Retinoid X Receptor alpha <END> is increased upon monocytic cell differentiation . 
1 alpha , 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VD ) is a potent inducer of monocytic differentiation of both <START:ana> normal and leukemic cells <END> . 
Its effects are mediated by its <START:ggp> nuclear receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) . 
Efficient gene activation requires the heterodimerization of <START:ggp> VDR <END> with <START:ggp> Retinoid X Receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RXR <END> ) . 
In the present study using <START:ggp> specific antibodies <END> , we analyzed the expression of the <START:ggp> RXR alpha protein <END> in <START:ana> blood mononuclear cells <END> from acute myeloid patients ( AML ) ( 10 cases ) and from <START:ana> myelomonocytic cell lines <END> arrested at different stages of differentiation . 
We observed that the <START:ggp> RXR alpha <END> expression increased during myelomonocytic differentiation , since the highest levels were found in AML samples and in <START:ana> myelomonocytic cell lines <END> having the highest amounts of <START:ana> monocytic precursors <END> . 
We also demonstrated that fresh <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> , whatever their stage of differentiation , as well as <START:ana> myelomonocytic cell lines <END> , respond to VD by an increase in <START:ggp> RXR alpha <END> levels . 
Combinations of all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) and VD , in some cases , increased this effect . 
This response suggests the involvement of <START:ggp> RXR alpha <END> in monocytic differentiation upon VD treatment . 
Expression of <START:ggp> p13MTCP1 <END> is restricted to mature T-cell proliferations with t ( X ; 14 ) translocations . 
T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia ( T-PLL ) , a rare form of mature T-cell leukemias , and ataxia telangiectasia clonal proliferation , a related condition occurring in patients suffering from ataxia telangiectasia , have been associated to translocations involving the <START:ggp> 14q32.1 <END> or <START:ggp> Xq28 regions <END> , where are located the <START:ggp> TCL1 and MTCP1 putative oncogenes <END> , respectively . 
The <START:ggp> MTCP1 gene <END> is involved in the <START:ggp> t ( X ; 14 ) ( q28 ; q11 ) translocation <END> associated with these T-cell proliferations . 
Alternative splicing generates <START:ana> type A and B transcripts <END> that potentially encode two entirely distinct proteins ; type <START:ana> A transcripts <END> code for a small <START:ggp> mitochondrial protein <END> , <START:ggp> p8MTCP1 <END> , and <START:ana> type B transcripts <END> , containing an additional <START:ggp> open reading frame <END> , may code for <START:ggp> 107 amino-acid protein <END> , <START:ggp> p13MTCP1 <END> . 
The recently cloned <START:ggp> TCL1 gene <END> , also involved in translocations and inversions associated with T-cell proliferations , codes for a <START:ggp> 14-kD protein <END> that displays significant homology with <START:ggp> p13MTCP1 <END> . 
We have generated rabbit antisera against this putative <START:ggp> p13MTCP1 protein <END> and screened for expression of <START:ggp> p13MTCP1 <END> normal lymphoid tissues and 33 cases of <START:ana> immature and mature lymphoid T-cell proliferations <END> using a sensitive Western blot assay . 
We also investigated the <START:ggp> MTCP1 locus <END> configuration by Southern blot analysis . 
The <START:ggp> p13MTCP1 protein <END> was detected in the three T-cell proliferations with <START:ggp> MTCP1 rearrangements <END> because of t ( X ; 14 ) translocations , but neither in normal resting and <START:ana> activated lymphocytes <END> nor in the other <START:ana> T-cell <END> leukemias . 
Our data support the hypothesis that <START:ggp> p13MTCP1 <END> and <START:ggp> p14TCL1 <END> form a new <START:ggp> protein family <END> that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of T-PLL and related conditions . 
Preassociation of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> with <START:ggp> STAT2 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> in separate <START:ggp> signalling complexes <END> prior to <START:ggp> cytokine <END> stimulation . 
A variety of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> growth factors <END> act through an induction of gene expression mediated by a family of <START:ggp> latent transcription factors <END> called <START:ggp> STAT ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) proteins <END> . 
Ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> STATs <END> promotes their homodimer and heterodimer formation and subsequent nuclear translocation . 
We demonstrate here that <START:ggp> STAT protein heterocomplexes <END> exist prior to <START:ggp> cytokine <END> treatment . 
When <START:ana> unstimulated HeLa cells <END> are ruptured in hypotonic buffer without salt or detergent , immunoadsorption of either <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> or <START:ggp> STAT2 <END> from the resulting cytosol yields coimmunoadsorption of the other <START:ggp> STAT protein <END> . 
Similarly , <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> <START:ggp> -STAT3 <END> heterocomplexes are coimmunoadsorbed from hypotonic cytosol . 
<START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT2 <END> or <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> translated in reticulocyte lysate spontaneously form heterocomplexes when the translation lysates are mixed at 0 degrees C . 
Our data suggest that <START:ggp> interferon-alpha <END> /beta-induced tyrosine phosphorylation increases the stability of a preexisting , latent , <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> - <START:ggp> STAT2 signaling complex <END> . 
Newly translated <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> binds in equilibrium fashion to <START:ggp> STAT2 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> , but we show that <START:ggp> STAT2 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> exist in separate <START:ggp> heterocomplexes <END> with <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> , consistent with a model in which <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> contains a common binding site for other <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interferon-gamma <END> modulates the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> at the mRNA and protein level in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) modulates the expression of several <START:ggp> cytokines <END> by <START:ana> human monocytes <END> at the transcriptional level . 
In view of these findings , we analyzed the effects of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> on the expression of different <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in activated <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Priming of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> resulted in the down regulation of <START:ana> c-fos and c-jun mRNA <END> in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) compared to the effects of LPS alone . 
Not only was this effect observed at the mRNA level , but <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) DNA binding capacity was affected as well , A strong reduction was observed in the LPS-induced DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> in the presence of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
<START:ana> LPS-stimulated monocytes <END> showed an increased expression of <START:ana> p105 mRNA <END> , the precursor of the <START:ggp> p50 subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) , while no effect was noticed on the expression of <START:ana> p65 mRNA <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> priming did not affect the expression of <START:ana> p105 transcripts <END> but enhanced the expression of <START:ana> p65 mRNA <END> ( two-fold ) . 
Priming with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> followed by LPS stimulation resulted in a further increase in the expression of <START:ana> p65 mRNA <END> . 
This was due to an increase in the half-life of <START:ana> p65 mRNA <END> ( 75 vs 150 minutes ) . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) demonstrated that unstimulated monocytes predominantly expressed <START:ggp> p50 <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Stimulation with LPS or <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> resulted in the expression of <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 subunits <END> , while the combination of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> plus LPS caused a further increase in the expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
With Western blotting , it was shown that nuclear extracts from <START:ana> monocytes <END> contained <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 protein <END> in response to LPS and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> stimulation . 
However , the combined stimulation did not result in enhanced <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 protein <END> expression . 
The effects of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> on the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> were specific , since no change was observed in the expression of <START:ggp> NF-IL-6 <END> or <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> , the inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
We conclude that the effects of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> on the expression of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> may be important for the modulatory effects of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> on the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression in activated <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> HIV-1 tat <END> induces the expression of a new <START:ggp> hematopoietic cell-specific transcription factor <END> and downregulates <START:ggp> MIP-1 alpha gene <END> expression in <START:ana> activated T-cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> MIP-1 alpha <END> is a secreted <START:ggp> chemokine <END> which can inhibit <START:ana> hematopoietic stem cells <END> and modulate inflammatory responses . 
It is also an inhibitor of HIV replication in <START:ana> CD8+ T-cells <END> . 
The expression of <START:ggp> MIP-1 alpha <END> is induced during cellular activation of <START:ana> CD4+ T-cells <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
It is also expressed in <START:ana> transformed B-cells <END> . 
We have previously identified a new <START:ggp> transcription factor family <END> ( the <START:ggp> MNP family <END> ) whose expression is crucial for the induction of <START:ggp> MIP-1 alpha <END> transcription during cellular activation and in <START:ana> transformed B cells <END> . 
Monocytes and <START:ana> transformed B-cells <END> normally express <START:ggp> MNP-1 <END> strongly and <START:ggp> MNP-2 <END> weakly , while T-cells strongly express only <START:ggp> MNP-2 <END> . 
Recently , we reported that <START:ggp> HIV-1 tat <END> downregulates <START:ggp> MIP-1 alpha <END> expression in <START:ana> Jurkat T-cells <END> . 
In this report we show induction of <START:ggp> MNP-1 <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T-cells <END> expressing <START:ggp> HIV-1 tat <END> . 
Expression of neither <START:ggp> HTLV-1 tax <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T-cells <END> nor EBV in <START:ana> B-cells <END> had any effect on <START:ggp> MNP-1 <END> or <START:ggp> MNP-2 <END> expression , showing that the effect is specific for <START:ggp> HIV-1 tat <END> . 
We propose that <START:ggp> HIV-1 tat <END> may inhibit <START:ggp> MIP-1 alpha <END> expression by inducing <START:ggp> MNP-1 <END> expression in <START:ana> T-cells <END> , probably by either competing with <START:ggp> MNP-2 <END> for binding to the <START:ggp> MIP-1 alpha promoter <END> or by sequestering it into inactive forms . 
Differentiation of <START:ana> T-helper lymphocytes <END> : selective regulation by members of the <START:ggp> STAT family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) and <START:ggp> interleukin-12 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> ) control the differentiation of <START:ana> T-helper cells <END> . 
Here we summarize studies which investigate the mechanism by which these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> selectively reprogramme gene expression in <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Cytokine <END> stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the <START:ggp> intracellular domain <END> of the corresponding <START:ggp> cytokine receptor <END> . 
These phosphotyrosines serve as <START:ggp> docking sites <END> for latent , <START:ggp> cytoplasmic transcription factors <END> known as <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat ) proteins <END> . 
Receptor/Stat interaction is mediated by the <START:ggp> src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain <END> of the corresponding <START:ggp> Stat protein <END> . 
Although Stat binding to the <START:ggp> intracellular domain <END> of the <START:ggp> cytokine receptor <END> strongly depends on the phosphotyrosine residue , the recruitment of a specific <START:ggp> Stat protein <END> is dictated by amino acid residues C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine . 
Specific <START:ggp> docking sites <END> within individual <START:ggp> cytokine receptors <END> have been identified for almost all <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> . 
The direct coupling between <START:ggp> cytokine receptor <END> and <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> helps to explain how different <START:ggp> cytokines <END> elicit distinct patterns of gene expression . 
Role of <START:ggp> EGR1 <END> in regulation of stimulus-dependent <START:ggp> CD44 <END> transcription in B lymphocytes . 
The <START:ggp> immediate-early gene <END> <START:ggp> egr-1 <END> encodes a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> ( <START:ggp> EGR1 <END> ) that links <START:ggp> B-cell antigen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> BCR <END> ) signals to downstream activation events through the regulation of previously unidentified <START:ggp> target genes <END> . 
Here we identify the gene encoding the <START:ggp> lymphocyte homing and migration protein <END> <START:ggp> CD44 <END> as a target of <START:ggp> EGR1 <END> regulation in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> BCR <END> -induced increases in <START:ana> CD44 mRNA <END> expression and transcription levels are shown to occur in <START:ana> EGR1-expressing but not in nonexpressing subclones <END> of the <START:ana> B-cell line <END> <START:ana> WEHI-231 <END> . 
Kinetics of <START:ggp> egr-1 <END> transcription and the appearance of nuclear <START:ggp> EGR1 protein <END> precede <START:ggp> CD44 <END> induction and occur within 30 min after stimulation in the <START:ana> EGR1-expressing subclone <END> . 
A single <START:ggp> EGR1 <END> binding motif is demonstrated at bp -301 of the <START:ggp> human CD44 promoter <END> . 
Cotransfection of a <START:ggp> CD44 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct <END> with an <START:ggp> egr-1 expression vector <END> resulted in a 6.5- to 8.5-fold induction of transcriptional activity relative to an <START:ggp> empty expression vector <END> . 
The <START:ggp> EGR1 binding motif <END> was shown to be necessary for stimulus-induced expression of a <START:ggp> CD44 <END> <START:ggp> promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct <END> in <START:ana> nontransformed B lymphocytes <END> and was required for transactivation by an <START:ggp> EGR1 expression vector <END> in a <START:ana> B-cell line <END> . 
These studies identify <START:ggp> EGR1 <END> as an intermediary linking <START:ggp> BCR <END> -derived signals to the induction of <START:ggp> CD44 <END> . 
The relevance of these molecular events to <START:ggp> BCR <END> signal transduction and antigen-stimulated B-cell-mediated immune responses is discussed . 
Involvement of intracellular Ca2+ in oxidant-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
In <START:ana> human Jurkat T cells <END> and its subclone <START:ana> Wurzburg cells <END> oxidant challenge elevated [ Ca2+ ] i by mobilizing Ca2+ from intracellular stores . 
In <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> this effect was rapid and transient , but in <START:ana> Wurzburg cells <END> the response was slow and sustained . 
H2O2-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> Wurzburg cells <END> was not influenced by the presence of extracellular EGTA but was totally inhibited in cells that were loaded with esterified EGTA . 
In <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> that are not sensitive to H2O2-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation , H2O2 potentiated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in the presence of sustained high [ Ca2+ ] i following thapsigargin treatment . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> regulatory effect of alpha-lipoate and N-acetylcysteine appeared to be , at least in part , due to their ability to stabilize elevation of [ Ca2+ ] i following oxidant challenge . 
Results of this study indicate that a sustained elevated [ Ca2+ ] i is a significant factor in oxidant-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
Transactivation of the <START:ggp> interleukin-1alpha promoter <END> by <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type I and type II Tax proteins <END> . 
<START:ana> Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) -infected T-cell lines <END> constitutively produce high levels of <START:ggp> interleukin-1alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1alpha <END> ) . 
To analyze the mechanisms that lead to the expression of <START:ggp> IL-1alpha <END> in <START:ana> HTLV-I-infected cell lines <END> , we studied regulatory regions of the human <START:ggp> IL-1alpha promoter <END> involved in activation of the <START:ggp> IL-1alpha gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-1alpha promoter constructs <END> drive transcription of the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene <END> in <START:ana> HTLV-I-positive MT-2 cells <END> , which constitutively produce <START:ggp> IL-1alpha <END> . 
In a cotransfection assay , the <START:ggp> Tax protein <END> of both HTLV-I and HTLV-II specifically activated transcription from the <START:ggp> IL-1alpha promoter <END> in an <START:ana> uninfected Jurkat cell line <END> . 
A mutant <START:ggp> Tax protein <END> deficient in transactivation of genes by the <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB <END> pathway was unable to induce transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> IL-1alpha promoter-CAT constructs <END> , but was rescued by exogenous provision of <START:ggp> p65/p50 <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
We found that two <START:ggp> IL-1alpha kappaB-like sites <END> ( positions <START:ggp> -1 , 065 to -1 , 056 <END> and <START:ggp> +646 to +655 <END> ) specifically formed a complex with <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -containing nuclear extract from <START:ana> MT-2 cells <END> and that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> bound with higher affinity to the <START:ggp> 3 ' NF-kappaB binding site <END> than to the <START:ggp> 5 ' NF-kappaB site <END> . 
Moreover , deletion of either <START:ggp> 5 ' or 3 ' NF-kappaB sites <END> reduced <START:ggp> IL-1alpha promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> MT-2 cells <END> and transactivation of the <START:ggp> IL-1alpha promoter <END> by exogenous <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> Tax <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
These data suggest a general role for <START:ggp> Tax <END> induction of <START:ggp> IL-1alpha gene <END> transcription by the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> pathway . 
Expression of <START:ggp> IL-1alpha <END> by HTLV-I productively <START:ana> infected cells <END> may be important in the hypercalcemia , osteolytic bone lesions , neutrophilia , elevation of <START:ggp> C-reactive protein <END> , and fever frequently seen in patients with HTLV-I-induced adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma . 
The <START:ggp> myeloid-cell-specific c-fes promoter <END> is regulated by <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , and a novel <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
The protein product of the <START:ggp> c-fps/fes ( c-fes ) proto-oncogene <END> has been implicated in the normal development of <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> ( <START:ana> macrophages <END> and <START:ana> neutrophils <END> ) . 
mRNA for c-fes has been detected exclusively in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> and <START:ana> vascular endothelial cells <END> in adult mammals . 
Although a <START:ggp> 13-kilobase-pair ( kb ) human c-fes transgene <END> exhibits high levels of expression in mice , the sequences that confer myeloid-cell-specific expression of the <START:ggp> human c-fes gene <END> have not been defined . 
Transient-transfection experiments demonstrated that <START:ggp> plasmids <END> containing 446 bp of <START:ggp> c-fes 5'-flanking sequences <END> linked to a luciferase reporter gene were active exclusively in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> . 
No other DNA element within the <START:ggp> 13-kb human c-fes locus <END> contained <START:ggp> positive cis-acting elements <END> , with the exception of a weakly active region within the <START:ggp> 3'-flanking sequences <END> . 
DNase I footprinting assays revealed four distinct sites that bind <START:ggp> myeloid nuclear proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> -408 to -386 <END> , <START:ggp> -293 to -254 <END> , <START:ggp> -76 to -65 <END> , and <START:ggp> -34 to +3 <END> ) . 
However , the first two footprints resided in sequences that were largely dispensable for transient activity . 
Plasmids containing <START:ggp> 151 bp <END> of <START:ggp> 5'-flanking sequences <END> confer myeloid-cell-specific gene expression . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses demonstrated that the <START:ggp> 151-bp region <END> contains <START:ggp> nuclear protein binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , and/or <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> , and a <START:ggp> novel factor <END> . 
This unidentified factor binds immediately 3 ' of the <START:ggp> PU.1/Elf-1 sites <END> and appears to be myeloid cell specific . 
Mutation of the <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> <START:ggp> /Elf-1 <END> site or the <START:ggp> 3 ' site <END> ( <START:ggp> FP4-3 ' <END> ) within the context of the <START:ggp> c-fes promoter <END> resulted in substantially reduced activity in transient transfections . 
Furthermore , transient-cotransfection assay demonstrated that <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> ( and not <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> ) can transactivate the <START:ggp> c-fes promoter <END> in <START:ana> nonmyeloid cell lines <END> . 
We conclude that the <START:ggp> human c-fes gene <END> contains a strong <START:ggp> myeloid-cell-specific promoter <END> that is regulated by <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , and a novel <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibits <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel <END> nuclear activity in <START:ana> CD3-stimulated human peripheral T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> markedly reduces nuclear factor <START:ggp> ( NF ) -kappa B/Rel <END> nuclear activity induced in <START:ana> PBMC <END> by stimulation with the <START:ggp> anti-CD3 mAb <END> <START:ggp> OKT3 <END> . 
The inhibition is exerted specifically on the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> activation induced by <START:ggp> mAb OKT3 <END> , and not that produced by PMA . 
As judged by supershifting the <START:ggp> DNA-protein complexes <END> with <START:ggp> Abs <END> recognizing specific components of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel protein family <END> , the <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> ( <START:ggp> Rel A <END> ) heterodimeric form of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is primarily affected . 
The maximal effect is observed at the <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> concentration of 20 U/ml . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibitory activity is exerted on <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> and is mediated by <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Indeed , <START:ana> monocytes <END> pretreated with <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> are able so inhibit <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> nuclear activity in purified <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> stimulated with <START:ggp> OKT3 <END> . 
Soluble factors do not appear to be involved in the mechanism of inhibition . 
On the other hand , the up-regulation of <START:ggp> CD80 Ag <END> , found on <START:ana> monocytes <END> obtained from <START:ana> PBMC <END> incubated with <START:ggp> OKT3 <END> , is not detected after addition of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , and the <START:ggp> anti-CD28 mAb <END> <START:ggp> CLB-CD28/1 <END> restores the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> nuclear activity in <START:ana> IL-10-inhibited lymphocytes <END> . 
Therefore , the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> inhibition might be ascribed to a lack of cooperation between accessory cells and <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , resulting from down-regulation of a costimulatory molecule , such as <START:ggp> CD80 <END> , produced by <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> on activated <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Our results demonstrate that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> can inhibit the induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> nuclear activity in <START:ana> CD3-stimulated T lymphocytes <END> . 
Since inappropriate activation of <START:ggp> kappa B-driven genes <END> has a physiopathologic role in a number of diseases , such as HIV infection , our findings support the possibility of using this cytokine to suppress an undesirable activation of these <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> A-myb <END> , but not <START:ggp> c-myb <END> and <START:ggp> B-myb <END> , is restricted to Burkitt 's lymphoma , sIg+ B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia , and a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemias . 
The <START:ggp> A-myb gene <END> encodes a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> that is related both functionally and structurally to the <START:ggp> v-myb oncogene <END> . 
Following our observations that <START:ggp> A-myb <END> is expressed in a restricted subset of normal <START:ana> mature human B lymphocytes <END> , with the phenotype CD38+ , CD39- , slgM- , we have now investigated the pattern of <START:ggp> A-myb <END> expression in neoplastic <START:ana> B cells <END> representating the whole spectrum of B-cell differentiation and compared it to that of <START:ggp> c-myb <END> and <START:ggp> B-myb <END> . 
In a panel of 32 <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> , <START:ggp> A-myb <END> was very strongly expressed in most Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) cell lines , but weak or negative in 2 pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , 4 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , 6 <START:ana> Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> , and 6 <START:ana> myeloma lines <END> . 
Protein expression paralleled that of the RNA . 
We have also investigated <START:ggp> A-myb <END> expression in 49 fresh cases of B leukemias . 
Among 24 ALL , 6 were of the null and 11 of the common type and all these were negative for <START:ggp> A-myb <END> expression ; on the other hand , all 7 B-ALL cases ( slg+ ) , as well as one fresh BL case with bone marrow infiltration , expressed <START:ggp> A-myb <END> . 
<START:ggp> A-myb <END> was undetectable in 4 prolymphocytic leukemias ( PLL ) but was strongly expressed in 5/20 ( 25 % ) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) samples . 
In the latter <START:ggp> A-myb <END> did not correlate with phenotype or clinical stage . 
Finally , we have studied the progression of one case of CLL into Richter 's syndrome and have found that the <START:ana> Richter 's cells <END> expressed about 25-fold less <START:ana> A-myb RNA <END> than the <START:ana> CLL cells <END> from the same patient. The pattern of <START:ggp> c-myb <END> and <START:ggp> B-myb <END> was clearly distinct from that of <START:ggp> A-myb <END> . 
C-myb and <START:ggp> B-myb <END> were expressed in all neoplastic groups , except in <START:ana> CLL cells <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> A-myb <END> expression , unlike that of <START:ggp> c-myb <END> and <START:ggp> B-myb <END> , is restricted to a subset of B-cell neoplasias ( in particular BL and slg+B-ALL ) representative of a specific stage of B-cell differentiation . 
This expression may in part reflect expression of <START:ggp> A-myb <END> by the normal germinal center <START:ana> B cells <END> that are the normal counterpart of these <START:ana> transformed B cells <END> . 
The data presented strongly support a role for this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> in B-cell differentiation and perhaps in B-cell transformation in some neoplasias . 
<START:ggp> Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> stimulates <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> signaling pathway and rapidly activates <START:ggp> p93fes <END> , <START:ggp> STAT1 p91 <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT3 p92 <END> in <START:ana> polymorphonuclear leukocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) , supports proliferation , differentiation , and functional activation of hemopoietic cells by its interaction with a heterodimeric receptor . 
Although <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> receptor is devoid of <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> enzymatic activity , <START:ana> GM-CSF-induced peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PMN <END> ) functional activation is mediated by the phosphorylation of a large number of <START:ggp> intracellular signaling molecules <END> . 
We have previously shown that <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> in <START:ana> PMN <END> . 
In the present study we demonstrate that also the <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) family members <END> <START:ggp> STAT1 p91 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 p92 <END> and the product of the <START:ggp> c-fps/fes protooncogene <END> become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> stimulation and physically associated with both <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> receptor beta common subunit and <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> . 
Moreover <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> was able to induce <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> and <START:ggp> p93fes <END> catalytic activity . 
We also demonstrate that the association of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF receptor beta common subunit <END> with <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> is ligand-dependent . 
Finally we demonstrate that <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> induces a <START:ggp> DNA-binding complex <END> that contains both <START:ggp> p91 <END> and <START:ggp> p92 <END> . 
These results identify a new signal transduction pathway activated by <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> and provide a mechanism for rapid activation of gene expression in <START:ana> GM-CSF-stimulated PMN <END> . 
<START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA2 ) -oestrogen receptor fusion proteins <END> complement the EBNA2-deficient Epstein-Barr virus strain P3HR1 in transformation of <START:ana> primary B cells <END> but suppress growth of <START:ana> human B cell lymphoma lines <END> . 
To develop a transformation system with a conditional <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA2 ) gene <END> , we fused the <START:ggp> hormone binding domain <END> of the oestrogen receptor to the <START:ggp> N or C terminus <END> of <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> . 
In promoter transactivation as well as primary B cell transformation assays these chimeric <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> proteins are able to substitute for <START:ggp> wild-type EBNA2 <END> in the presence of oestrogen . 
Here we provide evidence that this transformation is the result of double infection of a cell with two virions , the <START:ggp> P3HR1 virus genome <END> and a <START:ggp> mini-EBV plasmid <END> carrying the chimeric <START:ggp> EBNA2 gene <END> . 
Unexpectedly , expression of the same <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> -oestrogen receptor fusion protein in <START:ana> established human B cell lymphoma lines <END> resulted in growth retardation or growth arrest upon the addition of oestrogen . 
By titrating the oestrogen concentration in these <START:ana> stably transfected cells <END> , the growth retarding and the transactivating function of the <START:ggp> chimeric proteins <END> could not be dissociated . 
We propose that growth inhibition of established <START:ana> B cell lymphoma lines <END> is a novel function of <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> which has not been detected in the absence of an inducible system . 
It remains open whether the growth retarding property of the <START:ggp> EBNA2-oestrogen receptor fusion protein <END> in <START:ana> B cell lymphoma lines <END> is due to unphysiologically high expression of the <START:ggp> chimeric protein <END> or to interference with a cellular programme driving proliferation in these <START:ana> cell lines <END> . 
Tissue-specific activity of the <START:ggp> gammac chain gene promoter <END> depends upon an <START:ggp> Ets binding site <END> and is regulated by <START:ggp> GA-binding protein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> gammac chain <END> is a subunit of multiple <START:ggp> cytokine receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> ) , the expression of which is restricted to <START:ana> hematopoietic lineages <END> . 
A defect in gammac leads to the X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by a block in T cell differentiation . 
In order to better characterize the <START:ggp> human gammac promoter <END> and define the <START:ggp> minimal tissue-specific promoter region <END> , progressive <START:ggp> 5'-deletion constructs <END> of a segment extending <START:ggp> 1053 base pairs upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> major transcription start site <END> were generated and tested for promoter activity in various <START:ana> hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types <END> . 
The <START:ggp> -1053/+34 construct <END> allowed promoter activity only in cells of <START:ana> hematopoietic origin <END> , and tissue specificity was conserved in all other constructs tested . 
The region downstream of -90 appeared critical for basal promoter activity . 
It contains two potential <START:ggp> Ets binding sites <END> conserved in the <START:ggp> murine gammac promoter gene <END> , one of which was found essential for functional promoter activity as determined by mutational analysis . 
The functional <START:ggp> Ets binding site <END> was found to bind <START:ggp> Ets family proteins <END> , principally <START:ggp> GA-binding protein <END> and <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> and could be transactivated by <START:ggp> GABPalpha <END> and <START:ggp> -beta <END> synergistically . 
These results indicate that , as already reported for the <START:ggp> IL2Rbeta promoter <END> , <START:ggp> GA-binding protein <END> is an essential component of gammac basal promoter activity . 
Although <START:ggp> GABP <END> expression is not restricted to the <START:ana> hematopoietic lineage <END> , its interaction with other <START:ggp> specific factors <END> may contribute to the tissue-specific expression of the <START:ggp> gammac gene <END> . 
Detection of <START:ggp> intracellular signal transduction molecules <END> in <START:ana> PBMC <END> from rhesus macaques and sooty mangabeys . 
One of the manifestations of human HIV-1 and nonhuman primate SIV infection that lead to disease is reasoned to be secondary to generalized T-cell dysfunction . 
The molecular mechanisms associated with the T-cell dysfunction remain to be elucidated . 
To address this issue , we sought to utilize the nonhuman primate model to study intracellular signaling events in cells from disease-susceptible rhesus macaques and disease-resistant sooty mangabeys . 
Because relatively little is known about these events in nonhuman primates , our laboratory defined optimal conditions , reagents , and assays for the study of signal transduction events in cells from nonhuman primates . 
The protein phosphorylation patterns in the two monkeys exhibited quantitative , qualitative , and kinetic differences . 
Antibodies to <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> detected a unique band in macaque cell lysates . 
This band is markedly decreased human cell lysates and never seen in mangabey cell lysates . 
Detection of various other <START:ggp> intracellular signaling proteins <END> is also described . 
Genetic characterization of transactivation of the <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 promoter <END> : Binding of <START:ggp> Tax <END> to <START:ggp> Tax-responsive element 1 <END> is mediated by the <START:ggp> cyclic AMP-responsive members <END> of the <START:ggp> CREB/ATF family <END> of transcription factors . 
To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by <START:ggp> Tax <END> of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 <START:ggp> Tax-responsive element 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> TRE-1 <END> ) , we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae . 
We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the <START:ggp> lacZ gene <END> under the control of the <START:ggp> CYC1 promoter <END> associated with three copies of <START:ggp> TRE-1 <END> . 
Expression of either the <START:ggp> cyclic AMP response element-binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> CREB <END> ) or <START:ggp> CREB <END> fused to the <START:ggp> GAL4 activation domain <END> ( <START:ggp> GAD <END> ) in this strain did not modify the expression of the <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> alone was also inactive . 
However , expression of the <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> was induced by coexpression of <START:ggp> Tax <END> and <START:ggp> CREB <END> . 
This effect was stronger with the <START:ggp> GAD-CREB fusion protein <END> . 
Analysis of different <START:ggp> CREB mutants <END> with this genetic system indicated that the <START:ggp> C-terminal 92 amino acid residues <END> , which include the <START:ggp> basic domain <END> and the <START:ggp> leucine zipper <END> , are necessary and sufficient to mediate transactivation by <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
To identify <START:ggp> cellular proteins <END> binding to <START:ggp> TRE-1 <END> in a <START:ggp> Tax <END> -dependent manner , this strain was also used to screen a library of <START:ggp> human cDNAs <END> fused to <START:ggp> GAD <END> . 
Of five positive clones isolated from 0.75 x 10 ( 6 ) yeast colonies , four were members of the <START:ggp> CREB/activating transcription factor ( ATF ) family <END> : <START:ggp> CREB <END> , <START:ggp> two isoforms of the cyclic AMP-responsive element modulator <END> ( <START:ggp> CREM <END> ) , and <START:ggp> ATF-1 <END> . 
Interestingly , these three proteins can be phosphorylated by <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> and thus form a particular subgroup within the <START:ggp> CREB/ATF family <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> ATF-2 <END> in S. cerevisiae did not activate <START:ggp> TRE-1 <END> in the presence of <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
This shows that in a eukaryotic nucleus , <START:ggp> Tax <END> specifically interacts with the <START:ggp> basic domain-leucine zipper region <END> of <START:ggp> ATF-1 <END> , <START:ggp> CREB <END> , and <START:ggp> CREM <END> . 
The fifth clone identified in this screening corresponded to the <START:ggp> Ku autoantigen p70 subunit <END> . 
When fused to <START:ggp> GAD <END> , the <START:ggp> C-terminal region <END> of <START:ggp> Ku <END> was able to activate transcription via <START:ggp> TRE-1 <END> but this activation was not dependent on <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
A <START:ggp> mammalian histone deacetylase <END> related to the <START:ggp> yeast transcriptional regulator <END> <START:ggp> Rpd3p <END> [ see comments ] 
Trapoxin is a microbially derived cyclotetrapeptide that inhibits <START:ggp> histone <END> deacetylation in vivo and causes mammalian cells to arrest in the cell cycle . 
A trapoxin affinity matrix was used to isolate two nuclear proteins that copurified with <START:ggp> histone deacetylase <END> activity . 
Both proteins were identified by peptide microsequencing , and a <START:ggp> complementary DNA <END> encoding the <START:ggp> histone deacetylase catalytic subunit <END> ( <START:ggp> HD1 <END> ) was cloned from a human Jurkat T cell library . 
As the predicted protein is very similar to the <START:ggp> yeast transcriptional regulator <END> <START:ggp> Rpd3p <END> , these results support a role for <START:ggp> histone deacetylase <END> as a key regulator of eukaryotic transcription . 
Coexpression of the <START:ggp> interleukin-13 and interleukin-4 genes <END> correlates with their physical linkage in the <START:ggp> cytokine gene cluster <END> on <START:ggp> human chromosome 5q23-31 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-13 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> ) and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> are cytokines produced by T cells that are encoded by the q23-31 region of human chromosome 5 . 
To investigate the regulation of <START:ggp> IL-13 gene <END> expression by <START:ana> T cells <END> , we isolated and sequenced the human <START:ggp> IL-13 gene <END> , analyzed its <START:ggp> 5'-flanking region <END> for potential <START:ggp> transcriptional activation elements <END> , and examined its expression in <START:ana> nontransformed T-lineage cell populations <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human IL-13 gene <END> was located <START:ggp> 12.5-kb upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> and <START:ggp> 2-kb downstream <END> of a <START:ggp> CpG island <END> . 
The <START:ggp> IL-13 gene 5 ' flank region <END> included a segment with sequence homology to <START:ggp> P elements <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter <END> involved in transcriptional activation in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Mutation of the <START:ggp> IL-13 P element site <END> significantly reduced <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> promoter activity in response to T-cell activation . 
Oligonucleotides containing the <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-4 P element sites <END> specifically bound the <START:ggp> transcriptional activator protein <END> , <START:ggp> nuclear factor-activated T cells <END> , preformed ( <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> ) , when incubated with nuclear protein extracts from <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
Similar to <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ana> IL-13 mRNA <END> expression was highest in <START:ana> T-cell populations <END> enriched for cells that had previously been primed in vivo or in vitro , indicating that priming increases the expression of the <START:ggp> IL-13 and IL-4 genes <END> in a coordinate manner . 
Because the <START:ana> primed T cells <END> contain higher levels of <START:ggp> nuclear NF-ATp <END> , capable of binding to <START:ggp> P elements <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-4 and IL-13 promoters <END> , than do <START:ana> freshly-isolated T cells <END> , the <START:ggp> NF-AT-binding P elements <END> are attractive candidates to mediate the coordinate expression of these two <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> alpha interferon <END> but not <START:ggp> gamma interferon <END> signal transduction by phorbol esters is mediated by a <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphatase <END> . 
Previous studies have indicated that the expression of viral oncoproteins , cell transformation , or phorbol ester treatment of cells can inhibit alpha/beta interferon ( IFN-alpha/beta ) -induced gene expression . 
The mechanisms by which these promoters of cell growth exert their inhibitory effects vary , but in most instances they involve a disruption of the IFN-alpha/beta-induced transcription complex ISGF3 such that the DNA-binding component of this complex ( the 48-kDa ISGF3gamma protein ) does not bind to the interferon-stimulated response element ( ISRE ) . 
In this report , we demonstrated that phorbol ester treatment of human peripheral blood monocytes dramatically inhibits activation of IFN-alpha/B-stimulated early response genes but by a mechanism which does not involve abrogation of the ISRE binding of ISGF3gamma . 
Phorbol ester treatment of monocytes inhibited IFN alpha-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> , <START:ggp> Stat2 <END> , and <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> and of the <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> <START:ggp> Tyk2 <END> but had no effect on <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> activation of <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> . 
IFNalpha-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> and the <START:ggp> alpha subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> IFN-alpha receptor <END> were unaffected by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) . 
Moreover , PMA caused the dephosphorylation of <START:ggp> Tyk2 <END> but not of <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> , which was activated by <START:ggp> IFN <END> . 
Pretreatment of cells with vanadate prevented the effects of PMA with regard to PMA-induced <START:ggp> Tyk2 <END> dephosphorylation . 
These observations suggest that PMA exerts its inhibitory effects by activation of a <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphatase <END> which selectively regulates <START:ggp> Tyk2 <END> but not <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> activity . 
Transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 gene <END> in normal <START:ana> human peripheral blood T cells <END> . 
Convergence of costimulatory signals and differences from <START:ana> transformed T cells <END> . 
To study transcriptional regulation in <START:ana> normal human T cells <END> , we have optimized conditions for transient transfection . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter <END> <START:ggp> -reporter gene <END> behavior closely parallels the <START:ggp> endogenous gene <END> in response to <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> and costimulatory signals . 
As assessed with <START:ggp> mutagenized promoters <END> , the most important <START:ggp> IL-2 cis-regulatory elements <END> in <START:ana> normal T cells <END> are the <START:ggp> proximal AP-1 site <END> and the <START:ggp> NF- kappaB site <END> . 
Both primary activation , with <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> or <START:ggp> antibodies to CD3 <END> , and costimulation , provided by pairs of <START:ggp> CD2 antibodies <END> or <START:ana> B7-positive ( B cells ) <END> or <START:ana> B7-negative ( endothelial ) accessory cells , <END> are mediated through the same <START:ggp> cis-elements <END> . 
Interestingly , the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cell sites <END> are much less important in <START:ana> normal T cells <END> than in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
We conclude that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcriptional regulation differs in <START:ana> tumor cell lines <END> compared with <START:ana> normal T cells <END> and that different costimulatory signals converge on the same <START:ggp> cis-elements <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> RAR-RXR <END> as well as the <START:ggp> RXR-RXR <END> pathway is involved in signaling growth inhibition of <START:ana> human CD34+ erythroid progenitor cells <END> . 
Previous studies have shown that retinoic acid ( RA ) , similar to <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) , can act as a bifunctional regulator of the growth of <START:ana> bone marrow progenitors <END> , in that it can stimulate granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) - or interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) -induced GM colony formation , but potently inhibit <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> -induced growth . 
The present study , using highly enriched <START:ggp> human CD34+ <END> as well as <START:ana> Lin- murine bone marrow progenitor cells <END> , demonstrates a potent inhibitory effect of 9-cis-RA on burst-forming unit-erythroid ( BFU-E ) colony formation regardless of the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> stimulating growth . 
Specifically , 9-cis-RA potently inhibited the growth of BFU-E response to <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> Epo <END> ) ( 100 % ) , <START:ggp> stem cell factor <END> ( <START:ggp> SCF <END> ) + <START:ggp> Epo <END> ( 92 % ) , <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> + <START:ggp> Epo <END> ( 97 % ) , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> + <START:ggp> Epo <END> ( 88 % ) , and <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> + <START:ggp> Epo <END> ( 100 % ) . 
Erythroid colony growth was also inhibited when <START:ana> CD34+ progenitors <END> were seeded at one cell per well , suggesting a direct action of RA . 
Using synthetic ligands to <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RARs <END> ) and <START:ggp> retinoid X receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RXRs <END> ) that selectively bind and activate <START:ggp> RAR-RXR <END> or <START:ggp> RXR-RXR <END> dimers , respectively , we dissected the involvement of the two retinoid response pathways in the regulation of normal myeloid and erythroid progenitor cell growth . 
Transactivation studies showed that both the <START:ggp> RAR <END> ( Ro 13-7410 ) and <START:ggp> RXR <END> ( Ro 25-6603 and Ro 25-7386 ) ligands were highly selective at 100 nmol/L . 
At this concentration , Ro 13-7410 potently inhibited <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> -stimulated myeloid as well as <START:ggp> SCF <END> + <START:ggp> Epo <END> -induced erythroid colony growth . 
At the same concentration , Ro 25-6603 and Ro 25-7386 had little or no effect on <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> -induced colony formation , whereas they inhibited 75 % and 53 % , respectively , of <START:ggp> SCF <END> + <START:ggp> Epo <END> -stimulated BFU-E colony growth . 
Thus , the <START:ggp> RAR-RXR <END> response pathway can signal growth inhibition of <START:ana> normal bone marrow myeloid and erythroid progenitor cells <END> . 
In addition , we demonstrate a unique involvement of the <START:ggp> RXR-RXR <END> pathway in mediating growth inhibition of <START:ana> erythroid <END> but not <START:ana> myeloid progenitor cells <END> . 
AM580 , a stable benzoic derivative of retinoic acid , has powerful and selective cyto-differentiating effects on <START:ana> acute promyelocytic leukemia cells <END> . 
All-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is successfully used in the cyto-differentiating treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . 
Paradoxically , <START:ana> APL cells <END> express <START:ggp> PML-RAR <END> , an aberrant form of the <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor type alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> ) derived from the <START:ggp> leukemia-specific t ( 15 ; 17 ) chromosomal translocation <END> . 
We show here that AM580 , a stable retinobenzoic derivative originally synthesized as a <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> agonist , is a powerful inducer of granulocytic maturation in <START:ana> NB4 <END> , an <START:ana> APL-derived cell line <END> , and in <START:ana> freshly isolated APL blasts <END> . 
After treatment of <START:ana> APL cells <END> with AM580 either alone or in combination with <START:ggp> granulocyte colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> ) , the compound induces granulocytic maturation , as assessed by determination of the levels of <START:ana> leukocyte alkaline phosphatase , CD11b , CD33 , and G-CSF receptor mRNA <END> , at concentrations that are 10- to 100-fold lower than those of ATRA necessary to produce similar effects . 
By contrast , AM580 is not effective as ATRA in modulating the expression of these <START:ggp> differentiation markers <END> in the <START:ana> HL-60 cell line <END> and in <START:ana> freshly isolated granulocytes <END> obtained from the peripheral blood of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients during the stable phase of the disease . 
In <START:ana> NB4 cells <END> , two other synthetic nonselective RAR ligands are capable of inducing <START:ggp> LAP <END> as much as AM580 , whereas RAR beta- or RAR gamma-specific ligands are totally ineffective . 
These results show that AM580 is more powerful than ATRA in modulating the expression of differentiation antigens only in cells in which <START:ggp> PML-RAR <END> is present . 
Binding experiments , using <START:ana> COS-7 cells <END> transiently transfected with <START:ggp> PML-RAR <END> and the normal <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> , show that AM580 has a lower affinity than ATRA for both receptors . 
However , in the presence of <START:ggp> PML-RAR <END> , the synthetic retinoid is a much better transactivator of <START:ggp> retinoic acid-responsive element-containing promoters <END> than the natural retinoid , whereas , in the presence of <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> , AM580 and ATRA have similar activity . 
This may explain the strong cyto-differentiating potential of AM580 in <START:ana> PML-RAR-containing leukemic cells <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor-retinoid X receptor-vitamin D response element complex <END> formation by nuclear extracts of <START:ana> vitamin D-resistant New World primate cells <END> . 
Most New World primate ( NWP ) genera evolved to require high circulating levels of steroid hormones and vitamin D . 
We hypothesized that an <START:ggp> intracellular vitamin D binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> IDBP <END> ) , present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of <START:ana> NWP cells <END> , or another protein ( s ) may cause or contribute to the steroid hormone-resistant state in <START:ana> NWP <END> by disruption of the receptor dimerization process and/or by interference of <START:ggp> receptor complex <END> binding to the <START:ggp> consensus response elements <END> present in the <START:ggp> enhancer regions <END> of <START:ggp> steroid-responsive genes <END> . 
We employed electromobility shift assay ( EMSA ) to screen for the presence of proteins capable of binding to the <START:ggp> vitamin D response element <END> ( <START:ggp> VDRE <END> ) . 
Nuclear and post-nuclear extracts were prepared from two <START:ana> B-lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> known to be representative of the <START:ana> vitamin D-resistant <END> and <START:ana> wild type phenotypes <END> , respectively . 
The extracts were compared for their ability to retard the migration of radiolabeled double stranded oligomers representative of the <START:ggp> VDREs <END> of the <START:ggp> human osteocalcin and the mouse osteopontin gene promoters <END> . 
A specific , retarded band containing <START:ggp> VDR-RXR <END> was identified when wild type cell but not when vitamin D-resistant cell nuclear extract was used in the binding reaction with either probe . 
In addition , vitamin D-resistant cell nuclear extract contained a protein ( s ) which was bound specifically to the <START:ggp> VDRE <END> and was capable of completely inhibiting <START:ggp> VDR-RXR-VDRE complex <END> formation ; these effects were not demonstrated with nuclear extract from the <START:ana> wild type cell line <END> or with the post-nuclear extract of the <START:ana> vitamin D-resistant cell line <END> . 
We conclude that a <START:ggp> VDRE-binding protein <END> ( s ) , distinct from <START:ggp> IDBP <END> and present in nuclear extract of cells from a <START:ana> prototypical vitamin D-resistant NWP <END> , is capable of inhibiting normal <START:ggp> VDR-RXR <END> heterodimer binding to the <START:ggp> VDRE <END> . 
<START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> expression during B-cell activation . 
Translocations involving the <START:ggp> BCL-6 gene <END> are common in the diffuse large cell subtype of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . 
Invariably , the <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> coding region is intact , but its <START:ggp> 5 ' untranslated region <END> is replaced with sequences from the <START:ggp> translocation partner <END> . 
The present study shows that <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> expression is regulated in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> during mitogenic stimulation . 
<START:ana> Resting B and T lymphocytes <END> contain high levels of <START:ana> BCL-6 mRNA <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> mouse B cells <END> with <START:ggp> anti-IgM or IgD antibodies <END> , bacterial lipopolysaccharide , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin , or <START:ggp> CD40 ligand <END> led to a five-fold to 35-fold decrease in <START:ana> BCL-6 mRNA <END> levels . 
Similar downregulation of <START:ana> BCL-6 mRNA <END> was seen in <START:ana> human B cells <END> stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus plus <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> or <START:ggp> anti-IgM antibodies <END> and in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> stimulated with <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> . 
<START:ana> BCL-6 mRNA <END> levels began to decrease 8 to 16 hours after stimulation , before cells entered S phase . 
Although polyclonal activation of <START:ana> B cells <END> in vitro invariably decreased <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> MRNA expression , <START:ana> activated B cells <END> from human germinal centers expressed BCL-6 mRNA at levels comparable to the levels in resting B cells . 
Despite these similar mRNA levels , <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> protein expression was threefold to 34-fold higher in <START:ana> germinal center B cells <END> than in <START:ana> resting B cells <END> , suggesting that <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> protein levels are controlled by translational or posttranslational mechanisms . 
These observations suggest that the germinal center reaction provides unique activation signals to <START:ana> B cells <END> that allow for continued , high-level <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> expression . 
<START:ggp> DNA-binding phosphoproteins <END> induced after T cell activation : effects of cyclosporin A . 
To define <START:ggp> novel proteins <END> involved in the early transcriptional response during the activation of <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> , we used a high-resolution , two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system to identify <START:ggp> nuclear , deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) binding proteins <END> exhibiting rapid changes in phosphorylation following cell stimulation . 
We identified 18 <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> whose phosphorylation level changed more than 5-fold upon activation . 
Of these , 11 were found to possess DNA-binding properties . 
The 11 <START:ggp> phosphoproteins <END> with DNA-binding activity , along with 4 others , were analyzed further . 
Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed several sets of proteins with different phosphorylated residues Kinetic analysis of the phosphorylation of the selected proteins was performed and revealed a complex group of transient and sustained responses to cell activation . 
Finally , the activation-induced changes in one set of <START:ggp> phosphoproteins <END> were dramatically inhibited by cyclosporin A . 
We suggest that these <START:ggp> phosphoproteins <END> may be directly involved in regulating the transcriptional response to cellular activation by external stimuli . 
Inactivation of <START:ggp> IkappaBbeta <END> by the <START:ggp> tax protein <END> of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 : a potential mechanism for constitutive induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
In <START:ana> resting T lymphocytes <END> , the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> is sequestered in the cytoplasm via interactions with members of the <START:ggp> I kappa B family <END> of inhibitors , including <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> and <START:ggp> IkappaBbeta <END> . 
During normal T-cell activation , <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> is rapidly phosphorylated , ubiquitinated , and degraded by the <START:ggp> 26S proteasome <END> , thus permitting the release of functional <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
In contrast to its transient pattern of nuclear induction during an immune response , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> is constitutively activated in cells expressing the <START:ggp> Tax transforming protein <END> of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-1 ) . 
Recent studies indicate that HTLV-1 <START:ggp> Tax <END> targets <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway . 
However , it remains unclear how this <START:ggp> viral protein <END> induces a persistent rather than transient <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> response . 
In this report , we provide evidence that in addition to acting on <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> , <START:ggp> Tax <END> stimulates the turnover Of <START:ggp> IkappaBbeta <END> via a related targeting mechanism . 
Like <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> , <START:ggp> Tax <END> -mediated breakdown of <START:ggp> IkappaBbeta <END> in <START:ana> transfected T lymphocytes <END> is blocked either by cell-permeable proteasome inhibitors or by mutation Of <START:ggp> IkappaBbeta <END> at two serine residues present within its <START:ggp> N-terminal region <END> . 
Despite the dual specificity of HTLV-1 <START:ggp> Tax <END> for <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> and <START:ggp> IkappaBbeta <END> at the protein level , <START:ggp> Tax <END> selectively stimulates <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -directed transcription of the <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha gene <END> . 
Consequently , <START:ggp> IkappaBbeta <END> protein expression is chronically downregulated in <START:ana> HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes <END> . 
These findings with <START:ggp> IkappaBbeta <END> provide a potential mechanism for the constitutive activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> Tax-expressing cells <END> . 
The role of <START:ggp> p16 <END> in the <START:ggp> E2F-dependent thymidine kinase <END> regulation . 
The role of alterations of the <START:ggp> MTS1 tumor suppressor gene <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 9p21 <END> , which encodes <START:ggp> p16 <END> , the inhibitor of <START:ggp> cyclin-dependent-kinase-4 and 6 <END> , in tumorigenesis is not yet clear . 
Phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> retinoblastoma protein <END> by <START:ggp> cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 <END> prevents its interaction with the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> E2F <END> , which subsequently promotes the expression of <START:ggp> S phase regulated genes <END> , such as <START:ggp> thymidine kinase <END> . 
Although a role of <START:ggp> p16 <END> in this regulation has been presumed , there is no proof so far that loss of this <START:ggp> tumor suppressor gene <END> really affects <START:ggp> E2F <END> -mediated regulations . 
We investigated the regulation of <START:ggp> thymidine kinase <END> in <START:ana> phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes <END> and in the <START:ana> p16-negative human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines <END> , <START:ana> MOLT-4 <END> and <START:ana> CEM <END> . 
Compared to <START:ana> normal lymphocytes <END> , <START:ana> MOLT-4 and CEM cells <END> exhibited an altered cell cycle regulation of <START:ggp> thymidine kinase <END> , a much higher intracellular activity of this <START:ggp> enzyme <END> , and higher <START:ana> thymidine kinase mRNA <END> expression . 
Transient expression of <START:ggp> p16 <END> in normal human lymphocytes caused arrest in G1 , but was without effect on the cell growth of <START:ana> MOLT-4 and CEM cells <END> , although all of them express functional <START:ggp> retinoblastoma protein <END> . 
Nevertheless , in the two <START:ana> leukemia cell lines <END> transient overexpression of <START:ggp> p16 <END> reestablished the normal regulation of <START:ggp> thymidine kinase <END> , paralleled by an increase of the underphosphorylated form of <START:ggp> retinoblastoma protein <END> and decrease of free <START:ggp> E2F <END> bound to its motif in the <START:ggp> thymidine kinase promoter <END> . 
We demonstrate that loss of <START:ggp> p16 <END> causes upregulation of this DNA precursor pathway <START:ggp> enzyme <END> via activation of <START:ggp> E2F <END> by a mechanism involving <START:ggp> retinoblastoma protein <END> . 
Interactions of a <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> in the <START:ggp> env gene <END> of the mouse mammary tumor virus with <START:ggp> activation-dependent , T cell-specific transacting factors <END> . 
The mouse mammary tumor virus <START:ggp> env gene <END> contains a <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> ( <START:ggp> META <END> ) that can control transcription of the adjacent <START:ggp> long terminal repeat region <END> . 
Transcriptional control by <START:ggp> META <END> parallels that of several <START:ggp> lymphokine genes <END> , being specific to <START:ana> T cells <END> , dependent on their activation , and inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine ( CsA ) . 
<START:ggp> DNase I <END> footprinting indicated that <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> from <START:ana> activated T lymphocytes <END> bound a <START:ggp> promoter-proximal site <END> , <START:ggp> META ( P ) <END> , and a <START:ggp> promoter-distal site <END> , <START:ggp> META ( D+ ) <END> , within the <START:ggp> 400-base pair META region <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factors <END> from unstimulated , but not from activated cells , bound a site , <START:ggp> META ( D- ) <END> , adjacent to <START:ggp> META ( D+ ) <END> . 
<START:ggp> META ( D+ ) <END> directed transcription of a linked <START:ggp> luciferase gene <END> , and gel shift analysis revealed binding of inducible , <START:ggp> CsA-sensitive T cell factors <END> , in parallel with transfection results . 
Authentic <START:ggp> NFAT and NF-kappaB targets <END> did not compete for the <START:ggp> META ( D+ ) binding factor <END> ( s ) . 
The <START:ggp> SV40 core sequence <END> competed for <START:ggp> META ( D+ ) binding factors <END> , but <START:ggp> META ( D+ ) <END> failed to compete for the complexes obtained with the SV40 probe . 
Our results , taken together , indicate that <START:ggp> META ( D+ ) <END> is a novel <START:ggp> transcriptional enhancer element <END> that is similar in its cell-type specificity , activation dependence , and CsA sensitivity to the <START:ggp> NFAT element <END> . 
It may be relevant to the role of MMTV in expression of <START:ggp> Mls antigens <END> or the induction of T cell lymphomas . 
A novel <START:ggp> interferon regulatory factor family transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> ICSAT/Pip/LSIRF <END> , that negatively regulates the activity of <START:ggp> interferon-regulated genes <END> . 
We have isolated a <START:ggp> novel cDNA clone <END> encoding <START:ggp> interferon ( IFN ) consensus sequence-binding protein <END> in <START:ana> adult T-cell leukemia cell line <END> or activated <START:ana> T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> ICSAT <END> ) ; this protein is the human homolog of the recently cloned <START:ggp> Pip/LSIRF <END> . 
<START:ggp> ICSAT <END> is structurally most closely related to the previously cloned <START:ggp> ICSBP <END> , a member of the <START:ggp> IFN regulatory factor ( IRF ) family <END> of proteins that binds to <START:ggp> interferon consensus sequences <END> ( <START:ggp> ICSs <END> ) found in many promoters of the <START:ggp> IFN-regulated genes <END> . 
Among <START:ana> T-cell lines <END> investigated , <START:ggp> ICSAT <END> was abundantly expressed in <START:ana> human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) -infected T cells <END> . 
When the <START:ggp> HTLV-1 tax gene <END> was expressed or phorbol myristake acetate-A23187 stimulation was used , <START:ggp> ICSAT <END> expression was induced in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> which otherwise do not express <START:ggp> ICSAT <END> . 
When the binding of <START:ggp> ICSAT <END> to four different <START:ggp> ICSs <END> was tested , the relative differences in binding affinities for those <START:ggp> ICSs <END> were determined . 
To study the functional role of <START:ggp> ICSAT <END> , we performed cotransfection experiments with the <START:ana> human embryonal carcinoma cell line N-Tera2 <END> . 
<START:ggp> ICSAT <END> was demonstrated to possess repressive function over the gene activation induced by <START:ggp> IFN <END> stimulation or by <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> cotransfection . 
Such repressive function is similar to that seen in <START:ggp> IRF-2 <END> or <START:ggp> ICSBP <END> . 
However , we have found that <START:ggp> ICSAT <END> has a different repressive effect from that of <START:ggp> IRF-2 <END> or <START:ggp> ICSBP <END> in some <START:ggp> IFN-responsive reporter constructs <END> . 
These results suggest that a novel mechanism of gene regulation by `` differential repression '' is used by multiple members of <START:ggp> repressor proteins <END> with different repressive effects on the <START:ggp> IFN-responsive genes <END> . 
Regulation of [ Ca2+ ] i rise activated by <START:ggp> doxepin-sensitive H1-histamine receptors <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , <START:ana> cloned human T lymphocytes <END> . 
To clarify the presence of <START:ggp> histamine receptor <END> and its transmembrane mechanism in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> , we investigated the effects of agonists or antagonists of <START:ggp> histamine receptor <END> subtypes and bacterial toxins on intracellular concentration of Ca2+ [ Ca2+ ] i ) , [ 3H ] pyrilamine binding and <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> expression in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , cloned <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> . 
H1-agonists ( histamine and 2-methylhistamine ) caused a transient rise of [ Ca2+ ] , and H1-antagonists ( pyrilamine and doxepin ) inhibited the histamine-induced [ Ca2+ ] i rise more potently than the H2-antagonist ( cimetidine ) on the H3-antagonist ( impromidine ) . 
Binding parameters of [ 3H ] pyrilamine binding were Kd = 5.53 nM and Bmax = 2 , 647 sites/cell . 
Pretreatment with B.pertussis , V.cholera. or C.botulinum toxin did not influence histamine-induced [ Ca2+ ] i rise . 
Western Blot analysis using antibodies against subunits of <START:ggp> GTP-binding proteins <END> indicated that <START:ggp> Gq/G11 <END> richly existed in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
Histamine induced <START:ana> mRNA <END> expression of an <START:ggp> immediate early gene <END> <START:ggp> c-fos <END> . 
Pretreatment with a <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> activator , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate , caused almost complete inhibition of histamine-induced [ Ca2+ ] i rise , but did not do so by activators of <START:ggp> cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases <END> . 
STAT-related <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are constitutively activated in <START:ana> peripheral blood cells <END> from acute leukemia patients . 
A signal transduction pathway activated by many <START:ggp> cytokines <END> has recently been elaborated . 
The <START:ggp> JAK kinases <END> and the <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) factors <END> have been found to be essential components . 
In this report , we describe the presence of constitutively activated <START:ggp> STAT factors <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood cells <END> from patients with acute leukemia . 
We used oligonucleotide probes from the <START:ggp> beta-casein and IRF-1 gene promoters <END> and the ISRE probe to detect <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> in nuclear extracts from <START:ana> acute leukemia cells <END> in bandshift assays . 
Specific DNA <START:ggp> protein complex <END> formation was observed with the probes from the beta-casein and <START:ggp> IRF-1 gene promoters <END> , but not with the ISRE oligonucleotide probe , when cell extracts from acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) and acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) were investigated . 
We used nonradioactive oligonucleotides as competitors to show the specificity of the complex formation . 
Specific <START:ggp> antibodies <END> directed against the individual <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> were used in supershift experiments . 
<START:ggp> STAT5- and STAT1-related factors <END> were detected in ALL and <START:ggp> STAT1- , STAT3- , and STAT5-related proteins <END> were present in nuclear cell extracts from AML . 
Since the cells were not treated with <START:ggp> cytokines <END> before the <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> were extracted , we conclude that these factors are constitutively activated in vivo . 
It is likely that the constitutive activation of <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> is a part of the events of leukemogenesis . 
An <START:ggp> element <END> upstream from the <START:ggp> human delta-globin-encoding gene <END> specifically enhances <START:ggp> beta-globin reporter gene <END> expression in <START:ana> murine erythroleukemia cells <END> . 
We have previously shown that a <START:ggp> DNA-binding factor <END> specific to <START:ana> adult hematopoietic cells <END> ( <START:ggp> polypryrimidine-binding factor <END> , <START:ggp> PYBF <END> ) binds to a <START:ggp> pyrimidine-rich region <END> <START:ggp> 1 kb upstream <END> from the <START:ggp> human delta-globin-encoding gene <END> ( <START:ggp> HBD <END> ) . 
The developmental stage-specificity of <START:ggp> PYBF <END> and the location of its binding site between the <START:ggp> fetal and adult beta-globin ( HBB ) -like genes <END> suggest that <START:ggp> PBYF <END> and its binding site may function in fetal-to-adult <START:ggp> globin gene <END> switching . 
Here , we describe the effect of <START:ggp> 383-bp ( delta383 ) and 99-bp ( delta99 ) sequences <END> containing the <START:ggp> PYBF-binding site <END> on transcription from various globin and non-globin promoters , using a transient assay with the <START:ggp> cat reporter gene <END> in <START:ana> murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells <END> , a cell line with abundant <START:ggp> PYBF <END> activity . 
We show that both <START:ggp> delta383 <END> and <START:ggp> delta99 <END> specifically enhance expression of <START:ggp> cat <END> for <START:ggp> plasmids <END> containing a <START:ggp> human adult globin ( HBB ) promoter <END> , whereas expression of similar constructs using <START:ggp> human fetal ( A gamma- ) globin ( HBG1 ) or simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) promoters <END> is not enhanced . 
The results suggest that <START:ggp> PYBF <END> and the <START:ggp> pyrimidine-rich region <END> upstream from <START:ggp> HBD <END> can specifically enhance <START:ggp> HBB <END> transcription in <START:ana> adult erythroid cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Translocation breakpoints <END> in three patients with campomelic dysplasia and autosomal sex reversal map more than 130 kb from <START:ggp> SOX9 <END> . 
Campomelic dysplasia ( CMPD1 ) and autosomal XY sex reversal ( SRA1 ) are caused by mutations in the <START:ggp> SRY-related gene <END> <START:ggp> SOX9 <END> on <START:ggp> 17q <END> . 
Unexpectedly , the <START:ggp> 17q breakpoints <END> in four CMPD1 translocation cases previously analyzed by us and others map 50 kb or more from <START:ggp> SOX9 <END> . 
Here , we present clinical , cytogenetic , and molecular data from a new CMPD1/SRA1 patient with <START:ggp> t ( 6 ; 17 ) ( q14 ; q24 ) <END> . 
Fluorescence in situ hybridization has shown that the <START:ggp> 17q breakpoint <END> in this case maps to the same region as the breakpoints in the other translocation cases , at least 130 kb from <START:ggp> SOX9 <END> . 
Likewise , the breakpoints in two of the previously described cases also map more than 130 kb and , as shown by pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis , at most 400 kb or 690 kb from <START:ggp> SOX9 <END> . 
By using a <START:ggp> SOX9 coding sequence polymorphism <END> , expression of both <START:ggp> SOX9 <END> alleles has been demonstrated by the <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase <END> polymerase chain reaction in <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cells <END> from one of the translocation cases . 
An alternatively spliced isoform of the <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> Spi-B <END> is an <START:ggp> Ets transcription factor <END> related to the <START:ggp> oncoprotein <END> <START:ggp> Spi-1/PU.1 <END> and highly expressed in <START:ana> B lymphoid cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Ets proteins <END> share a conserved <START:ggp> Ets domain <END> that mediates specific DNA binding . 
<START:ggp> Spi-B <END> binds <START:ggp> DNA sequences <END> containing a core 5'-GGAA-3 ' and activates transcription through this motif . 
Up to date , the biological function of <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> remains unknown . 
Here , we describe the characterization of an alternatively spliced variant of <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> , named <START:ggp> deltaSpi-B <END> , which has lost the <START:ggp> Ets domain <END> . 
In <START:ana> B lymphoid cells <END> , <START:ana> deltaspi-B and spi-B mRNAs <END> were present simultaneously in a ratio of around 10 % . 
<START:ggp> DeltaSpi-B <END> product was not able to bind DNA and was recovered in cytoplasmic cellular extracts . 
We raise the hypothesis that <START:ggp> delta Spi-B <END> might affect <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> function by recruiting factors involved in <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> activity . 
Binding and cooperative interactions between two <START:ggp> B cell-specific transcriptional coactivators <END> . 
The <START:ggp> class II transactivator <END> ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) and <START:ggp> B cell octamer-binding protein 1/octamer-binding factor 1/Oct coactivator <END> from <START:ana> B cells <END> ( <START:ggp> Bob1/OBF-1/OCA-B <END> ) represent two <START:ggp> B cell-specific transcriptional coactivators <END> . 
<START:ggp> CIITA <END> and <START:ggp> Bob1 <END> interact with proteins that bind to <START:ggp> conserved upstream sequences <END> in <START:ggp> promoters <END> of <START:ggp> class II major histocompatibility genes <END> and <START:ggp> octamer-binding transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , respectively . 
Both <START:ggp> CIITA <END> and <START:ggp> Bob1 <END> increase the expression from the <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> , which is a prototypic <START:ggp> class II promoter <END> . 
Moreover , in the presence of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> , interactions between <START:ggp> class II promoters <END> and <START:ggp> Bob1 <END> are independent of the <START:ana> octamer-binding site <END> . 
Using in vivo and in vitro binding assays , we confirm that <START:ggp> Bob1 <END> binds to <START:ggp> CIITA <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> CIITA <END> not only activates the expression of <START:ggp> class II genes <END> but recruits another B cell-specific coactivator to increase transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> class II promoters <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Efficient transcription and replication of simian immunodeficiency virus in the absence of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB and Sp1 binding elements <END> . 
Ten mutants of the simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) SIVmac239 bearing deletions ( delta ) or substitutions ( subst ) in the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and/or <START:ggp> Sp1 binding elements <END> were created , and the replicative capacities of the mutants were analyzed . 
All mutants , including one extensively mutagenized strain entirely missing the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB and four Spl binding elements <END> , replicated with wild-type kinetics and to a wild-type level in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures <END> in 50 to 100 % of the experiments . 
One group of mutants replicated very similarly to SIVmac239 in kinetics and yield in <START:ana> CEMxl74 cells <END> ( 2x <START:ggp> NFKappaB <END> > or = <START:ggp> SlVmac239 <END> approximately <START:ggp> deltaNFkappaB <END> approximately <START:ggp> deltaSpl234 <END> approximately <START:ggp> substNFkappaB <END> approximately <START:ggp> substSpl2 <END> approximately <START:ggp> substSp23 <END> ) , while a second group replicated with delayed or slightly delayed kinetics in <START:ana> CEMxl74 cells <END> ( SIVmac239 > <START:ggp> substSp34 <END> > <START:ggp> deltaNFkappaBdeltaSpl234 <END> approximately <START:ggp> deltaNFkappaBdeltaSp1 <END> > <START:ggp> substSpl234 <END> ) . 
Reversions or additional mutations were not detected in the <START:ggp> U3 and R regions <END> of <START:ggp> proviral DNA <END> from <START:ana> CEMxl74 cells <END> infected with the SIVmac239 mutants . 
Similar results were obtained when mutants of SIVmacMER ( a macrophage-competent derivative of SIVmac239 ) were tested in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cell <END> and <START:ana> CEMx174 cultures <END> . 
However , the growth of most mutated viruses was suppressed in <START:ana> primary rhesus monkey alveolar macrophages <END> ( SIVmacMER approximately <START:ggp> 2xNFkappaB <END> approximately <START:ggp> substNFkappaB <END> > <START:ggp> deltaNFkappaB <END> > <START:ggp> deltaNFkappaB <END> <START:ggp> deltaSpl234 <END> approximately <START:ggp> deltaNFkappaBdeltaSpl <END> > <START:ggp> deltaSpl234 <END> approximately <START:ggp> substSpl2 <END> > <START:ggp> substSp23 <END> approximately <START:ggp> substSp34 <END> approximately <START:ggp> substSpl234 <END> > or = SIVmac239 ) . 
Thus , changes in the <START:ggp> Sp1 binding sites <END> had the most dramatic effects on SIVmac replication in <START:ana> primary macrophage cultures <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> -driven secreted <START:ggp> alkaline phosphatase <END> activity in transient assays showed that , unlike human immunodeficiency virus type 1 , the <START:ggp> SIV long terminal repeat <END> possesses an <START:ggp> enhancer region <END> just upstream of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB element <END> which maintains significant levels of basal transcription in the absence of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB and Sp1 sites <END> . 
This region is responsive to transactivation by <START:ggp> Tat <END> . 
In addition , the <START:ggp> SIV TATA box <END> was shown to be stronger than that of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 . 
Therefore , the surprisingly high replicative capacity of NF-kappaB and Sp1 binding site mutants of SIVmac is due to unique features or the <START:ggp> enhancer/promoter region <END> . 
cAMP inducibility of <START:ggp> transcriptional repressor <END> <START:ggp> ICER <END> in developing and <START:ana> mature human T lymphocytes <END> [ published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1996 Jul 23 ; 93 ( 15 ) : 8154 ] 
Stimulation of the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway exerts an inhibitory effect on the proliferation and effector functions of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The ability of <START:ana> T cells <END> to form high intracellular levels of cAMP is acquired during development in the human thymus and is retained by the majority of mature <START:ana> peripheral T lymphocytes <END> . 
Here we show that elevated cAMP levels in <START:ana> T cells <END> correlate with the expression of the <START:ggp> potent transcriptional repressor <END> <START:ggp> ICER <END> ( <START:ggp> inducible cAMP early repressor <END> ) previously described in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis . 
Further , in transcriptional assays in vivo , <START:ggp> ICER <END> inhibits <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> -mediated expression of the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 promoter <END> as well as <START:ggp> Tax <END> -mediated transactivation of the <START:ggp> human T-lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) promoter <END> . 
Thus , the induction of <START:ggp> ICER <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> may play an important role in the cAMP-induced quiescence and the persistent latency of HTLV-I . 
A hydrophobic domain of <START:ggp> Ca2+-modulating cyclophilin ligand <END> modulates calcium influx signaling in T lymphocytes . 
<START:ggp> Ca2+-modulating cyclophilin ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> CAML <END> ) was originally described as a <START:ggp> cyclophilin B-binding protein <END> whose overexpression in <START:ana> T cells <END> causes a rise in intracellular calcium , thus activating <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> responsible for the early immune response . 
As reported here , structure-function analysis of the <START:ggp> CAML gene <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> indicates that two of <START:ggp> CAML <END> 's <START:ggp> putative membrane-spanning domains <END> are necessary and sufficient for the modulation of intracellular calcium . 
We propose that the <START:ggp> hydrophobic C-terminal tail <END> of <START:ggp> CAML <END> forms its effector domain , thus implicating the <START:ggp> N-terminal hydrophilic domain <END> in a regulatory role . 
These findings define a <START:ggp> novel protein motif <END> that functions in intracellular calcium signaling . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen EBNA-5 <END> accumulates in PML-containing bodies . 
<START:ggp> EBNA-5 <END> is one of the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -encoded nuclear proteins <END> required for immortalization of <START:ana> human B lymphocytes <END> . 
In the nuclei of <START:ana> EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> <START:ggp> EBNA-5 <END> is preferentially targetted to distinct nuclear foci . 
Previously we have shown ( W.Q. Jiang , L.Szekely , V.Wendel-Hansen , N.Ringertz , G.Klein , and A. Rosen , Exp.Cell Res . 
A new variant translocation in acute promyelocytic leukaemia : molecular characterization and clinical correlation . 
<START:ggp> Translocation t ( 15 ; 17 ) ( q22 ; q21 <END> ) is an acquired clonal cytogenetic change present in almost all cases of acute promelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . 
The molecular genetic basis of the translocation supports its integral role in pathogenesis . 
We describe a patient with APL in whom the leukaemic clone was characterized by a true variant of the <START:ggp> classical t ( 15 ; 17 ) <END> . 
The patient whose disease had numerous atypical clinical features , had <START:ggp> t ( 11 ; 17 ) ( q13 ; 121 ) <END> . 
The <START:ggp> chromosome 17 breakpoint <END> was localized to <START:ggp> intron 2 <END> of <START:ggp> RARA <END> by Southern blotting , and there was no evidence at the molecular level for rearrangement at <START:ggp> PML locus <END> . 
These data , along with previous reports of rare variant translocations in APL , indicate that while dysregulation of <START:ggp> RARA <END> by gene fusion may be essential for the APL phenotype , the particular fusion partner may determine clinicopathological aspects , including presentation , response to treatment with all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , and prognosis . 
This heterogeneity suggests that the variant <START:ggp> fusion partners <END> of <START:ggp> RARA <END> in APL encode <START:ggp> factors <END> with properties both common to and distinct from those of <START:ana> PML <END> . 
Investigation of these factors promises to shed light on the complex development pathways involved in the regulation of haematopoiesis . 
A model of latent adenovirus 5 infection in the guinea pig ( Cavia porcellus ) . 
A model of adenovirus 5 ( Ad5 ) infection was developed in guinea pigs to begin to study its role in the pathogenesis of peripheral lung inflammation . 
Forty animals were inoculated intranasally with 10 ( 7.0 ) pfu of Ad5/animal , and 15 animals inoculated with sterile culture media served as controls . 
Viral titres were 10 ( 4.4 ) , 10 ( 6.1 ) , 10 ( 5.2 ) , and 10 ( 2.9 ) pfu/animal , on days 1 , 3 , 4 , and 7 after infection , respectively . 
In situ hybridization to <START:ggp> viral DNA <END> and immunocytochemistry for Ad5 <START:ggp> E1A protein <END> localized the virus to airway and <START:ana> alveolar epithelial cells <END> . 
Histologic examination showed an extensive inflammatory cell infiltration around the airways , with epithelial necrosis and an alveolar exudate that caused localized alveolar collapse in the infected areas . 
Immunocytochemistry identified the cells in the infiltrate as <START:ana> cytotoxic T cells <END> . 
Although all animals 20 and 47 days after infection had seroconverted to Ad5 , virus was not detected in these groups either by viral plaque assay or in situ hybridization . 
<START:ggp> Ad5 E1A DNA <END> was detected by polymerase chain reaction in five of six animals 20 days after infection and in five of five animals 47 days after infection . 
In these same animals , <START:ggp> E1A protein <END> was detected 20 days after infection in two and 47 days after infection in one while persistent bronchiolitis was observed in four and three animals 20 and 47 days after infection , respectively . 
These results demonstrate that the guinea pig provides a useful model to study the role of Ad5 infection in chronic airway inflammation . 
Cyclic AMP <START:ggp> -responsive element <END> -dependent activation of Epstein-Barr virus <START:ggp> zebra promoter <END> by human herpesvirus 6 . 
We have recently shown that infection of <START:ana> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) genome-positive B cells <END> by human herpesvirus 6 ( HHV-6 ) results in the expression of the <START:ggp> immediate-early EBV Zebra gene <END> , followed by virus replication ( L.Flamand , I.Stefanescu , D.V.Ablashi , and J.Menezes , J.Virol.67 : 6768-6777 , 1993 ) . 
Here we show that HHV-6 upregulates <START:ggp> Zebra gene <END> transcription through a <START:ggp> cyclic AMP-responsive element <END> ( <START:ggp> CRE <END> ) located within the <START:ggp> Zebra promoter <END> ( <START:ggp> Zp <END> ) . 
Using <START:ana> human B- or T-cell lines <END> transfected with <START:ggp> ZpCat reporter gene constructs <END> , we demonstrate that a region designated the <START:ggp> ZII domain <END> of <START:ggp> Zp <END> is the target of HHV-6 transactivation . 
Mutation of the <START:ggp> consensus AP-1/CRE site <END> within <START:ggp> ZII <END> abolished the inducibility of <START:ggp> Zp <END> by HHV-6 , whereas positioning of the <START:ggp> ZII domain <END> upstream of the <START:ggp> beta-globin minimal promoter <END> conferred responsiveness following HHV-6 infection . 
Binding of these factors to <START:ggp> ZII <END> was prevented by oligonucleotides containing <START:ggp> CRE <END> but not by <START:ggp> AP-1 consensus sequences <END> . 
Antibodies against <START:ggp> CRE-binding ( CREB ) protein <END> but not against <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> or <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> were able to supershift the <START:ggp> DNA-protein complex <END> , identifying the nature of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> which binds to <START:ggp> ZII <END> as a member of the <START:ggp> CREB family of proteins <END> . 
Finally , transfection of <START:ggp> CREB protein <END> and <START:ggp> protein kinase A expression vectors <END> were found to activate <START:ggp> Zp <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , suggesting that phosphorylated form of <START:ggp> CREB protein <END> can play a determining role in the EBV reactivation process . 
Regulation of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> in stably transfected <START:ana> Jurkat cell clones <END> . 
Two <START:ana> Jurkat cell clones <END> have been stably transfected with a <START:ggp> reporter vector <END> for the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) . 
Upon stimulation , they express high levels of secreted heat stable <START:ggp> placental alkaline phosphatase <END> . 
With these clones , we demonstrated that <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin was inhibited by both cyclosporin A ( CsA ) ( IC50 = 8 nM ) and FK506 ( IC50 = 160 pM ) , presumably by inhibition of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> activity . 
Selective phosphatase inhibitors for <START:ggp> protein phosphatase 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> PP1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> 2A <END> ( <START:ggp> PP2A <END> ) that do not inhibit <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , such as okadaic acid and calyculin A , also inhibited <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation with IC50s of 87 nM and 4 nM , respectively , suggesting that okadaic acid and related inhibitors may block <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation through the inhibition of <START:ggp> PP1 <END> , instead of <START:ggp> PP2A <END> . 
<START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation was also inhibited by agents that increase cAMP concentrations such as dibutyryl cAMP , forskolin and prostaglandin E2 . 
These stable <START:ana> Jurkat cell clones <END> provide a convenient and sensitive tool to study <START:ggp> NFAT <END> regulation . 
Glucocorticoids induced down-regulation of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> mRNA expression in asthma . 
Although their precise mechanism of action remains to be elucidated , glucocorticoids represent the most effective therapy in the treatment of asthma . 
Interactions between the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> and the <START:ggp> AP-1 complex <END> have been shown to regulate the transcription of some genes , including <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> itself . 
The aim of the present study was to compare the expression of <START:ana> mRNA <END> for <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> in <START:ana> human blood monocytes <END> obtained from seven unstable untreated asthmatic patients who were subsequently treated with high doses of parenteral corticosteroid ( methyl prednisolone 120 mg/day ) for 10 days . 
<START:ana> mRNA <END> expression was identified after RNA extraction using RNAzol and analysed after <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase <END> , by polymerase chain reaction using a semiquantitative competitive hybridization assay . 
All asthmatic patients showed an improvement in their FEV1 values after corticosteroid treatment ( per cent of predicted value 68.28 +/- 4.93 versus 95.57 +/- 6.41 , P < 0.02 ) , and a significant decrease for <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> <START:ana> mRNA <END> expression ( P < 0.02 ) was observed in their monocytes . 
This is the first report of an ex vivo down-regulation for the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> <START:ana> mRNA <END> expression , following corticosteroid treatment . 
Mapping of the <START:ggp> transcriptional repression domain <END> of the <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> oct-2A <END> . 
The <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> is implicated in B cell-specific transcriptional activity via the octamer motif . 
Structure/function analysis of various <START:ggp> Oct-2a effector regions <END> in the context of the <START:ggp> GAL4 DNA-binding domain <END> revealed that <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> contains two functionally different <START:ggp> activation domains <END> at the <START:ggp> N and the C termini <END> . 
The transcriptional activity of both domains is strongly potentiated by interactions with distinct <START:ggp> B cell-specific coactivators <END> . 
Recently , we have identified a <START:ggp> repression domain <END> located within the <START:ggp> N terminus <END> of <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> ( <START:ggp> amino acids 2-99 <END> ) . 
When this domain was transferred to a potent activator , transcription was strongly inhibited . 
In this study we present a deletion analysis of the <START:ggp> N-terminal region <END> of <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> to determine the <START:ggp> minimal repression domain <END> . 
We identified a stretch of 23 amino acids , rich in serine and threonine residues , which was responsible for most of the repression activity . 
We show that repression is strongly dependent on the type of <START:ggp> enhancer <END> present in the <START:ggp> reporter plasmid <END> as well as on the <START:ana> cell line <END> tested . 
The possibility that <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> can act as an activator and/or a repressor may have important consequences for the function of <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> in B cell differentiation and other developmental processes . 
Opposing effects of glucocorticoids on the rate of apoptosis in <START:ana> neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes <END> . 
<START:ana> Eosinophils <END> and <START:ana> neutrophils <END> are closely related , <START:ana> terminally differentiated cells <END> that in vitro undergo constitutive cell death by apoptosis . 
The onset of apoptosis in both cell types can be delayed by <START:ggp> hemopoietins <END> and <START:ggp> inflammatory mediators <END> . 
Although there have been a number of reports demonstrating that glucocorticoids ( in particular dexamethasone ) antagonize the eosinophil life-prolonging effects of <START:ggp> hemopoietins <END> , direct effects of dexamethasone on eosinophil apoptosis have not been documented . 
In this study we examined the direct effects of glucocorticoids on <START:ana> eosinophil <END> and <START:ana> neutrophil <END> apoptosis in light of their common therapeutic use as anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic/hypereosinophilic agents . 
We found that treatment with dexamethasone induced <START:ana> eosinophil <END> apoptosis . 
In contrast , dexamethasone was a potent inhibitor of <START:ana> neutrophil <END> apoptosis . 
The effect of dexamethasone on both cell types was mediated through the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> , i.e. , it was abolished by the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> antagonist RU38486 . 
This is the first description of an agent that promotes <START:ana> eosinophil <END> apoptosis while inhibiting <START:ana> neutrophil <END> apoptosis , and thus presents a novel approach to the study of control of apoptosis in these closely related cell types as well as increases our understanding of the clinical action of glucocorticoids in inflammation . 
Permanent occupancy of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer <END> by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is needed for persistent viral replication in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
This work aimed to ascertain the role of <START:ggp> kappaB-responsive elements <END> of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) enhancer <END> not only in early initiation but also in long-term maintenance of proviral transcription in cells of the <START:ana> monocytic lineage <END> . 
For this purpose , we used three main approaches . 
The first was to abruptly terminate tumor necrosis factor-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding to the enhancer sequences in U1 monocytic cells , using a short pulse of <START:ggp> exogenous tumor necrosis factor <END> . 
This resulted in concomitant decrease in nuclear <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA-binding activity and <START:ggp> endogenous long terminal repeat <END> transcriptional activity . 
The second was to suppress the permanent <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> translocation induced by HIV-1 replication itself in <START:ana> chronically infected U937 cells <END> , using a specific proteasome inhibitor ( Z-LLL-H ) . 
As early as 2 h after addition of the inhibitor to the culture medium , there was an inhibition of both constitutive activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and HIV-1 genome expression . 
The third approach was to monitor the replication competence in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> of an infectious HIV-1 provirus carrying point mutations in the <START:ggp> kappaB-responsive elements <END> of both <START:ggp> long terminal repeats <END> . 
Compared with its wild-type counterpart , this mutated provirus showed a profoundly decreased , Z-LLL-H-insensitive transcriptional and replicative activity in <START:ana> U937 monocytes <END> . 
Together , our results indicate that occupancy of the <START:ggp> viral enhancer <END> by <START:ggp> NF-kappaB ( p50/p65 ) heterodimers <END> is required for ongoing transcription of integrated HIV provirus in <START:ana> monocytes <END> , even in cells chronically infected and permanently producing functional <START:ggp> HIV Tat protein <END> . 
Thus , the ability of HIV-1 replication to activate <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> is crucial to the intense self-perpetuated viral transcription observed in cells of the <START:ana> monocytic lineage <END> . 
<START:ana> Rel-deficient T cells <END> exhibit defects in production of <START:ggp> interleukin 3 <END> and <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> c-rel protooncogene <END> encodes a subunit of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-like family of transcription factors <END> . 
Mice lacking <START:ggp> Rel <END> are defective in mitogenic activation of <START:ana> B and T lymphocytes <END> and display impaired humoral immunity . 
In an attempt to identify changes in gene expression that accompany the T-cell stimulation defects associated with the loss of <START:ggp> Rel <END> , we have examined the expression of <START:ggp> cell surface activation markers <END> and cytokine production in mitogen-stimulated <START:ana> Rel-/- T cells <END> . 
The expression of cell surface markers including the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 receptor alpha ( IL-2R alpha ) chain <END> ( <START:ggp> CD25 <END> ) , <START:ggp> CD69 <END> and <START:ggp> L-selectin <END> ( <START:ggp> CD62 <END> ) is normal in <START:ana> mitogen-activated Rel-/- T cells <END> , but <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production is impaired . 
In <START:ana> Rel-/- splenic T cell cultures <END> stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin , the levels of IL-3 , IL-5 , <START:ggp> granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) , <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) , and <START:ggp> gamma interferon <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) were only 2- to 3-fold lower compared with normal T cells . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> anti-CD28 <END> stimulated <START:ana> Rel-/- T cells <END> , which fail to proliferate , make little or no detectable <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
Exogenous <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , which restitutes the proliferative response of the <START:ana> anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-treated Rel-/- T cells <END> , restores production of IL-5 , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , but not <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> and <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> expression to approximately normal levels . 
In contrast to <START:ana> mitogen-activated Rel-/- T cells <END> , lipopolysaccharide-stimulated <START:ana> Rel-/- macrophages <END> produce higher than normal levels of <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> . 
These findings establish that <START:ggp> Rel <END> can function as an activator or repressor of gene expression and is required by <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> for production of <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> and <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> . 
Nuclear appearance of a factor that binds the <START:ggp> CD28 response element <END> within the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 enhancer <END> correlates with <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> production . 
Activation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> requires the combined signaling of the <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> and <START:ggp> costimulatory molecules <END> such as <START:ggp> CD28 <END> . 
The ability of <START:ana> T cells <END> to produce <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) is a critical control point in T lymphocyte activation . 
The <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> enhancer contains a functional motif named <START:ggp> CD28 response element <END> ( <START:ggp> CD28RE <END> ) that serves a role as a target for mitogenic T cell activation signals . 
The <START:ggp> CD28RE <END> sequence reveals similarity to the <START:ggp> consensus kappaB binding motif <END> . 
Here we demonstrate that <START:ggp> CD28RE <END> binds an inducible protein with a molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa called <START:ggp> nuclear factor of mitogenic-activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-MATp35 <END> ) that is clearly different from the known <START:ggp> NF- kappaB/Rel family members <END> . 
Induction of <START:ggp> NF-MATp35 <END> was shown to depend on de novo protein synthesis and was restricted to <START:ana> T cells <END> that received a mitogenic combination of T cell stimuli , not necessarily including <START:ggp> CD28 <END> signaling . 
Nonmitogenic T cell stimulation did not result in appearance of <START:ggp> NF-MATp35 <END> . 
These results indicate that mitogenic combinations of T cell activation signals are integrated at the level of <START:ggp> NF-MATp35 <END> induction . 
Similar to its effect on <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production , cyclosporin A inhibited the induction of <START:ggp> NF-MATp35 <END> . 
Taken together , these data demonstrate that the nuclear appearance of <START:ggp> NF-MATp35 <END> shows excellent correlation with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production , which is a unique characteristic among nuclear factors implicated in the control of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> gene expression . 
Transcriptional basis for hyporesponsiveness of the <START:ggp> human inducible nitric oxide synthase gene <END> to lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma . 
The work reported here resolves , at the level of gene regulation , the controversy as to whether or not <START:ana> human monocytes/macrophages <END> can produce nitric oxide ( NO ) when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , with or without co-stimulation by interferon-gamma ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) . 
Studies included structural comparison of the promoters for human and mouse <START:ggp> inducible NO synthase ( iNOS ) genes <END> , transfection and assay of human and mouse <START:ggp> iNOS promoter regions <END> in response to LPS +/- <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , and electrophoretic mobility shift assays of <START:ggp> kappa B response elements <END> . 
Two explanations for hyporesponsiveness of the <START:ggp> human iNOS promoter <END> to LPS +/- <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> were found : ( 1 ) multiple inactivating nucleotide substitutions in the human counterpart of the <START:ggp> enhancer element <END> that has been shown to regulate LPS/ <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induced expression of the <START:ggp> mouse iNOS gene <END> ; and ( 2 ) and absence of one or more <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> in <START:ana> human macrophages <END> ( e.g. , an <START:ggp> LPS-inducible nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel complex <END> ) , that is ( are ) required for maximal expression of the gene . 
The importance of resolution of this controversy is that future research in this area should be directed toward the understanding of alternative mechanisms that can result in the successful production of NO . 
X inactivation analysis in a female with hypomelanosis of Ito associated with a <START:ggp> balanced X ; 17 translocation <END> : evidence for functional disomy of Xp . 
X inactivation analysis was performed on normal and hypopigmented skin samples obtained from a female with hypomelanosis of Ito associated with a <START:ggp> balanced whole arm X ; 17 translocation <END> . 
Severe skewing of X inactivation resulting in inactivity of the intact <START:ggp> X <END> was found in blood and cultures of both types of skin , but analysis of DNA prepared directly from hypopigmented skin showed significant inactivation of the translocated <START:ggp> X <END> , inconsistent with the usual mechanism of phenotypic expression in <START:ggp> X ; autosome translocations <END> . 
In addition , dual colour FISH analysis using centromere specific probes for chromosomes <START:ggp> X <END> and <START:ggp> 17 <END> showed that the breakpoints on both <START:ggp> chromosomes <END> lie within the alphoid arrays , making interruption of a locus on either chromosome unlikely . 
While partial variable monosomy of loci on <START:ggp> chromosome 17p <END> can not be excluded as contributing to the phenotype in this patient , it is argued that the major likely factor is partial functional disomy of sequences on <START:ggp> Xp <END> in cell lineages that have failed to inactivate the intact <START:ggp> X chromosome <END> . 
Identification of a <START:ggp> herpesvirus Saimiri cis-acting DNA fragment <END> that permits stable replication of episomes in transformed <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Herpesvirus saimiri is a lymphotropic herpesvirus capable of immortalizing and transforming <START:ana> T cells <END> both in vitro and in vivo . 
Immortalized and transformed <START:ana> T cells <END> harbor several copies of the <START:ggp> viral genome <END> as a <START:ggp> persisting genome <END> . 
The mapping of the <START:ggp> cis-acting genetic cis-acting segment <END> ( <START:ggp> oriP <END> ) required for viral episomal maintenance is reported here . 
<START:ggp> Viral DNA fragments <END> that potentially contain <START:ggp> oriP <END> were cloned into a <START:ggp> plasmid <END> that contains the <START:ggp> hygromycin resistance gene <END> . 
After several round of subcloning followed by transfection , <START:ggp> oriP <END> was mapped to a <START:ggp> 1.955-kb viral segment <END> . 
This viral fragment permits stable <START:ggp> plasmid <END> replication without deletion or rearrangement as well as episomal maintenance without integration or recombination . 
The function of <START:ggp> oriP <END> depends on a <START:ggp> trans-acting factor <END> ( s ) encoded by the <START:ggp> viral genome <END> . 
The <START:ggp> 1.955-kb viral segment <END> includes a dyad symmetry region located between two <START:ggp> small nuclear RNA genes <END> and is located upstream of the <START:ggp> dihydrofolate reductase gene homolog <END> . 
Therefore , this <START:ggp> oriP <END> contains novel elements distinct from those of other DNA viruses . 
In vivo <START:ana> anergized CD4+ T cells <END> express perturbed AP-1 and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Anergy is a major mechanism to ensure antigen-specific tolerance in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> in the adult . 
In vivo , anergy has mainly been studied at the cellular level . 
In this study , we used the <START:ggp> T-cell-activating superantigen <END> <START:ggp> staphylococcal enterotoxin A <END> ( <START:ggp> SEA <END> ) to investigate molecular mechanisms of T-lymphocyte anergy in vivo . 
Injection of <START:ggp> SEA <END> to adult mice activates <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> expressing certain <START:ggp> T-cell receptor ( TCR ) variable region beta-chain families <END> and induces strong and rapid production of interleukin 2 ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) . 
In contrast , repeated injections of <START:ggp> SEA <END> cause <START:ana> CD4+ T-cell <END> deletion and anergy in the remaining CD4+ <START:ana> T cells <END> , characterized by reduced expression of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> at mRNA and protein levels . 
We analyzed expression of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , and <START:ggp> octamer binding transcription factors <END> , which are known to be involved in the regulation of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> gene promoter activity . 
Large amounts of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and significant quantities of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> were induced in <START:ana> SEA-activated CD4+ spleen T cells <END> , whereas Oct-1 and Oct-2 DNA binding activity was similar in both resting and <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ana> anergic CD4+ T cells <END> contained severely reduced levels of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Fos/Jun-containing NF-AT complexes <END> but expressed significant amounts of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> Oct binding proteins <END> after <START:ggp> SEA <END> stimulation . 
Resolution of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> demonstrated predominant expression of <START:ggp> p50-p65 heterodimers <END> in <START:ana> activated CD4+ T cells <END> , while anergic cells mainly expressed the transcriptionally inactive <START:ggp> p50 homodimer <END> . 
These alterations of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are likely to be responsible for repression of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in <START:ana> anergic T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Fas <END> ligation induces apoptosis and <START:ggp> Jun kinase <END> activation independently of <START:ggp> CD45 <END> and <START:ggp> Lck <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
Stimulation through the <START:ggp> Fas/APO-1 receptor <END> results in apoptosis through an incompletely characterized signaling pathway . 
More is known regarding signal transduction events that occur after ligation of the <START:ggp> T-cell antigen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) . 
It has been shown that <START:ggp> TCR <END> stimulation requires both the <START:ggp> membrane tyrosine phosphatase <END> , <START:ggp> CD45 <END> , and the <START:ggp> Src-family kinase <END> , <START:ggp> Lck <END> , to result in cellular activation . 
Although prior studies suggest a role for <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinases <END> and phosphatases in <START:ggp> Fas <END> signaling , we report here that Fas ligation induces apoptosis in <START:ana> T cells <END> deficient in either <START:ggp> CD45 <END> or <START:ggp> Lck <END> . 
Further , in normal and <START:ana> CD45- or Lck-deficient cell lines <END> , Fas stimulation results in activation of <START:ggp> Jun kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> JNK <END> ) , a proposed mediator of stress activation pathways . 
Previous studies have also demonstrated a role for endogenous ceramide release in Fas-mediated apoptosis . 
We show that stimulation with a synthetic ceramide analog results in <START:ggp> JNK <END> activation as well as apoptosis , suggesting ceramide release occurs proximal to <START:ggp> JNK <END> activation in <START:ggp> Fas <END> signaling . 
Our data suggest that although <START:ggp> CD45 <END> and <START:ggp> Lck <END> are not required for <START:ggp> Fas <END> signaling , <START:ggp> JNK <END> activation may play an important role transducing distal signals that lead to apoptosis after <START:ggp> Fas <END> ligation . 
Globin gene switching . 
In vivo protein-DNA interactions of the <START:ggp> human beta-globin locus <END> in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> expressing the fetal or the adult <START:ggp> globin gene <END> program . 
To characterize the protein-DNA interactions important for the developmental control of the <START:ggp> human beta-globin locus <END> , we analyzed by in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> expressing either the fetal or the adult globin developmental program . 
In the <START:ggp> locus control region <END> ( <START:ggp> LCR <END> ) of the <START:ggp> beta-globin locus <END> , in vivo footprints on <START:ggp> NF-E2 <END> ( or <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> GATA-1 motifs <END> remained the same regardless of whether the fetal or the <START:ggp> adult globin genes <END> are expressed . 
In contrast , in vivo footprints on <START:ggp> GT ( CACCC ) motifs <END> differed between the cells expressing the fetal or the adult globin program . 
In <START:ggp> promoter regions <END> , the <START:ggp> actively transcribed genes <END> demonstrated extensive and consistent footprints over the canonical elements , such as <START:ggp> CACCC and CCAAT motifs <END> . 
The <START:ana> adult globin expressing cells <END> displayed more extensive footprints than the <START:ana> fetal globin expressing cells <END> in the <START:ggp> 3 ' regulatory sequences <END> of both the <START:ggp> Agamma- and the beta-globin genes <END> , suggesting a role of these <START:ggp> 3 ' elements <END> in <START:ggp> beta-globin gene <END> expression . 
Our results suggest that the bulk of protein-DNA interactions that underlies the developmental control of <START:ggp> globin genes <END> takes place in the <START:ggp> gamma- and beta-globin gene promoters <END> , and that <START:ggp> GT motifs <END> of the <START:ggp> beta-globin locus <END> <START:ggp> LCR <END> may play a role in the developmental regulation of human <START:ggp> beta-globin gene <END> expression , perhaps by increasing the probability of interaction of the <START:ggp> LCR holocomplex <END> with the <START:ggp> fetal or the adult globin gene <END> . 
Antisense inhibition of <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> expression induces apoptosis in <START:ana> monoblastoid U937 cells <END> . 
The active vitamin D3 metabolite 1 , 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol ( 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) acts as an antiproliferative and differentiating agent for the <START:ana> monoblastoid cell line U937 <END> and as an important immunologic mediator implicated particularly in the function of cells belonging to the <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage lineage <END> . 
These effects are controlled by the <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) , a member of the <START:ggp> steroid hormone receptor family <END> . 
The objective of this study was to develop <START:ana> U937 <END> transfectants expressing antisense <START:ana> VDR mRNA <END> , and to use these to examine the role of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 <START:ggp> -VDR <END> interaction in this lineage . 
A <START:ggp> 2-kb VDR cDNA insert <END> ( including the complete <START:ggp> VDR coding region <END> ) was cloned in an antisense orientation into the EBV episomal vector pMEP4 under the control of an <START:ggp> inducible promoter <END> and transfected into <START:ana> U937 <END> . 
The <START:ana> resultant cell line <END> , <START:ana> DH42 <END> , was hygromycin resistant , contained <START:ggp> VDR cDNA <END> , expressed fewer <START:ggp> VDRs <END> than controls , and showed a substantial decrease in antiproliferative response to 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . 
However , 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 increased the number of cells expressing <START:ggp> macrophage cell surface Ags <END> , including <START:ggp> CD14 <END> and <START:ggp> CD11b <END> . 
A subpopulation of smaller cells did not express the differentiation markers after cadmium stimulation . 
Cell cycle analysis showed shifts in the distribution of cells from G1 to S phase , which were more pronounced after cadmium treatment . 
A considerable proportion of cells were outside the cycle and DNA fragmentation confirmed apoptosis . 
Thus , the functional outcome of the <START:ggp> VDR <END> antisense transfection suggests that in the <START:ana> myelomonocytic lineage <END> , <START:ggp> VDR <END> expression may act as a protective mechanism against programmed cell death . 
Human T lymphotropic virus-I infection of <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> induces expression of the <START:ggp> beta-galactoside-binding lectin <END> , <START:ggp> galectin-3 <END> . 
Animal <START:ggp> lectins <END> play important roles in a variety of biological processes via their recognition of glycoconjugates . 
Galectin-3 is a <START:ggp> beta-galactoside-binding lectin <END> previously designated as <START:ggp> epsilon BP <END> ( <START:ggp> IgE-binding protein <END> ) , <START:ggp> CBP35 <END> , <START:ggp> Mac-2 <END> , <START:ggp> L-29 <END> , and <START:ggp> L-34 <END> , and its expression has been associated with various physiological and pathological processes , including cell growth , tumor transformation , and metastasis . 
<START:ggp> Galectin-3 <END> is widely distributed in various tissues and cell types and is expressed in many <START:ana> leukocytes <END> , with the notable exception of <START:ana> B and T lymphocytes <END> . 
We now report that <START:ggp> galectin-3 <END> is abundantly expressed in a number of <START:ana> human T lymphotropic virus ( HTLV ) -I-infected human T cell lines <END> , including <START:ana> F6T <END> , <START:ana> HUT 102 <END> , <START:ana> K3T <END> , <START:ana> MT-2 <END> , and <START:ana> SLB-I <END> , but is not expressed in <START:ana> non-HTLV-I-infected T cell lines <END> such as <START:ana> Jurkat <END> , <START:ana> CEM <END> , and <START:ana> MOLT-4 <END> . 
In addition , the <START:ggp> galectin-3 <END> level was markedly increased in <START:ana> human thymocytes <END> after infection with HTLV-I as compared with <START:ana> uninfected thymocytes <END> . 
The up-regulation of <START:ggp> galectin-3 <END> expression appeared to correlate well with HTLV-I gene expression , as undetectable or very low levels of <START:ggp> galectin-3 <END> were found in the <START:ana> S1T and ATL-1K cell lines <END> , which are nonproductively infected with HTLV-I . 
In co-transfection experiments , the <START:ggp> galectin-3 promoter <END> was significantly up-regulated by <START:ggp> expression vectors <END> encoding the <START:ggp> 40-kd Tax protein <END> , a potent transactivator in HTLV-I . 
Analysis of various <START:ggp> Tax mutants <END> suggested that <START:ggp> galectin-3 promoter <END> induction is dependent on activation of the <START:ggp> cyclic-AMP-responsive element binding protein/activation transcription factor family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> and , to a lesser extent , <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel <END> induction . 
Transfection of <START:ana> human promonocytic U-937 cells <END> with an HTLV-I Tax expression vector induced <START:ggp> galectin-3 <END> expression in this cell line . 
Functionally , <START:ggp> galectin-3 <END> was shown to activate <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> production in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
Together , these findings raise the possibility that HTLV-I <START:ggp> Tax <END> production induces the transcription and subsequent synthesis and secretion of <START:ggp> galectin-3 <END> , which in turn may further activate these <START:ana> T cells <END> and contribute to the altered properties of cell growth found in adult T cell leukemia induced by HTLV-I . 
Monocytic cell type-specific transcriptional induction of <START:ggp> collagenase <END> . 
Interstitial <START:ggp> collagenase <END> ( <START:ggp> MMP-1 <END> ) , a <START:ggp> metalloproteinase <END> produced by <START:ana> resident and inflammatory cells <END> during connective tissue turnover , cleaves <START:ggp> type I collagen fibrils <END> . 
This catalytic event is rate limiting in remodeling of tissues rich in <START:ggp> fibrillar collagen <END> such as the skin and lungs . 
The regulation of <START:ggp> collagenase <END> expression is cell-type specific ; bacterial LPS and zymosan , a yeast cell wall derivative , are potent inducers of <START:ggp> collagenase <END> expression in <START:ana> macrophages <END> , but do not alter <START:ana> fibroblast <END> <START:ggp> collagenase <END> expression . 
Since promoter elements controlling <START:ggp> collagenase <END> transcription in monocytic cells have not been previously defined , we sought to delineate responsive <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> of the <START:ggp> collagenase promoter <END> in transiently transfected <START:ana> human ( U937 ) and murine ( J774 ) monocytic cell lines <END> . 
Deletion constructs containing as little as 72 bp of <START:ggp> 5 ' -flanking sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> collagenase promoter <END> were sufficient for LPS- or zymosan-mediated transcriptional induction , whereas phorbol inducibility exhibited an absolute requirement for upstream elements including the <START:ggp> polyoma enhancer A-binding protein-3 site <END> ( <START:ggp> -83 to -91 <END> ) and <START:ggp> TTCA sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> -102 to -105 <END> ) in both <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> and <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
Mutagenesis of the <START:ggp> activator protein-1 [ AP-1 ] site <END> at <START:ggp> -72 <END> abolished <START:ggp> basal promoter <END> activity and LPS/zymosan inducibility , while mutagenesis of an <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-like site <END> at -20 to -10 had no effect . 
Nuclear extracts from LPS -and <START:ana> zymosan-treated cells <END> showed strong <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity by gel-shift analysis , and supershift analysis showed the <START:ggp> AP-1 complexes <END> contained specific members of both the <START:ggp> jun and fos gene families <END> . 
These data indicate that , in contrast to most LPS effects , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , but not <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> , mediates LPS induction of <START:ggp> collagenase <END> transcription in <START:ana> macrophagelike cells <END> . 
Furthermore , as compared to regulation by phorbol ester , <START:ggp> collagenase <END> induction in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> by cell wall derivatives of bacteria or yeast is largely independent of <START:ggp> upstream promoter sequences <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> c-Jun N-terminal kinase <END> in <START:ana> bacterial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages <END> . 
Activation of <START:ana> macrophages <END> by bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces transcription of genes that encode for <START:ggp> proinflammatory regulators <END> of the immune response . 
Previous work has suggested that activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor activator protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) is one LPS-induced event that mediates this response . 
Consistent with this notion , we found that LPS stimulated <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -mediated transcription of a <START:ggp> transfected reporter gene <END> in the <START:ana> murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 <END> . 
As <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity is regulated in part by activation of the <START:ggp> c-Jun N-terminal kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> JNK <END> ) , which phosphorylates and subsequently increases the transcriptional activity of c-Jun , we examined whether LPS treatment of <START:ana> macrophages <END> resulted in activation of this <START:ggp> kinase <END> . 
LPS treatment of <START:ana> RAW 264.7 cells <END> , <START:ana> murine bone marrow-derived macrophages <END> , and the <START:ana> human monocyte cell line THP-1 <END> resulted in rapid activation of the <START:ggp> p46 and p54 isoforms <END> of <START:ggp> JNK <END> . 
Treatment with wild-type and rough mutant forms of LPS and synthetic lipid A resulted in <START:ggp> JNK <END> activation , while pretreatment with the <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> inhibitor herbimycin A inhibited this response . 
Binding of LPS- <START:ggp> LPS binding protein ( LBP ) complexes <END> to <START:ggp> CD14 <END> , a <START:ggp> surface receptor <END> that mediates many LPS responses , was found to be crucial , as pretreatment of <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> with the <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody 60b <END> , which blocks this binding , inhibited <START:ggp> JNK <END> activation . 
These results suggest that LPS activation of <START:ggp> JNK <END> in <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage cells <END> is a CD14- and protein tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent event that may mediate the early activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> in regulating LPS-triggered gene induction . 
Surfactant suppresses <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in human <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
In addition to biophysical properties , pulmonary surfactant has immunomodulatory activity . 
We previously demonstrated that both synthetic ( Exosurf ) and modified natural surfactant ( Survanta ) downregulated endotoxin-stimulated <START:ana> inflammatory c ytokine mRNA <END> levels and <START:ggp> protein products <END> ( <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> [ TNF ] , <START:ggp> interleukin-1-beta <END> [ <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> ] , <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> [ <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ] ) in <START:ana> human alveolar macrophages <END> . 
In this study , we report that both Exosurf and Survanta suppress <START:ana> TNF mRNA <END> and secretion ( 85 +/- 4 % mean percent inhibition +/- SEM by Exosurf ; 71 +/- 6 % by Survanta ) by <START:ana> endotoxin-stimulated THP-1 <END> , a <START:ana> human monocytic cell line <END> . 
Because surfactant downregulated <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokine <END> production similarly in both <START:ana> normal human alveolar macrophages <END> and the <START:ana> THP-1 cell line <END> , we used this <START:ana> cell line <END> to investigate whether surfactant affected transcriptional mechanisms . 
Specifically , we examined <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) activation because it is crucial in transcriptional regulation of many <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokine genes <END> including <START:ggp> TNF <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that both surfactants decreased activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
The presence of both <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> p50 <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B components <END> in LPS-activated <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> was confirmed by specific antibody induction of supershifts in mobility assays . 
These results are the first to suggest that surfactant 's suppressive effects on <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokine <END> production may involve transcriptional regulation through inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
A <START:ggp> cell type-specific enhancer <END> in the <START:ggp> human B7.1 gene <END> regulated by <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
The <START:ggp> costimulatory molecule B7.1 <END> provides a second signal critical for T cell activation . 
The distribution of this <START:ggp> integral membrane protein <END> is restricted to certain tissues where its level of expression is modulated by multiple exogenous stimuli . 
To identify the molecular basis for specificity and inducibility , the <START:ggp> chromatin <END> configuration of the <START:ggp> human B7.1 gene <END> was examined in intact nuclei from various cell types . 
The identification of a tissue-specific <START:ggp> deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitive site <END> approximately <START:ggp> 3kb upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> led to the characterization of a <START:ggp> cell type-specific enhancer region <END> . 
This <START:ggp> 183-bp region <END> was both cell type specific and responsive to two distinct stimuli , lipopolysaccharide and dibutyryl cAMP , known to regulate <START:ggp> B7.1 <END> expression . 
Deletional and site-directed mutagenesis revealed the presence of multiple functionally critical <START:ggp> cis elements <END> within this region , one of which was a <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB consensus sequence <END> . 
In <START:ana> B7.1-positive B cells <END> , this element bound several members of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB family <END> , <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> already implicated in signal transduction pathways relevant to <START:ggp> B7.1 <END> expression . 
This is the first description , to our knowledge , of <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> that control expression of a gene encoding a <START:ggp> B7 costimulatory molecule <END> . 
Ubiquitinylation of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> using <START:ggp> reconstituted ubiquitinylating enzymes <END> . 
Recombinant <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> were ubiquitinylated by the <START:ggp> ubiquitin carrier enzymes <END> <START:ggp> E214K <END> , <START:ggp> E220K <END> , or <START:ggp> E232K <END> in the presence of the <START:ggp> ubiquitin-activating enzyme <END> , <START:ggp> E1 <END> . 
Addition of <START:ggp> ubiquitin protein ligase E3 <END> substantially enhanced the <START:ggp> E214K <END> -mediated ubiquitinylation of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> . 
<START:ggp> Truncated c-Jun and c-Fos mutant proteins <END> including <START:ggp> wbJun <END> and <START:ggp> wbFos <END> were also ubiquitinylated under the same conditions , suggesting the sites of ubiquitinylation are located within the <START:ggp> dimerization and DNA binding domains <END> of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> . 
The E3-dependent ubiquitinylation of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> was inhibited upon the heterodimerization of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> with <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> . 
Further addition of <START:ggp> E220K <END> significantly enhanced ubiquitinylation of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> in the heterodimer suggesting a regulatory role of <START:ggp> E220K <END> . 
Polyubiquitinylated <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> , <START:ggp> wbFos <END> , and <START:ggp> wbJun <END> , but not <START:ggp> E220K-ubiquitinylated c-Jun <END> , were readily degraded by the <START:ggp> ATP-dependent 26 S multicatalytic proteases <END> . 
These results suggest that the temporal control of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> may be regulated through the ubiquitinylation pathways , and the ubiquitinylation of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> may in turn be regulated in response to the heterodimerization between them and the cooperation between <START:ggp> E220K <END> and E3 mediated polyubiquitinylation . 
Cloning and characterization of the <START:ggp> murine B-cell specific transcriptional coactivator <END> <START:ggp> Bob1 <END> . 
From a <START:ggp> murine B-cell cDNA-library <END> we have cloned a <START:ggp> cDNA <END> encoding the <START:ggp> murine B-cell specific coactivator <END> <START:ggp> mBob1 <END> . 
The protein is the murine homologue to the recently described <START:ggp> human coactivator Bob1 <END> ( <START:ggp> hBob1 <END> ) , also referred to as <START:ggp> OBF-1 <END> or <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> . 
We have also characterized the <START:ggp> genomic mBob1 clone <END> . 
Analysis of its intron-exon structure has allowed identification of a <START:ggp> C-terminal splice variant <END> . 
<START:ggp> mBob1 <END> is B-cell restricted , and is found in all <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> representing different stages of B-cell differentiation . 
<START:ggp> mBob1 <END> interacts with the <START:ggp> octamer transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> and stimulates transcription mediated by these factors . 
<START:ggp> HIV glycoprotein 120 <END> enhances <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> gene expression in <START:ana> glial cells <END> . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> Janus kinase <END> <START:ggp> /signal transducer and activator of transcription <END> and <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> signaling pathways . 
It is well established that the two major <START:ana> glial cells <END> in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , <START:ana> astrocytes <END> and <START:ana> microglia <END> , are key participants in mediating the neurologic dysfunction associated with HIV infection of the CNS . 
In this study , we investigated the ability of the <START:ggp> major envelope glycoprotein <END> of HIV , <START:ggp> glycoprotein 120 <END> ( <START:ggp> gp120 <END> ) , to regulate <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ) expression in <START:ana> glial cells <END> , because <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> is important in mediating immune responsiveness in the CNS , facilitating entry of <START:ana> HIV-infected cells <END> into the CNS , and promoting syncytia formation . 
Our results indicate that <START:ggp> gp120 <END> enhances <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> gene expression in <START:ana> primary rat astrocytes <END> , <START:ana> primary human astrocytes <END> , a <START:ana> human astroglioma cell line CRT <END> , and <START:ana> primary rat microglia <END> . 
The signal transduction events involved in <START:ggp> gp120 <END> -mediated enhancement of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> appear to involve activation of both <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> and <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> , because inhibitors of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> and <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> abrogate <START:ggp> gp120 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> expression in both <START:ana> astrocytes <END> and <START:ana> microglia <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> gp120 <END> induces tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription <END> ( <START:ggp> STAT-1 alpha <END> ) as well as the <START:ggp> Janus kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> ) in <START:ana> glial cells <END> . 
We also demonstrate that <START:ggp> gp120 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> expression has functional significance , as it enhances the ability of <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> to bind to <START:ana> gp120-stimulated human astrocytes <END> in an <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> /beta 2 <START:ggp> integrin <END> -dependent fashion . 
These results provide new insights into how <START:ggp> gp120 <END> can influence the involvement of <START:ana> glial cells <END> in the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia complex . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> cooperates with <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> to activate HIV-1 from <START:ana> latently and acutely infected cells <END> of <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage lineage <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> is elevated in HIV-1-infected individuals and has been implicated in disease progression . 
In this study , we investigated the effects of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> on the activation of HIV-1 from <START:ana> infected monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> alone did not induce HIV-1 replication , in the presence of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> markedly enhanced virion production from a chronically infected <START:ana> promonocytic cell line <END> ( <START:ana> U1 <END> ) and in acutely infected <START:ana> monocyte-derived macrophages <END> . 
Neutralizing <START:ggp> mAbs <END> to <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> indicated that both <START:ggp> cytokines <END> were essential for the induction and were required to generate a synergistic increase in virus expression . 
The effects of the two <START:ggp> cytokines <END> were distinguishable functionally since pretreatment with <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> attenuated the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> cooperativity , while pretreatment with <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> potentiated their cooperativity , suggesting that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> play different roles in the activation of virus . 
Northern blot analysis as well as Ab blocking and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> secretion studies indicated that the induction of either <START:ggp> endogenous TNF-alpha <END> or <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> was not involved in the cooperativity , nor was an up-regulation of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha receptors <END> . 
In combination with <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> stimulated <START:ggp> activating protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> binding activities and cooperated to increase HIV-1 steady-state mRNA levels and enhance <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> -directed transcription through activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B binding sites <END> , suggesting the <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> effect occurs at least in part at the transcriptional level . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , in addition to down-regulating the cellular immune response to HIV-1 , may also play a role in <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -mediated activation of HIV-1 replication in the <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage lineage <END> . 
Interaction of <START:ggp> HTLV-I Tax <END> with the <START:ggp> human proteasome <END> : implications for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> induction . 
The human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) has been etiologically associated with the development of the adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) as well as degenerative neurologic syndrome termed tropical spastic paraparesis ( TSP ) . 
HTLV-I encodes a potent <START:ggp> transactivator <END> protein termed <START:ggp> Tax <END> that appears to play an important role in the process of T-cell immortalization . 
Even though the mechanisms by which <START:ggp> Tax <END> induces transformation are still unknown , it seems likely that the ability of <START:ggp> Tax <END> to alter the expression of many <START:ggp> cellular genes <END> plays an important part in this process . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> does not bind directly to DNA but rather deregulates the activity of <START:ggp> cellular transcription factors <END> . 
One family of <START:ggp> host transcription factors <END> whose activity is altered by <START:ggp> Tax <END> includes <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> . 
These <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are post-transcriptionally regulated by their assembly with a second family of <START:ggp> inhibitory proteins <END> termed <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> that serve to sequester the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel complexes <END> in the cytoplasm . 
Upon cellular activation , <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> is phosphorylated , polyubiquitinated , and degraded in the <START:ggp> proteasome <END> . 
This proteolytic event liberates <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , permitting its rapid translocation into the nucleus where it binds to its <START:ggp> cognate enhancer elements <END> . 
Similarly , the <START:ggp> p105 precursor <END> of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> p50 subunit <END> is also post-translationally processed in the <START:ggp> proteasome <END> . 
The mechanisms by which <START:ggp> Tax <END> activates <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> remain unclear , and findings presented in the literature are often controversial . 
We identified a physical interaction between <START:ggp> Tax <END> and the <START:ggp> HsN3 subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> human proteasome <END> . 
This raises the intriguing possibility that physical association of the <START:ggp> HsN3 proteasome subunit <END> with <START:ggp> HTLV-I Tax <END> coupled with the independent interaction of <START:ggp> Tax <END> with either p100 or p65- <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> targets these <START:ggp> cytoplasmic NF-kappa B/Rel complexes <END> to the <START:ggp> proteasome <END> for processing . 
Immunophenotype of intraductal carcinoma . 
OBJECTIVE -- Mammography and breast-conserving therapy have focused attention on the classification of intraductal carcinoma ( IDC ) and emphasized the prognostic importance of comedo versus noncomedo variants . 
We used histochemical markers to define the immunophenotype of 43 IDCs with respect to comedo versus noncomedo status and patterns of angiogenesis . 
RESULTS -- Reactions in comedo carcinomas were significantly negative for <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> and <START:ggp> progesterone receptor <END> , and positive for <START:ggp> p53 <END> and <START:ggp> HER-2/neu <END> more often than the noncomedo variant . 
All seven IDCs associated with Paget 's disease showed positive reactions for <START:ggp> HER-2/neu <END> . 
Basement membrane immunoreactivity for <START:ggp> type IV collagen <END> and <START:ggp> laminin <END> was discontinuous in most examples of IDC regardless of type , with a trend toward more intense staining in comedo than in noncomedo carcinomas . 
Periductal angiogenesis was not significantly related to the type of IDC but was more pronounced with comedo carcinomas . 
CONCLUSIONS -- These observations indicate that there are immunophenotypic correlates to the current structural classification of IDC . 
The immunophenotype of IDC is helpful in subclassifying an IDC and could prove useful as a prognostic indicator for local control in patients treated by breast-conserving therapy . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> protein phosphatase 2A <END> induces serine/threonine phosphorylation , subcellular redistribution , and functional inhibition of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Signal transducers and activators of transcription <END> ( <START:ggp> STATs <END> ) are rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to <START:ggp> cytokine <END> and <START:ggp> growth factor <END> stimulation of <START:ggp> cell surface receptors <END> . 
<START:ggp> STATs <END> hereafter are translocated to the nucleus where they act as <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Recent reports suggest that serine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STATs <END> also is involved in the regulation of <START:ggp> STAT <END> -mediated gene transcription . 
Here , we studied the role of <START:ggp> serine/threonine phosphatases <END> in <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> signaling in <START:ana> human antigen-specific CD4 ( + ) T cell lines <END> and <START:ana> cutaneous T cell lymphoma lines <END> , expressing a constitutively activated <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> . 
We show that an inhibitor of <START:ggp> protein phosphatases <END> ( <START:ggp> PPs <END> ) <START:ggp> PP1/PP2A <END> , <START:ggp> calyculin A <END> , induces ( i ) phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> on serine and threonine residues , ( ii ) inhibition of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity , and ( iii ) relocation of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm . 
Similar results were obtained with other PP2A inhibitors ( okadaic acid , endothall thioanhydride ) but not with inhibitors of <START:ggp> PP1 <END> ( tautomycin ) or <START:ggp> PP2B <END> ( cyclosporine A ) . 
Pretreatment with the broad serine/threonine kinase inhibitor staurosporine partly blocked the <START:ggp> calyculin A <END> -induced <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> phosphorylation , whereas inhibitors of <START:ggp> serine/threonine kinases <END> , such as <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 extracellular-regulated kinase-kinase <END> , <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein p38 kinase <END> , and <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> , did not . 
In conclusion , we provide evidence that <START:ggp> PP2A <END> plays a crucial role in the regulation of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> phosphorylation and subcellular distribution in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Moreover , our findings suggest that the level of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> phosphorylation is balanced between a <START:ggp> staurosporine-sensitive kinase <END> ( s ) and <START:ggp> PP2A <END> . 
Polyamines in human breast cancer and its relations to classical prognostic features : clinical implications . 
Experimental evidence suggest an important role of polyamines in breast cancer development . 
Polyamines have been determined in tissue and erythrocyte samples from 100 patients with primary invasive breast cancer and 30 patients with fibroadenomas . 
Statistical analysis was performed in order to determine the prognostic value of the polyamine patterns of tumor tissues and erythrocytes in comparison with clinical and histological prognostic factors . 
In malignant tissues , polyamine levels were significantly higher than in benign tissues . 
They correlated with markers of tumor aggressivity ( axillary node involvement and especially with markers of high mitotic rate as Ki-67 staining , histological grade ) . 
No correlation was found between estrogen and progesterone status , tumor size and polyamine concentrations . 
Erythrocyte polyamines levels were identical between cancer patients and controls . 
The knowledge of the polyamine pattern in breast cancer could become useful in clinical practice particularly if polyamine metabolism is targeted as a therapeutic approach . 
Signal transduction pathways triggered by the <START:ggp> FcepsilonRIIb receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> CD23 <END> ) in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> lead to <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> activation . 
BACKGROUND : <START:ana> Alveolar macrophages <END> play a key role in the initiation of the inflammatory reaction of allergic asthma . 
<START:ana> Alveolar macrophages <END> and <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> are activated when <START:ggp> IgE/allergen immune complexes <END> bind to the <START:ggp> CD23 receptor <END> , which leads to the production of <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> . 
OBJECTIVE : We sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating this early inflammatory response . 
We have focused on the study of the signal transduction pathways triggered by <START:ggp> CD23 <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and the <START:ana> promonocytic cell line U937 <END> . 
METHODS : <START:ggp> CD23 <END> was cross-linked in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> U937 cells <END> with <START:ggp> IgE immune complexes <END> . 
Surface expression of <START:ggp> CD23 <END> was determined by FACS analysis . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor <END> activation and gene transcription were studied by gel-shift assays and Northern blot analysis , respectively . 
<START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> phosphorylation and degradation was analyzed by Western blot . 
RESULTS : <START:ggp> Nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB <END> is the main transcription factor involved in the gene activation that follows <START:ggp> CD23 <END> cross-linking in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD23-induced NF-kappaB <END> is a heterodimer composed of <START:ggp> p65/p50 subunits <END> . 
NF-kappaB nuclear translocation is secondary to the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB inhibitory molecule <END> <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tyrosine kinase <END> -dependent , and not <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> -dependent , pathways mediate <START:ggp> CD23 <END> -triggered <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation but do not participate in the direct phosphorylation of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> degradation and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> nuclear translocation correlate with transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and IL-1beta . 
CONCLUSIONS : <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> is the main transcription factor involved in the signal transduction pathway of <START:ggp> CD23 <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Suppression of <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> -mediated <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activity by myricetin and other flavonoids through downregulating the activity of <START:ggp> IKK <END> in <START:ana> ECV304 cells <END> . 
Flavonoids are a group of naturally-occurring phenolic compounds in the plant kingdom , and many flavonoids are found with vascular protective properties . 
Nevertheless how the protective response is exerted by flavonoids is not well characterized . 
In view of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> ) may play a central role in the initiation of atherosclerosis , prevention of the activation of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> represents an important role in protecting vascular injury . 
In this study , the effects of flavonoids on <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> /inhibitor-kappaB ( <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> ) system in <START:ana> ECV304 cells <END> activated with <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> ) were examined . 
We investigated the inhibitory action of six flavonoids on <START:ggp> IkappaB kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> IKK <END> ) activity , an enzyme recently found to phosphorylate critical serine residues of IkappaB for degradation . 
Of six flavonoids tested , myricetin was found to strongly inhibit <START:ggp> IKK <END> kinase activity , and prevent the degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> and <START:ggp> IkappaBbeta <END> in activated endothelial cells . 
Furthermore , myricetin was also found to inhibit <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activity correlated with suppression of monocyte adhesion to <START:ana> ECV304 cells <END> . 
Therefore we conclude that flavonoids may be of therapeutic value for vascular disease through down regulation of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> <START:ggp> /IkappaB <END> system .

<START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> -mediated drug resistance : inhibition of apoptosis by blocking <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) -induced <START:ggp> Fas <END> ligand transcription . 
<START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli , including chemotherapy drugs and glucocorticoids . 
It is generally accepted that <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> exerts its antiapoptotic effects mainly by dimerizing with proapoptotic members of the <START:ggp> Bcl-2 family <END> such as <START:ggp> Bax <END> and <START:ggp> Bad <END> . 
However , the mechanism of the antiapoptotic effects is unclear . 
Paclitaxel and other drugs that disturb <START:ggp> microtubule <END> dynamics kill cells in a <START:ggp> Fas <END> <START:ggp> /Fas ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> FasL <END> ) -dependent manner ; antibody to <START:ggp> FasL <END> inhibits paclitaxel-induced apoptosis . 
We have found that <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> overexpression leads to the prevention of chemotherapy ( paclitaxel ) -induced expression of <START:ggp> FasL <END> and blocks paclitaxel-induced apoptosis . 
The mechanism of this effect is that <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> prevents the nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ( <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes <END> , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> activated by <START:ggp> microtubule <END> damage ) by binding and sequestering calcineurin , a calcium-dependent phosphatase that must dephosphorylate <START:ggp> NFAT <END> to move to the nucleus . 
Without <START:ggp> NFAT <END> nuclear translocation , the <START:ggp> FasL <END> gene is not transcribed . 
Thus , it appears that paclitaxel and other drugs that disturb <START:ggp> microtubule <END> function kill cells at least in part through the induction of <START:ggp> FasL <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> antagonizes drug-induced apoptosis by inhibiting <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> activation , blocking <START:ggp> NFAT <END> nuclear translocation , and preventing <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression . 
The effects of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> can be overcome , at least partially , through phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> . 
Phosphorylated <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> can not bind <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , and <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation , <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression , and apoptosis can occur after <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> phosphorylation . 
MHC-peptide ligand interactions establish a functional threshold for antigen-specific T cell recognition . 
Antigen-specific T cell recognition is dependent on the functional density of the <START:ggp> TCR <END> -ligand , which consists of specific <START:ggp> MHC molecules <END> and a specifically bound peptide . 
We have examined the influence of the affinity and concentration of exogenous peptide and the density of specific <START:ggp> MHC molecules <END> on the proliferation of a <START:ana> CD4+ , DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201 ( DQ2.1 ) -restricted , HSV-2-specific T cell clone <END> . 
Using antigen peptide analogs with different mutations of known DQ2-anchor residues , T cell response was reduced in an peptide-affinity and - concentration specific manner . 
The decrease using weaker binding peptides was gradual as stimulation with a peptide with intermediate affinity yielded intermediate <START:ana> T cell <END> proliferation and the poorest binding peptide induced an even weaker <START:ana> T cell <END> response . 
<START:ggp> MHC class II <END> density on the <START:ana> APC <END> was modified using <START:ana> DQ2 homo -and heterozygous B-LCLs <END> as <START:ana> APCs <END> , however this variation of MHC concentration had no effect on <START:ana> T cell <END> proliferation . 
We interpret this as a reflection of a low threshold for activation of the <START:ana> T cell clone <END> , in which peptide- <START:ggp> MHC <END> avidity is the over-riding determinant of the strength of ligand signal . 
Regulatory effects of <START:ggp> interleukin-11 <END> during acute lung inflammatory injury . 
The role of <START:ggp> interleukin-11 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-11 <END> ) was evaluated in the <START:ggp> IgG immune complex <END> model of acute lung injury in rats . 
<START:ana> IL-11 mRNA <END> and protein were both up-regulated during the course of this inflammatory response . 
Exogenously administered <START:ggp> IL-11 <END> substantially reduced , in a dose-dependent manner , the intrapulmonary accumulation of <START:ana> neutrophils <END> and the lung vascular leak of <START:ggp> albumin <END> . 
These in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of <START:ggp> IL-11 <END> were associated with reduced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in lung , reduced levels of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluids , and diminished up-regulation of <START:ggp> lung vascular ICAM-1 <END> . 
It is interesting that <START:ggp> IL-11 <END> did not affect BAL fluid content of the <START:ggp> CXC chemokines <END> , <START:ggp> macrophage inflammatory protein-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> MIP-2 <END> ) and <START:ggp> cytokine-inducible neutrophil chemoattractant <END> ( <START:ggp> CINC <END> ) ; the presence of <START:ggp> IL-11 <END> did not affect these <START:ggp> chemokines <END> . 
However , BAL content of C5a was reduced by <START:ggp> IL-11 <END> . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> IL-11 <END> is a <START:ggp> regulatory cytokine <END> in the lung and that , like other members of this family , its anti-inflammatory properties appear to be linked to its suppression of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation , diminished production of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , and reduced up-regulation of <START:ggp> lung vascular ICAM-1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Thrombopoietin <END> induces tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> in <START:ana> human blood platelets <END> . 
<START:ggp> Thrombopoietin <END> is known to be essential for megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis . 
Recently , we and others have shown that <START:ggp> thrombopoietin <END> induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> and other proteins in <START:ana> human platelets <END> and <START:ana> BaF3 cells <END> , genetically engineered to express <START:ggp> c-Mpl <END> , a receptor for <START:ggp> thrombopoietin <END> . 
The Jak family of <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> are known to mediate some of the effects of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> or <START:ggp> hematopoietic growth factors <END> by recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of <START:ggp> Stat <END> ( <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription <END> ) proteins . 
Hence , we have investigated whether <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> are present in <START:ana> platelets <END> and , if so , whether they become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to <START:ggp> thrombopoietin <END> . 
We immunologically identified <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> , <START:ggp> Stat2 <END> , <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> , and <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> in human platelet lysates . 
<START:ggp> Thrombopoietin <END> induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> in these cells . 
<START:ggp> Thrombopoietin <END> also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> in <START:ana> FDCP-2 cells <END> genetically engineered to constitutively express <START:ggp> human c-Mpl <END> . 
Thus , our data indicate that <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> may be involved in signal transduction after ligand binding to <START:ggp> c-Mpl <END> and that this event may have a role in megakaryopoiesis/thrombopoiesis or possibly a mature platelet function such as aggregation . 
Mechanisms that contribute to the development of lymphoid malignancies : roles for genetic alterations and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production . 
Recent studies have defined genetic alterations commonly associated with <START:ana> transformed lymphocytes <END> . 
This review suggests roles for these alterations in the development of lymphoid neoplasms . 
Damage to the genes encoding proteins that function in intracellular signaling , transcription , or regulation of the cell cycle has been identified and linked at varying degrees to the progression of certain lymphoid malignancies . 
An understanding of the mechanistic consequences following such genetic alterations is essential to an understanding of the development of these lymphoid neoplasms . 
In contrast , it is also becoming clear that the dysregulated expression of proteins that are not genetically altered can also contribute to the progression of lymphoid malignancies . 
One such example is the excessive expression of <START:ggp> `` normal '' lymphokines <END> of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> which accompanies many lymphoproliferative diseases . 
The dysregulated expression of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> during malignancy can result in the augmentation of growth of <START:ana> transformed lymphocytes <END> , as well as an alteration of the anti-tumor immune response . 
The latter mechanism is especially important because evasion of the impending immune response is a prerequisite for the progression of lymphoproliferative diseases . 
Taken together , this review supports the notion that the development of lymphoid malignancies is multifactorial , involving genetic alterations as well as dysregulated <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression . 
Dehydroepiandrosterone modulation of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocyte cytotoxicity . 
Dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , the predominant androgen secreted by the adrenal cortex , can be converted to both potent androgens and estrogens . 
In addition to its role as a precursor for other steroid hormones , DHEA has been proposed to play an important role in immunity . 
This study has investigated DHEA modulation of LPS-induced monocyte cytotoxicity . 
<START:ggp> Cytotoxicity markers <END> assessed include tumor cell killing , <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> secretion , reactive oxygen intermediate release , <START:ggp> nitric oxide synthetase <END> activity as measured by the release of reactive nitrogen intermediates , <START:ggp> complement receptor-1 cell surface protein <END> , and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha protein <END> presence . 
<START:ana> Monocytes <END> stimulated with LPS concentrations of 1.0 micrograms/ml displayed the above cytotoxic markers , whereas <START:ana> monocytes <END> stimulated with DHEA alone or with LPS at a lower concentration of 0.2 ng/ml did not . 
However , when used simultaneously , DHEA and LPS 0.2 ng/ml displayed a synergistic effect on monocyte cytotoxicity against <START:ana> cancerous cell lines <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> secretion , reactive nitrogen intermediate release , <START:ggp> complement receptor-1 cell-surface protein <END> , and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha protein <END> to levels comparable with levels obtained using LPS 1.0 microgram/ml . 
Finally , Scatchard plot analysis demonstrated the presence of a DHEA receptor in <START:ana> monocytes <END> , suggesting that DHEA effects on <START:ana> LPS-stimulated monocytes <END> are mediated through a receptor-dependent process . 
Interferons inhibit activation of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> by <START:ggp> interleukin 4 <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> by inducing <START:ggp> SOCS-1 gene <END> expression . 
<START:ggp> Interferons <END> ( <START:ggp> IFNs <END> ) inhibit induction by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> of multiple genes in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
However , the mechanism by which <START:ggp> IFNs <END> mediate this inhibition has not been defined . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> activates gene expression by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation , homodimerization , and nuclear translocation of the <START:ggp> latent transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> ( <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> STAT6 <END> -responsive elements are characteristically present in the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of <START:ggp> IL-4-inducible genes <END> . 
Because <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> activation is essential for <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -induced gene expression , we examined the ability of type I and type II <START:ggp> IFNs <END> to regulate activation of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> in <START:ana> primary human monocytes <END> . 
Pretreatment of <START:ana> monocytes <END> with <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> or <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , but not <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> , <START:ggp> granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , or transforming growth factor beta suppressed activation of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> . 
This inhibition was associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> and was not evident unless the cells were preincubated with <START:ggp> IFN <END> for at least 1 hr before <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> stimulation . 
Furthermore , inhibition by <START:ggp> IFN <END> could be blocked by cotreatment with actinomycin D and correlated temporally with induction of the <START:ggp> JAK/STAT inhibitory gene <END> , <START:ggp> SOCS-1 <END> . 
Forced expression of <START:ggp> SOCS-1 <END> in a <START:ana> macrophage cell line <END> , <START:ana> RAW264 <END> , markedly suppressed trans-activation of an <START:ggp> IL-4-inducible reporter <END> as well as IL-6- and IFN-gamma-induced reporter gene activity . 
These findings demonstrate that <START:ggp> IFNs <END> inhibit <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> -dependent gene expression , at least in part , by inducing expression of <START:ggp> SOCS-1 <END> . 
An activation-responsive element in single <START:ggp> C motif-1/lymphotactin promoter <END> is a site of constitutive and inducible DNA-protein interactions involving <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cell <END> . 
<START:ggp> Single C motif-1 ( SCM-1 ) /lymphotactin <END> is a <START:ggp> C-type chemokine <END> whose expression is activation dependent , cyclosporin A sensitive and restricted to <START:ana> CD8+ T cells <END> , <START:ana> double-negative thymocytes <END> , <START:ana> gammadelta-type T cells <END> , and <START:ana> NK cells <END> . 
In humans , there are two highly <START:ggp> homologous genes <END> encoding <START:ggp> SCM-1alpha <END> and <START:ggp> SCM-1beta <END> . 
Here we examined the regulatory mechanism of the <START:ggp> SCM-1 genes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> luciferase reporter gene <END> under the control of the <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking region <END> of 0.7 kb was strongly induced upon activation with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> or <START:ggp> PHA <END> plus PMA only in <START:ana> SCM-1-producer T cell lines <END> through a cyclosporin A-sensitive mechanism . 
An element termed <START:ggp> E1 <END> located at <START:ggp> -108 to -95 nt <END> relative to the major transcription start site was found to be critical for the promoter activity . 
In electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the <START:ggp> E1 <END> oligonucleotide as probe , nuclear extracts from unstimulated T and <START:ana> B cell lines <END> formed a <START:ggp> constitutive complex <END> termed <START:ggp> complex I <END> , while nuclear extracts from stimulated <START:ana> SCM-1-producer T cell lines <END> formed a <START:ggp> higher mobility complex <END> termed <START:ggp> complex II <END> with a concomitant decrease in <START:ggp> complex I <END> . 
The shift from <START:ggp> complex I <END> to <START:ggp> complex II <END> seen only in <START:ana> SCM-1-producer T cell lines <END> upon activation was completely suppressed by cyclosporin A . 
Both complexes were critically dependent on the <START:ggp> NF-AT core sequence <END> TTTCC in the <START:ggp> E1 element <END> and were partially supershifted by <START:ggp> anti-NF-ATp <END> . 
One-hybrid assays in <START:ggp> yeast isolated NF-ATp <END> as an <START:ggp> E1 binding protein <END> , and transfection of <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> into <START:ana> T and B cell lines <END> strongly enhanced the <START:ggp> activation-dependent SCM-1 <END> promoter activity . 
Collectively , a unique mechanism involving <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> appears to regulate the cell type-specific and activation-dependent expression of the <START:ggp> SCM-1 genes <END> . 
Dopamine stimulates expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 via <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in cells of the immune system . 
Recent studies have reported that <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> produce , transport and bind dopamine present in plasma . 
However , the action of dopamine on HIV-1 gene expression in cells of the immune system has not yet been examined . 
Here , we have investigated the regulation of HIV-1 expression by dopamine in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> and in <START:ana> primary blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) . 
HIV-1 replication was increased by dopamine , which correlated with the increased levels of HIV-1 transactivation . 
Our transient expression data revealed that dopamine stimulated transcription through the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB element <END> present in the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> . 
The importance of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB sites <END> was confirmed by using vectors containing <START:ggp> wild-type or mutant kappaB sites <END> in a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> . 
Consistent with the role of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in mediating dopamine responsiveness , the proteasome inhibitor MG132 abolished dopamine-induced transcriptional activation . 
We further explored the effect of dopamine in the presence of phorbol esters or <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) known to activate <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
The combination of dopamine and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> led to a stimulation of HIV-1 transcription and replication . 
However , in contrast with <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , dopamine treatment did not affect <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA binding activity nor the concentrations of <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha proteins <END> , which suggests a distinct <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation mechanism . 
These results reveal a new link between the dopamine system , <START:ggp> cytokine <END> signaling pathway and regulation of gene expression via the involvement of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> PBMC <END> . 
[ Hormonal metabolic status in breast cancer patients after conservative surgery : comparison with known prognostic criteria ] 
Body weight , body mass index , body fat , lean body mass , blood-glucose , cholesterol , <START:ggp> HDL-cholesterol <END> , triglyceride , <START:ggp> beta-lipoproteins <END> , insulin , gonadotropin , estradiol , testosterone , <START:ggp> SHBG <END> , <START:ggp> T3 <END> , <START:ggp> T4 <END> and TSH levels as well as estradiol and progesterone receptor levels in excised tumor were studied in 40 patients with breast cancer prior to conservative treatment . 
Said anthropometric , metabolic and hormonal parameters were compared with the index of lymphocytic infiltration of tumor selected as a prognostic factor . 
A significant correlation between high lymphocytic infiltration ( 2.5 points ) , low body mass and fat was identified . 
Also , smoking contributed to loss of body mass and fat ; however , it caused lymphocytic infiltration to rise . 
Moderate body mass , relatively low fat level and positive receptor status are among factors of good prognosis in breast cancer of early stages . 
Selective DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> interleukin-10-stimulated STAT molecules <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
It has been demonstrated that <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) and <START:ggp> interleukin-10 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ) have various reverse effects on <START:ana> macrophages <END> ; however , the molecular mechanism of this difference has not been fully understood . 
In this study , we analyzed the binding activity of <START:ggp> IL-10- and IFN-gamma-activated STAT molecules <END> to two kinds of <START:ggp> GAS <END> -motif sequences . 
<START:ggp> IL-10-activated STAT1 <END> could bind to the <START:ggp> GAS-motif sequence <END> in the promoter region of the <START:ggp> Fcgamma receptor <END> , but not to that in the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> of the <START:ggp> COX-2 gene <END> , whereas <START:ggp> IFN-gamma-activated STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> could bind to both sequences . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibited <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -induced <START:ggp> STAT <END> activation without <START:ggp> newly synthesized protein <END> . 
We further demonstrated that aspirin , but not dexamethasone , suppressed <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -induced <START:ggp> STAT <END> activation . 
Taken together , these results suggest that <START:ggp> IL-10-activated STAT1 <END> has a specificity in binding to the <START:ggp> GAS-motif sequences <END> , whereas <START:ggp> IFN-gamma-activated STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> have a broader spectrum in binding to the <START:ggp> GAS-motif sequences <END> . 
This may explain the difference between <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> in biological activity , and the inhibitory effect of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> on <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> activities . 
Peptide binding affinity and pH variation establish functional thresholds for activation of <START:ggp> HLA-DQ <END> -restricted T cell recognition . 
Peptides derived from the <START:ggp> HSV-2 VP16 protein <END> were utilized for studies of peptide binding to DQ0302 molecules and T cell activation at both neutral and acidic pH . 
The native peptide VP16 430-444 contains an Asp at <START:ggp> position 442 <END> , binds to DQ0302 strongly , with a Kd value of 50nM at acidic pH and very weakly , with a Kd value of greater than 10 microM at neutral pH . 
A truncated version of 430-444 , i.e. , VP16 433-442 , binds with an affinity 10-fold lower compared to 430-444 at acidic pH , and binding at neutral pH was barely detectable . 
The homologous peptide 430-444 , 442A has an Asp to Ala substitution at position 442 and binds to DQ0302 with a Kd similar to 433-442 . 
The short truncated analog 433-442A binds very poorly at both acidic and neutral pH . 
Both the wild type 430-444 and 433-442 peptides stimulated a HSV-specific T cell clone after a brief incubation with <START:ana> antigen presenting cells <END> ( <START:ana> APC <END> ) expressing DQ0302 at acidic pH . 
Much higher concentrations of wild type peptides were needed to activate <START:ana> T cells <END> at neutral pH . 
In contrast , <START:ana> APC <END> pulsed with Ala-substituted peptides 430-444 , 442A or 433-442A at neutral pH failed to stimulate the <START:ana> T cell clone <END> , while <START:ana> APC <END> pulsed at acidic pH and subsequently washed led to successful T cell activation . 
The Ala-substituted peptide was recognized by the <START:ana> T cell clone <END> at neutral pH only when it was present in the <START:ana> APC culture <END> throughout the stimulation process . 
While the <START:ggp> MHC-peptide complexes <END> formed with the native peptide are stable , complexes formed with the Ala-substituted peptide had a functional t1/2 of less than 4 hr at neutral pH . 
<START:ggp> ETS transcription factors <END> regulate an enhancer activity in the <START:ggp> third intron <END> of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> . 
We describe an enhancer site in the <START:ggp> third intron <END> of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) . 
A <START:ggp> reporter construct <END> containing the <START:ggp> 5'-flanking region <END> of the mouse <START:ggp> TNF-alpha gene <END> displayed weak activity when transfected into <START:ana> RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells <END> . 
The addition of the <START:ggp> third intron <END> of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> to this construct resulted in an enhancement of <START:ggp> CAT protein <END> . 
This enhancement was eliminated if a <START:ggp> conserved 20-bp sequence <END> was removed from the <START:ggp> intron <END> or if a <START:ggp> dominant-negative ets-binding factor <END> was co-transfected with the <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> . 
Mutations of this site that destroyed potential <START:ggp> ets transcription factor binding sites <END> had reduced transcriptional activity . 
The major transcription factor that bound to the oligonucleotide was confirmed to be <START:ggp> GABP <END> by supershift and competition analysis . 
In <START:ana> RAW264.7 cells <END> , the binding was constitutive , however , in <START:ana> bone marrow-derived macrophages <END> binding activity was shown to be <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> inducible . 
This may imply a role for <START:ggp> ets transcription factors <END> in the production of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> E2F-1 <END> blocks terminal differentiation and causes proliferation in <START:ana> transgenic megakaryocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> E2F-1 <END> plays a central role in the cell cycle through its ability to <START:ggp> activate genes <END> involved in cell division . 
<START:ggp> E2F-1 <END> activity is regulated by a number of proteins , including the retinoblastoma <START:ggp> susceptibility gene <END> product , <START:ggp> cyclin-dependent kinases <END> , and their inhibitors , proteins that have been implicated in the control of certain developmental processes . 
To investigate a potential role of <START:ggp> E2F-1 <END> in differentiation , we assayed the ability of <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> to form <START:ana> platelets <END> in an in vivo transgenic model . 
<START:ggp> E2F-1 <END> expression in <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> blocked differentiation during maturation , resulting in severe thrombocytopenia . 
Ultrastructural analysis of <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> revealed abnormal development characterized by hyperdemarcation of cytoplasmic membranes and reduced numbers of alpha granules . 
Administration of <START:ggp> megakaryocyte growth and development factor <END> or <START:ggp> interleukin 6 <END> could not overcome the differentiation block . 
Additionally , <START:ggp> E2F-1 <END> caused massive <START:ana> megakaryocyte <END> accumulation in both normal and ectopic sites , first evident in E15 embryonic liver . 
Furthermore , significant apoptosis was observed in <START:ana> transgenic megakaryocytes <END> . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> E2F-1 <END> can prevent terminal differentiation , probably through its cell cycle-stimulatory activity . 
Polymorphic nucleotides within the <START:ggp> human IL-4 promoter <END> that mediate overexpression of the gene . 
Atopy , which predisposes individuals to develop asthma , severe systemic anaphylaxis , and atopic dermatitis , is usually associated with dramatically elevated total serum <START:ggp> IgE <END> levels and is thought to be controlled by a major <START:ggp> susceptibility gene <END> and multiple minor <START:ggp> susceptibility genes <END> . 
A recent sib-pair analysis revealed a tight linkage between markers on <START:ggp> 5q31.1 <END> and a <START:ggp> major susceptibility gene <END> controlling total serum <START:ggp> IgE <END> levels . 
Due to its location within this cluster and its biologic role in Ig class switching and <START:ana> Th2 cell <END> differentiation , the <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> has emerged as one major candidate for the <START:ggp> atopy gene <END> . 
In one model , polymorphisms within <START:ggp> IL-4 regulatory elements <END> might result in overexpression of the gene , amplifying <START:ana> Th2 cell <END> differentiation and class switching to <START:ggp> IgE <END> . 
In support of this model , we report that the <START:ggp> human IL-4 promoter <END> exists in multiple allelic forms that exhibit distinct transcriptional activities in <START:ana> IL-4-positive T cells <END> . 
A particular allele has an unusually high transcriptional activity . 
A nucleotide substitution within a recently described <START:ggp> OAP40 element <END> located just upstream of an <START:ggp> NF-AT site <END> ( <START:ggp> P sequence <END> ) appears to be largely responsible for the increased promotor strength of this particular allelic form of the <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter <END> . 
In EMSAs , this substitution results in a markedly enhanced affinity for sequence-specific complexes exhibiting an <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> specificity . 
The identification of allelic nucleotides , which results in overexpression of the <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> , provides specific targets for a comprehensive screening of atopic and nonatopic individuals and may provide a clue for genetic predisposition for atopy . 
Evidence for lowered induction of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> in <START:ana> activated human T lymphocytes <END> during aging . 
Transcription factor <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ) is induced in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> from young individuals following activation with a variety of stimuli including <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) . 
In contrast , activated <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> from older individuals show a significant reduction in the induction of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> in response to the same stimuli . 
The age-related decline in induction of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> could not be attributed to alteration in the composition of subunits , <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 <END> were found to be the predominant subunits of induced <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> from young as well as elderly donors . 
Furthermore , similar levels of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> were found in the cytosols of unactivated <START:ana> T cells <END> from both young and elderly donors suggesting that precursor levels of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> remain unaltered during aging . 
These results suggest that an age-associated decline in the induction of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> in activated <START:ana> T cells <END> from elderly individuals may be attributable to altered regulation of the inhibitor , <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> , and may play an important role in immune dysregulation accompanying aging . 
Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced <START:ggp> monocyte interleukin-1 receptor <END> antagonist synthesis by cortisol : involvement of the <START:ggp> mineralocorticoid receptor <END> . 
Glucocorticoids , as a part of their physiological role in the control of inflammatory and immune processes , suppress the expression of <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> ) and other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
<START:ana> Human monocyte IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1ra ) messenger ribonucleic acid <END> ( mRNA ) expression and protein secretion are inhibited by dexamethasone . 
We have now further studied the regulation of <START:ggp> IL-1ra <END> by the major physiological human glucocorticoid , cortisol . 
We found that cortisol incubation induced a decrease in <START:ana> IL-1ra mRNA <END> expression and a significant inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-1ra protein <END> secretion in cell cultures of <START:ana> human peripheral monocytes <END> stimulated with the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . 
Oral administration of 276 mumol cortisol to normal subjects also decreased LPS-induced <START:ggp> IL-1ra <END> synthesis in <START:ana> cultured monocytes <END> . 
By coincubating the <START:ana> monocytes <END> with either the mineralocorticoid antagonist spironolactone or the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> antagonist RU 38486 , the in vitro cortisol-induced inhibition of LPS-stimulated <START:ggp> IL-1ra <END> secretion was partially reversed . 
The mineralocorticoid aldosterone exerted a significant decrease in LPS-induced monocyte <START:ggp> IL-1ra <END> secretion in vitro , which was blocked by coincubation with spironolactone . 
In addition , the expression of <START:ana> mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA <END> in human <START:ana> monocytes <END> was observed by PCR of <START:ana> reversed transcribed RNA <END> . 
Our results further indicate that corticosteroids physiologically control the IL-1/ <START:ggp> IL-1ra <END> system during inflammatory or immune processes . 
Moreover , we provide evidence that , in addition to a <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> -mediated effect , the <START:ggp> mineralocorticoid receptor <END> is involved in the inhibition of monocyte <START:ggp> IL-1ra <END> secretion by cortisol . 
Target structures of the CD8 ( + ) -T-cell response to human cytomegalovirus : the <START:ggp> 72-kilodalton major immediate-early protein <END> revisited . 
Cell-mediated immunity plays an essential role in the control of infection with the human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) . 
However , only a few <START:ggp> CD8 ( + ) -T-cell epitopes <END> are known , with the majority being contained in the <START:ggp> pp65 phosphoprotein <END> , which is believed to dominate the CD8 ( + ) -T-cell response to HCMV . 
Here , we have readdressed the issue of <START:ana> CD8 ( + ) T cells <END> specific for the <START:ggp> 72-kDa major immediate-early protein <END> ( <START:ggp> IE-1 <END> ) , which is nonstructural but is found very early and throughout the replicative cycle . 
Using a novel flow-cytometric assay , we were able to identify <START:ggp> CD8 ( + ) -T-cell epitopes <END> ( by <START:ggp> IE-1 <END> peptide-specific induction of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> synthesis ) and simultaneously measure the frequency of cells directed against them . 
For this purpose , 81 pentadecamer peptides covering the complete <START:ggp> 491-amino-acid sequence <END> of <START:ggp> IE-1 <END> were tested on <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> of anti-HCMV immunoglobulin G-seropositive donors . 
At least 10 new <START:ggp> epitopes <END> were identified , and the fine specificity and presenting <START:ggp> HLA molecule <END> of the first of them was determined . 
The frequencies of <START:ana> CD8 ( + ) T cells <END> directed against <START:ggp> IE-1 <END> were similar to those directed against <START:ggp> pp65 <END> in donors tested with known <START:ggp> pp65 <END> -derived peptides . 
Importantly , additional testing of a corresponding set of peptides covering the complete sequence of <START:ggp> pp65 <END> on 10 of these donors identified individuals whose <START:ana> CD8 ( + ) T cells <END> recognized <START:ggp> IE-1 <END> but not <START:ggp> pp65 <END> and vice versa , clearly illustrating that either protein may be a major target . 
In summary , our results suggest that <START:ggp> IE-1 <END> is far more important as a CD8 ( + ) -T-cell target than current opinion suggests . 
<START:ggp> E1A oncogene <END> induction of cellular susceptibility to killing by <START:ana> cytolytic lymphocytes <END> through target cell sensitization to apoptotic injury . 
<START:ggp> E1A oncogene <END> expression increases mammalian cell susceptibility to lysis by <START:ana> cytolytic lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> CLs <END> ) at a stage in this intercellular interaction that is independent of cell surface recognition events . 
Since <START:ana> CLs <END> can induce either apoptotic or necrotic cell death , we asked whether <START:ggp> E1A <END> sensitization to injury-induced apoptosis is sufficient to explain <START:ggp> E1A <END> -induced cytolytic susceptibility . 
<START:ana> Mouse , rat , hamster , and human cells <END> that were rendered cytolytic susceptible by <START:ggp> E1A <END> were also sensitized to CL-induced and chemically induced apoptosis . 
In contrast , <START:ana> E1A-positive cells <END> were no more susceptible to injury-induced necrosis than <START:ana> E1A-negative cells <END> . 
Similar to induction of cytolytic susceptibility and in contrast to other <START:ggp> E1A <END> activities , cellular sensitization to chemically induced apoptosis depended on high-level <START:ggp> E1A <END> <START:ggp> oncoprotein <END> expression . 
Loss of both cytolytic susceptibility and sensitization to chemically induced apoptosis was coselected during in vivo selection of <START:ana> E1A-positive sarcoma cells <END> for increased tumorigenicity . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> E1A <END> <START:ggp> mutant proteins <END> that can not bind the <START:ggp> cellular transcriptional coactivator <END> , <START:ggp> p300 <END> , and that fail to induce cytolytic susceptibility also failed to sensitize cells to injury-induced apoptosis . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> E1A <END> induces susceptibility to killer cell-induced lysis through sensitization of cells to injury-induced apoptosis .

<START:ggp> TCL1 oncogene <END> expression in AIDS-related lymphomas and lymphoid tissues . 
AIDS-related non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( AIDS NHL ) comprises a diverse and heterogeneous group of high-grade B cell tumors . 
Certain classes of AIDS NHL are associated with alterations in <START:ggp> oncogenes <END> or <START:ggp> tumor-suppressor genes <END> or infections by oncogenic herpesviruses . 
However , the clinically significant class of AIDS NHL designated immunoblastic lymphoma plasmacytoid ( AIDS IBLP ) lacks any consistent genetic alterations . 
We identified the <START:ggp> TCL1 oncogene <END> from a set of <START:ggp> AIDS IBLP-associated cDNA fragments <END> generated by subtractive hybridization with non-AIDS IBLP . 
Aberrant <START:ggp> TCL1 <END> expression has been implicated in T cell leukemia/lymphoma development , and its expression also has been seen in many established <START:ana> B cell tumor lines <END> . 
However , <START:ggp> TCL1 <END> expression has not been reported in AIDS NHL . 
We find that <START:ggp> TCL1 <END> is expressed in the majority of AIDS IBLP tumors examined . 
<START:ggp> TCL1 <END> protein expression is restricted to tumor cells in AIDS IBLP tissue samples analyzed with immunohistochemical staining . 
Hyperplastic lymph node and tonsil also exhibit strong <START:ggp> TCL1 <END> protein expression in <START:ana> mantle zone B cells <END> and in rare <START:ana> interfollicular zone cells <END> , whereas <START:ana> follicle-center B cells <END> ( <START:ana> centroblasts <END> and <START:ana> centrocytes <END> ) show weaker expression . 
These results establish <START:ggp> TCL1 <END> as the most prevalent of all of the surveyed <START:ggp> oncogenes <END> associated with AIDS IBLP . 
They also indicate that abundant <START:ggp> TCL1 <END> expression in <START:ana> quiescent mantle zone B cells <END> is down-regulated in activated <START:ana> germinal center follicular B cells <END> in parallel to the known expression pattern of <START:ggp> BCL-2 <END> . 
High-level expression in <START:ana> nonproliferating B cells <END> suggests that <START:ggp> TCL1 <END> may function in protecting <START:ana> naive preactivated B cells <END> from apoptosis . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -independent activation and proliferation in <START:ana> human T cells <END> induced by <START:ggp> CD28 <END> . 
Although the role of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> in T cell costimulation is firmly established , the mechanisms by which it exerts its costimulatory actions are less clear . 
In many circumstances it is difficult to distinguish the effects of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> from subsequent actions of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , such as <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , on T cell proliferation . 
Here , we report a model of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> costimulation using PMA plus the <START:ggp> natural ligand CD80 <END> that resulted in very limited stimulation of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , as evidenced by both <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production and <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> stimulation . 
Promoter assays revealed <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -dependent effects on both <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , but not on <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> or the intact <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> . 
In addition , T cell proliferation was completely resistant to the actions of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A ( CsA ) . 
Moreover T cell proliferation was unaffected by the addition of blocking <START:ggp> Abs <END> to both <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and the <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor <END> , demonstrating that this form of costimulation by <START:ggp> CD28 <END> was independent of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
We also investigated the effects of stimulating <START:ana> T cell blasts <END> with <START:ggp> CD80 <END> alone and found that there was a limited requirement for <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in this system . 
We conclude that <START:ggp> CD28 <END> costimulation can cause substantial T cell proliferation in the absence of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , which is driven by a <START:ggp> soluble factor <END> independent of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> transactivation . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus latency BamHI-Q promoter <END> is positively regulated by <START:ggp> STATs <END> and <START:ggp> Zta <END> interference with <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> /STAT <END> activation leads to loss of <START:ggp> BamHI-Q promoter <END> activity . 
In Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -associated tumors in nonimmunocompromised patients , EBV gene expression is highly restricted . 
<START:ggp> EBV-encoded nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) -1 <END> is expressed , whereas the immunogenic and proliferative <START:ggp> EBNAs <END> are not . 
This pattern of <START:ggp> EBNA <END> expression is generated by usage of the <START:ggp> BamHI-Q promoter <END> ( <START:ggp> Qp <END> ) . 
We have determined that the <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> /STAT <END> pathway positively regulates <START:ggp> Qp <END> activity . 
In transient-transfection assays , a <START:ggp> Qp-CAT reporter <END> was activated by cotransfected <START:ggp> JAK-1 <END> and by treatment of cells with the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> . 
The ability of <START:ggp> Qp <END> to bind <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) proteins <END> was directly demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay , and mutation of potential <START:ggp> STAT-binding sites <END> reduced <START:ggp> Qp <END> responsiveness to <START:ggp> Janus kinase ( JAK ) -1 <END> . 
Consistent with a role for <START:ggp> STATs <END> in <START:ggp> Qp <END> function , <START:ggp> Qp <END> using <START:ana> Burkitt 's lymphoma Rael cells <END> and <START:ana> cultured nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) cells <END> contained nuclear <START:ggp> STAT protein <END> . 
We investigated whether the inability to maintain <START:ana> EBV-positive NPC cell lines <END> in culture was related to <START:ggp> Qp <END> activity . 
Passaging of the <START:ana> NPC cell line HK666 <END> led to activation of expression of <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> , which encodes <START:ggp> Zta <END> and loss of <START:ggp> Qp <END> function . 
Transient expression assays linked <START:ggp> Zta <END> expression to the down-regulation of <START:ggp> Qp <END> . 
Cotransfection of <START:ggp> Zta <END> reduced <START:ggp> Qp <END> activity in reporter assays . 
This negative regulation required <START:ggp> Zta <END> DNA-binding activity . 
We provide evidence that <START:ggp> Zta <END> up-regulation of <START:ggp> p53 <END> leads to <START:ggp> p53 <END> -mediated interference with <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> /STAT <END> activation of <START:ggp> Qp <END> . 
The data imply that <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> /STAT <END> signaling has a role in EBV-associated malignancies . 
Reactive oxygen intermediate-release of <START:ana> fibre-exposed monocytes <END> increases inflammatory <START:ana> cytokine-mRNA <END> level , <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity in <START:ana> co-cultured bronchial epithelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> BEAS-2B <END> ) . 
Some pulmonary diseases like bronchitis or asthma bronchiale are mediated by inflammatory mechanisms in <START:ana> bronchial epithelial cells <END> . 
<START:ana> Alveolar macrophages <END> are located directly in the surrounding of these cells , so that we suppose an interaction between <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> regarding to the release of <START:ggp> inflammatory mediators <END> . 
For measuring the contribution of <START:ana> macrophages <END> to the release of <START:ggp> inflammatory mediators <END> by <START:ana> bronchial epithelial cells <END> , we established an in vitro model of <START:ana> co-cultured blood monocytes <END> ( <START:ana> BM <END> ) and <START:ana> BEAS-2B cells <END> in a transwell system ( Costar ) . 
<START:ana> BM <END> were exposed to Chrysotile B and soot particle FR 101 in a concentration of 100 microg/10 ( 6 ) cells . 
After up to 90 min exposure time ELISA , EMSA ( electromobility shift assay ) and RT-PCR were used to measure <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase <END> activity , protein activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) specific <START:ana> mRNA <END> levels in <START:ana> BEAS-2B cells <END> . 
We observed an increase in <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase <END> activity ( up to 1.8 +/- 0.5-fold ) and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> protein activity in <START:ana> BEAS-2B cells <END> after particle or fibre exposure of <START:ana> co-cultured BM <END> . 
Consecutive <START:ana> IL-1beta- , IL-6- and TNF-alpha-mRNA <END> were elevated ( up to 1.9 +/- 0.58-fold ) . 
<START:ggp> Protein tyrosine kinase <END> activity , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity , and the synthesis of <START:ana> cytokine-specific mRNA <END> were inhibited by antioxidants . 
These data suggest a ROI-dependent <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> mediated transcription of <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> in <START:ana> bronchial epithelial cells <END> . 
Suppression of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat <END> by <START:ana> CD8+ T cells <END> is dependent on the <START:ggp> NFAT-1 element <END> . 
<START:ana> CD8+ T lymphocytes <END> of HIV-1 infected individuals produce a <START:ggp> soluble factor <END> that efficiently suppresses HIV-1 replication at the transcriptional level . 
We show here that the response of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) to mitogenic or <START:ggp> Tat <END> -mediated activation is sensitive to the suppressive action of a <START:ana> Herpesvirus saimiri ( HVS ) -transformed CD8+ T cell clone <END> from an HIV-infected individual and supernatants from <START:ana> CD8+ T cells <END> of HIV-1-infected asymptomatic subjects ( <START:ggp> CD4+ <END> > 350/microliters ) . 
Mutagenesis of <START:ggp> NF kappa B or Sp-1 elements <END> within the <START:ggp> LTR <END> resulted in no change in the ability of <START:ana> CD8+ T cell <END> supernatants to inhibit Tat- or mitogen-mediated LTR transcription . 
However , the response to <START:ggp> HIV-1 Tat <END> by a <START:ggp> LTR <END> in which the <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2 homology NFAT-1 region <END> was mutated resulted in almost complete elimination of suppression by <START:ana> CD8+ T cells <END> . 
This was not observed when the <START:ggp> NFAT-1 mutant LTR <END> was activated by <START:ggp> mitogen <END> . 
We have previously shown that gene expression directed by the HIV-1 <START:ggp> NF kappa B elements <END> is inhibited by <START:ggp> CD8 <END> + cell-derived supernatants ( Copeland et al. , AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses , 1995 ; 11 : 1321-1326 ) . 
Taken together , these observations suggest that mitogenic activation , mediated primarily through the <START:ggp> NF kappa B enhancer <END> , is susceptible to <START:ggp> CD8 <END> -mediated inhibition , however , inhibition of <START:ggp> Tat <END> -mediated activation may rely upon a different pathway that is <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> dependent . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ana> human T-cell lines <END> by anetholdithiolthione . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> is a <START:ggp> redox sensitive cytosolic transcription factor <END> . 
Redox regulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> has been implicated in the activation of the human immuno-deficiency virus ( HIV ) . 
Therefore , inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation may be an effective strategy for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome therapy . 
Anetholdithiolthione ( ADT , 5- [ p-methoxyphenyl ] -3H-1 , 2-dithiol-3-thione ) is an antioxidant which has been used to protect against acetaminophen- and CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity , lipid peroxidation , radiation injury , and also has been used clinically as an anti-choleretic agent . 
The present study examined the effect of ADT pretreatment on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in response to a variety of stimuli such as H2O2 , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) or <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> ) . 
PMA and <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> induced activation of <START:ggp> ( NF ) -kappa B <END> in human <START:ana> Jurkat T-cells <END> was partially inhibited by ADT ( 0.1 mM ) pretreatment . 
ADT ( 0.1 mM ) also inhibited H2O2 induced activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> in the <START:ana> peroxide sensitive human Wurzburg T-cells <END> . 
Furthermore , ADT treated <START:ana> Wurzburg cells <END> had significantly higher glutathione levels as compared with <START:ana> untreated cells <END> . 
H2O2 induced lipid peroxidation in <START:ana> Wurzburg cells <END> was remarkably inhibited by ADT pretreatment . 
ADT , a pro-glutathione antioxidant , was observed to be capable of modulating <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
Involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in <START:ggp> endothelial adhesion molecule <END> induction . 
Induction of <START:ggp> endothelial adhesion molecules <END> by the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) can occur independently of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> and activation of a <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PTK <END> ) has recently been implicated in the upregulation of <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) by <START:ggp> interleukin-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) on <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> . 
We demonstrate that the <START:ggp> PTK <END> inhibitors herbimycin A or genistein suppress induction of endothelial <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> , as well as subsequent monocytic cell adhesion to <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> stimulated by <START:ggp> TNF <END> . 
Inhibition studies indicate that specific tyrosine phosphorylation following <START:ggp> PTK <END> activation is involved in the mobilization of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> , and <START:ana> VCAM-1 mRNA <END> expression . 
This may have implications for pathophysiological conditions that involve the upregulation of these molecules ( e.g. inflammation and atherosclerosis ) . 
<START:ggp> Protein kinase C-zeta <END> mediates <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ana> human immunodeficiency virus-infected monocytes <END> . 
The molecular mechanisms regulating human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) persistence in a major cell reservoir such as the <START:ana> macrophage <END> remain unknown . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> involved in the regulation of the <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> and is selectively activated following HIV infection of <START:ana> human macrophages <END> . 
Although little information as to what signal transduction pathways mediate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ana> monocytes-macrophages <END> is available , our previous work indicated that classical <START:ggp> protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoenzymes <END> were not involved in the HIV-mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
In this study , we have focused on atypical <START:ggp> PKC isoenzymes <END> . 
<START:ggp> PKC-zeta <END> belongs to this family and is known to be an important step in <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in other cell systems . 
Immunoblotting experiments with <START:ana> U937 cells <END> demonstrate that <START:ggp> PKC-zeta <END> is present in these cells , and its expression can be downmodulated by antisense oligonucleotides ( AO ) . 
The HIV-mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation is selectively reduced by AO to <START:ggp> PKC-zeta <END> . 
In addition , cotransfection of a negative dominant molecule of <START:ggp> PKC-zeta <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC-zeta mut <END> ) with <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -dependent reporter genes selectively inhibits the HIV -but not phorbol myristate acetate- or lipopolysaccharide-mediated activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
That <START:ggp> PKC-zeta <END> is specific in regulating <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is concluded from the inability of <START:ggp> PKC-zeta ( mut ) <END> to interfere with the basal or phorbol myristate acetate-inducible <START:ggp> CREB <END> -or <START:ggp> AP1 <END> -dependent transcriptional activity . 
Lastly , we demonstrate a selective inhibition of <START:ggp> p24 <END> production by <START:ana> HIV-infected human macrophages <END> when treated with AO to <START:ggp> PKC-zeta <END> . 
Altogether , these results suggest that <START:ggp> atypical PKC isoenzymes <END> , including <START:ggp> PKC-zeta <END> , participate in the signal transduction pathways by which HIV infection results in the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> human monocytic cells <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
Induction of <START:ggp> Bcl-x ( L ) <END> expression by <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax <END> through <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> apoptosis-resistant T-cell transfectants <END> with <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) <START:ggp> Tax <END> is thought to play a pivotal role in immortalization of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
We have recently shown that the expression of <START:ggp> Tax <END> protected the <START:ana> mouse T-cell line CTLL-2 <END> against apoptosis induced by <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) deprivation and converted its growth from being <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> dependent to being <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> independent . 
In this study , we demonstrate that constitutive expression of <START:ggp> bcl-xl <END> but not <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> , <START:ggp> bcl-xs <END> , <START:ggp> bak <END> , <START:ggp> bad <END> , or <START:ggp> bax <END> was associated with apoptosis resistance after <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> deprivation in <START:ana> CTLL-2 cells <END> that expressed <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
Transient-transfection assays showed that <START:ggp> bcl-x promoter <END> was transactivated by <START:ggp> wild-type Tax <END> . 
Similar effects were observed in mutant <START:ggp> Tax <END> retaining transactivating ability through <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Deletion or substitution of a <START:ggp> putative NF-kappaB binding site <END> identified in the <START:ggp> bcl-x promoter <END> significantly decreased <START:ggp> Tax <END> -induced transactivation . 
This <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-like element <END> was able to form a complex with <START:ggp> NF-kappaB family proteins <END> in vitro . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> Tax <END> -induced transactivation of the <START:ggp> bcl-x promoter <END> was also diminished by the <START:ggp> mutant IkappaBalpha <END> , which specifically inhibits <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity . 
Our findings suggest that constitutive expression of <START:ggp> Bcl-x ( L ) <END> induced by <START:ggp> Tax <END> through the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> pathway contributes to the inhibition of apoptosis in <START:ana> CTLL-2 cells <END> after <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> deprivation . 
The <START:ggp> beta-globin promoter <END> is important for recruitment of <START:ggp> erythroid Kruppel-like factor <END> to the <START:ggp> locus control region <END> in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Erythroid Kruppel-like factor <END> ( <START:ggp> EKLF <END> ) , which binds to the CACCC box in the <START:ggp> beta-globin promoter <END> , is required for the expression of the <START:ggp> beta-globin gene <END> in <START:ana> adult erythroid cells <END> . 
It was recently demonstrated that <START:ggp> EKLF <END> is also required for the activity of the <START:ggp> beta-globin locus control region <END> ( <START:ggp> LCR <END> ) <START:ggp> 5'HS3 <END> . 
Some evidence suggests that the <START:ggp> LCR <END> and the <START:ggp> beta-globin promoter <END> interact in <START:ana> adult erythroid cells <END> , and the network of protein-protein interactions that exists between these two elements may regulate how <START:ggp> EKLF <END> is recruited to the <START:ggp> LCR <END> . 
In this report , we use the PIN*POINT assay to study the role of the promoter on the recruitment of <START:ggp> EKLF <END> to <START:ggp> 5'HS2 <END> and <START:ggp> 5'HS3 <END> of the <START:ggp> LCR <END> . 
We find that recruitment of <START:ggp> EKLF <END> to <START:ggp> 5'HS2 <END> requires the <START:ggp> TATA box <END> , but recruitment to <START:ggp> 5'HS3 <END> depends on the CACCC and <START:ggp> TATA boxes <END> of the <START:ggp> beta-globin promoter <END> . 
Furthermore , recruitment of <START:ggp> EKLF <END> to <START:ggp> 5'HS3 <END> only occurred in <START:ana> beta-globin-expressing murine erythroid leukemia cells <END> , whereas recruitment of <START:ggp> EKLF <END> to <START:ggp> 5'HS2 <END> occurred in both <START:ana> gamma-globin-expressing K562 cells <END> and <START:ana> murine erythroid leukemia cells <END> . 
Unlike <START:ggp> EKLF <END> , <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , which also binds to CACCC boxes , is not recruited to <START:ggp> 5'HS3 <END> . 
We have also examined how one <START:ggp> 5'HS <END> affects the recruitment of <START:ggp> EKLF <END> to another <START:ggp> 5'HS <END> . 
We have found that the recruitment of <START:ggp> EKLF <END> to <START:ggp> 5'HS3 <END> depends on the presence of <START:ggp> 5'HS2 <END> in cis , but the recruitment to <START:ggp> 5'HS2 <END> does not depend on <START:ggp> 5'HS3 <END> . 
Based on these results , we present a model that illustrates how <START:ggp> EKLF <END> may be recruited to the <START:ggp> beta-globin locus <END> . 
Estrogen decreases <START:ggp> TNF <END> gene expression by blocking <START:ggp> JNK <END> activity and the resulting production of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> JunD <END> . 
Central to the bone-sparing effect of estrogen ( E ( 2 ) ) is its ability to block the monocytic production of the <START:ggp> osteoclastogenic cytokine TNF-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) . 
However , the mechanism by which E ( 2 ) downregulates <START:ggp> TNF <END> production is presently unknown . 
Transient transfection studies in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , an E ( 2 ) receptor-negative line , suggest that E ( 2 ) inhibits <START:ggp> TNF <END> gene expression through an effect mediated by <START:ggp> estrogen receptor beta <END> ( <START:ggp> ERbeta <END> ) . 
We also report that in <START:ana> RAW 264.7 cells <END> , an E ( 2 ) receptor-positive murine monocytic line , E ( 2 ) downregulates cytokine-induced <START:ggp> TNF <END> gene expression by decreasing the activity of the <START:ggp> Jun NH ( 2 ) -terminal kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> JNK <END> ) . 
The resulting diminished phosphorylation of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> JunD <END> at their <START:ggp> NH ( 2 ) -termini <END> decreases the ability of these nuclear proteins to autostimulate the expression of the <START:ggp> c-Jun and JunD genes <END> , thus leading to lower production of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> JunD <END> . 
The consequent decrease in the nuclear levels of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> JunD <END> leads to diminished binding of <START:ggp> c-Jun/c-Fos <END> and <START:ggp> JunD/c-Fos heterodimers <END> to the <START:ggp> AP-1 consensus sequence <END> in the <START:ggp> TNF promoter <END> and , thus , to decreased transactivation of the <START:ggp> TNF gene <END> . 
Cutting edge : <START:ggp> TCR <END> stimulation by antibody and bacterial superantigen induces <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> activation in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
Recent data show that <START:ggp> TCR/CD3 <END> stimulation induces activation of <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> in <START:ana> murine T cells <END> . 
Here , we show that CD3 ligation by mAb and Staphylococcal enterotoxin ( SE ) induce a rapid , gradually accumulating , long-lasting tyrosine , and serine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> ( but not <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> ) in <START:ana> allogen-specific human CD4+ T cell lines <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induces a rapid and transient tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> . 
Compared with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> CD3 <END> ligation induces a delayed <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> binding to oligonucleotide probes from the <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD3 <END> -mediated activation of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> is almost completely inhibited by a <START:ggp> Src kinase inhibitor <END> ( <START:ggp> PP1 <END> ) , whereas <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> activation is unaffected . 
In conclusion , we show that <START:ggp> CD3 <END> ligation by <START:ggp> mAb <END> and SE triggers a rapid , <START:ggp> PP1 <END> -sensitive tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> in <START:ana> human CD4+ T cells <END> . 
Moreover , we provide evidence that <START:ggp> TCR/CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induce <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> activation via distinct signaling pathways . 
Distinctive gene expression patterns in <START:ana> human mammary epithelial cells <END> and breast cancers . 
<START:ggp> cDNA microarrays <END> and a clustering algorithm were used to identify patterns of gene expression in <START:ana> human mammary epithelial cells <END> growing in culture and in primary human breast tumors . 
Clusters of <START:ggp> coexpressed genes <END> identified through manipulations of <START:ana> mammary epithelial cells <END> in vitro also showed consistent patterns of variation in expression among breast tumor samples . 
By using immunohistochemistry with antibodies against proteins encoded by a particular gene in a cluster , the identity of the cell type within the tumor specimen that contributed the observed gene expression pattern could be determined . 
Clusters of <START:ggp> genes <END> with coherent expression patterns in <START:ana> cultured cells <END> and in the breast tumors samples could be related to specific features of biological variation among the samples . 
Two such clusters were found to have patterns that correlated with variation in cell proliferation rates and with activation of the <START:ggp> IFN <END> -regulated signal transduction pathway , respectively . 
Clusters of <START:ggp> genes <END> expressed by <START:ana> stromal cells <END> and <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> in the breast tumors also were identified in this analysis . 
These results support the feasibility and usefulness of this systematic approach to studying variation in gene expression patterns in human cancers as a means to dissect and classify solid tumors . 
<START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> activation induces the expression of the <START:ggp> adipocyte fatty acid binding protein gene <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> ) , a member of the <START:ggp> nuclear receptor superfamily <END> of <START:ggp> ligand activated transcription factors <END> , plays a key role in the anti-diabetic actions of the thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) . 
<START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> induces the expression of many <START:ggp> genes <END> involved in lipid anabolism , including the <START:ggp> adipocyte fatty acid binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> aP2 <END> ) , and is a key regulator of <START:ana> adipocyte <END> differentiation . 
<START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> is also expressed in <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> and is up-regulated in activated <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> may play a role in the induction of differentiation of <START:ana> macrophages <END> to <START:ana> foam cells <END> that are associated with atherosclerotic lesions . 
We report that both natural and synthetic PPARgamma agonists induce time- and dose-dependent increases in <START:ana> aP2 mRNA <END> in both <START:ana> primary human monocytes <END> and the <START:ana> monocytic cell line <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 <END> . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> activation may play a role in <START:ana> monocyte <END> differentiation and function analogous to its well-characterized role in <START:ana> adipocytes . <END> 
Identification of a physical interaction between <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> and <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFATp <END> ) . 
In <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , the <START:ggp> calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase <END> , <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , plays a pivotal role in transducing membrane-associated signals to the nucleus . 
One of the putative targets of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> is the pre-existing , <START:ggp> cytosolic component <END> of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFATp <END> ; also referred to as <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> ) , which is one of several <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> required for the expression of <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 prevents dephosphorylation of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> and its translocation to the nucleus . 
However , a physical interaction between <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> and <START:ggp> NFATp <END> has not been demonstrated . 
Here we demonstrate the binding of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> from lysates of <START:ana> T cells <END> to immobilized <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> T cells <END> with calcium ionophore induced a shift in the molecular weight of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> that is due to its dephosphorylation . 
This dephosphorylation was inhibited by treatment of <START:ana> T cells <END> with cyclosporin A or FK506 prior to stimulation . 
Of note , both the phosphorylated and the dephosphorylated form of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> bound to <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
Furthermore , the binding of both forms of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> to <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> was inhibited by pretreatment of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> with a complex of FK506 and its ligand FKBP12 . 
Taken together these data strongly suggest a direct interaction of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> with <START:ggp> NFATp <END> and that this interaction does not depend upon the <START:ggp> phosphorylation sites <END> of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> affected by activation . 
Cross-linking <START:ggp> CD40 <END> on <START:ana> B cells <END> preferentially induces <START:ggp> stress-activated protein kinases <END> rather than <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinases <END> . 
The <START:ggp> B cell-associated surface molecule <END> <START:ggp> CD40 <END> plays a key role in T cell-dependent B cell maturation , as individuals with defects in either <START:ggp> CD40 <END> or its ligand are impaired in <START:ggp> immunoglobulin <END> isotype class switching and germinal center formation . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> signaling activates <START:ggp> downstream effectors <END> , including the <START:ggp> tyrosine protein kinase <END> , <START:ggp> Lyn <END> , the <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PI-3 kinase <END> ) , and the transcription factor , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
In this study , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> stress-activated protein kinases <END> ( <START:ggp> SAPK <END> ) are activated after <START:ggp> CD40 <END> cross-linking on various <START:ana> B cell lines <END> or <START:ana> human tonsillar B cells <END> . 
The activation is rapid and transient and is mediated through a cyclosporin A-insensitive pathway . 
Furthermore , this signaling pathway appears not to rely on <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> . 
While <START:ggp> CD40 <END> ligation strongly activates the <START:ggp> SAPKs <END> ( up to 25-fold ) , it does not affect members of the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase family <END> ( <START:ggp> MAPK <END> ; <START:ggp> ERK1 <END> and <START:ggp> ERK2 <END> ) . 
Consistent with these data , <START:ggp> CD40 <END> signals up-regulate <START:ana> c-jun but not c-fos mRNA <END> and alter the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> ATF2 <END> but not the <START:ggp> Raf-1 protein <END> . 
In summary , <START:ggp> CD40 <END> signaling preferentially induces <START:ggp> SAPK <END> but not <START:ggp> MAPK <END> . 
Stimulation of the <START:ggp> T-cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex <END> signaling pathway by the <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphatase <END> inhibitor pervanadate is mediated by inhibition of <START:ggp> CD45 <END> : evidence for two interconnected Lck/Fyn- or zap-70-dependent signaling pathways . 
The <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphatase <END> specific inhibitor pervanadate is a potent activator of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> through induction of <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphorylation <END> and downstream events of the activation cascade . 
Using <START:ana> CD45- or CD3-negative variants <END> of the <START:ana> Jurkat leukemic T-cell line <END> we show that the different biochemical events induced by pervanadate appeared to be dependent on the presence at the cell surface of either <START:ggp> CD45 <END> or <START:ggp> CD3 <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD45 <END> -dependent events such as <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphorylation <END> of <START:ggp> Shc <END> , activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) , <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) , <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , and stimulation of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter <END> and of <START:ggp> CD69 <END> and <START:ggp> CD25 <END> surface expression paralleled activation of the <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> <START:ggp> lck <END> and <START:ggp> fyn <END> . 
By contrast , stimulation of calcium influx , a <START:ggp> CD3 <END> -dependent event , paralleled <START:ggp> zap-70 <END> activation . 
The data demonstrate that the T-cell antigen receptor <START:ggp> -CD3 ( TcR-CD3 ) complex <END> is functionally linked to two different <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PTK <END> ) modules with separate specific functions and that <START:ggp> CD45 <END> may be an important regulator of this coupling . 
Vitamin D analogs , 20-Epi-22-oxa-24a , 26a , 27a , -trihomo-1alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2-vitamin D3 , 1 , 24 ( OH ) 2-22-ene-24-cyclopropyl-vitamin D3 and 1alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2-lumisterol3 prime <START:ana> NB4 leukemia cells <END> for monocytic differentiation via nongenomic signaling pathways , involving calcium and calpain . 
Side-chain modified vitamin D analogs including 20-Epi-22-oxa-24a , 26a , 27a-trihomo-1alpha , 2 5-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( KH1060 ) , and 1 , 24-dihydroxy-22-ene-24-cyclopropyl-vitamin D3 ( MC903 ) were originally designed to aid in the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders including psoriasis and cancer . 
Here we demonstrate that these analogs , as well as the 6-cis-locked conformer , <START:ana> 1alpha , 25-dihydroxy-lumisterol3 ( JN ) prime NB4 cells <END> for monocytic differentiation . 
Previously , the action of MC903 and KH1060 was presumed to be mediated by the <START:ggp> nuclear vitamin D receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> VDRnuc <END> ) . 
Differentiation in response to all analogs was shown to be inhibited by 1beta , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( HL ) , the antagonist to the nongenomic activities of 1 , 25D3 . 
These data suggest that although MC903 and KH1060 may bind the <START:ggp> VDRnuc <END> , that the differentiative activities of these agents requires nongenomic signaling pathways . 
Here we show that 1alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2-d5-previtamin D3 ( HF ) , JN , KH1060 , and MC903 induce expression of <START:ggp> PKC alpha <END> and <START:ggp> PKC delta <END> and translocation of both isoforms to the particulate fraction , and <START:ggp> PKC alpha <END> to the nuclear fraction . 
The full differentiation response with combinations of analogs and TPA was inhibited 50 % by the membrane permeable Ca2+ chelator , 1 , 2-bis ( o-aminophenoxy ) -ethane-N , N , N ' , N'-tetraacetic acid ( BAPTA-AM ) or <START:ggp> calpain <END> inhibitor I . 
These data demonstrate that intracellular free calcium and the <START:ggp> calcium-dependent protease <END> , <START:ggp> calpain <END> play critical roles in monocytic differentiation . 
Intracellular calcium appears to be most critical in the 1 , 25D3-priming stage of differentiation , while <START:ggp> calpain <END> is essential in the TPA maturation response . 
<START:ana> Neutrophil <END> maturation and the role of retinoic acid . 
<START:ana> Neutrophil <END> maturation occurs in well defined morphological stages that correlate with the acquisition of <START:ggp> molecular markers <END> associated with neutrophil function . 
A variety of factors are known to play a role in terminal <START:ana> neutrophil <END> maturation , including the vitamin A derivative , retinoic acid . 
Retinoic acid can directly modulate gene expression via binding to its <START:ggp> nuclear receptors <END> , which can , in turn , activate transcription of <START:ggp> target genes <END> . 
A role for retinoic acid during <START:ana> neutrophil <END> maturation has been suggested from a variety of sources. Here we present a review of the mechanism of <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor <END> action and the major evidence showing that normal retinoid signaling is required for <START:ana> neutrophil <END> maturation . 
<START:ggp> Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type-I tax gene <END> induces secretion of <START:ggp> human macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha <END> . 
Human T-cell lymphotropic virus I ( HTLV-I ) encodes for a <START:ggp> 40-kDa protein <END> , <START:ggp> Tax <END> , which is important for the immortalization of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> has been shown to transactivate several <START:ggp> cellular genes <END> . 
In this study , we show that <START:ggp> MIP-1alpha <END> is selectively expressed and secreted in the <START:ana> tax transfected Jurkat cell line <END> upon <START:ggp> mitogen <END> stimulation . 
Expression of <START:ana> MIP-1alpha-R mRNA <END> in these cells suggests an autocrine role for this <START:ggp> chemokine <END> in <START:ana> HTLV-I infected T-cells <END> . 
Induced <START:ggp> MIP-1alpha <END> expression and secretion in <START:ana> PMA/PHA stimulated tax transfected cells <END> correlate with the noninduction of <START:ggp> MNP-1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , which is intimately involved in downmodulating the <START:ggp> MIP-1alpha gene <END> .

<START:ana> Dendritic cells <END> and the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis . 
Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease in which unknown <START:ggp> arthrogenic autoantigen <END> is presented to <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> . 
The strong association of the disease with an <START:ggp> epitope <END> within the <START:ggp> HLA-DR chain <END> shared between various alleles of <START:ggp> HLA-DR4 <END> and <START:ggp> DR1 <END> emphasizes the importance of antigen presentation . 
This immune response predominantly occurs in the synovial tissue and fluid of the joints and <START:ana> autoreactive T cells <END> are readily demonstrable in both the synovial compartment and blood . 
<START:ana> Circulating dendritic cells <END> ( <START:ana> DC <END> ) are phenotypically and functionally identical with <START:ana> normal peripheral blood ( PB ) DC <END> . 
In the synovial tissue , fully differentiated <START:ana> perivascular DC <END> are found in close association with <START:ana> T cells <END> and with <START:ana> B cell follicles <END> , sometimes containing <START:ana> follicular DC <END> . 
These <START:ana> perivascular DC <END> migrate across the activated endothelium from blood and receive differentiative signals within the joint from <START:ggp> monocyte-derived cytokines <END> and <START:ana> CD40-ligand+ T cells <END> . 
In the SF , <START:ana> DC <END> manifest an intermediate phenotype , similar to that of <START:ana> monocyte-derived DC <END> in vitro . 
Like a delayed-type hypersensitivity response , the rheumatoid synovium represents an effector site . 
DC at many effector sites have a characteristic pattern of infiltration and differentiation . 
It is important to note that the effector response is not self-limiting in RA autoimmune inflammation . 
In this article , we argue that the presentation of <START:ggp> self-antigen <END> by <START:ana> DC <END> and by <START:ana> autoantibody-producing B cells <END> is critical for the perpetuation of the autoimmune response . 
Permanently arresting this ongoing immune response with either pharmaceutical agents or immunotherapy is a major challenge for immunology . 
Thymocyte-thymic <START:ana> epithelial cell <END> interaction leads to high-level replication of human immunodeficiency virus exclusively in <START:ana> mature CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( - ) CD3 ( + ) thymocytes <END> : a critical role for <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin-7 <END> . 
This work aims at identifying the thymocyte subpopulation able to support human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) replication under the biological stimuli of the thymic microenvironment . 
In this report we demonstrate that interaction with <START:ana> thymic epithelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> TEC <END> ) induces a high-level replication of the <START:ggp> T-tropic primary isolate HIV-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> B-LAIp <END> ) exclusively in the mature <START:ana> CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( - ) CD3 ( + ) thymocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tumor necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) and <START:ggp> interleukin-7 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> ) , secreted during this interaction , are critical cytokines for <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> transactivation through <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent activation . 
<START:ggp> TNF <END> is the major inducer of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and particularly of the <START:ggp> p50-p65 complex <END> , whereas <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> acts as a cofactor by sustaining the expression of the <START:ggp> p75 TNF receptor <END> . 
The requirement for <START:ggp> TNF <END> is further confirmed by the observation that the inability of the <START:ana> intermediate CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( - ) CD3 ( - ) thymocytes <END> to replicate the virus is associated with a defect in <START:ggp> TNF <END> production during their interaction with <START:ana> TEC <END> and correlates with the absence of nuclear <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity in these <START:ana> freshly isolated thymocytes <END> . 
Addition of exogenous <START:ggp> TNF <END> to the <START:ana> intermediate thymocyte cultures <END> induces <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity and is sufficient to promote HIV replication in the cocultures with <START:ana> TEC <END> . 
The other major subpopulation expressing the <START:ggp> CD4 receptor <END> , namely , the <START:ana> double-positive ( DP ) CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) CD3 ( +/- ) thymocytes <END> , despite the entry of the virus , do not produce a significant level of virus , presumably because they are unresponsive to <START:ggp> TNF <END> and <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> . 
Together , these data suggest that in vivo , despite an efficient entry of the virus in all the <START:ana> CD4 ( + ) subpopulations <END> , a high viral load may be generated exclusively within the <START:ana> mature CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( - ) CD3 ( + ) subset of thymocytes <END> . 
However , under conditions of inflammatory response after infection , <START:ggp> TNF <END> might also be present in the <START:ana> intermediate thymocyte compartment <END> , leading to efficient HIV replication in these cells . 
<START:ana> NF-kappaB-mediated up-regulation <END> of <START:ggp> Bcl-x <END> and <START:ggp> Bfl-1/A1 <END> is required for <START:ggp> CD40 <END> survival signaling in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> is essential for thymus-dependent humoral immune responses and rescuing <START:ana> B cells <END> from apoptosis . 
Many of the effects of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> are believed to be achieved through altered gene expression . 
In addition to <START:ggp> Bcl-x <END> , a known <START:ggp> CD40-regulated antiapoptotic molecule <END> , we identified a related <START:ggp> antiapoptotic molecule <END> , <START:ggp> A1/Bfl-1 <END> , as a <START:ggp> CD40-inducible gene <END> . 
Inhibition of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> pathway by overexpression of a dominant-active inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> abolished <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -induced up-regulation of both the <START:ggp> Bfl-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Bcl-x <END> genes and also eliminated the ability of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> to rescue <START:ggp> Fas <END> -induced cell death . 
Within the <START:ggp> upstream promoter region <END> of <START:ggp> Bcl-x <END> , a potential <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-binding sequence <END> was found to support <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent transcriptional activation . 
Furthermore , expression of physiological levels of <START:ana> Bcl-x protected B cells <END> from Fas-mediated apoptosis in the absence of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> signaling . 
Thus , our results suggest that <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -mediated cell survival proceeds through <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent up-regulation of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 family members <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> neutrophil <END> <START:ggp> interleukin-8 <END> production by <START:ggp> eosinophil granule major basic protein <END> . 
We evaluated the ability of <START:ggp> eosinophil granule major basic protein <END> ( <START:ggp> MBP <END> ) to stimulate <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -8 <END> production by <START:ana> neutrophils <END> . 
<START:ggp> MBP <END> over the concentration range of 0.1 to 10 microM stimulated the release of up to approximately 8 ng/ml <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> . 
Incubation with 2 microM <START:ggp> MBP <END> showed that , after a 1 h lag , the level of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> release increased with time for approximately 10 h . 
At the 2 microM concentration , <START:ggp> eosinophil cationic protein <END> , eosinophil-derived neurotoxin , and <START:ggp> eosinophil peroxidase <END> did not stimulate significant levels of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> production . 
<START:ggp> MBP <END> stimulated 2-fold increases in <START:ana> IL-8 messenger RNA <END> ( <START:ana> mRNA <END> ) after 1 and 3 h of incubation , which were blocked by pretreatment with actinomycin D . 
However , stimulation with <START:ggp> MBP <END> did not produce an increase in the binding activity of <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB <END> or <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> . 
No <START:ggp> NF-IL-6 <END> binding activity was detected in the same nuclear extracts . 
In addition , stimulation with <START:ggp> MBP <END> prolonged the stability of <START:ana> IL-8 mRNA <END> . 
<START:ggp> MBP <END> also induced transient increases in <START:ana> mRNA <END> for <START:ggp> macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) -1alpha <END> and <START:ggp> MIP-1beta <END> , but did not stimulate the release of either <START:ggp> chemokine <END> . 
These findings indicate that <START:ggp> MBP <END> is selective among the <START:ggp> eosinophil granule proteins <END> as a stimulus for <START:ana> neutrophil <END> <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> release and , further , that stimulation of <START:ana> neutrophil <END> <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> release by <START:ggp> MBP <END> involves both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation . 
We postulate that <START:ggp> MBP <END> -induced release of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> by <START:ana> neutrophils <END> may contribute to the pathophysiology of acute asthma and other inflammatory lung diseases . 
Expression of either the <START:ggp> TCL1 oncogene <END> , or transcripts from its homologue <START:ggp> MTCP1/c6.1B <END> , in leukaemic and <START:ana> non-leukaemic T cells <END> from ataxia telangiectasia patients . 
Patients with the recessively inherited disorder ataxia telangiectasia ( A-T ) have a high level of specific <START:ggp> chromosome translocations <END> which can be easily observed in <START:ana> peripheral T cells <END> and show a greatly increased predisposition to leukaemia/lymphoma , mainly of <START:ana> T cell <END> origin . 
Some <START:ana> translocation cells <END> proliferate into a large clone and may develop into T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia ( T-PLL ) . 
By the time of diagnosis of T-PLL , the clone contains many more genetic changes in the form of additional translocations . 
T-PLL is also seen in non-A-T individuals where expression of either <START:ggp> TCL1 <END> ( at <START:ggp> 14q32 <END> ) or the <START:ggp> c6.1B/MTCP1 A1 transcript <END> ( <START:ggp> at-Xq28 <END> ) has been demonstrated in just a few instances . 
We show here , that expression of <START:ggp> TCL1 <END> occurs in <START:ana> leukaemic T cells <END> from A-T patients with <START:ggp> chromosome 14 <END> rearrangements . 
Expression of <START:ggp> TCL1 <END> also occurs in the <START:ana> preleukaemic clone cells <END> of A-T patients containing the primary translocation alone . 
Some expression of <START:ggp> TCL1 <END> could also be detected in randomly selected A-T patients without large cytogenetic clones and without any evidence of leukaemic change . 
We also show that expression of the <START:ana> B1 transcript <END> from a second gene , <START:ggp> MTCP1 <END> , occurred at a relatively high level only in two T-PLL tumours from A-T patients with t ( X ; 14 ) translocations whereas the <START:ana> MTCP1/A1 transcript <END> is much more widely expressed in both <START:ana> tumour and non tumour cells <END> of A-T and non-A-T individuals . 
[ Correlation of lymphocytic infiltration of tumor tissue with the hormonal and metabolic state in patients with breast cancer ] 
Lymphocyte infiltration of tumor was studied vis-a-vis hormone metabolic status , tumor tissue hormone sensitivity and tobacco smoking , in 113 breast cancer patients , aged 25-77 . 
On the average , no correlation was established between degree of lymphocyte infiltration in breast tumor and age and menopause onset . 
In smoking menopausal patients , lymphocyte infiltration was found to be higher than in non-smokers ( p < 0.05 ) . 
There was a direct correlation between the rate of lymphocyte infiltration and the level of <START:ggp> progesterone receptors <END> in tumor . 
Some subgroups displayed a direct correlation between infiltration and <START:ggp> sex-binding globulin <END> , cholesterol , luteinizing hormone in blood , and lean body mass . 
It was matched by an inverse correlation between lymphocyte infiltration and blood-thyroid hormone concentration , urine catecholamines and free cortisol excretion and fat/lean body mass ratio . 
Considering the abovesaid as well as the lymphocyte ability to perform the dual function of <START:ana> immunocytes <END> and <START:ana> hormonocytes <END> , it is suggested that the results may be used in both the study of lymphocyte infiltration and research in means of its control . 
Gene transcription through activation of <START:ggp> G-protein-coupled chemoattractant receptors <END> . 
Receptors for <START:ggp> leukocyte chemoattractants <END> , including <START:ggp> chemokines <END> , are traditionally considered to be responsible for the activation of special leukocyte functions such as chemotaxis , degranulation , and the release of superoxide anions . 
Recently , these <START:ggp> G-protein-coupled serpentine receptors <END> have been found to transduce signals leading to gene transcription and translation in <START:ana> leukocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factors <END> , such as <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , are activated upon stimulation of the cells with several chemoattractants at physiologically relevant concentrations . 
Activation of transcription factors through these receptors involves <START:ggp> G-protein <END> coupling and the activation of <START:ggp> protein kinases <END> . 
The underlying signaling pathways appear to be different from those utilized by <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , a better characterized cytokine that induces the transcription of <START:ggp> immediate-early genes <END> . 
Chemoattractants stimulate the expression of several <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> chemokines <END> , which in turn may activate their respective receptors and initiate an autocrine regulatory mechanism for persistent <START:ggp> cytokine <END> and <START:ggp> chemokine <END> gene expression . 
Affinity-driven peptide selection of an NFAT inhibitor more selective than cyclosporin A [ see comments ] 
The flow of information from <START:ggp> calcium-mobilizing receptors <END> to <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) -dependent genes <END> is critically dependent on interaction between the <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> and the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
A high-affinity <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> -binding peptide was selected from combinatorial peptide libraries based on the <START:ggp> calcineurin docking motif <END> of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
This peptide potently inhibited <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation and <START:ggp> NFAT <END> -dependent expression of <START:ggp> endogenous cytokine genes <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> , without affecting the expression of other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> that require <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> but not <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
Substitution of the optimized peptide sequence into the natural <START:ggp> calcineurin docking site <END> increased the <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> responsiveness of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
Compounds that interfere selectively with the <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> <START:ggp> -NFAT <END> interaction without affecting <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> activity may be useful as therapeutic agents that are less toxic than current drugs . 
9-cis retinoic acid induces <START:ggp> monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 <END> secretion in <START:ana> human monocytic THP-1 cells <END> . 
Monocyte migration and activation are regulated by <START:ggp> monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> ) . 
Prior studies have shown <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> expression is modulated by a variety of ligands that act through <START:ggp> extracellular receptors <END> . 
In the current study , we show 9-cis retinoic acid ( RA ) , a ligand for the <START:ggp> nuclear hormone receptor retinoid X receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> RXR <END> ) and <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR <END> ) , markedly induces the expression of <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> . 
In <START:ana> human THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells <END> cultured with RA ( 0.05 to 500 nmol/L ) , <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> expression was induced rapidly , significantly , and dose-dependently by as much as 165-fold . 
<START:ana> MCP-1 RNA <END> level was also increased in RA-treated cells . 
Expression of <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> , a heterodimer partner of <START:ggp> RXR <END> , is also markedly induced by RA in <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> . 
However , BRL49653 , a <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> ligand , failed to induce <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> secretion either alone or to modify the expression level induced by RA . 
In contrast , BRL49653 significantly increased <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> biotinylated MCP-1 <END> ) binding to <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> , whereas RA had no effect . 
Other <START:ggp> peroxisome proliferator activated receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> PPAR <END> ) ligands , 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) and troglitazone ( <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> ) , Wy14 , 643 ( <START:ggp> PPARalpha <END> ) , and PD195599 ( <START:ggp> PPARbeta <END> ) inhibited the induction of <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> by RA . 
RA 's effect on <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> expression in human elutriated monocytes were similar to that observed in the <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> . 
These studies identify RA as a nuclear signal for <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> induction in <START:ana> undifferentiated human monocytic cells <END> . 
These studies also suggest monocyte <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> expression induced through RA may modulate cell migration . 
Classification of IVS1-10T -- > C as a polymorphism of <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> . 
Mutations inactivating the <START:ggp> tumor suppressor gene <END> <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> may be responsible for disease for up to 80 % of familial ovarian cancer cases . 
In this syndrome , tumorigenesis classically initiates from an inherited mutation in one <START:ggp> allele <END> followed by somatic deletion of the <START:ggp> normal allele <END> . 
Sequencing of <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> amplified from <START:ggp> genomic DNA <END> of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> microdissected ovarian tumor cells <END> of a familial ovarian cancer patient revealed three , rare heterozygous DNA variations ( 2418delA , 233G -- > A , and IVS1-10T -- > C ) in both <START:ggp> tumor and constitutional ( lymphocyte ) DNA <END> . 
Thus , both copies of <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> were retained in tumor . 
Haplotype analysis of the patient and four siblings assigned 2418delA to one copy of <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> and 233G -- > A and IVS1-10T -- > C to the other . 
The DNA change , 2418delA , is considered a mutation that inactivated one <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> allele because it caused a frameshift and generation of a <START:ggp> premature stop codon <END> , resulting in synthesis of a truncated peptide as evidenced by an in vitro protein truncation test . 
The DNA variation , 233G -- > A , does not result in an amino acid change , and is considered a benign polymorphism . 
IVS1-10T -- > C is a unique <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> change that occurs in the last nucleotide of a <START:ggp> consensus sequence <END> for a <START:ggp> branch site <END> critical for RNA splicing . 
Therefore , we investigated whether IVS1-10T -- > C deleteriously affected <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> splicing or expression , and thereby inactivated the other <START:ggp> BRCA1 allele <END> . 
Using the technique of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) with RNA isolated from <START:ana> lymphoid cell lines <END> of the patient and of controls , no evidence was found that IVS1-10TC abnormally disrupted <START:ana> mRNA <END> splicing or caused the absence of <START:ana> BRCA1 mRNA <END> . 
Thus , IVS1-10T -- > C is not harmful to <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> function , and is classified a benign polymorphism . 
Retention of the normal <START:ggp> BRCA1 allele <END> in the tumor with the heterozygous germline <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> mutation , 2418delA , indicated that mutational inactivation of both <START:ggp> BRCA1 alleles <END> was not required for tumorigenesis . 
It is possible that the <START:ggp> normal allele <END> may be functionally inactivated by a nonmutational mechanism . 
<START:ana> Myb-transformed hematopoietic cells <END> as a model for monocyte differentiation into <START:ana> dendritic cells <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
Immune induction is effected through the interaction of <START:ana> antigen-presenting cells <END> with specific <START:ggp> receptors <END> on the surface of <START:ana> thymus-derived lymphocytes <END> . 
Cells most able to ingest , process , and present antigen appear to be related to the <START:ana> mononuclear phagocyte/neutrophil series <END> . 
For example <START:ana> dendritic cells <END> ( <START:ana> DC <END> ) can be found in colonies of <START:ana> GM-CSF-responsive bone marrow cells <END> , and under experimental conditions are routinely expanded as a population in vitro from <START:ana> GM-CSF-responsive progenitor cells <END> . 
To address the question of <START:ana> DC lineage <END> and to determine what genes are involved in lineage commitment , we have generated a series of <START:ana> GM-CSF-responsive cell lines <END> that can be induced to differentiate in a homogeneous manner in vitro . 
The <START:ana> cloned cell lines <END> are derived from 12-day fetal liver and are transformed with a truncated form of <START:ggp> c-myb <END> , which lacks the normal <START:ggp> autoregulatory sequences <END> . 
As far as we know , these <START:ana> myb-transformed hemopoi-etic cells <END> ( <START:ana> MTHC <END> ) differ from normal only in the unregulated expression of myb , a gene whose expression is obligatory for proliferation of hemopoietic cells . 
<START:ana> MTHC <END> in the presence of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> will differentiate into cells that have many of the properties of <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
When the same <START:ana> MTHC lines <END> are exposed to <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> in combination with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , the cells instead become <START:ana> DC <END> . 
The differentiated <START:ana> DC <END> are potent presenters of antigen in mixed lymphocyte reactions and of soluble antigen to specific <START:ana> T cell lines <END> . 
Thus , cells with the properties of both <START:ana> macrophages <END> and <START:ana> DC <END> can be derived from a single type of <START:ana> GM-CSF-responsive progenitor cell <END> . 
We have used this <START:ana> MTHC system <END> to analyze differences in gene expression as the cells mature along the <START:ana> DC <END> and <START:ana> macrophage pathways <END> . 
A distinctive pattern of differentially expressed <START:ggp> cDNAs <END> is evident where <START:ggp> macrophage-specific cDNAs <END> are homologous to genes encoding <START:ggp> cytoskeletal and cell-surface proteins <END> , whereas the <START:ana> DC <END> -specific <START:ggp> cDNAs <END> are homologous to <START:ggp> signaling , chemokine , and IFN-gamma-inducible genes <END> . 
We discuss the utility of <START:ana> MTHC <END> in analyzing the relationships between <START:ana> DC <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> , and suggest that <START:ana> DC <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> represent extreme phenotypes in a spectrum of <START:ana> antigen handling cells <END> that are somewhat interchangeable , depending on their immediate environment . 
The Legionella pneumophila <START:ggp> rpoS gene <END> is required for growth within Acanthamoeba castellanii . 
To investigate regulatory networks in Legionella pneumophila , the gene encoding the homolog of the <START:ggp> Escherichia coli stress and stationary-phase sigma factor <END> <START:ggp> RpoS <END> was identified by complementation of an E. coli <START:ggp> rpoS <END> mutation . 
An <START:ggp> open reading frame <END> that is approximately 60 % identical to the <START:ggp> E. coli rpoS gene <END> was identified . 
Western blot analysis showed that the level of L. pneumophila <START:ggp> RpoS <END> increased in stationary phase . 
An insertion mutation was constructed in the <START:ggp> rpoS gene <END> on the chromosome of L. pneumophila , and the ability of this mutant strain to survive various stress conditions was assayed and compared with results for the wild-type strain . 
Both the mutant and wild-type strains were more resistant to stress when in stationary phase than when in the logarithmic phase of growth . 
This finding indicates that L. pneumophila <START:ggp> RpoS <END> is not required for a stationary-phase-dependent resistance to stress . 
Although the mutant strain was able to kill <START:ana> HL-60- and THP-1-derived macrophages <END> , it could not replicate within a protozoan host , Acanthamoeba castellanii . 
These data suggest that L. pneumophila possesses a growth phase-dependent resistance to stress that is independent of <START:ggp> RpoS <END> control and that <START:ggp> RpoS <END> likely regulates genes that enable it to survive in the environment within protozoa . 
Our data indicate that the role of <START:ggp> rpoS <END> in L. pneumophila is very different from what has previously been reported for E. coli <START:ggp> rpoS <END> . 
Monoallelic expression of <START:ggp> Pax5 <END> : a paradigm for the haploinsufficiency of <START:ggp> mammalian Pax genes <END> ? 
It is generally assumed that most <START:ggp> mammalian genes <END> are transcribed from both <START:ggp> alleles <END> . 
Hence , the diploid state of the genome offers the advantage that a loss-of-function mutation in one <START:ggp> allele <END> can be compensated for by the remaining <START:ggp> wild-type allele <END> of the same gene . 
Indeed , the vast majority of human disease syndromes and engineered mutations in the <START:ggp> mouse genome <END> are recessive , indicating that recessiveness is the 'default ' state . 
However , a minority of genes are semi-dominant , as heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in these genes leads to phenotypic abnormalities . 
This condition , known as haploinsufficiency , has been described for five of the nine <START:ggp> mammalian Pax genes <END> , which are associated with mouse developmental mutants and human disease syndromes . 
Recently we have reported that the <START:ggp> Pax5 gene <END> is subject to <START:ggp> allele <END> -specific regulation during B cell development . 
<START:ggp> Pax5 <END> is predominantly transcribed from only one of its two <START:ggp> alleles <END> in <START:ana> early B-lymphoid progenitors <END> and <START:ana> mature B cells <END> , while it transiently switches to a biallelic mode of transcription in <START:ana> pre-B and immature B cells <END> . 
As a consequence , B-lymphoid tissues are mosaic with regard to the transcribed <START:ggp> allele <END> , and heterozygous mutation of <START:ggp> Pax5 <END> therefore results in deletion of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> expressing only the <START:ggp> mutant allele <END> . 
The <START:ggp> allele <END> -specific regulation of <START:ggp> Pax5 <END> raises the intriguing possibility that monoallelic expression may also be the mechanism causing the haploinsufficiency of other <START:ggp> Pax genes <END> . 
In this review , we discuss different models accounting for the haploinsufficiency of <START:ggp> mammalian Pax genes <END> , provide further evidence in support of the <START:ggp> allele <END> -specific regulation of <START:ggp> Pax5 <END> and discuss the implication of these findings in the context of the recent literature describing the stochastic and monoallelic activation of other <START:ggp> hematopoietic genes <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> relies on <START:ggp> Janus kinase <END> function but not on receptor tyrosine phosphorylation , and can contribute to both cell proliferation and gene regulation . 
We have investigated mechanisms and consequences of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> activation through the <START:ggp> human IL-4 receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4R <END> ) . 
By functionally expressing <START:ggp> receptor mutants <END> in the <START:ana> murine pro-B cell line <END> <START:ana> Ba/F3 <END> , we could show that phosphorylated tyrosine residues within the <START:ggp> IL-4R alpha chain <END> are dispensable for <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -induced <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> activity . 
However , disruption of a <START:ggp> membrane-proximal proline-rich sequence motif <END> ( ' <START:ggp> box1 <END> ' ) in either subunit of the <START:ggp> bipartite IL-4R <END> abolished not only ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Janus kinases <END> <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> , but also <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -triggered activation of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> and concomitant cell proliferation . 
A <START:ggp> dominant-negative version <END> of <START:ggp> STAT5b <END> , but not of <START:ggp> STAT5a <END> , interfered with <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -induced DNA synthesis in <START:ana> Ba/F3 cells <END> , suggesting an involvement of <START:ggp> STAT5b <END> in the control of cell proliferation through <START:ggp> IL-4R <END> . 
Reporter gene experiments finally showed that transcription from promoters of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> target genes can be specifically induced by challenging cells with <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , and that both <START:ggp> STAT5a <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5b <END> can contribute to <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -triggered transcriptional control . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> signal transduction events by a dominant-negative form of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
An inhibitory , `` dominant-negative , '' form of the <START:ggp> calcineurin catalytic ( A ) subunit <END> was prepared , which lacks the <START:ggp> calmodulin-binding domain <END> , <START:ggp> autoinhibitory domain <END> and most of its catalytic core but possesses the <START:ggp> regulatory ( B ) subunit <END> binding domain . 
When tested for its ability to block <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> -dependent signaling in Jurkat cells , expression of this <START:ggp> `` B-subunit knock-out '' ( BKO ) construct <END> suppressed <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> activity driven by <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , the pivotal <START:ggp> promoter element <END> for <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2 gene <END> induction . 
Immunoprecipitation of <START:ggp> epitope-labeled BKO <END> demonstrated for the formation of a tight complex with <START:ggp> endogenous B subunit <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , consistent with an inhibitory mechanism that involves the sequestration of the <START:ggp> B subunit <END> . 
Furthermore , the sharply reduced <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> activity produced by <START:ggp> co-transfecting BKO <END> could be `` rescued '' by overexpression of transfected <START:ggp> B subunit <END> , suggesting that depletion of this subunit was responsible for the inhibition . 
These data suggest the potential utility of agents that disrupt <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> -mediated signal transduction pathways by blocking formation of the <START:ggp> catalytically active dimer <END> of <START:ggp> calcineurin A and B subunits <END> . 
Evaluation of monoclonal anti-D reagents using <START:ana> D variant cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Monoclonal anti-D antibodies <END> submitted to the Third Monoclonal International Workshop were evaluated against a number of <START:ana> D variant cells <END> using standard serological techniques . 
The <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> were able to discriminate between the cells of <START:ana> Categories Va , VI and DFR but not Category III cells <END> . 
Cells within each category did not give any aberrant results . 
The <START:ana> Rh : 33 cells <END> behaved as <START:ana> normal Rh ( D ) positive cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin 10 <END> induced <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression in <START:ana> human B cells <END> by activation of <START:ggp> divergent protein kinases <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> is a potent mediator of <START:ana> human B cell <END> growth and plasma cell formation . 
However , signal transduction of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> is poorly understood . 
In this study the effect of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> on the expression of the <START:ggp> protooncogene c-fos <END> was investigated , because Fos plays a potential role in the regulation of B cell proliferation and differentiation . 
<START:ana> B cells <END> were purified from buffy coat preparations of healthy blood donors by positive selection using an <START:ggp> anti CD20 monoclonal antibody <END> and a MiniMACS separation unit . 
<START:ana> B cells <END> were prestimulated with SAC for 48 hrs . 
Then , cells were incubated with medium or <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ( 100 ng/ml ) for 10 to 120 min . 
<START:ana> RNA <END> was extracted by phenol/chloroform and <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression was analyzed by PCR assisted mRNA assay . 
A significant 2-4 fold increase of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression was observed within 30 min of stimulation with <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ( p < 0.01 ) . 
After 2 hrs <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression declined to basal levels . 
The effect of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> was dose-dependent with a maximum stimulation using 100 ng/ml of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> effect on <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression was not blocked by polymyxin B . 
Using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein ( 10 microM ) a complete inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> induced <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression was observed . 
In addition , H-7 ( 10 microM ) , a specific inhibitor of <START:ggp> serine/threonine kinases <END> , significantly blocked <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> mediated <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression ( p < 0.05 ) . 
In conclusion , these data show that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> induces <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression in <START:ana> human B-cells <END> by activation of tyrosine and <START:ggp> serine/threonine kinases <END> . 
Since this is the first report on <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> induced signal transduction , these data may help to identify the intracellular mechanisms by which <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> stimulates <START:ana> human B-cells <END> . 
Immunocytochemical analysis of <START:ggp> MNDA <END> in tissue sections and sorted normal bone marrow cells documents expression only in maturing normal and neoplastic myelomonocytic cells and a subset of normal and neoplastic B lymphocytes . 
The human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen ( <START:ggp> MNDA <END> ) is a nuclear antigen known to be expressed in mature myelomonocytic cell lines . 
An extensive immunocytochemical evaluation of fixed tissues confirmed <START:ggp> MNDA <END> expression in <START:ana> normal maturing granulocytes <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> and in acute nonlymphocytic leukemias and chronic myelogenous leukemia . 
<START:ggp> MNDA <END> was not detected in normal tissue histiocytes but was found in <START:ana> activated macrophages <END> and <START:ana> foreign body giant cells <END> associated with inflammation . 
Flow cytometric cell sorting of normal bone marrow established that <START:ggp> MNDA <END> is initially expressed in <START:ana> myeloid blast cells <END> . 
Examination of lymphoid tissues showed a low level of expression in a population of normal <START:ana> mande B lymphocytes <END> but not in <START:ana> germinal center cells <END> or <START:ana> plasma cells <END> . 
A subset of <START:ana> B cell neoplasms <END> expressing <START:ggp> MNDA <END> included hairy cell leukemia , parafollicular ( monocytoid ) B cell lymphoma , mantle cell lymphoma , and small lymphocytic lymphoma . 
Cell sorting of normal bone marrow showed <START:ggp> MNDA <END> expression in <START:ggp> CD20 <END> +/CD10-/CD5- <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> MNDA <END> was not detected in other normal bone marrow or all other <START:ana> nonhematopoietic cells <END> . 
The hematopoietic cell-specific pattern of <START:ggp> MNDA <END> expression was elucidated through a comprehensive analysis of normal and neoplastic tissues , and the results provide further evidence of the coexpression of <START:ggp> B- and myeloid cell markers <END> in <START:ana> neoplastic B cells <END> and identify a <START:ana> normal B cell population <END> that might be related to the cell of origin of a subset of <START:ana> B cell neoplasms <END> . 
<START:ggp> Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activators <END> target <START:ana> human endothelial cells <END> to inhibit <START:ana> leukocyte <END> <START:ana> -endothelial cell <END> interaction . 
An early event in acute and chronic inflammation and associated diseases such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis is the induced expression of specific <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> on the surface of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> ECs <END> ) , which subsequently bind <START:ana> leukocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> PPARs <END> ) , members of the <START:ggp> nuclear receptor superfamily <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , are activated by fatty acid metabolites , peroxisome proliferators , and thiazolidinediones and are now recognized as important mediators in the inflammatory response . 
Whether PPAR activators influence the inflammatory responses of <START:ana> ECs <END> is unknown . 
We show that the PPAR activators 15-deoxy-Delta ( 12 , 14 ) -prostaglandin J ( 2 ) ( 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) ) , Wyeth 14643 , ciglitazone , and troglitazone , but not BRL 49653 , partially inhibit the induced expression of <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) , as measured by ELISA , and monocyte binding to <START:ana> human aortic endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> HAECs <END> ) activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) or lipopolysaccharide . 
The `` natural '' PPAR activator 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) had the greatest potency and was the only tested molecule capable of partially inhibiting the induced expression of <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> and neutrophil-like <START:ana> HL60 cell <END> binding to PMA-activated <START:ana> HAECs <END> . 
Intracellular adhesion molecule-1 induction by PMA was unaffected by any of the molecules tested . 
Both <START:ana> PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma mRNAs <END> were detected in <START:ana> HAECs <END> by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a <START:ggp> ribonuclease <END> protection assay ; however , we have yet to determine which , if any , of the <START:ggp> PPARs <END> are mediating this process . 
These results suggest that certain PPAR activators may help limit chronic inflammation mediated by <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> without affecting acute inflammation mediated by <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> and <START:ana> neutrophil <END> binding . 
Dephosphorylation of <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> and inhibition of T cell activation by <START:ggp> activated SHP1 <END> . 
Studies with motheaten mice , which lack the <START:ggp> SHP1 protein <END> <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphatase <END> , indicate that this enzyme plays an important negative role in <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) signaling . 
The physiological substrates for <START:ggp> SHP1 <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , however , have remained unclear or controversial . 
To define these targets for <START:ggp> SHP1 <END> we have compared the effects of constitutively active and inactive mutants of <START:ggp> SHP1 <END> on <START:ggp> TCR <END> signaling . 
Expression of <START:ggp> wild-type SHP1 <END> had a very small effect on the TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> and <START:ggp> Syk <END> , even when <START:ggp> SHP1 <END> was overexpressed 20 - 100-fold over <START:ggp> endogenous SHP1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Inactive SHP1-D421A <END> and <START:ggp> wild-type SHP2 <END> were without effects . 
<START:ggp> Constitutively active SHP1-DeltaSH2 <END> had a more pronounced effect on <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> and <START:ggp> Syk <END> , even when expressed at near physiological levels . 
<START:ggp> SHP1-DeltaSH2 <END> also inhibited events downstream of <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> and <START:ggp> Syk <END> , such as activation of the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> <START:ggp> Erk2 <END> and the transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 gene <END> . 
In contrast , a constitutively active <START:ggp> SHP2-DeltaSH2 <END> had no statistically significant effect ( although it caused a slight augmentation in some individual experiments ) . 
None of the constructs influenced the anti-CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> TCR zeta-chain <END> or <START:ggp> phospholipase Cgamma1 <END> , indicating that <START:ggp> Src family kinase <END> function was intact . 
Taken together , our findings support the notion that <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> and <START:ggp> Syk <END> can be direct substrates for <START:ggp> SHP1 <END> in intact cells . 
However , the two <START:ggp> SH2 domains <END> of <START:ggp> SHP1 <END> did not facilitate its recognition of <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> and <START:ggp> Syk <END> as substrates in intact cells . 
Therefore , we suggest that <START:ggp> SHP1 <END> is not actively recruited to inhibit <START:ggp> TCR <END> signaling induced by ligation of this receptor alone . 
Instead , we propose that ligation of a distinct <START:ggp> inhibitory receptor <END> leads to the recruitment of <START:ggp> SHP1 <END> via its <START:ggp> SH2 domains <END> , activation of <START:ggp> SHP1 <END> and subsequently inhibition of <START:ggp> TCR <END> signals if the <START:ggp> inhibitory receptor <END> is juxtaposed to the <START:ggp> TCR <END> . 
Immune responses to adenoviruses : viral evasion mechanisms and their implications for the clinic . 
Adenoviruses encode proteins that block responses to <START:ggp> interferons <END> , intrinsic cellular apoptosis , killing by <START:ana> CD8 ( + ) cytotoxic T lymphocytes <END> and killing by the <START:ggp> death ligands <END> <START:ggp> TNF <END> , <START:ggp> Fas ligand <END> and <START:ggp> TRAIL <END> . 
The <START:ggp> viral proteins <END> are believed to prolong acute and persistent adenovirus infections . 
The proteins may prove useful in protecting <START:ggp> adenovirus gene therapy vectors <END> and <START:ana> transplanted cells <END> from the immune system . 
<START:ggp> C/EBPbeta <END> and <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> synergistically regulate activity of the <START:ggp> eosinophil granule major basic protein promoter <END> : implication for <START:ggp> C/EBPbeta <END> activity in eosinophil gene expression . 
<START:ggp> Eosinophil granule major basic protein <END> ( <START:ggp> MBP <END> ) is expressed exclusively in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> and <START:ana> basophils <END> in <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> . 
In our previous study , we demonstrated a major positive regulatory role for <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and a negative regulatory role for <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> in <START:ggp> MBP <END> gene transcription . 
Further analysis of the <START:ggp> MBP promoter region <END> identified a <START:ggp> C/EBP ( CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ) consensus binding site <END> 6 bp upstream of the functional <START:ggp> GATA-binding site <END> in the <START:ggp> MBP gene <END> . 
In the <START:ana> cell line HT93A <END> , which is capable of differentiating towards both the <START:ana> eosinophil <END> and neutrophil lineages in response to retinoic acid ( RA ) , <START:ana> C/EBPalpha mRNA <END> expression decreased significantly concomitant with eosinophilic and neutrophilic differentiation , whereas <START:ggp> C/EBPbeta <END> expression was markedly increased . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) showed that recombinant <START:ggp> C/EBPbeta <END> protein could bind to the potential <START:ggp> C/EBP-binding site <END> ( <START:ggp> bp -90 to -82 <END> ) in the <START:ggp> MBP <END> promoter . 
Furthermore , we have demonstrated that both <START:ggp> C/EBPbeta <END> and <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> can bind simultaneously to the C/EBP- and <START:ggp> GATA-binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> MBP promoter <END> . 
To determine the functionality of both the <START:ggp> C/EBP- and GATA- binding sites <END> , we analyzed whether <START:ggp> C/EBPbeta <END> and <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> can stimulate the <START:ggp> MBP promoter <END> in the <START:ana> C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 negative Jurkat T-cell line <END> . 
Cotransfection with <START:ggp> C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 expression vectors <END> produced a 5-fold increase compared with cotransfection with the <START:ggp> C/EBPbeta <END> or <START:ggp> GATA-1 expression vectors <END> individually . 
In addition , <START:ggp> GST <END> pull-down experiments demonstrated a physical interaction between human <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> C/EBPbeta <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> FOG <END> ( <START:ggp> riend ATA <END> ) , which binds to <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and acts as a cofactor for <START:ggp> GATA-binding proteins <END> , decreased transactivation activity of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> for the <START:ggp> MBP promoter <END> in a dose-dependent manner . 
Our results provide the first evidence that both <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> C/EBPbeta <END> synergistically transactivate the <START:ggp> promoter <END> of an <START:ggp> eosinophil-specific granule protein gene <END> and that <START:ggp> FOG <END> may act as a negative cofactor for the <START:ana> eosinophil lineage <END> , unlike its positively regulatory function for the <START:ana> erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages <END> . 
Tissue-specific regulation of the <START:ggp> ecto-5'-nucleotidase promoter <END> . 
Role of the <START:ggp> camp response element site <END> in mediating repression by the <START:ggp> upstream regulatory region <END> . 
We have isolated the <START:ggp> 5 ' region <END> of the <START:ggp> ecto-5'-nucleotidase ( low K ( m ) 5'-NT ) gene <END> and established that a <START:ggp> 969-base pair ( bp ) fragment <END> confers cell-specific expression of a <START:ggp> CAT reporter gene <END> that correlates with the expression of <START:ana> endogenous ecto-5'-NT mRNA <END> and enzymatic activity . 
A <START:ggp> 768-bp upstream negative regulatory region <END> has been identified that conferred lymphocyte-specific negative regulation in a heterologous system with a <START:ggp> 244-bp deoxycytidine kinase core promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> DNase I <END> footprinting identified several protected areas including <START:ggp> Sp1 , Sp1/AP-2 , and cAMP response element ( CRE ) binding sites <END> within the 201-bp core promoter region and <START:ggp> Sp1 , NRE-2a , TCF-1/LEF-1 , and Sp1/NF-AT binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> upstream regulatory region <END> . 
Whereas the <START:ggp> CRE site <END> was essential in mediating the negative activity of the <START:ggp> upstream regulatory region <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat <END> but not in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , mutation of the <START:ggp> Sp1/AP-2 site <END> decreased promoter activity in both cell lines . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis of proteins binding to the <START:ggp> CRE site <END> identified both <START:ggp> ATF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> ATF-2 <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
Finally , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased the activity of both the core and the <START:ggp> 969-bp promoter fragments <END> , and this increase was abrogated by mutations at the <START:ggp> CRE site <END> . 
In summary , we have identified a <START:ggp> tissue-specific regulatory region <END> 5 ' of the <START:ggp> ecto-5'-NT core promoter <END> that requires the presence of a functional <START:ggp> CRE site <END> within the <START:ggp> basal promoter <END> for its suppressive activity . 
Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ( ERK ) -dependent and ERK-independent pathways target <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> on serine-727 in human neutrophils stimulated by <START:ggp> chemotactic factors <END> and <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
<START:ggp> STAT3 <END> ( <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 <END> ) is a latent transcription factor that is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation ( Tyr-705 ) in cells stimulated with <START:ggp> cytokines <END> or <START:ggp> growth factors <END> . 
Recent studies suggest that one or more <START:ggp> cytoplasmic serine kinases <END> also phosphorylate <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> and are necessary for maximal gene activation . 
Here we demonstrate , with a site-specific antibody , that <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> is phosphorylated on Ser-727 in <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> stimulated with <START:ggp> chemotactic factors <END> ( N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and complement C5a ) , <START:ggp> cytokines <END> [ <START:ggp> granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) and <START:ggp> granulocyte colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> ) ] , or a <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> activator ( PMA ) . 
( 2-Amino-3'-methoxyphenyl ) oxanaphthalen-4-one ( PD 98059 ) , an inhibitor of extracellular <START:ggp> signal-regulated protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> ERK <END> ) activation , blocked the serine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> induced by <START:ggp> chemotactic factors <END> or PMA . 
The drug was less effective on <START:ggp> cytokines <END> : it virtually abolished the response to <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> that occurred 5 min after stimulation but only partly decreased those at 15-30 min and did not appreciably alter responses to <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> regardless of incubation time . 
1- ( 5-Isoquinolinylsulphonyl ) -2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride ( H7 ) , an inhibitor of a putative <START:ggp> STAT3 serine kinase <END> , and 4- ( 4-fluorophenyl ) -2- ( 4-methylsulphinylphenyl ) -5- ( 4-pyridyl ) 1H-imidazole ( SB 203580 ) , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> p38 mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase <END> , did not dampen any of these serine phosphorylation responses . 
We propose that <START:ana> neutrophils <END> use both ERK-dependent and ERK-independent pathways to phosphorylate Ser-727 on <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> . 
The former pathway is recruited by all <START:ggp> ERK <END> -activating stimuli , whereas the latter pathway uses an undefined <START:ggp> serine kinase <END> and is recruited selectively by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
<START:ggp> GATA transcription factors <END> associate with a novel class of nuclear bodies in <START:ana> erythroblasts <END> and <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> . 
The nuclear distribution of <START:ggp> GATA transcription factors <END> in <START:ana> murine haemopoietic cells <END> was examined by indirect immunofluorescence . 
Specific bright foci of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> fluorescence were observed in <START:ana> erythroleukaemia cells <END> and <START:ana> primary murine erythroblasts <END> and <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> , in addition to diffuse nucleoplasmic localization . 
These foci , which were preferentially found adjacent to nucleoli or at the nuclear periphery , did not represent sites of active transcription or binding of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> to <START:ggp> consensus sites <END> in the <START:ggp> beta-globin loci <END> . 
Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated the presence of intensely labelled structures likely to represent the <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> foci seen by immunofluorescence . 
The <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> nuclear bodies differed from previously described nuclear structures and there was no co-localization with <START:ggp> nuclear antigens <END> involved in RNA processing or other <START:ggp> ubiquitous ( Spl , c-Jun and TBP ) or haemopoietic ( NF-E2 ) transcription factors <END> . 
Interestingly , <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> and <START:ggp> GATA-3 proteins <END> also localized to the same nuclear bodies in cell lines co-expressing <START:ggp> GATA-1 and -2 or GATA-1 and -3 gene products <END> . 
This pattern of distribution is , thus far , unique to the <START:ggp> GATA transcription factors <END> and suggests a protein-protein interaction with other components of the nuclear bodies via the <START:ggp> GATA zinc finger domain <END> . 
Energy substrates , hormone responses and glucocorticoid binding in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> during intense physical exercise in humans following phosphocreatine administration . 
Eight healthy untrained male volunteers pedalled a cycle ergometer according to two exercise protocols : the first involved step-wise increasing physical exercise to maximal ( MPE ) ; the second involved prolonged ( 35 min ) submaximal physical exercise ( PPE ) at 70 % of the individual 's maximal oxygen uptake . 
Each volunteer performed these exercise twice , following either an intravenous injection of phosphocreatine ( PCr ) or a placebo of an isotonic NaCl solution . 
Anaerobic threshold ( AT ) was determined from the point of departure of the ventilatory response from linearity and from the sudden increase in venous blood lactate concentrations during MPE . 
After exercise following placebo administration we observed increases in concentrations of blood substrates , <START:ggp> plasma adrenocorticotropin <END> ( <START:ggp> ACTH <END> ) , growth hormone and cortisol and in the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> without changes in the dissociation constant . 
Intravenous administration of PCr ( starting 1 day before exercise ) led to an increase in the total workload ( on average by 5.8 % ) and in AT ( on average by 6.8 % ) during MPE and to a better tolerance of exercise during PPE . 
Following PCr administration we observed lower blood lactate concentrations and different patterns of some enzyme activities , less pronounced changes in <START:ggp> plasma ACTH <END> and cortisol concentrations and in glucocorticoid binding in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , but no changes in plasma growth hormone concentrations compared to the placebo . 
The results showed that intense physical exercise led not only to increases in blood hormone concentrations but also to an increase in the density of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
Intravenous PCr injection led to smaller changes in <START:ggp> ACTH <END> and cortisol concentrations as well as to a lower activation of glucocorticoid binding in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Putative steroid binding domain <END> of the <START:ggp> human mineralocorticoid receptor <END> , expressed in E. coli in the presence of <START:ggp> heat shock proteins <END> shows typical native receptor characteristics . 
<START:ggp> Domain E <END> , considered as the <START:ggp> putative hormone binding domain <END> ( <START:ggp> HBD <END> ) of the <START:ggp> human mineralocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> hMR <END> ) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with either <START:ggp> maltose binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> MBP <END> ) or <START:ggp> glutathione S-transferase <END> ( <START:ggp> GST <END> ) . 
These <START:ggp> bacterially-produced MR constructs <END> had no steroid binding activity per se . 
In fact , <START:ggp> heat shock protein <END> association ( <START:ggp> hsp <END> ) is required for high affinity ligand-binding of the <START:ggp> MR <END> . 
After incubation of purified <START:ggp> MBP- or GST-HBD <END> with rabbit reticulocyte lysate , known to be rich in <START:ggp> heat shock proteins <END> , we obtained saturable binding of [ 3H ] aldosterone . 
The Kd value for aldosterone was 0.3 nM and the Bmax = 32 pmol/mg . 
Hormone binding specificity was assessed by competition studies with various steroid ligands . 
Sucrose gradient assays performed with <START:ggp> [ 3H ] aldosterone-MBP-HBD <END> revealed complex sedimenting at 8.3S and 4.9S with <START:ggp> [ 3H ] progesterone-MBP-HBD <END> . 
Western-blot analysis of the sedimentation peak showed the concomitant presence of <START:ggp> MBP-HBD <END> by a <START:ggp> monoclonal anti-MBP antibody <END> , and <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> by a <START:ggp> monoclonal anti-hsp antibody <END> . 
Moreover , following incubation with the <START:ggp> anti-rabbit hsp90 monoclonal antibody <END> the sedimenting gradient showed a <START:ggp> 10.4S sedimenting complex <END> . 
These analyses demonstrated that the [ 3H ] aldosterone- <START:ggp> MBP-HBD complex <END> is at least associated with <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> in reticulocyte lysate and that the <START:ggp> HBD <END> of <START:ggp> hMR <END> is sufficient to bind <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> . 
Deletions of a relatively short <START:ggp> amino- ( 729-766 ) or carboxy- terminal ( 940-984 ) region <END> of the <START:ggp> HBD fragment <END> eliminated all steroid-binding properties . 
Overall , these results indicate that the integrity of <START:ggp> domain E <END> is necessary and sufficient to bind steroid ligands , agonists or antagonists , with characteristics similar to the entire native <START:ggp> MR <END> . 
Renal cell carcinoma-derived gangliosides suppress <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> ) is impaired in <START:ana> T cells <END> from patients with renal cell carcinomas ( RCCs ) . 
In circulating <START:ana> T cells <END> from a subset of patients with RCCs , the suppression of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> binding activity is downstream from the stimulus-induced degradation of the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic factor <END> <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tumor-derived soluble products <END> from cultured RCC explants inhibit <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> from healthy volunteers , despite a normal level of stimulus-induced <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> degradation in these cells . 
The inhibitory agent has several features characteristic of a ganglioside , including sensitivity to <START:ggp> neuraminidase <END> but not <START:ggp> protease <END> treatment ; hydrophobicity ; and molecular weight less than 3 kDa . 
Indeed , we detected gangliosides in supernatants from <START:ana> RCC explants <END> and not from adjacent normal kidney tissue . 
Gangliosides prepared from RCC supernatants , as well as the purified bovine gangliosides G ( m1 ) and G ( d1a ) , suppressed <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> binding activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> and reduced expression of the <START:ggp> cytokines <END> <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
Taken together , our findings suggest that tumor-derived gangliosides may blunt antitumor immune responses in patients with RCCs . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor-kappaB <END> -dependent induction of <START:ggp> interleukin-8 <END> gene expression by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> : evidence for an antioxidant sensitive activating pathway distinct from nuclear translocation . 
<START:ggp> Tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> ) is a pluripotent activator of inflammation by inducing a <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokine <END> cascade . 
This phenomenon is mediated , in part , through inducible expression of the <START:ggp> CXC chemokine <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin-8 <END> ( IL-8 ) . 
In this study , we investigate the role of <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> -inducible reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> expression by `` monocyte-like '' <START:ana> U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> is a rapid activator of <START:ggp> IL-8 gene <END> expression by <START:ana> U937 <END> , producing a 50-fold induction of <START:ana> mRNA <END> within 1 hour of treatment . 
In gene transfection assays , the effect of <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> requires the presence of an <START:ggp> inducible nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) ( Rel A ) binding site <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-8 promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> treatment induces a rapid translocation of the <START:ggp> 65 kD transcriptional activator <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB subunit <END> , <START:ggp> Rel A <END> , whose binding in the nucleus occurs before changes in intracellular ROS . 
Pretreatment ( or up to 15 minutes posttreatment ) relative to <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> with the antioxidant dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) ( 2 % [ vol/vol ] ) blocks 80 % of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent transcription . 
Surprisingly , however , DMSO has no effect on inducible <START:ggp> Rel A <END> binding . 
Similar selective effects on <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> transcription are seen with the unrelated antioxidants , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) and vitamin C . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> induces a delayed ROS-dependent signalling pathway that is required for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> transcriptional activation and is separable from that required for its nuclear translocation . 
Further definition of this pathway will yield new insights into inflammation initiated by <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> signalling . 
Gender and vascular reactivity . 
<START:ggp> Estrogen receptors <END> are found on <START:ana> vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells <END> ; their expression is influenced by exposure to the hormone . 
<START:ggp> Estrogen receptors <END> influence non-genomic events , which are rapid in onset and genomic events , which are longer acting responses . 
Estrogens affect vascular tone indirectly by modulating release of <START:ggp> endothelium-derived vasoactive factors <END> and directly by modulating intracellular calcium in <START:ana> vascular smooth muscle cells <END> . 
Estrogens indirectly affect thrombotic events and inflammation by altering <START:ana> platelet <END> aggregation and <START:ana> leukocyte <END> adherence and migration , respectively . 
Estrogens also influence production of mitogens which , when released at sites of vascular injury , affect vascular remodeling . 
Although estrogens initiate vascular responses , genomic sex may influence and/or limit expression of estrogen receptors and therefore actions of sex steroid hormones throughout the vasculature . 
Induction of a functional <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> in all-trans-retinoic acid-induced monocytic differentiation of <START:ana> M2-type leukemic blast cells <END> . 
Different types of <START:ana> acute myeloid leukemia blast cells <END> were induced to differentiate in vitro with all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and vitamin D3 ( VD ) . 
<START:ana> M0/M1 leukemic cells <END> are not sensitive to differentiating agents , whereas <START:ana> M3 leukemic cells <END> are induced to undergo granulocytic differentiation after ATRA treatment but are not sensitive to VD . 
<START:ana> M2 leukemic blast cells <END> behave differently because they undergo monocytic differentiation with both the differentiation inducers . 
To gain some insight into the maturation of <START:ana> M2-type leukemic cells <END> , we studied the molecular mechanisms underlying monocytic differentiation induced by ATRA and VD in spontaneous <START:ana> M2 blast cells <END> as well as in <START:ana> Kasumi-1 cells <END> ( an <START:ana> acute myeloid leukemia M2-type cell line <END> ) . 
Our results indicate that ATRA as well as VD efficiently increases the nuclear abundance of <START:ggp> VD receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) and promotes monocytic differentiation . 
<START:ggp> VDR <END> is functionally active in ATRA-treated <START:ana> Kasumi-1 cells <END> because it efficiently heterodimerizes with <START:ggp> retinoid X receptor <END> , binds to a <START:ggp> DR3-type vitamin D-responsive element <END> , and activates the transcription of a <START:ggp> vitamin D-responsive element-regulated reporter gene <END> . 
Consistent with these findings , <START:ggp> VD-responsive genes <END> are induced by ATRA treatment of <START:ana> Kasumi-1 cells <END> , suggesting that the genetic program underlying monocytic differentiation is activated . 
The molecular mechanism by which ATRA increases the nuclear abundance of a functional <START:ggp> VDR <END> is still unknown , but our data clearly indicate that the <START:ana> M2 leukemic cell <END> context is only permissive of monocytic differentiation . 
<START:ggp> Protein kinase C <END> and <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> synergize to activate <START:ggp> IkappaB kinase <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
The nuclear factor of kappaB ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) is a <START:ggp> ubiquitous transcription factor <END> that is key in the regulation of the immune response and inflammation . 
<START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) cross-linking is in part required for activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , which is dependent on the phosphorylation and degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> . 
By using <START:ana> Jurkat <END> and <START:ana> primary human T lymphocytes <END> , we demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of two second messengers of the <START:ggp> TCR <END> -initiated signal transduction , <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) and <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , results in the synergistic activation of the <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha kinase ( IKK ) complex <END> but not of another <START:ggp> putative IkappaBalpha kinase <END> , <START:ggp> p90 ( rsk ) <END> . 
We also demonstrate that the <START:ggp> IKK complex <END> , but not <START:ggp> p90 ( rsk ) <END> , is responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> mediated by the co-activation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> and <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
Each second messenger is necessary , as inhibition of either one reverses the activation of the <START:ggp> IKK complex <END> and <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> phosphorylation in vivo . 
Overexpression of dominant negative forms of <START:ggp> IKKalpha and -beta <END> demonstrates that only <START:ggp> IKKbeta <END> is the target for <START:ggp> PKC <END> and <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
These results indicate that within the <START:ggp> TCR <END> <START:ggp> /CD3 <END> signal transduction pathway both <START:ggp> PKC <END> and <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> are required for the effective activation of the <START:ggp> IKK complex <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Diminished responses to <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> by human monocytes differentiated in vitro : role of the <START:ggp> IL-13Ralpha1 chain <END> and <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> . 
The primary <START:ggp> IL-13 receptor complex <END> on <START:ana> human monocytes <END> is believed to be a heterodimer comprised of the <START:ggp> IL-4R alpha chain <END> and the <START:ggp> IL-2R gamma chain <END> <START:ggp> ( gamma ( c ) ) -like molecule <END> , <START:ggp> IL-13R alpha1 <END> . 
<START:ana> mRNA <END> levels for <START:ggp> IL-13R alpha1 <END> , but not <START:ggp> IL-4R alpha <END> , were markedly decreased in <START:ana> in vitro monocyte-derived macrophages <END> ( <START:ana> MDMac <END> ) , and with increasing time of <START:ana> monocytes <END> in culture correlated with the loss of <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> regulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> production . 
Analysis of <START:ana> cell lines <END> <START:ana> Daudi <END> and <START:ana> THP-1 <END> that differentially express <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13R alpha1 <END> showed that <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> can activate <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> in <START:ana> IL-13R alpha1-positive THP-1 cells <END> but not in <START:ana> gamma ( c ) -positive , IL-13R alpha1-negative Daudi cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-13 <END> activation of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> was reduced in <START:ana> MDMac <END> which was associated with diminished <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> -induced expression of <START:ggp> CD23 <END> and <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> . 
However , with reduced <START:ggp> IL-13R alpha1 <END> expression and low nuclear <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> activity , some <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> -induced responses were unaltered in magnitude in <START:ana> MDMac <END> . 
In the absence of functional <START:ggp> IL-13R alpha1 <END> and <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> , <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> must signal through an alternative <START:ggp> receptor complex <END> on <START:ana> MDMac <END> . 
Experiments with a blocking antibody to <START:ggp> IL-4R alpha <END> showed that this chain remains an essential component of the <START:ggp> IL-13 receptor complex <END> on <START:ana> MDMac <END> . 
The <START:ggp> p53 <END> paradox in the pathogenesis of tumor progression . 
Recent evidence suggests that the <START:ggp> p53 molecule <END> appears in two different forms : the <START:ggp> mutant p53 <END> that stimulates tumor progression , and <START:ggp> wild type p53 <END> that inhibits tumor progression . 
In addition , it has been established that <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) can activate the expression of <START:ggp> wild type p53 <END> in concert with the <START:ggp> nuclear transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> are also involved in the stimulation of the pathway that leads to the expression of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecules <END> and , hence , antigen presentation to the <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
In this paper we shall advance the hypothesis that : ( i ) <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> indirectly controls immune surveillance ; and ( ii ) <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> controls DNA repair and tumor suppression through the regulation of <START:ggp> wild type p53 <END> . 
Thus , it is hypothesized that elevated <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> is primarily responsible for promoting tumor progression . 
The <START:ggp> promoter <END> and <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking sequences <END> controlling human <START:ggp> B29 gene <END> expression . 
The product of the <START:ggp> B-cell-specific B29 gene <END> ( <START:ggp> B29 <END> , <START:ggp> Ig beta <END> , <START:ggp> CD79b <END> ) is essential for Ig-mediated B-cell activation via the <START:ggp> B-cell antigen receptor complex <END> ( <START:ggp> BCR <END> ) on <START:ana> human and murine B lymphocytes <END> . 
To better understand the regulation of this pivotal gene , we have analyzed the <START:ggp> human genomic DNA sequence <END> upstream of the <START:ggp> B29 <END> <START:ggp> ATG start codon <END> for transcriptional control activity . 
The human <START:ggp> B29 gene <END> lacks either a <START:ggp> TATA or a CAAT box <END> and transcription is initiated at <START:ggp> multiple sites <END> . 
The minimal promoter of the <START:ggp> human B29 gene <END> is contained within a <START:ggp> 193-bp region <END> 5 ' of these <START:ggp> multiple start sites <END> . 
This <START:ggp> minimal promoter <END> exhibits B-cell-specific activity and contains <START:ggp> SP1 , ETS , OCT , and IKAROS/LYF-1 transcription factor motifs <END> . 
All these motifs are strikingly conserved in sequence and placement relative to the previously characterized <START:ggp> murine B29 promoter <END> . 
Additional upstream gene segments dramatically affected <START:ggp> B29 <END> <START:ggp> minimal promoter <END> activity . 
A newly identified motif called the <START:ggp> B29 conserved sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> BCS <END> ) , found upstream of both <START:ggp> human and murine B29 promoters <END> , appears to stimulate <START:ggp> B29 <END> transcription through a novel mechanism . 
A single <START:ggp> BCS <END> had little effect either on the minimal <START:ggp> B29 promoter <END> or on a heterologous promoter . 
Instead , the <START:ggp> BCS <END> stimulated transcription by counteracting <START:ggp> 5 ' negative regulatory DNA sequences <END> that block the activity of the <START:ggp> B29 <END> <START:ggp> minimal promoter <END> in its absence . 
These findings indicate that <START:ggp> B29 gene <END> expression is controlled by the complex interplay of positive and <START:ggp> negative regulatory elements <END> . 
A novel <START:ggp> immunosuppressive factor <END> in bovine colostrum blocks activation of the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 gene enhancer <END> at the <START:ggp> NFAT site <END> . 
A factor in bovine colostrum ( <START:ggp> colostrum inhibitory factor <END> , <START:ggp> CIF <END> ) inhibits <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL2 <END> ) production in activated <START:ana> T helper cells <END> by blocking the accumulation of <START:ana> IL2 mRNA <END> . 
To determine whether <START:ggp> CIF <END> blocks at the level of <START:ggp> IL2 <END> transcription , we introduced reporter plasmids into the <START:ana> human T leukemia cell line Jurkat <END> by transient transfection . 
These contained the <START:ggp> luciferase gene <END> under the control of either the <START:ggp> human IL2 upstream enhancer <END> region ( segments -326 to +45 ) or three repeats of the <START:ggp> NFAT element <END> contained within it ( segments -255 to -285 ) . 
Expression of <START:ggp> luciferase <END> in these cells was induced by phorbol myristate acetate plus a calcium ionophore . 
<START:ggp> CIF <END> inhibited induction of either construct as did cyclosporine , which is known to block activation of the <START:ggp> NFAT element <END> . 
<START:ggp> CIF <END> failed to inhibit several other <START:ggp> enhancer elements <END> . 
The <START:ggp> NFAT-controlled luciferase gene system <END> distinguishes <START:ggp> CIF <END> from other T cell inhibitory activities present in colostrum , in particular , <START:ggp> TGF beta 1 <END> and <START:ggp> TGF beta 2 <END> and the glucocorticoids . 
Stably transfected Jurkat cells behaved similarly to the transiently transfected ones with respect to inhibition by <START:ggp> CIF <END> and cyclosporine . 
The <START:ggp> NFAT <END> -luc assay is a useful technique for the rapid , sensitive measurement of <START:ggp> CIF <END> or other immunosuppressants with a similar mode of action . 
Heat shock induces HIV-1 replication in chronically infected <START:ana> promyelocyte cell line OM10.1 <END> . 
A long period of clinical latency before development of symptoms is characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection . 
<START:ana> OM10.1 <END> , a <START:ana> promyelocyte cell line <END> latently infected with HIV-1 , has been developed as a model for studying the mechanism of viral latency and the activation of virus expression . 
We found that this latently infected cell line with heat shock at 42 degrees C for 2 h resulted in a high level of HIV-1 production without addition of any <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
The mechanism of activation was analyzed by using <START:ggp> anti-TNF-alpha antibody <END> and various inhibitors . 
Although the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> level in culture supernatants was below the sensitivity of an ELISA assay system , addition of anti- <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> antibody in culture medium could partially suppress the heat shock induced HIV-1 production . 
Staurosporine ( PKC inhibitor ) , pentoxifylline ( NF-kappa B inhibitor ) , and Ro5-3335 ( HIV-1 <START:ggp> Tat <END> inhibitor ) also inhibited significantly the heat shock induced virus activation . 
In particular , staurosporine achieved approximately 90 % inhibition of the HIV-1 antigen expression in <START:ana> heat shock-treated OM10.1 <END> at a non-toxic concentration . 
Although the mechanism of HIV-1 activation with heat shock has not been fully elucidated yet , it is presumed <START:ggp> PKC <END> plays an important role in HIV-1 activation . 
Thus , the present observations will provide a further insight into the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infections . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> CDC42 effector <END> <START:ggp> N-WASP <END> by the <START:ggp> Shigella flexneri IcsA protein <END> promotes <START:ggp> actin <END> nucleation by <START:ggp> Arp2/3 complex <END> and bacterial <START:ggp> actin <END> -based motility . 
To propel itself in <START:ana> infected cells <END> , the pathogen Shigella flexneri subverts the <START:ggp> Cdc42 <END> -controlled machinery responsible for <START:ggp> actin <END> assembly during filopodia formation . 
Using a combination of bacterial motility assays in platelet extracts with Escherichia coli expressing the <START:ggp> Shigella IcsA protein <END> and in vitro analysis of reconstituted systems from <START:ggp> purified proteins <END> , we show here that the <START:ggp> bacterial protein IcsA <END> binds <START:ggp> N-WASP <END> and activates it in a <START:ggp> Cdc42 <END> -like fashion . 
Dramatic stimulation of <START:ggp> actin <END> assembly is linked to the formation of a ternary <START:ggp> IcsA-N-WASP-Arp2/3 complex <END> , which nucleates <START:ggp> actin <END> polymerization . 
The <START:ggp> Arp2/3 complex <END> is essential in initiation of <START:ggp> actin <END> assembly and Shigella movement , as previously observed for Listeria monocytogenes . 
Activation of <START:ggp> N-WASP <END> by <START:ggp> IcsA <END> unmasks two domains acting together in insertional <START:ggp> actin <END> polymerization . 
The isolated <START:ggp> COOH-terminal domain <END> of <START:ggp> N-WASP <END> containing a <START:ggp> verprolin-homology region <END> , a cofilin-homology sequence , and an <START:ggp> acidic terminal segment <END> ( <START:ggp> VCA <END> ) interacts with <START:ggp> G-actin <END> in a unique profilin-like functional fashion . 
Hence , when <START:ggp> N-WASP <END> is activated , its <START:ggp> COOH-terminal domain <END> feeds barbed end growth of filaments and lowers the critical concentration at the bacterial surface . 
On the other hand , the <START:ggp> NH ( 2 ) -terminal domain <END> of <START:ggp> N-WASP <END> interacts with <START:ggp> F-actin <END> , mediating the attachment of the <START:ggp> actin tail <END> to the bacterium surface . 
VASP is not involved in Shigella movement , and the function of <START:ggp> profilin <END> does not require its binding to <START:ggp> proline-rich regions <END> . 
<START:ggp> c-Maf <END> induces monocytic differentiation and apoptosis in <START:ana> bipotent myeloid progenitors <END> . 
The transcriptional mechanisms that drive <START:ana> colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage ( CFU-GM ) myeloid progenitors <END> to differentiate into cells of either the <START:ana> granulocytic or monocytic lineage <END> are not fully understood . 
We have shown that the <START:ggp> c-Maf <END> and <START:ggp> c-Myb transcription factors <END> physically interact in myeloid cells to form inhibitory complexes that hinder transactivation of <START:ggp> c-Myb target genes <END> through direct binding to <START:ggp> Myb consensus sites <END> . 
These complexes arise in a developmentally regulated pattern , peaking at the <START:ana> promyelocyte stage <END> , or in <START:ana> cell model systems <END> , appearing soon after the induction of monocytic differentiation . 
We wished to determine if this developmentally related interaction is a consequence of myeloid differentiation or an intrinsic differentiating stimulus . 
Because the elevated <START:ggp> Myb : Maf <END> status seen in <START:ana> differentiating cells <END> can be recapitulated by overexpression of <START:ggp> c-Maf <END> in myeloid cell lines , we inducibly expressed the <START:ggp> c-Maf cDNA <END> in 2 bipotent <START:ana> human myeloid progenitor cells <END> . 
Elevated levels of <START:ggp> c-Maf protein <END> led to marked increases in <START:ggp> Myb : Maf complexes <END> and the accumulation of <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage cells <END> , followed by eventual programmed cell death . 
Analysis of targets that could mediate these phenotypic changes indicated that <START:ggp> c-Maf <END> likely plays a key role in myeloid cell development through dual mechanisms ; inhibition of a select set of <START:ggp> c-Myb <END> regulated targets , such as <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> and <START:ggp> CD13/APN <END> , coupled with the activation of as yet undefined <START:ggp> differentiation-promoting genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> AML1 ( CBFalpha2 ) <END> cooperates with <START:ggp> B cell-specific activating protein ( BSAP/PAX5 ) <END> in activation of the <START:ggp> B cell-specific BLK gene promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> AML1 <END> plays a critical role during hematopoiesis and chromosomal translocations involving <START:ggp> AML1 <END> are commonly associated with different forms of leukemia , including pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia . 
To understand the function of <START:ggp> AML1 <END> during <START:ana> B cell <END> differentiation , we analyzed <START:ggp> regulatory regions <END> of <START:ggp> B cell-specific genes <END> for potential <START:ggp> AML1-binding sites <END> and have identified a putative <START:ggp> AML1-binding site <END> in the promoter of the <START:ggp> B cell-specific tyrosine kinase gene , blk <END> . 
Gel mobility shift assays and transient transfection assays demonstrate that <START:ggp> AML1 <END> binds specifically to this site in the <START:ggp> blk promoter <END> and this binding site is important for <START:ggp> blk <END> promoter activity . 
Furthermore , in vitro binding analysis revealed that the <START:ggp> AML1 runt DNA-binding domain <END> physically interacts with the <START:ggp> paired DNA-binding domain <END> of <START:ggp> BSAP <END> , a <START:ggp> B cell-specific transcription factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> BSAP <END> has been shown previously to be important for B cell-specific regulation of the <START:ggp> blk <END> gene . 
Physical interaction of <START:ggp> AML1 <END> with <START:ggp> BSAP <END> correlates with functional cooperativity in transfection studies where <START:ggp> AML1 <END> and <START:ggp> BSAP <END> synergistically activate <START:ggp> blk <END> promoter transcription by more than 50-fold . 
These results demonstrate physical and functional interactions between <START:ggp> AML1 <END> and <START:ggp> BSAP <END> and suggest that <START:ggp> AML1 <END> is an important factor for regulating a critical <START:ggp> B cell-specific gene <END> , <START:ggp> blk <END> . 
Transcriptional inhibition by <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> of the <START:ggp> class A macrophage scavenger receptor <END> in <START:ana> macrophages <END> derived from <START:ana> human peripheral monocytes <END> and the <START:ana> THP-1 monocytic cell line <END> . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> class A macrophage scavenger receptor ( MSR ) <END> contributes to the uptake of <START:ggp> modified low density lipoproteins ( LDL ) <END> by <START:ana> macrophages <END> and transformation of these cells into <START:ana> lipid-laden foam cells <END> , which characterize atherosclerosis . 
Many environmental factors , in particular , <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> growth factors <END> , can exert regulatory effects on <START:ggp> MSR <END> expression , whereas intracellular accumulation of cholesterol itself does not influence <START:ggp> MSR <END> levels to any considerable extent . 
In the present study , by using an in vitro model , we examined whether stimulation with <START:ggp> interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) <END> , an <START:ggp> immunoregulatory <END> , <START:ggp> multipotential cytokine <END> , modulates the expression and activities of the <START:ggp> MSR <END> in <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
When treated with <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , <START:ana> macrophages <END> derived from <START:ana> peripheral monocytes <END> and <START:ana> phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -differentiated THP-1 monocytic cells <END> showed significantly reduced uptake and/or binding of the <START:ggp> MSR <END> ligand , <START:ggp> acetylated LDL <END> . 
This effect was paralleled by a reduction in the expression of <START:ggp> MSR <END> protein and <START:ana> mRNA <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> MSR promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> transfected with an <START:ggp> MSR promoter-reporter gene construct <END> demonstrated decreased activity of the <START:ggp> MSR promoter <END> in <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> -treated <START:ana> THP-1 <END> <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay also showed a reduction in the binding of a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> to the <START:ggp> MSR promoter AP-1/ets elements <END> in <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> -treated cells . 
Thus , exposure to <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> may inhibit expression of the <START:ggp> class A MSR <END> in differentiated <START:ana> macrophages <END> at transcriptional levels . 
This result suggests that this <START:ggp> cytokine <END> may modulate foam cell formation during atherogenesis . 
Retinoblastoma protein expression leads to reduced <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> DNA binding activity and enhances <START:ggp> interleukin-8 <END> expression . 
Tumor cell lines with a defective <START:ggp> retinoblastoma gene <END> are unable to transcribe the <START:ggp> HLA class II genes <END> in response to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> treatment , and reconstitution of functional <START:ggp> Rb <END> rescues IFN-gamma-induced <START:ggp> class II gene <END> expression . 
However , the molecular mechanism of <START:ggp> Rb <END> rescue of the <START:ggp> class II genes <END> is unknown . 
We have examined the effect of <START:ggp> Rb <END> expression on the activation of the promoter for <START:ggp> HLA-DRA <END> , the <START:ggp> prototype class II gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> , a <START:ggp> POU domain transcription factor <END> , was identified as a repressor of <START:ggp> HLA-DRA <END> promoter activity in the <START:ana> Rb-defective cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Rb <END> expression led to phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> , thus relieving its repressive effect . 
<START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> has also been shown to repress <START:ggp> interleukin 8 <END> promoter activity . 
Consistent with reduced levels of <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> DNA binding activity in the <START:ana> Rb-transformed cell lines <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin 8 <END> expression is higher in these cell lines . 
Cell activation and apoptosis by <START:ggp> bacterial lipoproteins <END> through <START:ggp> toll-like receptor-2 <END> . 
Apoptosis is implicated in the generation and resolution of inflammation in response to bacterial pathogens . 
All bacterial pathogens produce <START:ggp> lipoproteins ( BLPs ) <END> , which trigger the innate immune response . 
<START:ggp> BLPs <END> were found to induce apoptosis in <START:ana> THP-1 monocytic cells <END> through <START:ggp> human Toll-like receptor-2 ( hTLR2 ) <END> . 
<START:ggp> BLPs <END> also initiated apoptosis in an <START:ana> epithelial cell line <END> transfected with <START:ggp> hTLR2 <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> BLPs <END> stimulated <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> , a <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> of <START:ggp> multiple host defense genes <END> , and activated the respiratory burst through <START:ggp> hTLR2 <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> hTLR2 <END> is a molecular link between microbial products , apoptosis , and host defense mechanisms . 
Possible differences in the mechanism ( s ) of action of different glucocorticoid hormone compounds . 
Different glucocorticoid hormones ( GCH ) show differences in the intensity and in the kinetics of their immunomodulating activity . 
The mechanism ( s ) of action of GCH is under investigation , but is has been noted that they exert immune activity via the genomic pathway . 
We have studied the effects of prednisone ( PDN ) , deflazacort ( DFC ) , and dexamethasone ( DXM ) on the production of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ) by <START:ana> peripheral T lymphocytes <END> , and the effects on the inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> DNA binding activity by <START:ana> activated Jurkat cell line <END> . 
The data obtained show that the three GCH molecules exert an immunosuppression on <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production by <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> and a strong decrease in the nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> ; moreover , ( a ) not all the <START:ggp> cytokines <END> investigated were affected , and not with the same intensity , by the three GCH and ( b ) DXM inhibited the binding activity of <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> less than that of DFC and PDN . 
These data are in agreement with the concept that different GCH compounds might differ in their binding and affinity properties , tissue-specific metabolism , and interaction with <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
Distinctive expression pattern of the <START:ggp> BCL-6 protein <END> in nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin 's disease . 
The <START:ana> BCL-6 gene <END> encoding a <START:ggp> nuclear-located Kruppel-type zinc finger protein <END> is rearranged in about 30 % diffuse large <START:ana> B-cell lymphomas <END> and is expressed predominantly in normal <START:ana> germinal center B cells <END> and related lymphomas . 
These findings suggest that <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> may play a role in regulating differentiation of normal <START:ana> germinal center B cells <END> and that its deregulated expression caused by rearrangements may contribute to lymphomagenesis . 
This prompted us to investigate the expression of the <START:ggp> BCL-6 protein <END> in Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) , focusing on the nodular lymphocyte predominance subtype ( NLPHD ) , which differs from classical HD by virtue of the B-cell nature of the <START:ana> malignant cell population <END> ( so-called <START:ana> L & H cells <END> ) and its relationship with germinal centers . 
Forty-one HD samples ( 19 NLPHD , 12 nodular sclerosis , and 10 mixed cellularity ) were immunostained with the <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> <START:ggp> PG-B6 <END> and <START:ggp> PG-B6p <END> that react with a fixative-sensitive and a <START:ggp> formalin-resistant epitope <END> on the <START:ggp> aminoterminal region <END> of the <START:ggp> BCL-6 gene product <END> , respectively . 
Strong nuclear positivity for the <START:ggp> BCL-6 protein <END> was detected in <START:ana> tumor ( L & H ) cells <END> in all cases of NLPHD . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> was expressed only in a small percentage of <START:ana> Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells <END> in about 30 % of classical HD cases . 
Notably , the nuclei of <START:ana> reactive CD3+/CD4+ T cells <END> nearby to and rosetting around <START:ana> L & H cells <END> in NLPHD were also strongly <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> + , but lacked <START:ggp> CD40 ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> CD40L <END> ) expression . 
This staining pattern clearly differed from that of classical HD , whose cellular background was made up of <START:ana> CD3+/CD4+ T cells <END> showing the <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> -/ <START:ggp> CD40L <END> + phenotype . 
These results further support the concept that NLPHD is an histogenetically distinct , B-cell-derived subtype of HD and suggest a role for <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> in its development . 
Selenium-mediated inhibition of <START:ggp> transcription factor NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR promoter <END> activity . 
The <START:ggp> eukaryotic transcription factor NF-kappa B <END> is involved in the inducible expression of various <START:ggp> inflammatory genes <END> as well as in HIV-1 replication . 
Activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is induced by prooxidants and several stimuli eliciting oxidative stress , such as <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , lipopolysaccharide , UV irradiation and other mediators . 
Various antioxidants inhibit <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in response to these stimuli . 
In this study , we have investigated the effects of selenium , an integral component of <START:ggp> glutathione peroxidase <END> ( <START:ggp> GPX <END> ) , on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
In <START:ana> selenium-deprived Jurkat <END> and <START:ana> ESb-L T lymphocytes <END> , supplementation of selenium led to a substantial increase of <START:ggp> GPX <END> activity . 
Analysis of DNA binding revealed that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in response to <START:ggp> TNF <END> was significantly inhibited under these conditions . 
Likewise , reporter gene assays using luciferase constructs driven by the <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> showed a dose-dependent inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> controlled gene expression by selenium . 
The effects of selenium were specific for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , since the activity of the transcription factor <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> was not suppressed . 
These data suggest that selenium supplementation may be used to modulate the expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B target genes <END> and HIV-1 . 
The involvement of <START:ggp> p23 <END> , <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> , and <START:ggp> immunophilins <END> in the assembly of <START:ggp> progesterone receptor complexes <END> . 
To better understand the assembly mechanism for the <START:ggp> progesterone receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> PR <END> ) , we have developed cell-free systems for studying interactions of <START:ggp> PR <END> , <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> , and other <START:ggp> associated proteins <END> . 
When <START:ggp> PR <END> is incubated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate , its association with <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> , <START:ggp> hsp70 <END> , the three <START:ggp> immunophilins <END> <START:ggp> FKBP54 <END> , <START:ggp> FKBP52 <END> and <START:ggp> CyP-40 <END> , and with <START:ggp> p23 <END> is observed . 
These interactions require ATP/Mg2+ and when ATP is limiting the <START:ggp> PR <END> complex is altered to one containing the proteins <START:ggp> p60 <END> and <START:ggp> p48 <END> , but lacking <START:ggp> immunophilins <END> and <START:ggp> p23 <END> . 
We have studied two <START:ggp> pre-formed hsp90 complexes <END> that may participate in the assembly of <START:ggp> PR complexes <END> . 
One contains <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> bound to <START:ggp> hsp70 <END> and <START:ggp> p60 <END> and this complex forms spontaneously in the absence of ATP . 
A second complex contains <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> bound to <START:ggp> p23 <END> plus the three <START:ggp> immunophilins <END> and some <START:ggp> hsp70 <END> . 
The formation of this complex requires ATP . 
In further studies we have shown that purified <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> can bind to purified <START:ggp> p23 <END> and this interaction requires both ATP and molybdate . 
This explains , in part , the known effects of ATP and molybdate on assembly of <START:ggp> PR complexes <END> . 
Increased <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> expression and diminished <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> human mononuclear cells <END> following hydrocortisone injection . 
We have recently demonstrated that hydrocortisone and other glucocorticoids inhibit reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation by <START:ana> mononuclear ( MNC ) and polymorphonuclear leucocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PMNL <END> ) . 
Since NF-kappaB/ <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> system regulates the transcription of <START:ggp> proinflammatory genes <END> , including those responsible for ROS generation , we tested the hypothesis that hydrocortisone may stimulate <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> production thus inhibiting <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> translocation from the cytosol into the nucleus in <START:ana> MNC <END> , in vivo . 
One hundred milligram of hydrocortisone was injected intravenously into 4 normal subjects . 
Blood samples were obtained prior to the injection and at 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 24 hr after the injection . 
Nuclear extracts and total cell lysates were prepared from <START:ana> MNC <END> by standard techniques . 
<START:ggp> IkappaB <END> levels in <START:ana> MNC <END> homogenates increased at 1 hr , peaked at 2-4 hr , started to decrease at 8 hr , and returned to baseline levels at 24 hr . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> MNC <END> nuclear extracts decreased at 1 hr , reached a nadir at 4 hr , gradually increased at 8 hr and returned back to baseline levels at 24 hr . 
The total protein content of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB subunit <END> ( <START:ggp> P65 <END> ) in <START:ana> MNC <END> lysates also showed a decrease following hydrocortisone injection . 
This decrease was observed at 2 hr , reached a nadir at 4 hr , and returned to baseline levels at 24 hr . 
ROS generation inhibition paralleled <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> levels in the nucleus . 
It was inhibited at 1 hr , reached a nadir at 2-4 hr , started to increase at 8 hr , and returned to basal levels at 24 hr . 
Our data demonstrate that hydrocortisone induces <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> and suppresses <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> expression in <START:ana> MNC <END> in parallel . 
<START:ggp> IkappaB <END> further reduces the translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> into the nucleus thus preventing the expression of <START:ggp> proinflammatory genes <END> . 
Glucocorticoids induce apoptosis in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> : potential role of <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> . 
Glucocorticoids ( GC ) are potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents that act on a variety of <START:ana> immune cells <END> , including <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
However , the exact cellular mechanisms underlying this anti-inflammatory capacity are still unknown . 
In our study , we determined the induction of apoptosis by GC in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
<START:ana> Peripheral blood monocytes <END> were isolated by density centrifugation methods with a purity of > 90 % and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium . 
Monocyte apoptosis was determined by four independent methods , including annexin-V staining , TUNEL , DNA-laddering , and typical morphology by means of transmission electron microscopy . 
<START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> were measured by ELISA . 
<START:ggp> GC receptor <END> was blocked with mifepristone . 
Caspase 3 was inhibited with caspase-3 inhibitor ( DEVD-CHO ) . 
Stimulation with different GC at therapeutic concentrations resulted in monocyte apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner . 
Necrosis was excluded by propidium iodide staining . 
<START:ggp> Proinflammatory cytokines <END> such as <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> were down-regulated by GC treatment . 
Continuous treatment of <START:ana> monocytes <END> with <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> , but not with <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , could almost completely prevent GC-induced cell death . 
The addition of mifepristone or caspase-3 inhibitor could partially abrogate GC-induced apoptosis as well as GC-induced inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> . 
This is the first study to demonstrate induction of apoptosis by GC in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
GC-induced monocyte apoptosis may be partially mediated through effects on <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> production . 
It is conceivable that GC exert their anti-inflammatory capacity in various diseases , at least in part , by the induction of apoptosis in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Differential effects of lipopolysaccharide and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> on <START:ggp> monocytic IkappaB kinase <END> signalsome activation and <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> proteolysis . 
The inflammatory mediators lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) are potent activators of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
This study compared the effect of these stimuli on endogenous <START:ggp> IkappaB kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> IKK <END> ) signalsome activation and <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> phosphorylation/proteolysis in <START:ana> human monocytic cells <END> and investigated the role of the <START:ggp> signalsome proteins <END> <START:ggp> IKK-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IKK-beta <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-inducing kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> NIK <END> ) , <START:ggp> IKK-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> essential modulator ) , and <START:ggp> IKK complex-associated protein <END> . 
Kinase assays showed that <START:ggp> TNF <END> elicited a rapid but short-lived induction of <START:ggp> IKK <END> activity with a 3-fold greater effect on <START:ggp> IKK-alpha <END> than on <START:ggp> IKK-beta <END> , peaking at 5 min . 
In contrast , LPS predominantly stimulated <START:ggp> IKK-beta <END> activity , which slowly increased , peaking at 30 min . 
A second peak was observed at a later time point following LPS stimulation , which consisted of both IKK-alpha and -beta activity . 
The endogenous levels of the signalsome components were unaffected by stimulation . 
Furthermore , our studies showed association of the <START:ggp> IKK-alpha/beta heterodimer <END> with <START:ggp> NIK <END> , <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> -epsilon <END> in <START:ana> unstimulated cells <END> . 
Exposure to LPS or <START:ggp> TNF <END> led to differential patterns of <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IkappaB-epsilon <END> disappearance from and reassembly with the signalsome , whereas <START:ggp> IKK-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IKK-beta <END> , and <START:ggp> NIK <END> remained complex-associated . 
<START:ggp> NIK <END> can not phosphorylate <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> directly , but it appears to be a functionally important subunit , because mutated <START:ggp> NIK <END> inhibited stimulus-induced <START:ggp> kappaB <END> -dependent transcription more effectively than mutated <START:ggp> IKK-alpha <END> or <START:ggp> -beta <END> . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> IKK complex-associated protein <END> inhibited stimulus-mediated transcription , whereas <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> essential modulator enhanced it . 
The understanding of LPS- and TNF-induced signaling may allow the development of specific strategies to treat sepsis-associated disease . 
<START:ggp> Tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> decreases , and <START:ggp> interleukin-10 <END> increases , the sensitivity of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> to dexamethasone : potential regulation of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
Resistance to glucocorticoid therapy has been observed in patients with autoimmune/inflammatory diseases and may be related to the inflammatory process itself . 
The aim of this study was to examine the ability of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> , a <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokine <END> ) and <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -10 <END> ( an <START:ggp> anti-inflammatory cytokine <END> ) to differentially regulate the sensitivity of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> <START:ana> /macrophages <END> to glucocorticoids . 
To accomplish this , we first analyzed the pattern of <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> and IL-10 inhibition by dexamethasone in <START:ana> LPS-stimulated whole-blood cell cultures <END> . 
Second , we studied the modulation of the sensitivity of these cells to dexamethasone by preincubation with <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> or <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and measurement of LPS-stimulated <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> secretion . 
In addition , we evaluated the effect of dexamethasone on phorbolmyristate-acetate-stimulated <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor <END> antagonist secretion by the <START:ana> human monocytic cell line U937 <END> . 
Finally , we investigated whether the modulation of corticosensitivity in <START:ana> TNFalpha- and IL-10-pretreated U937 cells <END> was related to a change of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> concentration and affinity . 
Dexamethasone had different effects on LPS-induced <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> secretion ; whereas it suppressed <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> in a dose-dependent fashion , its effect on <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> secretion was biphasic , producing stimulation at lower , and inhibition at higher doses . 
The concentration of LPS employed influenced the effect of dexamethasone on <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> secretion ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Pretreatment with <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> diminished , and with <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> improved , the ability of dexamethasone to suppress <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> secretion in <START:ana> whole-blood cell cultures <END> ( P < 0.01 for both ) and to enhance <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> receptor antagonist secretion by U937 cells ( P < 0.05 for both ) . 
<START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> decreased ( P < 0.001 ) , while <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> increased ( P < 0.001 ) , the concentration of dexamethasone binding sites in these cells , with no discernible effect on their binding affinity . 
We conclude that glucocorticoids differentially modulate <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> secretion by <START:ana> human monocytes <END> in a LPS dose-dependent fashion and that the sensitivity of these cells to glucocorticoids is altered by <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> or <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> pretreatment ; <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> blocks their effects , whereas <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> acts synergistically with glucocorticoids . 
This is accompanied by opposite <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> changes , respectively opposing and favoring glucocorticoid actions . 
This study suggests that the pattern of pro-/antiinflammatory <START:ggp> cytokine <END> secretion may alter the response of patients to glucocorticoid therapy . 
Block of granulocytic differentiation of <START:ana> 32Dcl3 cells <END> by <START:ggp> AML1/ETO ( MTG8 ) <END> but not by highly expressed <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> chimeric gene , <END> <START:ggp> AML1/ETO ( MTG8 ) <END> , generated in <START:ggp> t ( 8 ; 21 ) <END> acute myeloid leukemia enhances the expression of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> . 
To evaluate whether this enhancement is the primary role of <START:ggp> AML1/ETO <END> in leukemogenesis , effects of over-expression of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> in the <START:ana> murine myeloid precursor cell line <END> , <START:ana> 32Dcl3 <END> , were examined . 
When <START:ana> 32Dcl3 cells <END> expressing exogenous <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> were induced to differentiate , the onset of morphological differentiation was delayed . 
However , even the cells expressing very high levels of exogenous <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> eventually underwent differentiation without a significant decrease in the synthesis of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> . 
On the contrary , <START:ana> 32Dcl3 cells <END> stably expressing <START:ggp> AML1/ETO <END> were completely resistant to differentiation and continued to grow in the presence of <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> . 
These results are consistent with the interpretation that stimulation of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> expression is not the primary target of <START:ggp> AML1/ETO <END> . 
Host defense mechanisms triggered by <START:ggp> microbial lipoproteins <END> through <START:ggp> toll-like receptors <END> . 
The generation of cell-mediated immunity against many infectious pathogens involves the production of <START:ggp> interleukin-12 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> ) , a key signal of the innate immune system . 
Yet , for many pathogens , the molecules that induce <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> production by <START:ana> macrophages <END> and the mechanisms by which they do so remain undefined . 
Here it is shown that <START:ggp> microbial lipoproteins <END> are potent stimulators of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> production by human <START:ana> macrophages <END> , and that induction is mediated by <START:ggp> Toll-like receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> TLRs <END> ) . 
Several lipoproteins stimulated TLR-dependent transcription of inducible <START:ggp> nitric oxide synthase <END> and the production of nitric oxide , a powerful microbicidal pathway . 
Activation of <START:ggp> TLRs <END> by <START:ggp> microbial lipoproteins <END> may initiate innate defense mechanisms against infectious pathogens . 
Abnormal <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with decreased <START:ggp> p65-RelA <END> protein expression . 
Numerous cellular and biochemical abnormalities in immune regulation have been described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , including surface <START:ggp> Ag receptor <END> -initiated signaling events and <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> production . 
Because <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> contributes to the transcription of numerous <START:ggp> inflammatory genes <END> and has been shown to be a molecular target of antiinflammatory drugs , we sought to characterize the functional role of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B protein complex <END> in <START:ana> lupus T cells <END> . 
Freshly isolated <START:ana> T cells <END> from lupus patients , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients , and normal individuals were activated physiologically via the <START:ggp> TCR <END> with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> anti-CD28 Abs <END> to assess proximal membrane signaling , and with PMA and a calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) to bypass membrane-mediated signaling events . 
We measured the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity in nuclear extracts by gel shift analysis . 
When compared with <START:ana> normal cells <END> , the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity in SLE patients was significantly decreased in SLE , but not in RA , patients . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity was absent in several SLE patients who were not receiving any medication , including corticosteroids . 
Also , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity remained absent in follow-up studies . 
In supershift experiments using specific <START:ggp> Abs <END> , we showed that , in the group of SLE patients who displayed undetectable <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity , <START:ggp> p65 complexes <END> were not formed . 
Finally , immunoblot analysis of nuclear extracts showed decreased or absent <START:ggp> p65 protein <END> levels . 
As <START:ggp> p65 complexes <END> are transcriptionally active in comparison to the p50 homodimer , this novel finding may provide insight on the origin of <START:ggp> abnormal cytokine <END> or other gene transcription in SLE patients . 
Signaling events induced by <START:ggp> lipopolysaccharide-activated toll-like receptor 2 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Human Toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) <END> is a <START:ggp> signaling receptor <END> that responds to LPS and activates <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Here , we investigate further the events triggered by <START:ggp> TLR2 <END> in response to LPS . 
We show that <START:ggp> TLR2 <END> associates with the <START:ggp> high-affinity LPS binding protein <END> membrane <START:ggp> CD14 <END> to serve as an <START:ggp> LPS receptor complex <END> , and that LPS treatment enhances the oligomerization of <START:ggp> TLR2 <END> . 
Concomitant with receptor oligomerization , the <START:ggp> IL-1R-associated kinase ( IRAK ) <END> is recruited to the <START:ggp> TLR2 <END> complex . 
Intracellular deletion variants of <START:ggp> TLR2 <END> lacking C-terminal 13 or 141 aa fail to recruit <START:ggp> IRAK <END> , which is consistent with the inability of these mutants to transmit LPS cellular signaling . 
Moreover , both deletion mutants could still form complexes with <START:ggp> wild-type TLR2 <END> and act in a dominant-negative ( DN ) fashion to block <START:ggp> TLR2 <END> -mediated signal transduction . 
DN constructs of <START:ggp> myeloid differentiation protein <END> , <START:ggp> IRAK <END> , <START:ggp> TNF receptor-associated factor 6 <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-inducing kinase <END> , when coexpressed with <START:ggp> TLR2 <END> , abrogate <START:ggp> TLR2 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
These results reveal a conserved signaling pathway for <START:ggp> TLR2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1Rs <END> and suggest a molecular mechanism for the inhibition of <START:ggp> TLR2 <END> by DN variants . 
Tyrphostin AG-490 inhibits cytokine-mediated <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> <START:ggp> /STAT5a/b <END> signal transduction and cellular proliferation of antigen-activated human <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Janus kinase 3 ( JAK3 ) <END> is a <START:ggp> cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase <END> required for <START:ana> T cell <END> development and activated by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> that utilize the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor common gamma chain ( gamma ( c ) ) <END> . 
Genetic inactivation of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> is manifested as severe combined immunodeficiency disease ( SCID ) in humans and mice . 
These findings have suggested that <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> represents a pharmacological target to control certain lymphoid-derived diseases . 
Here we provide novel evidence that AG-490 potently inhibits the autokinase activity of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> and tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a and 5b ( STAT5a/b ) <END> . 
Similar inhibitory effects were observed with other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> that use <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> . 
AG-490 also inhibited <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -mediated proliferative growth in human <START:ana> T cells <END> with an IC50 ) = 25 microM that was partially recoverable . 
Moreover , we demonstrate that this inhibitor prevented tetanus toxoid antigen-specific T cell proliferation and expansion but failed to block activation of <START:ggp> Zap70 <END> or <START:ggp> p56Lck <END> after <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> stimulation of human <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Taken together , these findings suggest that AG-490 inhibits the <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> -mediated Type II signaling pathway but not the <START:ana> T cell <END> receptor-derived Type I pathway and possesses therapeutic potential for <START:ana> T cell <END> -derived pathologies such as graft-versus-host disease , allergy , and autoimmune disorders . 
<START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> in rheumatoid arthritis : correlation with inflammation , not disease specificity . 
Rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue was examined and compared with osteoarthritis tissue for the presence of the <START:ggp> nuclear transcription factor C/EBP beta ( NF-IL-6 ) <END> . 
The region ( lining or sublining ) , cell type , and subcellular distribution ( cytoplasmic or nuclear ) of the expression of <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> was characterized . 
Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid and blood and normal peripheral blood were also examined . 
<START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> was detected in the synovial lining and in <START:ana> sublining cells of synovial tissue <END> from patients with both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis . 
A significant ( P < 0.001 and < 0.05 , respectively ) increase in the percentage of cells with nuclear staining was seen in the lining layer , compared to cells in the sublining region , in rheumatoid and osteoarthritis . 
In both diseases a strong correlation ( r = 0.79 , P < 0.001 ) was observed between the percentage of cells in the synovial lining that were positive for <START:ggp> nuclear C/EBP beta <END> and lining cell depth . 
Two-color immunohistochemistry demonstrated that both <START:ana> macrophages <END> and <START:ana> fibroblast-like synoviocytes <END> were positive for nuclear <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> . 
The presence of <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis with isolated <START:ana> synovial fibroblasts <END> . 
Nuclear <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> was also detected in <START:ana> rheumatoid synovial fluid monocytes/macrophages , but not in lymphocytes or neutrophils <END> . 
Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> in these cells . 
The intensity of <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> staining was greater ( P < 0.001 ) in <START:ana> synovial fluid monocytes <END> than in those from <START:ana> normal or rheumatoid peripheral blood <END> . 
In conclusion , the enhanced nuclear staining for <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> in the synovial lining , compared to the sublining , suggesting activation in the lining , and the positive correlation of lining layer depth with the percentage of cells in the lining positive for nuclear <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> , suggest a potential role for <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> in chronic inflammation . 
The regulation of the production or activity of <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> , to inhibit inflammatory mediator expression by <START:ana> synovial macrophages <END> and <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> , offers a novel approach to therapeutic intervention . 
Direct interaction of <START:ggp> hematopoietic transcription factors PU.1 and GATA-1 <END> : functional antagonism in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> . 
Malignant transformation usually inhibits terminal cell differentiation but the precise mechanisms involved are not understood . 
<START:ggp> PU.1 <END> is a <START:ggp> hematopoietic-specific Ets family transcription factor <END> that is required for development of some <START:ana> lymphoid and myeloid lineages <END> . 
<START:ggp> PU.1 <END> can also act as an <START:ggp> oncoprotein <END> as activation of its expression in erythroid precursors by proviral insertion or transgenesis causes erythroleukemias in mice . 
Restoration of terminal differentiation in the <START:ana> mouse erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells <END> requires a decline in the level of <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , indicating that <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> can block erythroid differentiation . 
Here we investigate the mechanism by which <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> interferes with erythroid differentiation . 
We find that <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> interacts directly with <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , a <START:ggp> zinc finger transcription factor <END> required for erythroid differentiation . 
Interaction between <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> and <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> requires intact <START:ggp> DNA-binding domains <END> in both proteins . 
<START:ggp> PU.1 <END> represses <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> -mediated transcriptional activation . 
Both the <START:ggp> DNA binding <END> and <START:ggp> transactivation domains <END> of <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> are required for repression and both domains are also needed to block terminal differentiation in <START:ana> MEL cells <END> . 
We also show that ectopic expression of <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> in Xenopus embryos is sufficient to block erythropoiesis during normal development . 
Furthermore , introduction of exogenous <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> in both <START:ana> MEL cells <END> and Xenopus embryos and explants relieves the block to erythroid differentiation imposed by <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> . 
Our results indicate that the stoichiometry of directly interacting but opposing <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> may be a crucial determinant governing processes of normal differentiation and malignant transformation . 
<START:ggp> IL-12 <END> induces <START:ggp> IFN regulating factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) <END> gene expression in human <START:ana> NK <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-12 <END> is a <START:ggp> critical immunoregulatory cytokine <END> that promotes cell-mediated immune responses and the differentiation of naive <START:ana> CD4+ cells <END> to <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> ; however , relatively few <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> target genes have been identified . 
To better clarify the molecular basis of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> action , we set out to characterize genes up-regulated by <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , first by contrasting <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> -and <START:ggp> IFN-alpha-inducible genes <END> . 
We identified several genes up-regulated by <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , namely , <START:ggp> MIP-1alpha <END> , <START:ggp> MIP-1beta <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1RA <END> , and <START:ggp> IFN regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) <END> . 
<START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> is a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> regulated by <START:ggp> IFNs <END> that is also essential for <START:ana> Th1 <END> responses . 
We demonstrated that <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> directly up-regulates <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> to the same extent as <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> in normal human <START:ana> T cells <END> and in <START:ana> NK cells <END> . 
We showed that <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> had a direct effect on <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> , an effect not mediated indirectly by the induction of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> production . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> synergistically induced <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> , whereas <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> did not . 
The participation of <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> in the regulation of <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> was demonstrated in two ways . 
First , <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> was required for the <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> -dependent transactivation of an <START:ggp> IRF-1 reporter construct <END> , and second , <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> binding to the <START:ggp> IRF-1 promoter <END> was shown using EMSA . 
In contrast to <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , no up-regulation of <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> was found in <START:ana> IL-4-stimulated cells <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> did not block <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> -dependent up-regulation of <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> . 
Therefore , <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> may be an important contributor to <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> signaling , and we speculate that the defective <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> responses seen in <START:ggp> IRF <END> -1-/- mice might be attributable , in part , to the absence of this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
Targeted remodeling of human beta-globin promoter chromatin structure produces increased expression and decreased silencing . 
The chromatin structure of the <START:ggp> human beta-globin gene locus <END> assumes a transcriptionally-active conformation in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> . 
One feature of this chromatin reorganization is the formation of <START:ggp> DNase 1 hypersensitive sites <END> in the regions of <START:ggp> active globin gene promoters <END> . 
This reorganization requires the <START:ggp> globin locus control region <END> and is associated with normal expression of the <START:ggp> beta-like globin genes <END> . 
To determine whether it is possible to artificially enhance the opening of the chromatin structure of a <START:ggp> minimal beta-globin promoter <END> , we placed a 101bp , <START:ggp> erythroid-specific DNase 1 hypersensitive site-forming element <END> ( <START:ggp> HSFE <END> ) immediately upstream of the <START:ggp> beta-globin promoter and gene <END> . 
This element includes binding sites for <START:ggp> NF-E2 <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Sp-1 <END> . 
Constructs were stably transfected into <START:ana> murine erythroleukemia cells <END> and promoter chromatin structure and gene expression were analyzed . 
The <START:ggp> HSFE <END> induced an area of enhanced <START:ggp> DNase 1 <END> hypersensitivity extending from the transcriptional start site to -300bp of the <START:ggp> artificial promoter <END> and significantly increased the proportion of <START:ggp> beta-globin promoters <END> in an open chromatin configuration . 
This remodeling of promoter chromatin structure resulted in 3-fold increases in <START:ggp> beta-globin gene <END> transcription and induction , and inhibited long-term <START:ggp> beta-globin gene <END> silencing . 
These results indicate that a relatively small <START:ggp> cis-acting element <END> is able to enhance remodeling of promoter chromatin structure resulting in increased <START:ggp> beta-globin gene <END> expression . 
Regulation of low shear flow-induced <START:ana> HAEC <END> <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression and monocyte adhesion . 
We recently reported that prolonged exposure of <START:ana> human aortic endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> HAEC <END> ) to low shear stress flow patterns is associated with a sustained increase in the activated form of the transcriptional regulator <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) . 
Here we investigate the hypothesis that low shear-induced activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> is responsible for enhanced expression of <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) resulting in augmented endothelial cell-monocyte ( EC-Mn ) adhesion and that this activation is dependent on intracellular oxidant activity . 
Before exposure to low shear ( 2 dyn/cm2 ) for 6 h , <START:ana> HAEC <END> were preincubated with or without the antioxidants pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) or N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) . 
PDTC strongly inhibited low shear-induced activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , expression of <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> , and EC-Mn adhesion . 
Paradoxically , NAC exerted a positive effect on low shear-induced <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression and EC-Mn adhesion and only slightly downregulated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
However , cytokine-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression are blocked by both PDTC and NAC . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> plays a key role in low shear-induced <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression and that pathways mediating low shear- and cytokine-induced EC-Mn adhesion may be differentially regulated . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor-90 <END> of <START:ana> activated T-cells <END> : A <START:ana> double-stranded RNA <END> -binding protein and substrate for the <START:ggp> double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase <END> , <START:ggp> PKR <END> . 
NFAT transcription factors play a central role in initiating T-cell activation through the induction of immediate-early T-cell specific genes including interleukin-2 ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) . 
NFAT transcription factors bind to a sequence in the <START:ggp> IL-2 enhancer <END> known as the <START:ggp> antigen receptor response element 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> ARRE-2 <END> ) . 
Multiple proteins exhibiting <START:ggp> ARRE-2 <END> binding activity have been isolated , including a <START:ggp> heterodimer <END> from stimulated T-cell nuclear extracts consisting of Mr = 90 000 ( <START:ggp> NF90 <END> ) and Mr = 45 000 ( <START:ggp> NF45 <END> ) subunits . 
The subunits of this <START:ggp> heterodimer <END> have been cloned , and <START:ggp> NF90 <END> was found to encode a protein containing two domains that are predicted to form motifs capable of binding to <START:ana> double-stranded RNA <END> . 
Using in vitro translated polypeptides , we have demonstrated that <START:ggp> NF90 <END> specifically binds to <START:ana> double-stranded RNA <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> NF90 <END> was phosphorylated in a <START:ana> double-stranded RNA <END> -dependent manner likely by the interferon-induced , <START:ggp> double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase <END> , <START:ggp> PKR <END> . 
The <START:ggp> NF90 <END> protein was found to be expressed not only in <START:ana> T-cells <END> , but also in <START:ana> nonimmune HeLa cells <END> . 
In <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , the protein was almost exclusively localized to the ribosome salt wash fraction of cell lysates . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation is required for <START:ggp> C5a-induced interleukin-8 gene <END> expression in <START:ana> mononuclear cells <END> . 
C5a , a potent peptide chemoattractant , stimulates <START:ggp> interleukin-8 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> ) secretion from <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) . 
Experiments were conducted to understand the mechanisms for C5a-induced <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> production , which was 14-fold greater than that in <START:ana> unstimulated cells <END> by 2 hours . 
<START:ggp> IL-8 <END> secretion was accompanied by accumulation of <START:ana> IL-8 mRNA <END> in the cytosol and by nuclear expression of a <START:ggp> kappaB <END> DNA binding activity within 30 minutes . 
<START:ggp> AP-1 <END> but not <START:ggp> NF-IL-6 <END> DNA binding activity was also detected in <START:ana> C5a-stimulated PBMC <END> ; however , its delayed expression ( maximal at 4 hours ) suggested a less important role in the rapid production of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> . 
The correlation between C5a-induced <START:ggp> kappaB <END> binding activity and <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> gene expression was examined in the <START:ana> RAW264.7 macrophage cells <END> using reporter genes directed by the <START:ggp> kappaB sequence <END> from <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-8 promoter regions <END> . 
C5a-induced <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> expression was abolished by introducing mutations into the <START:ggp> kappaB sites <END> and by coexpression of a <START:ggp> dominant negative IkappaBalpha construct <END> resistant to agonist-induced phosphorylation . 
Pertussis toxin , which ADP-ribosylates the <START:ggp> Gi proteins <END> known to couple to the <START:ggp> C5a receptor <END> , produced minimal inhibition of C5a-induced <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> expression and had little effect on C5a-induced calcium mobilization in <START:ana> RAW264.7 cells <END> . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation is required for C5a-induced <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> gene expression and that this response is mediated primarily through a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway . 
Increased <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor beta <END> in <START:ana> airway cells <END> of glucocorticoid-insensitive asthma . 
Glucocorticoid ( GC ) -insensitive asthma is a challenging clinical problem that can be associated with life-threatening disease progression . 
The molecular basis of GC insensitivity is unknown . 
Alternative splicing of the <START:ana> GC receptor ( GCR ) pre-mRNA <END> generates a second <START:ggp> GCR <END> , termed <START:ggp> GCRbeta <END> , which does not bind GC but antagonizes the transactivating activity of the classic <START:ggp> GCR <END> . 
Thus increased expression of <START:ggp> GCRbeta <END> could account for glucocorticoid insensitivity . 
<START:ana> Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) cells <END> and peripheral blood <START:ana> mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) were examined for <START:ggp> GCRbeta <END> immunoreactivity using a <START:ggp> GCRbeta-specific antibody <END> by immunohistochemical staining . 
Cell localization of <START:ggp> GCRbeta <END> expression was performed using a double immunostaining technique . 
Patients with GC-insensitive asthma expressed a significantly higher number of <START:ana> GCRbeta-immunoreactive cells <END> in their BAL and peripheral blood than GC-sensitive asthmatics or normal control subjects . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> GCRbeta <END> expression in GC-insensitive asthma was particularly high in airway <START:ana> T cells <END> , which are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of asthma . 
We also examined the expression of <START:ggp> GCRbeta <END> in specimens from the airways of patients with chronic bronchitis . 
In chronic bronchitis , few cells were <START:ana> GCRbeta-positive <END> and their numbers did not differ significantly from normal control subjects . 
We conclude that GC-insensitive asthma is associated with increased expression of <START:ggp> GCRbeta <END> in airway <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> Janus kinase 3 <END> <START:ggp> -STAT5a <END> pathway after <START:ggp> CD40 <END> triggering of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> but not of <START:ana> resting B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> <START:ggp> /CD40 <END> ligand interactions play a key role in the immune responses of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> , <START:ana> monocytes <END> , and <START:ana> dendritic cells <END> . 
The signal transduction events triggered by cross-linking of the <START:ggp> CD40 receptor <END> have been widely studied in <START:ana> B cell lines <END> , but little is known about signaling following <START:ggp> CD40 <END> stimulation of <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> resting tonsillar B cells <END> . 
Therefore , we studied the <START:ggp> CD40 <END> pathway in highly purified <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> resting B cells <END> . 
After <START:ggp> CD40 <END> triggering , a similar activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ( but not of the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) <START:ggp> transcription factor complex <END> occurred in both cell preparations . 
However , the components of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB complexes <END> were different in <START:ana> monocytes <END> and B cells , because <START:ggp> p50 <END> is part of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB complex <END> induced by <START:ggp> CD40 <END> triggering in both <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> B cells <END> , whereas <START:ggp> p65 <END> was only induced in <START:ana> B cells <END> . In contrast , although the <START:ggp> Janus kinase 3 tyrosine kinase <END> was associated with <START:ggp> CD40 <END> molecules in both <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> resting B cells <END> , <START:ggp> Janus kinase 3 <END> phosphorylation induction was observed only in <START:ana> CD40-activated monocytes <END> , with subsequent induction of <START:ggp> STAT5a <END> DNA binding activity in the nucleus . 
These results suggest that the activation signals in <START:ana> human B cells <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> differ following <START:ggp> CD40 <END> stimulation . 
This observation is consistent with the detection of normal <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -induced monocyte activation in patients with <START:ggp> CD40 <END> ligand+ hyper <START:ggp> IgM <END> syndrome in whom a defect in <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -induced B cell activation has been reported . 
Genetic evidence for an additional factor required for <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> -induced signal transduction . 
<START:ggp> Erythropoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> EPO <END> ) and its receptor ( <START:ggp> EPOR <END> ) are required for the development of mature erythrocytes . 
After binding of ligand , the <START:ggp> EPOR <END> activates a variety of signaling pathways that ultimately control cellular proliferation , survival , and specific gene expression . 
Although <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> appear to be the principal <START:ana> EPO-responsive cell type <END> in vivo due to the restricted expression of the <START:ggp> EPOR <END> , many <START:ana> growth factor-dependent cell lines <END> expressing the <START:ggp> EPOR <END> can respond to <START:ggp> EPO <END> by activating many or all of these pathways . 
In the present study , we have identified a cellular context ( the <START:ana> interleukin-2 [ IL-2 ] -dependent HT-2 line <END> ) in which the <START:ggp> EPO <END> stimulation of the <START:ggp> EPOR <END> fails to support cellular proliferation , <START:ggp> STAT-5 <END> induction , or <START:ggp> MAPK <END> activation , despite efficient phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> EPOR <END> and <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> and inhibition of apoptosis after withdrawal of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
Interestingly , when we fused <START:ana> HT-2 cells <END> expressing the <START:ggp> EPOR <END> with <START:ana> Ba/F3 cells <END> in a complementation assay , the resulting <START:ana> hybridomas <END> proliferated and potently activated <START:ggp> STAT-5 <END> and <START:ggp> MAPK <END> in response to <START:ggp> EPO <END> . 
These data indicate that an <START:ggp> unidentified cellular factor <END> is needed to mediate signaling by the <START:ggp> EPOR <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ana> Ba/F3 cells <END> apparently express this factor ( s ) and somatic fusions can , therefore , confer <START:ggp> EPO <END> -responsiveness to <START:ana> HT-2 cells <END> that lack this factor . 
Novel therapies for inflammatory bowel disease . 
Looking back at successes and failures in newer approaches to treating IBD , it is tempting -- although still difficult -- to draw conclusions about pathogenesis . 
When a therapy proves effective , do clinicians truly know how it works ? Even with a therapy as specific as <START:ggp> anti-TNF antibody <END> , it is not clear if the benefit is attributable to simple binding and clearance of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> or to binding on the cell surface and subsequent deletion of the <START:ana> activated macrophage <END> . 
When a drug appears to be less effective than preclinical models suggest , can failures in effectiveness from delivery or dosing be differentiated ? The disappointing results of clinical trials with <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> -- so at odds with the prediction of benefit from animal models -- bring into question the validity of those models as well as the soundness of design of the clinical trials on which efficacy of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> is judged . 
The variability of response even to the most narrowly targeted agents suggests that these diseases are far more heterogeneous in humans than in their murine counterparts . 
Clinicians are only just beginning to recognize subclinical markers of response , and it may soon be possible to predict response on the basis of genetic composition . 
For the moment , however , the field of pharmacogenetics is embryonic . 
Challenges in developing new therapeutic strategies include not only identifying novel agents , but also improving the definitions of clinical endpoints and defining efficacy at the biologic level . 
Only through considered evaluation of clinical evidence may clinicians determine which therapies should remain novelties and which should become an accepted part of the armamentarium . 
Potent and stable attenuation of live-HIV-1 by gain of a <START:ggp> proteolysis-resistant inhibitor <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> IkappaB-alphaS32/36A <END> ) and the implications for vaccine development . 
Live-attenuated human immunodeficiency viruses ( HIVs ) are candidates for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) vaccine . 
Based on the simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) model for AIDS , loss-of-function ( e.g. deletion of accessory genes such as <START:ggp> nef <END> ) has been forwarded as a primary approach for creating enfeebled , but replication-competent , HIV-1/SIV . 
Regrettably , recent evidence suggests that loss-of-function alone is not always sufficient to prevent the emergence of virulent mutants . 
New strategies that attenuate via mechanisms distinct from loss-of-function are needed for enhancing the safety phenotype of <START:ggp> viral genome <END> . 
Here , we propose gain-of-function to be used simultaneously with loss-of-function as a novel approach for attenuating HIV-1 . 
We have constructed an <START:ggp> HIV-1 genome <END> carrying the <START:ggp> cDNA <END> of a <START:ggp> proteolysis-resistant nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitor <END> ( <START:ggp> IkappaB-alphaS32/36A <END> ) in the <START:ggp> nef region <END> . 
HIV-1 expressing <START:ggp> IkappaB-alphaS32/36A <END> down-regulates viral expression and is highly attenuated in both <START:ana> Jurkat <END> and <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
We provide formal proof that the phenotypic and attenuating characteristics of <START:ggp> IkappaB-alphaS32/36A <END> permit its stable maintenance in a live , replicating HIV-1 despite 180 days of forced ex vivo passaging in tissue culture . 
As compared with other <START:ggp> open-reading frames <END> embedded into <START:ggp> HIV/SIV genome <END> , this degree of stability is unprecedented . 
Thus , <START:ggp> IkappaB-alphaS32/36A <END> offers proof-of-principle that artifactually gained functions , when used to attenuate the replication of live HIV-1 , can be stable . 
These findings illustrate gain-of-function as a feasible strategy for developing safer live-attenuated HIVs to be tested as candidates for AIDS vaccine . 
Multiple <START:ggp> NF-ATc isoforms <END> with individual transcriptional properties are synthesized in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> that controls gene expression in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> embryonic cardiac cells <END> is expressed in three prominent isoforms . 
This is due to alternative splice/polyadenylation events that lead to the predominant synthesis of two long isoforms in <START:ana> naive T cells <END> and a shorter <START:ggp> NF-ATc isoform <END> in <START:ana> effector T cells <END> . 
Whereas the previously described <START:ggp> isoform NF-ATc/A <END> contains a relatively short <START:ggp> C terminus <END> , the longer isoforms , <START:ggp> B <END> and <START:ggp> C <END> , span extra C-terminal peptides of 128 and 246 aa , respectively . 
We show here that in addition to the <START:ggp> strong N-terminal trans-activation domain <END> , <START:ggp> TAD-A <END> , which is common to all three <START:ggp> NF-ATc isoforms <END> , <START:ggp> NF-ATc/C <END> contains a second <START:ggp> trans-activation domain <END> , <START:ggp> TAD-B <END> , in its C-terminal peptide . 
Various stimuli of <START:ana> T cells <END> that induce the activity of <START:ggp> TAD-A <END> also enhance the activity of <START:ggp> TAD-B <END> , but , unlike <START:ggp> TAD-A <END> , <START:ggp> TAD-B <END> remains unphosphorylated by protein from <START:ana> 12-O-tetradecanoyl 12-phorbol 13-acetate-stimulated T cells <END> . 
The shorter C-terminal peptide of isoform <START:ggp> NF-ATc/B <END> exerts a suppressive transcriptional effect . 
These properties of <START:ggp> NF-ATc/B and -C <END> might be of importance for gene regulation in <START:ana> naive T lymphocytes <END> in which <START:ggp> NF-ATc/B and -C <END> are predominantly synthesized . 
Selection and long-term persistence of reactive <START:ana> CTL clones <END> during an EBV chronic response are determined by avidity , <START:ggp> CD8 <END> variable contribution compensating for differences in <START:ggp> TCR <END> affinities . 
Recent studies have suggested that the diversity of <START:ggp> TCR <END> repertoire after primary immunization is conserved in <START:ana> memory T cells <END> and that a progressive narrowing of this repertoire may take place during recall infections . 
It now remains to be investigated which parameters determine the repertoire of the memory response and possibly restrict its diversity after subsequent antigenic challenges . 
To address this question , we took advantage of a panel of <START:ana> CD8+ T cell clones <END> from the joint of a rheumatoid arthritis patient and selected for their reactivity against a <START:ggp> single MHC/peptide complex <END> . 
Characterization of both <START:ggp> TCR chains <END> documented a great diversity among those clones and the persistence of clonotypes over a 2-yr period . 
Strikingly , despite the observed repertoire heterogeneity , all clones displayed a narrow range of <START:ggp> MHC <END> /peptide density requirements in cytotoxicity assays ( ED50 between 9 and 36 nM ) . 
<START:ggp> TCR <END> affinities were then indirectly estimated by blocking <START:ggp> CD8 <END> interaction with an <START:ggp> anti-CD8 mAb <END> . 
We found a wide range of <START:ggp> TCR <END> affinities among the different clonotypes that segregated with Vbeta usage . 
We thus propose that during an in vivo chronic response , a narrow range of avidity of the <START:ggp> TCR-CD8 complex <END> conditions long-term clonotype persistence , and that the level of <START:ggp> CD8 <END> contribution is adjusted to keep clonotypes with variable <START:ggp> TCR <END> affinities within this avidity window . 
Nuclear localization and formation of <START:ggp> beta-catenin-lymphoid enhancer factor 1 complexes <END> are not sufficient for activation of gene expression . 
In response to activation of the Wnt signaling pathway , <START:ggp> beta-catenin <END> accumulates in the nucleus , where it cooperates with <START:ggp> LEF/TCF <END> ( for <START:ggp> lymphoid enhancer factor and T-cell factor <END> ) <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> to activate gene expression . 
The mechanisms by which <START:ggp> beta-catenin <END> undergoes this shift in location and participates in activation of gene transcription are unknown . 
We demonstrate here that <START:ggp> beta-catenin <END> can be imported into the nucleus independently of <START:ggp> LEF/TCF <END> binding , and it may also be exported from nuclei . 
We have introduced a small deletion within <START:ggp> beta-catenin <END> ( <START:ggp> Delta19 <END> ) that disrupts binding to <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> , <START:ggp> E-cadherin <END> , and <START:ggp> APC <END> but not <START:ggp> axin <END> . 
This <START:ggp> Delta19 beta-catenin mutant <END> localizes to the nucleus because it may not be efficiently sequestered in the cytoplasm . 
The nuclear localization of <START:ggp> Delta19 <END> definitively demonstrates that the mechanisms by which <START:ggp> beta-catenin <END> localizes in the nucleus are completely independent of <START:ggp> LEF/TCF factors <END> . 
<START:ggp> beta-Catenin <END> and <START:ggp> LEF-1 complexes <END> can activate reporter gene expression in a <START:ana> transformed T-lymphocyte cell line <END> ( <START:ana> Jurkat <END> ) but not in <START:ana> normal T lymphocytes <END> , even though both factors are nuclear . 
Thus , localization of both factors to the nucleus is not sufficient for activation of gene expression . 
Excess <START:ggp> beta-catenin <END> can squelch reporter gene activation by <START:ggp> LEF-1-beta-catenin complexes <END> but not activation by the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> VP16 <END> . 
Taken together , these data suggest that a third component is necessary for gene activation and that this third component may vary with cell type . 
Control of lymphocyte development by the <START:ggp> Ikaros gene family <END> . 
Lymphoid cell differentiation relies on precisely orchestrated gene activation and repression events . 
Gene targeting studies have demonstrated crucial roles for the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> and <START:ggp> Aiolos <END> in regulating multiple stages of B and T cell development . 
Recent experiments suggest that <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> and <START:ggp> Aiolos <END> set B cell antigen-receptor ( BCR ) - and TCR-mediated signaling thresholds and that the molecules exist within <START:ana> T cells <END> in <START:ggp> nuclear complexes <END> that contain nucleosome remodeling and <START:ggp> histone deacetylase <END> activities . 
Transcriptional targeting of retroviral vectors to the <START:ana> erythroblastic progeny <END> of <START:ana> transduced hematopoietic stem cells <END> . 
Targeted expression to specific tissues or cell lineages is a necessary feature of a gene therapy vector for many clinical applications , such as correction of hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias by transplantation of <START:ana> genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells <END> . 
We developed retroviral vectors in which the <START:ggp> constitutive viral enhancer <END> in the <START:ggp> U3 region <END> of the <START:ggp> 3 ' LTR <END> is replaced by an <START:ggp> autoregulatory enhancer <END> of the <START:ggp> erythroid-specific GATA-1 transcription factor gene <END> . 
The <START:ggp> replaced enhancer <END> is propagated to the <START:ggp> 5 ' LTR <END> upon integration into the <START:ggp> target cell genome <END> . 
The modified vectors were used to transduce <START:ana> human hematopoietic cell lines <END> , <START:ana> cord blood-derived CD34 ( + ) stem/progenitor cells <END> , and <START:ana> murine bone marrow repopulating stem cells <END> . 
The expression of appropriate <START:ggp> reporter genes <END> ( <START:ggp> triangle upLNGFR <END> , <START:ggp> EGFP <END> ) was analyzed in the differentiated progeny of <START:ana> transduced stem cells <END> in vitro , in liquid culture as well as in clonogenic assay , and in vivo , after bone marrow transplantation in lethally irradiated mice . 
The <START:ggp> GATA-1 autoregulatory enhancer <END> effectively restricts the expression of the <START:ggp> LTR-driven proviral transcription unit <END> to the <START:ana> erythroblastic progeny <END> of both <START:ana> human progenitors <END> and <START:ana> mouse-repopulating stem cells <END> . 
Packaging of viral particles , integration into the target genome , and stability of the integrated provirus are not affected by the <START:ggp> LTR <END> modification . 
Enhancer replacement is therefore an effective strategy to target expression of a <START:ggp> retroviral transgene <END> to a specific progeny of <START:ana> transduced hematopoietic stem cells <END> . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> Fas ligand <END> expression and cell death by <START:ggp> apoptosis-linked gene 4 <END> . 
Programmed cell death is a process required for the normal development of an organism . 
One of the best understood apoptotic pathways occurs in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> and is mediated by <START:ggp> Fas <END> <START:ggp> /Fas ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> FasL <END> ) interaction . 
During studies of apoptosis induced by T cell-receptor engagement , we identified <START:ggp> ALG-4F <END> , a <START:ggp> truncated transcript <END> that prevents T cell-receptor-induced <START:ggp> FasL <END> upregulation and cell death . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> full-length ALG-4 <END> induced transcription of <START:ggp> FasL <END> and , consequently , apoptosis . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> ALG-4 <END> is necessary and sufficient for <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression . 
Fas/ <START:ggp> FasL <END> interaction initiates cell death in many other systems , and its dysregulation is a mechanism by which several pathologic conditions arise . 
Understanding the molecular mechanisms of <START:ggp> FasL <END> regulation could be very useful in elucidating how these diseases develop and in identifying potential therapeutic targets . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 <END> engages the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated proteins <END> <START:ggp> TRADD <END> and <START:ggp> receptor-interacting protein <END> ( <START:ggp> RIP <END> ) but does not induce apoptosis or require <START:ggp> RIP <END> for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
A site in the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) transforming protein <END> <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> that constitutively associates with the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 ( TNFR1 ) -associated death domain protein <END> <START:ggp> TRADD <END> to mediate <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> c-Jun N-terminal kinase <END> activation is critical for long-term lymphoblastoid cell proliferation . 
We now find that <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> signaling through <START:ggp> TRADD <END> differs from <START:ggp> TNFR1 <END> signaling through <START:ggp> TRADD <END> . 
<START:ggp> LMP1 <END> needs only 11 amino acids to activate <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> or synergize with <START:ggp> TRADD <END> in <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation , while <START:ggp> TNFR1 <END> requires approximately 70 residues . 
Further , <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> does not require <START:ggp> TRADD <END> residues 294 to 312 for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation , while <START:ggp> TNFR1 <END> requires <START:ggp> TRADD <END> residues 296 to 302 . 
<START:ggp> LMP1 <END> is partially blocked for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation by a <START:ggp> TRADD <END> mutant consisting of <START:ggp> residues 122 to 293 <END> . 
Unlike <START:ggp> TNFR1 <END> , <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> can interact directly with <START:ggp> receptor-interacting protein <END> ( <START:ggp> RIP <END> ) and stably associates with <START:ggp> RIP <END> in <START:ana> EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> . 
Surprisingly , <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> does not require <START:ggp> RIP <END> for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
Despite constitutive association with <START:ggp> TRADD <END> or <START:ggp> RIP <END> , <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> does not induce apoptosis in <START:ana> EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma or human embryonic kidney 293 cells <END> . 
These results add a different perspective to the molecular interactions through which <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> , <START:ggp> TRADD <END> , and <START:ggp> RIP <END> participate in B-lymphocyte activation and growth . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity in human T lymphocytes induces caspase-dependent apoptosis without detectable activation of <START:ggp> caspase-1 and -3 <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is involved in the transcriptional control of <START:ggp> various genes <END> that act as extrinsic and intrinsic survival factors for <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Our findings show that suppression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity with cell-permeable SN50 peptide , which masks the nuclear localization sequence of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 dimers <END> and prevents their nuclear localization , induces apoptosis in <START:ana> resting normal human PBL <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> resulted in the externalization of phosphatidylserine , induction of DNA breaks , and morphological changes consistent with apoptosis . 
DNA fragmentation was efficiently blocked by the <START:ggp> caspase inhibitor <END> <START:ggp> Z-VAD-fmk <END> and partially blocked by <START:ggp> Ac-DEVD-fmk <END> , suggesting that SN50-mediated apoptosis is <START:ggp> caspase <END> -dependent . 
Interestingly , apoptosis induced by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> suppression , in contrast to that induced by TPEN ( N , N , N ' , N'-tetrakis [ 2-pyridylmethyl ] ethylenediamine ) or <START:ggp> soluble Fas ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> CD95 <END> ) , was observed in the absence of <START:ggp> active death effector proteases <END> <START:ggp> caspase-1 <END> -like ( <START:ggp> IL-1 converting enzyme <END> ) , <START:ggp> caspase-3 <END> -like ( <START:ggp> CPP32/Yama/apopain <END> ) , and <START:ggp> caspase-6 <END> -like and without cleavage of <START:ggp> caspase-3 substrates <END> <START:ggp> poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase <END> and <START:ggp> DNA fragmentation factor-45 <END> . 
These findings suggest either low level of activation is required or that different <START:ggp> caspases <END> are involved . 
Preactivation of <START:ana> T cells <END> resulting in <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> nuclear translocation protected cells from SN50-induced apoptosis . 
Our findings demonstrate an essential role of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in survival of <START:ana> naive PBL <END> . 
Signal transduction pathways in <START:ana> normal human monocytes <END> stimulated by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and mediators : comparative study with <START:ana> normal human neutrophils <END> or <START:ana> transformed cells <END> and the putative roles in functionality and cell biology . 
<START:ggp> Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) and <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -3 <END> induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> 92-kDa protein <END> in <START:ana> normal human monocytes <END> . 
We identified this <START:ggp> 92-kDa protein <END> as <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> , but not as <START:ggp> STATs1 , 3 , and 6 <END> nor <START:ggp> c-fes <END> and <START:ggp> vav protooncogene products <END> , and demonstrated its translocation to the nucleus , enhancement of specific DNA binding capacity , and potentiation of trancriptional activity by <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> . 
N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine ( FMLP ) and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> 42- and 44-kDa proteins <END> , which were identified as <START:ggp> extracellular signal-regulated kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> ERK <END> ) , in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
In marked contrast to <START:ana> neutrophils <END> and <START:ana> MO7e cells <END> , <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of <START:ggp> ERK <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Among <START:ggp> upstream signaling molecules <END> of <START:ggp> ERK <END> , <START:ggp> Shc <END> was constitutively associated with Grb2 and was not tyrosine-phosphorylated by <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> and FMLP , and <START:ggp> Sos1 <END> and <START:ggp> c-Raf-1 <END> were not phosphorylated by <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> , IL-3 , TNF , and FMLP in <START:ana> monocytes <END> , whereas all these signaling molecules were affected and/or utilized by <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> in <START:ana> MO7e cells <END> . 
In contrast to <START:ana> neutrophils <END> , <START:ggp> p38 <END> was constitutively phosphorylated and agonist-dependent phosphorylation and activation was not detected in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Superoxide release stimulated by FMLP was inhibited partially by PD98059 or SB203580 , a specific inhibitor of ERK or p38 pathway , and was almost completely inhibited by the combination of both inhibitors , whereas PMA-induced superoxide release was resistant to these two inhibitors in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
PD98059 inhibited <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> -dependent proliferation of <START:ana> MO7e cells <END> . 
Present results indicate trancriptional roles of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> and functional roles of <START:ggp> ERK <END> and/or <START:ggp> p38 <END> in <START:ana> normal human monocytes <END> stimulated by physiological receptor-mediated agonists <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> and FMLP . 
Possible roles of <START:ggp> ERK <END> in proliferation of <START:ana> transformed cells <END> were also suggested . 
<START:ggp> Aiolos <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> controls cell death in <START:ana> T cells <END> by regulating <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> expression and its cellular localization . 
We searched for proteins that interact with <START:ggp> Ras <END> in <START:ana> interleukin ( IL ) -2-stimulated or IL-2-deprived cells <END> , and found that the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Aiolos <END> interacts with <START:ggp> Ras <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Ras <END> <START:ggp> -Aiolos <END> interaction was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation . 
Indirect immunofluorescence shows that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> controls the cellular distribution of <START:ggp> Aiolos <END> and induces its tyrosine phosphorylation , required for dissociation from <START:ggp> Ras <END> . 
We also identified functional <START:ggp> Aiolos-binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> Bcl-2 promoter <END> , which are able to activate the <START:ggp> luciferase reporter gene <END> . 
Mutation of <START:ggp> Aiolos-binding sites <END> within the <START:ggp> Bcl-2 promoter <END> inhibits transactivation of the <START:ggp> reporter gene luciferase <END> , suggesting direct control of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> expression by <START:ggp> Aiolos <END> . 
Co-transfection experiments confirm that <START:ggp> Aiolos <END> induces <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> expression and prevents apoptosis in <START:ana> IL-2-deprived cells <END> . 
We propose a model for the regulation of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> expression via <START:ggp> Aiolos <END> . 
Binding of <START:ggp> YY1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct1 <END> to a novel element that downregulates expression of <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> in human <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
BACKGROUND : <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> controls development of eosinophilia and has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases . 
In both atopic and nonatopic asthma , elevated <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> has been detected in peripheral blood and the airways . 
<START:ggp> IL-5 <END> is produced mainly by activated <START:ana> T cells <END> , and its expression is regulated at the transcriptional level . 
OBJECTIVE : This study focuses on the functional analysis of the <START:ggp> human IL-5 ( hIL-5 ) promoter <END> and characterization of cis -regulatory elements and transcription factors involved in the suppression of <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> transcription in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
METHODS : Methods used in this study include <START:ggp> DNase I <END> footprint assays , electrophoretic mobility shift assays , and functional analysis by mammalian cell transfection involving deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis . 
RESULTS : We identified 5 <START:ggp> protein binding regions <END> ( <START:ggp> BRs <END> ) located within the <START:ggp> proximal hIL-5 promoter <END> . 
Functional analysis indicates that the <START:ggp> BRs <END> are involved in control of <START:ggp> hIL-5 promoter <END> activity . 
Two of these regions , <START:ggp> BR3 <END> and <START:ggp> BR4 <END> located at positions -102 to -73 , have not previously been described as regulators of <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
We show that the <START:ggp> BR3 <END> sequence contains a novel <START:ggp> negative regulatory element <END> located at positions -90 to -79 of the <START:ggp> hIL-5 promoter <END> , which binds <START:ggp> Oct1 <END> , <START:ggp> octamer-like <END> , and <START:ggp> YY1 nuclear factors <END> . 
Substitution mutations , which abolished binding of these proteins to the <START:ggp> BR3 sequence <END> , significantly increased <START:ggp> hIL-5 promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
CONCLUSION : We suggest that <START:ggp> Oct1 <END> , <START:ggp> YY1 <END> , and <START:ggp> octamer-like factors <END> binding to the <START:ggp> -90/-79 sequence <END> within the <START:ggp> proximal IL-5 promoter <END> are involved in suppression of <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> transcription in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
New immunosuppressive drug PNU156804 blocks <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -dependent proliferation and NF-kappa B and AP-1 activation . 
We had previously shown that the drug undecylprodigiosin ( UP ) blocks <START:ana> human lymphocyte <END> proliferation in vitro . 
We have now investigated the mechanism of action of a new analogue of UP , PNU156804 , which shows a more favorable activity profile than UP in mice . 
We demonstrate here that the biological effect of PNU156804 in vitro is indistinguishable from UP : PNU156804 blocks <START:ana> human T cell <END> proliferation in mid-late G1 , as determined by cell cycle analysis , expression of <START:ggp> cyclins <END> , and <START:ggp> cyclin-dependent kinases <END> and retinoblastoma phosphorylation . 
In addition , we show that PNU156804 does not block significantly the induction of either <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha- and gamma-chains <END> but inhibits <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -dependent T cell proliferation . 
We have investigated several molecular pathways that are known to be activated by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
We show that PNU156804 does not inhibit c-myc and bcl-2 mRNA induction . 
On the other hand , PNU156804 efficiently inhibits the activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> transcription factors . 
PNU156804 inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation is due to the inhibition of the degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B-beta <END> . 
PNU156804 action is restricted to some signaling pathways ; it does not affect <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation by PMA in <START:ana> T cells <END> but blocks that induced by <START:ggp> CD40 <END> cross-linking in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
We conclude that the prodigiosin family of immunosuppressants is a new family of molecules that show a novel target specificity clearly distinct from that of other immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A , FK506 , and rapamycin . 
<START:ggp> Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein <END> induces the expression of <START:ggp> STAT1 and STAT5 genes <END> in <START:ana> T-cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax <END> transforms normal <START:ana> T-cells <END> in the presence of <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2 <END> in vitro . 
<START:ggp> STAT <END> is a family of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that play a pivotal role in cytokine-induced functions of a various type of cells . 
We investigated the involvement of <START:ggp> STATs <END> in the transformation of <START:ana> T-cells <END> by HTLV-1 . 
<START:ana> HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines <END> expressed higher amounts of <START:ana> STAT1 , STAT3 and STAT5 RNA <END> and proteins than <START:ana> virus-negative T cells <END> . 
The expression of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> in a <START:ana> human T-cell line <END> was induced by <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induced the DNA binding activity of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> of a HTLV-1-transformed cell line and then stimulated its proliferation . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> did neither in a cell line lacking <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> . 
The expression of <START:ana> STAT1 , STAT3 and STAT5 mRNAs <END> were also induced by a <START:ggp> T-cell mitogen <END> in normal <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
Our results suggest that the induction of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> by <START:ggp> Tax <END> enhances <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -induced functions of virus-infected <START:ana> T-cells <END> , hence the induction may play a role in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -dependent transformation steps of <START:ana> T-cells <END> by HTLV-1 . 
Transcriptional control of the <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> gene by <START:ana> human helper T cells <END> : <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> synthesis is regulated independently from <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> synthesis . 
BACKGROUND : <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> is fundamentally involved in eosinophilic inflammation . 
Control of <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> production may be effective for the management of allergic diseases . 
OBJECTIVE : We aimed to find the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate the <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> gene to selectively control <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> synthesis . 
METHODS : <START:ana> Allergen-specific T-cell clones <END> and <START:ana> T-cell hybridomas <END> were established from the <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> of patients with asthma , and the transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> IL-5 gene <END> was investigated with transient transfection and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis . 
RESULTS : A human <START:ggp> IL-5 promoter/enhancer-luciferase gene construct <END> , <START:ggp> pIL-5 ( -511 ) Luc <END> , was transcribed on activation of <START:ana> IL-5-producing T-cell clones <END> , but not <START:ana> IL-5-nonproducing clones <END> . 
<START:ggp> pIL-5 ( -511 ) Luc <END> was transcribed by <START:ana> T-cell hybridomas <END> derived from fusion between <START:ana> IL-5-producing T-cell clones <END> and an <START:ana> IL-5 gene-nonexpressing T-cell line <END> , but not by <START:ana> hybridomas <END> derived from <START:ana> IL-5-nonproducing T-cell clones <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-5 <END> synthesis was not only induced by T-cell receptor stimulation but also by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> receptor stimulation . 
Binding of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> was induced by <START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TcR <END> ) stimulation , although there was no significant upregulation of binding by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> stimulation . 
CONCLUSION : <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> synthesis by <START:ana> human helper T cells <END> is regulated at the transcriptional level . 
A unique transcriptional mechanism distinct from those regulating the <START:ggp> IL-2 or IL-4 genes <END> seems to control the <START:ggp> IL-5 gene <END> . 
Selective regulation of <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> gene transcription may be useful for treating eosinophlic inflammation . 
Defining therapeutic targets by using adenovirus : blocking <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> inhibits both inflammatory and destructive mechanisms in rheumatoid synovium but spares <START:ggp> anti-inflammatory mediators <END> . 
The role of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis has long been a subject of controversy . 
We used an adenoviral technique of blocking <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> through overexpression of the <START:ggp> inhibitory subunit <END> <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> , which has the advantage that it can be used in the diseased tissue itself , with > 90 % of the <START:ana> synovial macrophages <END> , <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> , and <START:ana> T cells <END> infected . 
We found that the spontaneous production of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> and other <START:ggp> pro-inflammatory cytokines <END> is <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent in rheumatoid synovial tissue , in contrast to the main <START:ggp> anti-inflammatory mediators <END> , like <START:ggp> IL-10 and -11 <END> , and the <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor antagonist <END> . 
Of even more interest , <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> overexpression inhibited the production of <START:ggp> matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3 <END> while not affecting their tissue inhibitor . 
Blocking <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in the rheumatoid joint thus has a very beneficial profile , reducing both the inflammatory response and the tissue destruction . 
The adenoviral technique described here has widespread applicability , allowing rapid testing of the effects of blocking a potential therapeutic target in either cultures of <START:ana> normal cells <END> or in the diseased tissue itself . 
Resistance to <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> induced apoptosis in vitro correlates with high metastatic capacity of cells in vivo . 
<START:ggp> TNF <END> is one of the <START:ggp> cytokines <END> secreted by the cells of the immune system . 
Our data demonstrate that those <START:ana> cell lines <END> lacking capability to form metastatic tumors in vivo are susceptible to <START:ggp> TNF <END> induced apoptosis in vitro . 
However , <START:ana> cell lines <END> with high metastatic potential are resistant to <START:ggp> TNF <END> in vitro . 
Furthermore , the same <START:ana> cell lines <END> were resistant to cytolytic action of other <START:ggp> cytotoxic proteins <END> secreted by <START:ana> LAK cells <END> . 
Our data showed that <START:ggp> TNF <END> resistance in vitro correlates with the increased level of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
This finding may provide a tool to improve current protocols of immunotherapy and insights to how <START:ana> tumor cells <END> are or are not killed by <START:ana> LAK cells <END> . 
Clonality analysis of <START:ana> granulocytes <END> and <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> in healthy females by the PCR-based <START:ggp> HUMARA <END> method . 
Clonality analysis utilizing <START:ggp> X-chromosome <END> inactivation has been used in the study of various diseases , including hematological malignancies . 
The <START:ggp> human androgen receptor gene <END> ( <START:ggp> HUMARA <END> ) assay is the newest of such methods , and the majority of the female population can be assessed by this relatively simple procedure . 
One problem in using these clonality analysis methods , however , is that there may be significant variation in Lyonization in <START:ana> blood cells <END> in normal individuals . 
To determine the diversity in <START:ggp> X-chromosome <END> methylation patterns , which reflect Lyonization , assessed by the <START:ggp> HUMARA <END> assay in the supposedly normal population , we analyzed <START:ana> granulocytes <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> from 97 relatively young ( 18- to 35-year-old ) healthy female volunteers . 
We found that the methylation patterns in the two <START:ggp> HUMARA alleles <END> were distributed even more widely , both in <START:ana> granuloctyes <END> and in <START:ana> T cells <END> , than previously reported with other methods . 
We also found that the deviation of methylation in <START:ana> granulocytes <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> was well correlated . 
Thus , we conclude that appropriate controls from the same individuals , such as <START:ana> T cells <END> in the case of stem cell disorders , should always be employed to conclusively determine whether certain cells of hematopoietic origin are clonal . 
Functional B-cell response in intrahepatic lymphoid follicles in chronic hepatitis C . 
Intrahepatic lymphoid follicle ( ILF ) formation is one of the most characteristic and commonly observed histological features in patients with chronic hepatitis C . 
However , little is known regarding whether follicles in the liver belong to functional lymphoid tissues , where B cells are activated , differentiated , and proliferated , or if the lymphocytes are merely infiltrated after recruitment from the secondary lymphoid organs . 
To ascertain this possibility , we examined the expression of markers for B-cell activation , differentiation , and proliferation in ILFs in patients with chronic hepatitis C using surgically resected specimens , and compared them with specimens of perihepatic lymph nodes by an immunohistochemical technique . 
Germinal center ( GC ) formation in the ILFs was frequently found in HCV-positive cases . 
The distribution of immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) - , IgD- , and IgG-positive cells and the expression patterns of Ki-67 , CD23 , or bcl-2 and bcl-6 gene products in the follicles with GC formation in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis C were similar to those of lymph nodes , indicating that <START:ana> B cells <END> are activated , proliferated , and differentiated in the ILFs with GC formation in patients with chronic hepatitis C . 
Oligoclonal expansion of <START:ana> B cells <END> in the livers with ILFs was confirmed by an analysis of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) gene <END> rearrangement determined by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . 
These data strongly suggest that ILFs with GC formation , which are frequently found in patients with chronic hepatitis C , may functionally be the same as those found in lymph nodes with respect to B-cell expansion and maturation . 
Downregulation of <START:ggp> Wilms ' tumor gene <END> ( <START:ggp> WT1 <END> ) is not a prerequisite for erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation of the <START:ana> leukemic cell line K562 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Wilms ' tumor gene <END> ( <START:ggp> WT1 <END> ) encodes a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> of the <START:ggp> zinc finger type <END> . 
A high expression of <START:ggp> WT1 <END> has been detected in a range of acute leukemias , and <START:ggp> WT1 <END> is downregulated during induced differentiation of some <START:ana> leukemic cell lines <END> . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> WT1 <END> in some <START:ana> myeloid cell lines <END> confers resistance to differentiation induction . 
These observations suggest that a high <START:ggp> WT1 <END> expression in <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> is incompatible with differentiation . 
In this study , each of the four different isoforms of <START:ggp> WT1 <END> was constitutively overexpressed in the <START:ana> leukemic cell line K562 <END> . 
<START:ana> K562 cells <END> express endogenous <START:ggp> WT1 <END> , which is downregulated as a response to induced differentiation along the erythroid and megakaryocytic pathways . 
We now demonstrate that a forced exogenous expression of the four different isoforms of <START:ggp> WT1 <END> in <START:ana> K562 <END> does not affect the differentiation response , as judged by accumulation of <START:ggp> hemoglobin <END> in response to <START:ggp> hemin <END> or the expression of <START:ggp> megakaryocytic cell surface markers <END> in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) . 
We conclude that downregulation of <START:ggp> WT1 <END> during induced differentiation of <START:ana> K562 cells <END> is not a prerequisite for erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation of these cells . 
Association of the <START:ggp> interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain <END> with p47phox , an activator of the <START:ggp> phagocyte NADPH oxidase <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin ( IL ) -4 <END> plays an important role in <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis in <START:ana> B cells <END> and in Th2 differentiation in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> conducts its biological activities through binding to the <START:ggp> IL-4 receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4R <END> ) on the surface of <START:ana> target cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4R <END> are thought to be composed of the <START:ggp> IL-4R alpha chain <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4R alpha <END> ) and either the <START:ggp> IL-2R gamma chain <END> or the <START:ggp> IL-13R alpha chain <END> . 
We have previously shown that the <START:ggp> membrane-proximal portion <END> in the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> of the <START:ggp> human IL-4R alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> hIL-4R alpha <END> ) is critical for proliferation , generation of germline epsilon transcript , and activation of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> , based on analyses of <START:ggp> truncated hIL-4R alphas <END> . 
In this study , we found that p47phox , an activator of the <START:ggp> phagocyte NADPH oxidase <END> , binds to this portion by the two-hybrid system . 
Furthermore , we observed the association of p47phox with the <START:ggp> hIL-4R alpha <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> derived from a normal donor . 
These results suggest that p47phox is involved in the signal transduction of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
However , activation of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> , <START:ggp> CD23 <END> expression , and <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis induced by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> were not affected in p47phox-deficient patients , which raises the possibility that p47phox may be important in other signaling activities as well in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Effects of diesel organic extracts on <START:ggp> chemokine <END> production by <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
BACKGROUND : Polyaromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) associated with diesel exhaust particles ( DEPs ) are found in the atmospheric urban pollution . 
Such compounds have been shown to favor <START:ggp> IgE <END> production , bronchial hyperresponsiveness , and airway inflammation . 
Chemokines are a group of <START:ggp> chemotactic cytokines <END> involved in the recruitment of <START:ana> inflammatory cells <END> . 
OBJECTIVE : We investigated the effect of DEP-PAHs on the release and <START:ana> mRNA <END> expression of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> RANTES <END> by <START:ana> PBMCs <END> obtained from healthy subjects . 
METHODS : Protein production in supernatants was assessed by ELISA , and <START:ana> mRNA <END> expression was evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR . 
RESULTS : Secretion of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> and <START:ggp> RANTES <END> increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of DEP-PAHs ( range , 0.5 ng to 50 ng/mL ) . 
On the contrary , the release of <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> was significantly inhibited , also in a dose-dependent manner . 
<START:ana> Messenger RNA <END> production coding for <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , <START:ggp> RANTES <END> , and <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> showed parallel variations to the production of the <START:ggp> correspondent proteins <END> . 
Effects of DEP-PAHs became significant at 7 hours and up to 48 hours time culture for <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> , and up to 24 hours time culture for <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> and <START:ggp> RANTES <END> . 
Moreover , supernatants from <START:ana> DEP-PAH-activated cells <END> , compared with those of controls , exhibited a significantly enhanced chemotactic activity for <START:ana> neutrophils <END> and <START:ana> eosinophils <END> , which was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with <START:ggp> anti-IL-8 <END> and <START:ggp> anti-RANTES <END> neutralizing antibodies , respectively . 
CONCLUSION : These findings suggest that the <START:ggp> chemokine <END> pathways are modulated by DEP-PAHs at the transcriptional level , reinforcing the idea that the development of inflammatory reactions might be affected by diesel exhaust emission . 
20-Epi analogues of 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 are highly potent inducers of <START:ggp> DRIP coactivator complex <END> binding to the <START:ggp> vitamin D3 receptor <END> . 
1 , 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) plays a major role in the stimulation of bone growth , mineralization , and intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption ; it also acts as a general inhibitor of cellular proliferation . 
Several new , clinically relevant compounds dissociate antiproliferative and calcemic activities of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 , but the molecular basis for this has not been clearly elucidated . 
Here , we tested whether the potency of one class of compounds , 20-epi analogues , to induce myeloid cell differentiation , is because of direct molecular effects on <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) . 
We report that two 20-epi analogues , MC1627 and MC1288 , induced differentiation and transcription of <START:ggp> p21 <END> ( <START:ggp> Waf1 <END> , <START:ggp> Cip1 <END> ) , a key <START:ggp> VDR target gene <END> involved in growth inhibition , at a concentration 100-fold lower than that of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . 
We compared this sensitivity to analogue effects on <START:ggp> VDR <END> interacting proteins : <START:ggp> RXR <END> , <START:ggp> GRIP-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> DRIP205 <END> , a subunit of the <START:ggp> DRIP coactivator complex <END> . 
Compared with the interaction of <START:ggp> VDR <END> with <START:ggp> RXR <END> or <START:ggp> GRIP-1 <END> , the differentiation dose-response most closely correlated to the ligand-dependent recruitment of the <START:ggp> DRIP coactivator complex <END> to <START:ggp> VDR <END> and to the ability of the receptor to activate transcription in a cell-free system . 
These results provide compelling links between the efficiency of the 20-epi analogue in inducing <START:ggp> VDR <END> /DRIP interactions , transactivation in vitro , and its enhanced ability to induce cellular differentiation . 
<START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> and <START:ggp> Vav <END> function in separate , but overlapping pathways to augment <START:ggp> interleukin-2 promoter <END> activity . 
<START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> and <START:ggp> Vav <END> , two <START:ggp> hematopoietic cell specific molecules <END> , are critical for T cell development and activation . 
Following <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> stimulation , <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> and <START:ggp> Vav <END> both undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and associate with each other via the SH2 domain of <START:ggp> Vav <END> and phosphorylated tyrosines of <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> and <START:ggp> Vav <END> have a synergistic effect on <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2 promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
In this report , we show that two tyrosines , Tyr-113 and Tyr-128 , of <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> are required for its binding to <START:ggp> Vav <END> , both in vitro and in <START:ana> intact cells <END> . 
Surprisingly , we find also that the interaction between <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> and <START:ggp> Vav <END> is not required for their cooperation in augmenting <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activity , as the two molecules appear to function in different signaling pathways upstream of <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> expression . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> in the <START:ana> Jurkat T cell line <END> potentiates the activities of both <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 transcription factors <END> . 
In contrast , overexpression of <START:ggp> Vav <END> leads to enhanced <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> activity without affecting <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
Additionally , overexpression of <START:ggp> Vav <END> , but not <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> , augments CD28-induced <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activity . 
These findings suggest that the synergy between <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> and <START:ggp> Vav <END> in regulating <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> expression reflects the cooperation between different signaling pathways . 
<START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappaB <END> can trigger the Notch signaling pathway by inducing the expression of <START:ggp> Jagged1 <END> , a ligand for <START:ggp> Notch receptors <END> . 
<START:ggp> Jagged1 <END> belongs to the <START:ggp> DSL family of ligands <END> for <START:ggp> Notch receptors <END> that control the proliferation and differentiation of various <START:ana> cell lineages <END> . 
However , little is known about the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that regulate its expression . 
Here , we show that <START:ggp> Jagged1 <END> is a <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappaB-responsive gene <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> and <START:ggp> RelA <END> induced jagged1 gene expression , whereas a mutant defective for transactivation did not . 
Importantly , <START:ggp> jagged1 transcripts <END> were also upregulated by endogenous <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and this effect was inhibited by a dominant mutant of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> , a physiological inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Cell surface expression of <START:ggp> Jagged1 <END> in <START:ana> c-Rel-expressing cell monolayers <END> led to a functional interaction with <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> expressing the <START:ggp> Notch1/TAN-1 receptor <END> . 
This correlated with the initiation of signaling downstream of Notch , as evidenced by increased levels of <START:ana> HES-1 transcripts <END> in <START:ana> co-cultivated T cells <END> and of <START:ana> CD23 transcripts <END> in co-cultivated <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Consistent with its <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappaB <END> -dependent induction , <START:ggp> Jagged1 <END> was found to be highly expressed in <START:ana> splenic B cells <END> where <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> is expressed constitutively . 
These results demonstrate that <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> can trigger the Notch signaling pathway in neighboring cells by inducing jagged1 gene expression , and suggest a role for <START:ggp> Jagged1 <END> in B-cell activation , differentiation or function . 
These findings also highlight the potential for an interplay between the Notch and NF-kappaB signaling pathways in the immune system . 
Bacterial peptidoglycan induces <START:ggp> CD14 <END> -dependent activation of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> CREB/ATF <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
Peptidoglycan ( PGN ) , the major cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria , induces secretion of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> in <START:ana> macrophages <END> through <START:ggp> CD14 <END> , the pattern recognition receptor that binds lipopolysaccharide and other microbial products . 
To begin to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the transcription of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> , we wanted to determine which <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are activated by PGN in <START:ana> mouse RAW264.7 <END> and <START:ana> human THP-1 macrophage cells <END> . 
Our results demonstrated that : ( i ) PGN induced phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> ATF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> CREB <END> ; ( ii ) <START:ggp> ATF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> CREB <END> bound DNA as a dimer and induced transcriptional activation of a <START:ggp> CRE reporter plasmid <END> , which was inhibited by dominant negative <START:ggp> CREB <END> and <START:ggp> ATF-1 <END> ; ( iii ) PGN induced phosphorylation of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> , protein synthesis of <START:ggp> JunB <END> and <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , and transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> AP-1 reporter plasmid <END> , which was inhibited by dominant negative <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> ; and ( iv ) PGN-induced activation of <START:ggp> CREB/ATF <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> was mediated through <START:ggp> CD14 <END> . 
This is the first study to demonstrate activation of <START:ggp> CREB/ATF <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 transcription factors <END> by PGN or by any other component of Gram-positive bacteria . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> are down-regulated in inflamed colonic mucosa but not in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> from patients with inflammatory bowel disease [ see comments ] 
BACKGROUND : Growing evidence indicates that the immune system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system are linked by several mechanisms , for example intracellular <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> hGR <END> ) . 
Glucocorticoids are the standard treatment of acute attacks of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . 
Binding of glucocorticoids to <START:ggp> hGR <END> down-regulates the transcription of <START:ggp> inflammatory genes <END> that can propagate IBD . 
PATIENTS AND METHODS : IBD patients were either treated with 5-60 mg of prednisolone for more than 1 week or were without glucocorticoid treatment for more than 4 weeks . 
<START:ggp> hGR <END> levels were determined from isolated cytosol of <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMCs <END> ) or mucosal biopsies using a radioassay with [ 3H ] -dexamethasone . 
Interleukin ( IL ) 6 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . 
RESULTS : The systemic ( PBMC ) <START:ggp> hGR <END> levels of corticosteroid-treated IBD patients were significantly lower than those of control subjects ( 59.6 +/- 57.1 dpm mg-1 <START:ggp> cytosol protein <END> vs . 
227.0 +/- 90.8 dpm mg-1 <START:ggp> cytosol protein <END> , P = 0.007 ) and IBD patients not receiving glucocorticoid treatment ( 179.7 +/- 171.3 dpm mg-1 <START:ggp> cytosol protein <END> , P = 0.002 ) . 
Systemic <START:ggp> hGR <END> levels in untreated IBD patients did not differ significantly from those in control subjects . 
In patients with connective tissue diseases , systemic <START:ggp> hGR <END> levels were also found to be decreased in the absence of glucocorticoid treatment . 
Systemic <START:ggp> hGR <END> levels in patients with Crohn 's disease ( CD ) treated with steroids ( 66.6 +/- 61.0 dpm mg-1 <START:ggp> cytosol protein <END> ) were not different from those in patients with ulcerative colitis ( UC ) ( 56.1 +/- 51.6 dpm mg-1 <START:ggp> cytosol protein <END> ) . 
In contrast to these findings , mucosal <START:ggp> hGR <END> levels were significantly decreased in both steroid-treated ( 18.0 +/- 15.5 ) and not steroid-treated ( 37.8 +/- 30.5 ) patients compared with control subjects ( 125.6 +/- 97.1 ; P = 0.00009 and P = 0.0008 respectively ) . 
IL-6 levels in all IBD groups with and without steroids were significantly different from those in control subjects . 
CONCLUSION : In IBD there is no difference in systemic <START:ggp> hGR <END> levels between not steroid-treated patients and control subjects , in spite of inflammatory activity ( <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ) . 
Mucosal <START:ggp> hGR <END> levels were decreased independently of treatment , probably leading to a decreased protection against <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> action in the intestinal mucosa . 
<START:ggp> ICSAT <END> overexpression is not sufficient to cause adult T-cell leukemia or multiple myeloma . 
<START:ggp> ICSAT <END> ( <START:ggp> Interferon Consensus Sequence binding protein for Activated T cells <END> ) is a lymphocyte-specific member of the <START:ggp> interferon regulatory factor ( IRF ) family <END> of transcription factors , originally identified through Southwestern screening of the <START:ggp> ATL ( Adult T-cell leukemia ) -16T expression library <END> . 
In this study , we created transgenic mice overexpressing <START:ggp> ICSAT <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
Although spontaneous tumorigenesis was not observed , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production with Concanavalin A stimulation was significantly increased in transgenic mice overexpressing <START:ggp> ICSAT <END> . 
<START:ggp> ICSAT <END> overexpression in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> seems insufficient for the leukemogenesis of ATL or multiple myeloma ( MM ) , however , it may regulate T cell activation and its overexpression may lead to leukemogenesis via controlling <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production .

Altered <START:ana> memory T cell <END> differentiation in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis . 
The chronic immune response in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) might be driven by activated Th1 cells without sufficient Th2 cell differentiation to down-modulate inflammation . 
To test whether disordered <START:ana> memory T cell <END> differentiation contributes to the typical Th1-dominated chronic inflammation in RA we investigated differentiation of <START:ana> resting CD4+ memory T cells <END> in patients with early ( 6 wk to 12 mo ) untreated RA and in age- and sex-matched healthy controls in vitro . 
No difference in <START:ggp> cytokine <END> secretion profiles of <START:ana> freshly isolated memory T cells <END> was detected between patients and controls . 
A <START:ana> cell culture system <END> was then employed that permitted the differentiation of <START:ggp> Th effectors <END> from <START:ana> resting memory T cells <END> by short term priming . 
Marked differences were found in response to priming . 
<START:ana> Th2 cells <END> could be induced in all healthy controls by priming with <START:ggp> anti-CD28 <END> in the absence of <START:ggp> TCR <END> ligation . 
By contrast , priming under those conditions resulted in Th2 differentiation in only 9 of 24 RA patients . 
Exogenous <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> could overcome the apparent Th2 differentiation defect in seven patients but was without effect in the remaining eight patients . 
In all patients a marked decrease in <START:ana> IL-2-producing cells <END> and a significant increase in well-differentiated <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> that produced <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> but not <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> were evident after priming with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> anti-CD28 <END> . 
The data suggest that <START:ana> CD4+ memory T cells <END> from patients with early untreated RA manifest an intrinsic abnormality in their ability to differentiate into specific <START:ana> cytokine-producing effector cells <END> that might contribute to the characteristic Th1-dominated chronic ( auto ) immune inflammation in RA . 
The intracellular parasite Theileria parva protects <START:ana> infected T cells <END> from apoptosis . 
Parasites have evolved a plethora of strategies to ensure their survival . 
The intracellular parasite Theileria parva secures its propagation and spreads through the infected animal by infecting and transforming <START:ana> T cells <END> , inducing their continuous proliferation and rendering them metastatic . 
In previous work , we have shown that the parasite induces constitutive activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , by inducing the constitutive degradation of its <START:ggp> cytoplasmic inhibitors <END> . 
The biological significance of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> T. parva-infected cells <END> , however , has not yet been defined . 
Cells that have been transformed by viruses or <START:ggp> oncogenes <END> can persist only if they manage to avoid destruction by the apoptotic mechanisms that are activated on transformation and that contribute to maintain cellular homeostasis . 
We now demonstrate that parasite-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation plays a crucial role in the survival of <START:ana> T. parva-transformed T cells <END> by conveying protection against an apoptotic signal that accompanies parasite-mediated transformation . 
Consequently , inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> nuclear translocation and the expression of <START:ggp> dominant negative mutant <END> forms of components of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation pathway , such as <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> or <START:ggp> p65 <END> , prompt rapid apoptosis of <START:ana> T. parva-transformed T cells <END> . 
Our findings offer important insights into parasite survival strategies and demonstrate that parasite-induced constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation is an essential step in maintaining the transformed phenotype of the <START:ana> infected cells <END> . 
A polymorphism that affects <START:ggp> OCT-1 <END> binding to the <START:ggp> TNF promoter region <END> is associated with severe malaria [ see comments ] 
Genetic variation in <START:ggp> cytokine promoter regions <END> is postulated to influence susceptibility to infection , but the molecular mechanisms by which such polymorphisms might affect gene regulation are unknown . 
Through systematic DNA footprinting of the TNF ( encoding tumour necrosis factor , TNF ) promoter region , we have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) that causes the helix-turn-helix <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> OCT-1 to bind to a novel region of complex protein-DNA interactions and alters gene expression in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
The OCT-1-binding genotype , found in approximately 5 % of Africans , is associated with fourfold increased susceptibility to cerebral malaria in large case-control studies of West African and East African populations , after correction for other known TNF polymorphisms and linked <START:ggp> HLA alleles <END> . 
UV-induced <START:ggp> CYP1A1 <END> gene expression in human cells is mediated by tryptophan . 
Induction of <START:ggp> cytochrome P-4501A1 <END> ( <START:ggp> CYP1A1 <END> ) activity by UV has been observed earlier in animal studies via a mechanism that has not yet been resolved . 
Our previous data have indicated that formylated indolocarbazoles which are formed by UV irradiation of tryptophan solutions are very potent Ah-receptor agonists . 
To evaluate the effect of UV light on <START:ggp> cytochrome P4501A1 <END> gene expression , we studied the induction of <START:ana> CYP1A1 mRNA <END> by UV irradiation of <START:ana> cultured human keratinocytes <END> ( <START:ana> HaCaT cell line <END> ) , <START:ana> primary human blood lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> mouse Hepa-1 cells <END> . 
The cells were exposed to UV light delivered by a bank of 6 Philips TL20/12RS sun lamps emitting primarily in the UVB range in the absence and presence of tryptophan . 
A semiquantitative <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase <END> -linked polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) was used for analysis of gene expression in the <START:ana> treated cells <END> . 
The results show that the <START:ana> CYP1A1 mRNA <END> level induced by UV in the presence of tryptophan was higher than that induced by UV alone in both <START:ana> HaCaT cells <END> and <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> after 3 h of incubation post-UV irradiation . 
To find out if the induction by UV light is caused by the formation of an Ah receptor ligand , <START:ana> Hepa-1 wild-type and Ah receptor deficient c12 cell lines <END> were applied . 
<START:ana> Wild-type ( wt ) cells <END> were inducible either by the tryptophan photoproduct 6-formylindolo [ 3 , 2-b ] carbazole ( FICZ ) or by UV-irradiation but very low or undetectable levels were observed in the <START:ana> c12 cells <END> . 
This shows that the induction of gene expression by FICZ and UV is <START:ggp> Ah receptor <END> dependent . 
Together , these results indicate that UV-induced <START:ggp> CYP1A1 <END> gene expression in <START:ana> mammalian cells <END> is mediated by an <START:ggp> Ah receptor <END> ligand formed from tryptophan . 
Thus , the photoproducts of tryptophan are suggested to be mediators of light via binding to the <START:ggp> Ah receptor <END> and as such also could have a role in light-regulated biological rhythms . 
Repression by <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> and <START:ggp> Aiolos <END> is mediated through <START:ggp> histone deacetylase complexes <END> . 
Here we show that the <START:ggp> lymphoid lineage-determining factors <END> <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> and <START:ggp> Aiolos <END> can function as <START:ggp> strong transcriptional repressors <END> . 
This function is mediated through two <START:ggp> repression domains <END> and is dependent upon the promoter context and cell type . 
Repression by <START:ggp> Ikaros proteins <END> correlates with hypo-acetylation of <START:ggp> core histones <END> at <START:ggp> promoter sites <END> and is relieved by <START:ggp> histone deacetylase <END> inhibitors . 
Consistent with these findings , <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> and its <START:ggp> repression domains <END> can interact in vivo and in vitro with the <START:ggp> mSin3 family <END> of co-repressors which bind to <START:ggp> histone deacetylases <END> . 
Based on these and our recent findings of associations between <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> and <START:ggp> Mi-2-HDAC <END> , we propose that <START:ggp> Ikaros family members <END> modulate gene expression during lymphocyte development by recruiting distinct <START:ggp> histone deacetylase complexes <END> to <START:ggp> specific promoters <END> . 
<START:ggp> Protein kinase B <END> ( <START:ggp> c-Akt <END> ) , <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> are activated by <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> EPO <END> ) in <START:ana> HCD57 erythroid cells <END> but are constitutively active in an <START:ana> EPO-independent , apoptosis-resistant subclone <END> ( <START:ana> HCD57-SREI cells <END> ) . 
We found that <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> EPO <END> ) and <START:ggp> stem cell factor <END> ( <START:ggp> SCF <END> ) <START:ggp> activated protein kinase B <END> ( <START:ggp> PKB/Akt <END> ) in <START:ana> EPO-dependent HCD57 erythroid cells <END> . 
To better understand signals controlling proliferation and viability , erythroid cells that resist apoptosis in the absence of <START:ggp> EPO <END> were subcloned and characterized ( <START:ana> HCD57-SREI cells <END> ) . 
Constitutive activations of <START:ggp> PKB/Akt <END> , <START:ggp> STAT5a <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT5b <END> were noted in these <START:ana> EPO-independent cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> PI3-kinase <END> activity was an upstream activator of <START:ggp> PKB/Akt <END> because the <START:ggp> PI3-kinase <END> inhibitor LY294002 blocked both constitutive <START:ggp> PKB/Akt <END> and factor-dependent <START:ggp> PKB/Akt <END> activity . 
The LY294002 study showed that proliferation and viability of both <START:ana> HCD57-SREI <END> and <START:ana> HCD57 cells <END> correlated with the activity of <START:ggp> PKB/Akt <END> ; however , <START:ggp> PKB/Akt <END> activity alone did not protect these cells from apoptosis . 
Treatment of <START:ana> HCD57 cells <END> with <START:ggp> SCF <END> also activated <START:ggp> PKB/Akt <END> , but did not protect from apoptosis . 
This result suggested that <START:ggp> PKB/PI3-kinase <END> activity is necessary but not sufficient to promote viability and/or proliferation . 
Constitutive <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> activity , activated through an unknown pathway not including <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> or <START:ggp> EPOR <END> , may act in concert with the constitutive <START:ggp> PI3-kinase <END> <START:ggp> /PKB/Akt <END> pathway to protect the <START:ana> EPO-independent HCD57-SREI cells <END> from apoptosis and promote limited proliferation . 
Disruption of alpha beta but not of gamma delta T cell development by overexpression of the <START:ggp> helix-loop-helix protein <END> <START:ggp> Id3 <END> in <START:ana> committed T cell progenitors <END> . 
Enforced expression of <START:ggp> Id3 <END> , which has the capacity to inhibit many <START:ggp> basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors <END> , in <START:ana> human CD34 ( + ) hematopoietic progenitor cells <END> that have not undergone <START:ggp> T cell receptor ( TCR ) gene rearrangements <END> inhibits development of the <START:ana> transduced cells <END> into <START:ana> TCRalpha beta and gamma delta cells <END> in a <START:ana> fetal thymic organ culture <END> ( <START:ana> FTOC <END> ) . 
Here we document that overexpression of <START:ggp> Id3 <END> , in <START:ana> progenitors <END> that have initiated <START:ggp> TCR gene rearrangements <END> ( <START:ana> pre-T cells <END> ) , inhibits development into <START:ana> TCRalpha beta <END> but not into <START:ana> TCRgamma delta T cells <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> Id3 <END> impedes expression of recombination activating genes and downregulates <START:ana> pre-Talpha mRNA <END> . 
These observations suggest possible mechanisms by which <START:ggp> Id3 <END> overexpression can differentially affect development of <START:ana> pre-T cells <END> into <START:ana> TCRalpha beta and gamma delta cells <END> . 
We also observed that <START:ana> cell surface CD4 ( - ) CD8 ( - ) CD3 ( - ) cells <END> with <START:ggp> rearranged TCR genes <END> developed from <START:ana> Id3-transduced <END> but not from <START:ana> control-transduced pre-T cells <END> in an <START:ana> FTOC <END> . 
These cells had properties of both <START:ana> natural killer <END> ( <START:ana> NK <END> ) and <START:ana> pre-T cells <END> . 
These findings suggest that <START:ggp> bHLH factors <END> are required to control T cell development after the T/NK developmental checkpoint . 
HIV-1 reactivation in <START:ana> resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> of infected adults upon in vitro <START:ggp> CD4 <END> cross-linking by ligands of the <START:ggp> CDR2-loop <END> in <START:ggp> extracellular domain 1 <END> . 
HIV-1 infects <START:ana> resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMCs <END> ) but remains inactive state until subsequent cell activation . 
We have demonstrated that the cross-linking of <START:ggp> cell surface CD4 <END> by <START:ggp> gp120-anti-gp120 immune complexes <END> or heat-inactivated HIV-1 ( iHIV-1 ) is sufficient to trigger activation signals leading to virus reactivation ( 9 ) . 
In this study , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> nuclear translocation and stimulation of virus production by iHIV-1 were strictly linked to the concentrations of <START:ggp> viral proteins <END> used as exogenous stimuli . 
Moreover , we further investigated the physiologic relevance of these observations . 
When submitted to an in vitro <START:ggp> CD4 <END> cross-linking by iHIV-1 , <START:ana> PBMCs <END> from HIV-1-infected patients were found to produce virus . 
This viral reactivation was associated with increased <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> nuclear translocation in patients ' <START:ana> PBMCs <END> . 
Additionally , virus reactivation in <START:ana> resting PBMCs <END> infected in vitro with HIV-1 was found to be specifically induced by ligands of the <START:ggp> CDR2-loop <END> in <START:ggp> domain 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> D1 <END> ) of <START:ggp> CD4 <END> ( <START:ggp> virus envelope and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies <END> ) . 
In contrast , virus reactivation was not observed following <START:ggp> CD4 <END> oligomerization by <START:ggp> antibodies <END> that bind other epitopes in <START:ggp> D1 <END> , including the <START:ggp> D1/CDR3-loop <END> . 
Finally , <START:ggp> soluble CD4 <END> ( <START:ggp> sCD4 <END> ) prevented virus reactivation by <START:ggp> D1/CDR2-loop ligands <END> . 
Our results indicate that the signaling events initiated in <START:ana> PBMCs <END> by oligomerization of <START:ggp> CD4 <END> at the <START:ggp> D1/CDR2-loop <END> can trigger HIV-1 upregulation in infected individuals . 
Signaling through the <START:ggp> lymphotoxin-beta receptor <END> stimulates HIV-1 replication alone and in cooperation with soluble or <START:ggp> membrane-bound TNF-alpha <END> . 
The level of ongoing HIV-1 replication within an individual is critical to HIV-1 pathogenesis . 
Among host immune factors , the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> has previously been shown to increase HIV-1 replication in various monocyte and T cell model systems . 
Here , we demonstrate that signaling through the <START:ggp> TNF <END> receptor family member , the <START:ggp> lymphotoxin-beta ( LT-beta ) receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> LT-betaR <END> ) , also regulates HIV-1 replication . 
Furthermore , HIV-1 replication is cooperatively stimulated when the distinct <START:ggp> LT-betaR <END> and <START:ggp> TNF receptor systems <END> are simultaneously engaged by their specific ligands . 
Moreover , in a physiological coculture cellular assay system , we show that <START:ggp> membrane-bound TNF-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> LT-alpha1beta2 <END> act virtually identically to their soluble forms in the regulation of HIV-1 replication . 
Thus , cosignaling via the <START:ggp> LT-beta and TNF-alpha receptors <END> is probably involved in the modulation of HIV-1 replication and the subsequent determination of HIV-1 viral burden in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Intriguingly , surface expression of <START:ggp> LT-alpha1beta2 <END> is up-regulated on a <START:ana> T cell line <END> acutely infected with HIV-1 , suggesting a positive feedback loop between HIV-1 infection , <START:ggp> LT-alpha1beta2 <END> expression , and HIV-1 replication . 
Given the critical role that <START:ggp> LT-alpha1beta2 <END> plays in lymphoid architecture , we speculate that <START:ggp> LT-alpha1beta2 <END> may be involved in HIV-associated abnormalities of the lymphoid organs . 
<START:ggp> Monoclonal anti-endothelial cell antibodies <END> from a patient with Takayasu arteritis activate endothelial cells from large vessels . 
OBJECTIVE : To create <START:ggp> monoclonal anti-endothelial cell antibodies <END> ( <START:ggp> mAECA <END> ) from a patient with Takayasu arteritis to evaluate their ability to activate <START:ana> human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> HUVEC <END> ) , and to characterize the mechanism of EC activation . 
METHODS : A panel of <START:ggp> mAECA <END> was generated from <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> of a patient with Takayasu arteritis , using Epstein-Barr virus transformation . 
Activity against <START:ana> macrovascular EC <END> ( <START:ana> HUVEC <END> ) and <START:ana> microvascular EC <END> ( <START:ana> human bone marrow EC immortalized by SV40 <END> ) antigens was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . 
Inhibition studies were used to select the <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> ( <START:ggp> mAECA <END> ) which share the same EC epitope binding specificity as the <START:ggp> total IgG-AECA <END> from the Takayasu arteritis patient . 
The binding of the <START:ggp> mAECA <END> to <START:ana> human aortic EC <END> was studied by immunohistochemistry . 
The secretion levels of <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ) and von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) were determined , to serve as markers for EC activation . 
The <START:ana> activated EC <END> were examined for the adherence of a <START:ana> monocytic cell line <END> ( <START:ana> U937 <END> ) , as well as for expression of <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 <END> , intercellular adhesion molecule 1 , and <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> . 
In addition , nuclear extracts of the <START:ana> mAECA-treated EC <END> were analyzed for the induction of translocation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) , using a specific <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> oligoprobe in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay . 
RESULTS : Six <START:ggp> mAECA <END> were selected , the mixture of which produced 100 % inhibition of binding of the original <START:ggp> IgG <END> ( from the patient with Takayasu arteritis ) to <START:ana> HUVEC <END> . 
All <START:ggp> mAECA <END> possessed high activity against <START:ana> macrovascular EC <END> , but none had significant antimicrovascular EC activity . 
The <START:ggp> mAECA <END> , but not <START:ggp> normal human IgG <END> , had anti-human aortic EC activity . 
Four of the 6 <START:ggp> mAECA <END> <START:ana> activated EC <END> , manifested by increased <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> and vWF secretion . 
The 4 <START:ggp> mAECA <END> induced EC expression of <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> and increased adhesion of <START:ana> U937 monocytic cells <END> to <START:ana> EC <END> . 
In addition , these <START:ggp> mAECA <END> stimulated the nuclear translocation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB transcription factor <END> . 
CONCLUSION : Our findings suggest that <START:ggp> AECA <END> may directly stimulate <START:ana> EC <END> in Takayasu arteritis through elevation of <START:ggp> adhesion molecule <END> expression associated with <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and adhesion of <START:ana> monocytes <END> , and may therefore play a pathogenic role in the development of the vasculopathy in Takayasu arteritis . 
Cutting edge : expression of the <START:ggp> NF of activated T cells <END> in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> : regulation by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> . 
We report that <START:ggp> NF-AT1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT4 <END> are expressed cytoplasmically in <START:ana> resting eosinophils <END> , whereas <START:ggp> NF-AT2 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT3 <END> have not been seen . 
Likewise , <START:ana> NF-AT1 mRNA <END> and <START:ana> NF-AT4 mRNA <END> have been detected in <START:ana> resting eosinophils <END> , and their levels can be significantly up-regulated by the <START:ggp> Th2-associated cytokines <END> <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> . 
There is no detectable <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> protein expression in the nuclei of <START:ana> resting eosinophils <END> . 
However <START:ggp> NF-ATs <END> appear in the nuclei of <START:ana> IL-4- , IL-5- , or ionomycin-stimulated eosinophils <END> . 
Only <START:ggp> NF-AT1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT4 <END> , but not <START:ggp> NF-AT2 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT3 <END> , have translocated into the nuclei in <START:ana> IL-4- or IL-5-stimulated eosinophils <END> . 
These findings delineate a novel pathway in the cytokine network in which <START:ana> Th2 lymphocytes <END> `` control '' <START:ana> eosinophils <END> via the release of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> , and activation of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
The findings also suggest that a later feedback `` talking '' may exist between <START:ana> eosinophils <END> and <START:ana> Th2 lymphocytes <END> . 
PPARalpha activators inhibit cytokine-induced <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> expression in <START:ana> human endothelial cells <END> . 
BACKGROUND : Adhesion molecule expression on the endothelial cell ( EC ) surface is critical for leukocyte recruitment to atherosclerotic lesions . 
Better understanding of transcriptional regulation of <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> in <START:ana> ECs <END> may provide important insight into plaque formation . 
<START:ggp> Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> PPARalpha <END> ) , a member of the <START:ggp> nuclear receptor family <END> , regulates gene expression in response to certain fatty acids and fibric acid derivatives . 
The present study investigated <START:ggp> PPARalpha <END> expression in <START:ana> human ECs <END> and their regulation of <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) . 
METHODS AND RESULTS : Immunohistochemistry revealed that <START:ana> human carotid artery ECs <END> express <START:ggp> PPARalpha <END> . 
Pretreatment of <START:ana> cultured human ECs <END> with the <START:ggp> PPARalpha <END> activators fenofibrate or WY14643 inhibited <START:ggp> TNF-alpha-induced VCAM-1 <END> in a time- and concentration-dependent manner , an effect not seen with <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> activators . 
Both <START:ggp> PPARalpha <END> activators decreased cytokine-induced <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> mRNA expression without altering its mRNA half-life . 
Transient transfection of deletional <START:ggp> VCAM-1 promoter constructs <END> and electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that fenofibrate inhibits <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> transcription in part by inhibiting <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Finally , <START:ggp> PPARalpha <END> activators significantly reduced adhesion of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> to <START:ana> cultured human ECs <END> . 
CONCLUSIONS : <START:ana> Human ECs <END> express <START:ggp> PPARalpha <END> , a potentially important regulator of atherogenesis through its transcriptional control of <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> gene expression . 
Such findings also have implications regarding the clinical use of lipid-lowering agents , like fibric acids , which can activate <START:ggp> PPARalpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> CBP/p300 <END> integrates <START:ggp> Raf <END> / <START:ggp> Rac <END> -signaling pathways in the transcriptional induction of <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> during T cell activation . 
<START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> , an inducibly expressed <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , controls gene expression in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> cardiomyocytes <END> . 
We show here that the <START:ggp> transcriptional co-activators <END> <START:ggp> CBP/p300 <END> bind to and control the activity of the <START:ggp> inducible N-terminal transactivation domain <END> of <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> , <START:ggp> TAD-A <END> . 
Similar to the <START:ggp> N terminal transactivation domain <END> of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> , <START:ggp> TAD-A <END> is inducibly phosphorylated , but this phosphorylation is dispensable for the interaction with <START:ggp> CBP/p300 <END> . 
Constitutive active versions of <START:ggp> c-Raf <END> and <START:ggp> Rac <END> synergistically enhance the <START:ggp> CBP/p300 <END> -mediated increase of <START:ggp> TAD-A <END> activity , indicating the important role <START:ggp> CBP/p300 <END> plays in the integration of T cell activation signals . 
Since a mutation of <START:ggp> CBP <END> abolishing HAT activity is almost as active as <START:ggp> wild-type CBP <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> , functions of <START:ggp> CBP/p300 <END> other than histone acetylation appear to control the <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> -dependent transcription in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Immune functions , clinical parameters and hormone receptor status in breast cancer patients . 
We have carried out a detailed analysis of the cellular immune functions of breast cancer patients in comparison with healthy controls . 
A possible correlation between immune and clinical parameters was analysed in 50 breast cancer patients . 
Immune parameters , <START:ana> natural killer cell <END> and T lymphocyte functions and the numbers of <START:ana> circulating T lymphocytes <END> were analysed against the clinical parameters comprising the tumour burden , the stage of the disease and the expression of <START:ggp> hormone receptors <END> on the tumour . 
In order to analyse the immune function data effectively , low responders were identified with stringent cut-off values . 
Considerably higher proportions of low responders were found among the patient population . 
Elevated numbers of <START:ana> circulating T lymphocytes <END> and <START:ggp> CD3 <END> -directed cytolysis correlated with the expression of <START:ggp> oestrogen receptors <END> independently of the clinical/histological parameters . 
<START:ggp> Latent membrane protein 1 <END> of Epstein-Barr virus interacts with <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> and activates <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> . 
<START:ggp> Latent membrane protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> ) acts like a <START:ggp> permanently activated receptor <END> of the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -receptor superfamily <END> and is absolutely required for B cell immortalization by Epstein-Barr virus . 
Molecular and biochemical approaches demonstrated that <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> usurps cellular signaling pathways resulting in the induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> via two <START:ggp> C-terminal activating regions <END> . 
We demonstrate here that a third region encompassing a <START:ggp> proline rich sequence <END> within the 33 bp repetitive stretch of <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> 's <START:ggp> C-terminus <END> is required for the activation of <START:ggp> Janus kinase 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> ) . 
The interaction of <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> and <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> leads to the enhanced tyrosine auto/transphosphorylation of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> within minutes after crosslinking of a conditional <START:ggp> NGF-R : LMP1 chimera <END> and is a prerequisite for the activation of <START:ggp> STAT transcription factors <END> . 
These results reveal a novel activating region in the <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> <START:ggp> C-terminus <END> and identify the <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> /STAT <END> pathway as a target of this <START:ggp> viral integral membrane protein <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Monocyte arrest and transmigration on inflamed endothelium in shear flow is inhibited by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> . 
Mobilization of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) activates transcription of genes encoding <START:ggp> endothelial adhesion molecules <END> and chemokines that contribute to monocyte infiltration critical in atherogenesis . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> has been achieved by pharmacological and genetic approaches ; however , monocyte interactions with activated endothelium in shear flow following gene transfer of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> inhibitor <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> have not been studied . 
We found that overexpression of <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> in <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> using a recombinant adenovirus prevented <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) -induced degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> and suppressed the upregulation of <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) , <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ) , and <START:ana> E-selectin mRNA <END> and surface protein expression and the upregulation of transcripts for the <START:ggp> chemokines <END> <START:ggp> monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> growth-related activity-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> GRO-alpha <END> ) by <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> . 
This was associated with a reduction in endothelial <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> secretion and <START:ggp> GRO-alpha <END> immobilization . 
Adhesion assays under physiological shear flow conditions showed that firm arrest , spreading , and transmigration of <START:ana> monocytes <END> on <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -activated endothelium was markedly inhibited by <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> overexpression . 
Inhibition with <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> and peptide antagonists inferred that this was due to reduced expression of Ig integrin ligand as well as of <START:ggp> chemokines <END> specifically involved in these events . 
In contrast , rolling of <START:ana> monocytes <END> was increased by <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> transfer and was partly mediated by <START:ggp> P-selectin <END> ; however , it appeared to be unaffected by the inhibition of <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> induction . 
Thus , our data provide novel evidence that selective modulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> by adenoviral transfer of <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> impairs the expression of multiple <START:ggp> endothelial gene products <END> required for subsequent monocyte arrest and emigration in shear flow and thus for monocyte infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques . 
Recognition of <START:ggp> NFATp/AP-1 composite elements <END> within genes induced upon the activation of <START:ana> immune cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Composite elements <END> are <START:ggp> regulatory modules <END> of <START:ggp> promoters <END> or <START:ggp> enhancers <END> that consist of binding sites of two different but synergizing <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
A well-studied example is <START:ggp> nuclear factors of activated T-cell ( NFAT ) sites <END> which are composite elements of a <START:ggp> NFATp/c and an activating protein 1 ( AP-1 ) binding site <END> . 
We have developed a computational approach to identify potential <START:ggp> NFAT target genes <END> which ( a ) comprises an improved method to scan for individual <START:ggp> NFAT composite elements <END> ; ( b ) considers positional effects relative to <START:ggp> transcription start sites <END> ; and ( c ) involves cluster analysis of potential <START:ggp> NFAT composite elements <END> . 
All three steps progressively helpX ? ed to discriminate <START:ggp> T-cell-specific promoter sequences <END> against other <START:ggp> functional regions <END> ( <START:ggp> coding and intronic sequences <END> ) of the same genes , against <START:ggp> promoters <END> of <START:ggp> muscle-specific genes <END> or against <START:ggp> random sequences <END> . 
Using this approach , we identified potential <START:ggp> NFAT composite elements <END> in <START:ggp> promoters <END> of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> and their receptors as well as in <START:ggp> promoters <END> of genes for <START:ggp> AP-1 family members <END> , <START:ggp> Ca2+-binding proteins <END> and some other components of the regulatory network operating in <START:ana> activated T-cells <END> and other <START:ana> immune cells <END> . 
The method developed can be adapted to characterize and identify other <START:ggp> composite elements <END> as well . 
The program for recognition <START:ggp> NFAT composite elements <END> is available through the World Wide Web ( http : //compel.bionet.nsc.ru/FunSite/CompelScan.html and http : //transfac.gbf.de/dbsearch/funsitep/s_comp.html ) .

The <START:ggp> oestrogen receptor <END> <START:ggp> codon 10 <END> polymorphism detected in breast cancer is also present in <START:ana> non-malignant cells <END> . 
The effect of oestrogens on oestrogen-receptive organs and cells is mediated via <START:ggp> intracellular receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> ERalpha <END> and <START:ggp> ERbeta <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> Oestrogen receptor <END> gene polymorphisms in the region encoding the <START:ggp> N-terminal portion <END> of the protein are reportedly associated with pathological conditions including breast cancer , hypertension , spontaneous abortion and coronary heart disease . 
A silent mutation in <START:ggp> codon 10 <END> of <START:ggp> exon 1 <END> , detected in <START:ana> ER-negative and ER-positive human breast cancer cell lines <END> , in breast tumors and <START:ggp> blood DNA <END> from breast cancer patients , has been recognized as a <START:ggp> polymorphic site <END> . 
In this study we examined , by denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis and <START:ggp> DNA sequence <END> analysis , the possible presence of a <START:ggp> codon 10 polymorphic site <END> in normal oestrogen target organs and cells such as the uterus ( myometrium and endometrium ) , in the placenta and <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> and in a benign uterus tumour ( leiomyoma ) . 
We have detected <START:ggp> ER codon 10 <END> polymorphism in these samples and have compared them to those observed in breast cancer samples . 
All tissues and cells studied were homozygous for the <START:ggp> wild-type gene <END> , and were heterozygous as well as homozygous for the <START:ggp> codon-10-variant type <END> . 
These results indicate that the presence of the <START:ggp> codon-10-variant type <END> is not a characteristic of breast cancer . 
Out current findings suggest that further investigations are warranted to elucidate the possible linkage of <START:ggp> ER codon 10 <END> polymorphism to physiological and pathological conditions . 
<START:ggp> USF/c-Myc <END> enhances , while <START:ggp> Yin-Yang 1 <END> suppresses , the promoter activity of <START:ggp> CXCR4 <END> , a <START:ggp> coreceptor <END> for HIV-1 entry . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> USF1 <END> and <START:ggp> USF2 <END> up-regulate gene expression ( i.e. , <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeats <END> ) via interaction with an <START:ggp> E box <END> on their target promoters , which is also a <START:ggp> binding site <END> for <START:ggp> c-Myc <END> . 
The <START:ggp> c-Myc oncoprotein <END> is important in control of cellular proliferation and differentiation , while <START:ggp> Yin-Yang 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> YY1 <END> ) has been shown to control the expression of a number of <START:ggp> cellular and viral genes <END> . 
These two proteins physically interact with each other and mutually inhibit their respective biological functions . 
In this study , we show that <START:ggp> USF/c-Myc <END> up-regulates , while <START:ggp> YY1 <END> down-regulates the promoter activity of <START:ggp> CXCR4 <END> , a coreceptor for T cell-tropic HIV-1 entry . 
We have identified an <START:ggp> E box <END> around <START:ggp> -260 <END> and a <START:ggp> YY1 binding site <END> around <START:ggp> -300 <END> relative to the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> . 
Mutation of the <START:ggp> E box <END> abolished <START:ggp> USF/c-Myc <END> -mediated up-regulation of <START:ggp> CXCR4 <END> promoter activity , and mutation of the <START:ggp> YY1 binding site <END> was associated with unresponsiveness to <START:ggp> YY1 <END> -mediated inhibition . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> USF/c-Myc <END> and <START:ggp> YY1 <END> may play an important role in the HIV-1-replicative cycle , by modulating both the viral fusion/entry process and viral expression . 
Suppression of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> normal T cells <END> by supernatant fluid from human renal cell carcinomas . 
<START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> from patients with renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) show reduced immune function and impaired activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
We determined the mechanism of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> suppression in <START:ana> T cells <END> of RCC patient and determined whether supernatant fluid from RCC explants ( RCC-S ) induced the same phenotype of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> suppression in <START:ana> normal T cells <END> that is observed in patient <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The pattern of <START:ggp> kappaB <END> -binding activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> of RCC patient was altered as compared to that seen in <START:ana> T cells <END> obtained from normal volunteers . 
In some patients , no activation of <START:ggp> RelA/NFkappaB1 <END> -binding activity was detectable , while in others <START:ggp> kappaB <END> -binding activity was modestly induced but the duration was reduced . 
<START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> was degraded normally following stimulation in both normal controls and <START:ana> T cells <END> from RCC patients . 
RCC-S did not alter the cytoplasmic levels of <START:ggp> RelA <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB1 <END> but did suppress their nuclear localization and inhibited the activation of <START:ggp> RelA/NF-kappaB1 binding complexes <END> . 
These results show that RCC-S can induce in <START:ana> normal T cells <END> the same phenotype of impaired <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation that is detected in <START:ana> T cells <END> of RCC patient . 
It also appears that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> suppression by RCC-S may contribute to the immunosuppression of host immunity . 
<START:ggp> STAT1 <END> activation during monocyte to macrophage maturation : role of <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> . 
<START:ana> Human monocytes <END> isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors show a time-dependent differentiation into <START:ana> macrophages <END> upon in vitro cultivation , closely mimicking their in vivo migration and maturation into extravascular tissues . 
The mediator ( s ) of this maturation process has not been yet defined . 
We investigated the involvement of <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) factors <END> in this phenomenon and reported the specific , time-dependent , activation of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> protein starting at day 0/1 of cultivation and maximally expressed at day 5 . 
<START:ggp> STAT1 <END> activity was evident on the <START:ggp> STAT binding sequences <END> ( <START:ggp> SBE <END> ) present in the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of genes which are up-regulated during monocyte to macrophage maturation such as <START:ggp> FcgammaRI <END> and <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> , and in the promoter of the <START:ggp> transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1 <END> . 
Moreover , the effect of cell adhesion to fibronectin or laminin was studied to investigate mechanisms involved in <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> activation . 
Compared with <START:ana> monocytes <END> adherent on plastic surfaces , freshly isolated cells allowed to adhere either to fibronectin- or laminin-coated flasks exhibited an increased <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> binding activity both in control and in <START:ana> IFN-gamma-treated cells <END> . 
The molecular events leading to enhanced <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> activation and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> responsiveness concerned both <START:ggp> Y701 <END> and <START:ggp> S727 STAT1 <END> phosphorylation . 
Exogenous addition of <START:ggp> transforming growth factor-beta <END> , which exerts an inhibitory effect on some <START:ggp> monocytic differentiation markers <END> , inhibited macrophage maturation , integrin expression and <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> binding activity . 
Taken together these results indicate that <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> plays a pivotal role in the differentiation/maturation process of <START:ana> monocytes <END> as an early <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> initially activated by adherence and then able to modulate the expression of <START:ggp> functional genes <END> , such as <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> FcgammaRI <END> . 
Expression and role of <START:ggp> PML gene <END> in normal adult hematopoiesis : functional interaction between <START:ggp> PML and Rb proteins <END> in erythropoiesis . 
The expression of the <START:ggp> PML gene <END> was investigated in purified early <START:ana> hematopoietic progenitor cells <END> ( <START:ana> HPCs <END> ) induced to unilineage erythroid or granulocytic differentiation . 
<START:ana> PML mRNA <END> and <START:ggp> protein <END> , while barely detectable in quiescent <START:ana> HPCs <END> , are consistently induced by <START:ggp> growth factor <END> stimulation through the erythroid or granulocytic lineage . 
Thereafter , <START:ggp> PML <END> is downmodulated in late granulocytic maturation , whereas it is sustainably expressed through the erythroid pathway . 
In functional studies , <START:ggp> PML <END> expression was inhibited by addition of antisense oligomers targeting <START:ana> PML mRNA <END> ( <START:ggp> alpha-PML <END> ) . 
Interestingly , early treatment ( day 0 <START:ana> HPCs <END> ) with <START:ggp> alpha-PML <END> reduced the number of both <START:ana> erythroid and granulocytic colonies <END> , whereas late treatment ( day 5 culture ) reduced erythroid , but not granulocytic , clonogenesis . 
These findings suggest that <START:ggp> PML <END> is required for early hematopoiesis and erythroid , but not granulocytic maturation . 
The pattern of <START:ggp> PML <END> expression in normal hematopoiesis mimics that of <START:ana> retinoblastoma <END> <START:ggp> pRb 105 <END> . 
Combined treatment of <START:ana> HPCs <END> with <START:ggp> alpha-PML <END> and alpha-Rb oligomers inhibited both PML and Rb protein expression and completely blocked erythroid colony development . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> PML <END> and <START:ggp> pRb 105 <END> were co-immunoprecipitated in cellular lysates derived from <START:ana> erythroid precursors <END> indicating that this functional interaction may have a biochemical basis . 
These results suggest a key functional role of <START:ggp> PML <END> in early hematopoiesis and late erythropoiesis : the latter phenomenon may be related to the molecular and functional interaction of <START:ggp> PML <END> with <START:ggp> pRb 105 <END> . 
Binding characteristics of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> in multiple sclerosis . 
Although the exact etiology of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) remains unresolved , immune reactions are believed to be the central pathogenic mechanisms . 
Endogenous and therapeutic steroid hormones affect the immune system , and inflammatory diseases are associated with activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis , providing evidence of an immune-endocrine interplay . 
Function tests in MS have revealed dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system in a substantial proportion of patients . 
We characterized <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) binding in <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> from 39 MS patients and 14 age- and sex-matched controls with respect to dissociation constant and binding capacity , using a whole-cell binding assay with [ 3H ] dexamethasone as the ligand . 
<START:ggp> GR <END> binding parameters did not differ significantly between patients ( Kd 8.98 +/- 1.07 nM , Bmax 183 +/- 29.8 fmol/mg ) and controls ( Kd 9.36 +/- 1.17 nM , Bmax 158 +/- 16 fmol/mg ) . 
No effect of age , sex , course , duration or severity of disease , or prior steroid treatments was detected . 
<START:ggp> GR <END> binding parameters were analyzed in relation to the results of the combined dexamethasone <START:ggp> -CRH <END> test , which reflects corticosteroid receptor function at the hypothalamus , in 30 patients and 9 controls . 
While controls showed a moderate correlation between binding affinity of the <START:ggp> GR <END> in lymphocytes and regulatory function at the hypothalamic level , the patients did not . 
These data suggest that the physiological relationship between binding and function of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> is disturbed in MS . 
Phorbol ester-induced mononuclear cell differentiation is blocked by the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MEK <END> ) inhibitor PD98059 . 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MAPK <END> ) signaling pathway contributes to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) -induced mononuclear differentiation in the <START:ana> human myeloblastic leukemia ML-1 cells <END> . 
Upon TPA treatment , the activity of <START:ggp> ERK1 <END> and <START:ggp> ERK2 <END> rapidly increased , with maximal induction between 1 and 3 h , while <START:ggp> ERK2 <END> protein levels remained constant . 
The activity of <START:ggp> JNK1 <END> was also significantly induced , with <START:ggp> JNK1 <END> protein levels increasing moderately during exposure to TPA . 
Treatment of cells with PD98059 , a specific inhibitor of <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MEK <END> ) , inhibited TPA-induced <START:ggp> ERK2 <END> activity . 
Furthermore , PD98059 completely blocked the TPA-induced differentiation of <START:ana> ML-1 cells <END> , as assessed by a number of features associated with mononuclear differentiation including changes in morphology , nonspecific <START:ggp> esterase <END> activity , phagocytic ability , <START:ggp> NADPH oxidase <END> activity , mitochondrial respiration , and <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> inducibility . 
We conclude that activation of the <START:ggp> MEK <END> /ERK signaling pathway is necessary for TPA-induced mononuclear cell differentiation . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> in anorexia nervosa and Cushing 's disease . 
BACKGROUND : Patients with anorexia nervosa do not display cushingoid features in spite of elevated cortisol plasma levels . 
Whether a cortisol resistance or a reduced availability of the metabolic substrates necessary to develop the effect of glucocorticoids is responsible for this has not been established . 
METHODS : Twenty-two patients with severe restrictive anorexia nervosa , 10 patients with active Cushing 's disease , and 24 healthy volunteers without psychiatric disorders or mood alterations were investigated . 
Glucocorticoid receptor characteristics were examined on <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> by measuring [ 3H ] dexamethasone binding and the effect of dexamethasone on [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation , which represents an index of DNA synthesis . 
RESULTS : The number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> on <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> ( <START:ana> MNL <END> ) was comparable in patients with anorexia nervosa , patients with active Cushing 's disease , and normal subjects ( binding capacity 3.3 +/- 0.23 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.30 and 3.5 +/- 0.20 fmol/10 ( 6 ) cells ) . 
Conversely , <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> affinity was significantly decreased in anorexia nervosa as well as in Cushing 's patients compared to control subjects ( dissociation constant 4.0 +/- 0.31 and 4.1 +/- 0.34 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.29 nmol/L , p < .001 ) and inversely correlated with the levels of urinary free cortisol in both groups of patients . 
Basal [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation in <START:ana> MNL <END> was significantly reduced in anorexia nervosa as well as in Cushing 's patients compared to control subjects ( p < .001 ) and was diminished by dexamethasone to an extent similar to control subjects in patients with anorexia nervosa , but significantly ( p < .001 ) less in those with Cushing 's disease . 
In patients with anorexia nervosa , the incorporation of [ 3H ] thymidine into the <START:ana> MNL <END> was inversely correlated with urinary free cortisol levels . 
CONCLUSIONS : These data indicate that the lack of cushingoid features in patients with anorexia nervosa is not ascribable to a reduced sensitivity to glucocorticoids but is more likely due to the paucity of metabolic substrates . 
Different sequence requirements for expression in <START:ana> erythroid and megakaryocytic cells <END> within a <START:ggp> regulatory element <END> upstream of the <START:ggp> GATA-1 gene <END> . 
The <START:ggp> lineage-restricted transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> is required for differentiation of <START:ana> erythroid and megakaryocytic cells <END> . 
We have localized a 317 base pair <START:ggp> cis-acting regulatory element <END> , <START:ggp> HS I <END> , associated with a <START:ggp> hematopoietic-specific DNase I hypersensitive site <END> , which lies approx . 
3.7 kilobases upstream of the <START:ggp> murine hematopoietic-specific GATA-1 IE promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> HS I <END> directs high-level expression of reporter <START:ggp> GATA-1/lacZ genes <END> to <START:ana> primitive and definitive erythroid cells <END> and <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> in transgenic mice . 
Comparative sequence analysis of <START:ggp> HS I <END> between human and mouse shows approx . 
63 % nucleotide identity with a more conserved core of <START:ggp> 169 base pairs <END> ( 86 % identity ) . 
This core contains a <START:ggp> GATA site <END> separated by 10 base pairs from an <START:ggp> E-box motif <END> . 
The <START:ggp> composite motif <END> binds a <START:ggp> multi-protein hematopoietic-specific transcription factor complex <END> which includes <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , <START:ggp> SCL/tal-1 , <END> <START:ggp> E2A <END> , <START:ggp> Lmo2 <END> and <START:ggp> Ldb-1 <END> . 
Point mutations of the <START:ggp> GATA site <END> abolishes <START:ggp> HS I <END> function , whereas mutation of the <START:ggp> E-box motif <END> still allows reporter gene expression in both lineages . 
Strict dependence of <START:ggp> HS I <END> activity on a <START:ggp> GATA site <END> implies that assembly of a protein complex containing a <START:ggp> GATA-factor <END> , presumably <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> or <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> , is critical to activating or maintaining its function . 
Further dissection of the <START:ggp> 317 base pair region <END> demonstrates that , whereas all <START:ggp> 317 base pairs <END> are required for expression in <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> , only the <START:ggp> 5 ' 62 base pairs <END> are needed for erythroid-specific reporter expression . 
These findings demonstrate differential lineage requirements for expression within the <START:ggp> HS I element <END> . 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the expression of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and induce <START:ggp> HSP70 <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Recent studies have shown that the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) activate <START:ggp> heat shock transcription factor <END> ( <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> ) from a <START:ggp> latent cytoplasmic form <END> to a <START:ggp> nuclear , DNA binding state <END> . 
As <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> can function as both an activator of <START:ggp> heat shock genes <END> and a repressor of <START:ggp> non-heat shock genes <END> such as IL1B and c- fos , we have examined the potential role of <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> in the effects of NSAIDs on gene expression in a human <START:ana> monocytic cell line THP-1 <END> . 
We found that two members of the NSAIDs , sodium salicylate and sulindac repress the <START:ggp> IL1B promoter <END> to similar degree to heat shock or <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> overexpression . 
In addition , sodium salicylate and additional NSAIDs used at concentrations that activate <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> also inhibited the expression of other <START:ggp> monocytic genes <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ) activated by exposure to a pro-inflammatory stimulus ( lipopolysaccharide , LPS ) . 
At least in the case of the <START:ggp> IL1B promoter <END> , repression did not seem to involve another factor whose activity is affected by the NSAIDs , <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> as the <START:ggp> IL1B promoter fragment <END> used in our studies is not <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> responsive and binds specifically to <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> . 
Exposure to NSAIDs had a complex effect on HSP gene expression and while sulindac activated the stress responsive <START:ggp> HSP70B promoter <END> , sodium salicylate did not . 
In addition , only a subset of the NSAIDs induced <START:ana> HSP70 mRNA species <END> . 
These findings reflect the properties of <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> which can be activated to at least two <START:ggp> DNA binding forms <END> only one of which activates <START:ggp> heat shock promoters <END> and suggest that individual NSAID family members may differentially induce one or other of these forms . 
Overall therefore , exposure to NSAIDs leads to a profound switch in gene expression in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> , with suppression of genes involved in macrophage activation and induction of <START:ggp> stress genes <END> and <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> appears to play a regulatory role in these effects .

Immortalization of <START:ana> CD4 ( + ) and CD8 ( + ) T lymphocytes <END> by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 <START:ggp> Tax mutants <END> expressed in a <START:ana> functional molecular clone <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) transcriptional trans-activator <END> <START:ggp> Tax <END> has been demonstrated to have transforming activity in <START:ana> multiple cell culture <END> and transgenic-mouse models . 
In addition to activating transcription from the <START:ggp> viral long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) through the <START:ggp> cyclic AMP response element binding protein/activating transcription factor ( CREB/ATF ) family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> Tax <END> activates the expression of <START:ggp> multiple cellular promoters <END> through the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> pathway of transcriptional activation . 
The <START:ggp> Tax mutants <END> <START:ggp> M22 <END> and <START:ggp> M47 <END> have previously been demonstrated to selectively abrogate the ability of <START:ggp> Tax <END> to activate transcription through the NF-kappaB or CREB/ATF pathway , respectively . 
These mutations were introduced in the <START:ggp> tax gene <END> of the <START:ggp> ACH functional molecular clone <END> of HTLV-1 , and virus produced from the <START:ggp> mutant ACH clones <END> was examined for the ability to replicate and immortalize <START:ana> primary human lymphocytes <END> . 
While virus derived from the clone containing the <START:ggp> M47 <END> mutation retained the ability to immortalize <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , the <START:ggp> M22 <END> mutant lost the ability to immortalize <START:ana> infected cells <END> . 
These results indicate that activation of the <START:ggp> CREB/ATF <END> pathway by <START:ggp> Tax <END> is dispensable for the immortalization of <START:ana> T cells <END> by HTLV-1 , whereas activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> pathway may be critical . 
<START:ggp> Fibroblast growth factor-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> FGF-1 <END> ) enhances <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production and nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> FGF receptor-bearing Jurkat T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Fibroblast growth factors <END> ( <START:ggp> FGFs <END> ) are <START:ggp> heparin-binding proteins <END> crucial to embryogenesis , angiogenesis , and wound healing . 
<START:ggp> FGF-1 <END> is abundantly expressed in the synovium in rheumatoid arthritis and in rejecting allografts , sites of chronic immune-mediated inflammation . 
The frequency of <START:ggp> FGF-1 <END> -responsive <START:ana> T cells <END> is increased in the peripheral blood of these disorders , and a high percentage of <START:ana> infiltrating T cells <END> in rheumatoid arthritis synovium express receptors for <START:ggp> FGF-1 <END> . 
To understand the action of <START:ggp> FGF-1 <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> , studies were initiated in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> that express the signaling isoform of <START:ggp> FGF receptor-1 <END> . 
These experiments show that <START:ggp> FGF-1 <END> stimulation of <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> provides a second signal that augments TCR-mediated <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production . 
Analogous to costimulation via <START:ggp> CD28 <END> , this activity is mediated through activation of <START:ggp> Rel/kappaB <END> , a family of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> known to regulate <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and other <START:ggp> activation-inducible proteins <END> . 
<START:ggp> FGF-1 <END> alone induces modest nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> kappaB-binding proteins <END> , and this translocation is enhanced by the combination of <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> FGF-1 <END> . 
This <START:ggp> NF-kappaB binding complex <END> is composed of <START:ggp> transcriptionally active p65 ( RelA ) /p50 heterodimers <END> and results primarily from the targeted degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> , an inhibitor that sequesters <START:ggp> Rel/kappaB <END> in the cytoplasm . 
These data are the first to show a connection between <START:ggp> FGF-1 <END> signaling and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation outside of embryonic development . 
The signaling events that link <START:ggp> FGF receptor-1 <END> engagement and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> Jurkat <END> are probably distinct from the <START:ggp> CD28 <END> costimulation pathway , since <START:ggp> FGF-1 <END> -induced <START:ggp> Rel/kappaB binding proteins <END> do not contain significant levels of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> and are not identical with the <START:ggp> CD28 response complex <END> . 
Escape of human cytomegalovirus from <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> -restricted CD4 ( + ) T-cell response is mediated by repression of <START:ggp> gamma interferon <END> -induced <START:ggp> class II transactivator <END> expression . 
Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) , a betaherpesvirus , is a pathogen which escapes immune recognition through various mechanisms . 
In this paper , we show that HCMV down regulates gamma interferon ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) -induced <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> expression in <START:ana> U373 MG astrocytoma cells <END> due to a defect downstream of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> phosphorylation and nuclear translocation . 
Repression of class II transactivator ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) mRNA expression is detected within the first hours of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -HCMV coincubation and results in the absence of <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> synthesis . 
This defect leads to the absence of presentation of the <START:ggp> major immediate-early protein <END> <START:ggp> IE1 <END> to specific <START:ana> CD4 ( + ) T-cell clones <END> when <START:ana> U373 MG cells <END> , used as <START:ana> antigen-presenting cells <END> , are treated with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> plus HCMV . 
However , presentation of endogenously synthesized <START:ggp> IE1 <END> can be restored when <START:ana> U373 MG cells <END> are transfected with <START:ggp> CIITA <END> prior to infection with HCMV . 
Altogether , the data indicate that the defect induced by HCMV resides in the activation of the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma-responsive promoter <END> of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> . 
This is the first demonstration of a viral inhibition of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> expression . 
3-deazaadenosine , a <START:ggp> S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase <END> inhibitor , has dual effects on <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> regulation . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> transcriptional activity and promotion of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> degradation . 
Previously we reported that 3-deazaadenosine ( DZA ) , a potent inhibitor and substrate for <START:ggp> S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase <END> inhibits bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced transcription of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin-1beta <END> in <START:ana> mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells <END> . 
In this study , we demonstrate the effects of DZA on <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) regulation . 
DZA inhibits the transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> through the hindrance of <START:ggp> p65 <END> ( <START:ggp> Rel-A <END> ) phosphorylation without reduction of its nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity . 
The inhibitory effect of DZA on <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> transcriptional activity is potentiated by the addition of homocysteine . 
Taken together , DZA promotes the proteolytic degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> , but not <START:ggp> IkappaBbeta <END> , resulting in an increase of DNA binding activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in the nucleus in the absence of its transcriptional activity in <START:ana> RAW 264.7 cells <END> . 
The reduction of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> by DZA is neither involved in <START:ggp> IkappaB kinase complex <END> activation nor modulated by the addition of homocysteine . 
This study strongly suggests that DZA may be a potent drug for the treatment of diseases in which <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> plays a central pathogenic role , as well as a useful tool for studying the regulation and physiological functions of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
The role of <START:ana> gamma/delta T cell receptor positive cells <END> in pregnancy . 
PROBLEM : Due to the lack of <START:ggp> classical HLA antigens <END> on the trophoblast , <START:ggp> fetal antigens <END> are possibly presented in a non <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex <END> ( <START:ggp> MHC <END> ) restricted way . 
<START:ana> Decidual gammadelta T cells <END> , which significantly increase in number during pregnancy , might play a role in recognition of <START:ggp> fetal antigens <END> and also in determining the quality of the response to these <START:ggp> antigens <END> . 
Our study was aimed at investigating the role of this cell population in progesterone-dependent immunomodulation . 
METHOD OF STUDY : <START:ana> Peripheral lymphocytes <END> from healthy pregnant women and from habitual aborters were tested by immunocytochemistry for the presence of gamma/delta T cell receptor ( TCR ) and progesterone receptor . 
To investigate the effect of treatment with a pan <START:ggp> anti gamma/delta antibody <END> , <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> were incubated for 3 hr with the antibody , and then <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -10 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and <START:ggp> progesterone-induced blocking factor <END> ( <START:ggp> PIBF <END> ) expression ( by immuno-cytochemistry ) as well as <START:ana> natural killer ( NK ) cell <END> activity were determined . 
RESULTS : In peripheral blood of healthy pregnant women the percentage of <START:ana> gamma/delta TCR+ cells <END> was significantly higher ( P < 0.001 ) than in that of recurrent aborters or of non-pregnant individuals . 
Ninety-seven percent of <START:ana> gamma/delta TCR+ pregnancy lymphocytes <END> expressed <START:ggp> progesterone receptor <END> . 
Binding of a specific antibody to the gamma/delta TCR inhibited PIBF -as well as IL-10 production , whereas it increased NK activity and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> expression . 
CONCLUSIONS : These data suggest the role of <START:ana> gamma/delta TCR-bearing lymphocytes <END> in progesterone-dependent immunomodulation . 
Monocyte adhesion and spreading on <START:ana> human endothelial cells <END> is dependent on <START:ggp> Rho <END> -regulated receptor clustering . 
The <START:ggp> GTPase <END> <START:ggp> Rho <END> is known to mediate the assembly of integrin-containing focal adhesions and actin stress fibers . 
Here , we investigate the role of <START:ggp> Rho <END> in regulating the distribution of the <START:ggp> monocyte-binding receptors <END> <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> , <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> in <START:ana> human endothelial cells <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> Rho <END> activity with <START:ggp> C3 transferase <END> or <START:ggp> N19RhoA <END> , a dominant negative <START:ggp> RhoA mutant <END> , reduced the adhesion of <START:ana> monocytes <END> to activated <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> and inhibited their spreading . 
Similar effects were observed after pretreatment of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> with cytochalasin D . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> dominant negative Rac and Cdc42 proteins <END> did not affect monocyte adhesion or spreading . 
C3 transferase and cytochalasin D did not alter the expression levels of <START:ggp> monocyte-binding receptors <END> on <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> , but did inhibit clustering of <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> , <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> on the cell surface induced by monocyte adhesion or <START:ggp> cross-linking antibodies <END> . 
Similarly , <START:ggp> N19RhoA <END> inhibited receptor clustering . 
Monocyte adhesion and receptor cross-linking induced stress fiber assembly , and inhibitors of <START:ggp> myosin light chain kinase <END> prevented this response but did not affect receptor clustering . 
Finally , receptor clusters colocalized with <START:ggp> ezrin/moesin/radixin proteins <END> . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> Rho <END> is required in <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> for the assembly of stable adhesions with <START:ana> monocytes <END> via the clustering of <START:ggp> monocyte-binding receptors <END> and their association with the actin cytoskeleton , independent of stress fiber formation . 
Selection of the T cell repertoire . 
Advances in gene technology have allowed the manipulation of molecular interactions that shape the T cell repertoire . 
Although recognized as fundamental aspects of <START:ana> T lymphocyte <END> development , only recently have the mechanisms governing positive and negative selection been examined at a molecular level . 
Positive selection refers to the active process of rescuing <START:ana> MHC-restricted thymocytes <END> from programmed cell death . 
Negative selection refers to the deletion or inactivation of potentially <START:ana> autoreactive thymocytes <END> . 
This review focuses on interactions during <START:ana> thymocyte <END> maturation that define the T cell repertoire , with an emphasis placed on current literature within this field . 
<START:ggp> CD28 <END> costimulation augments <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion of activated lamina propria T cells by increasing mRNA stability without enhancing <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> gene transactivation . 
The pathways leading to activation in <START:ana> lamina propria ( LP ) T cells <END> are different from <START:ana> peripheral T cells <END> . 
<START:ana> LP T cells <END> exhibit enhanced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion when activated through the <START:ggp> CD2 <END> pathway . 
Coligation of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> leads to synergistic enhancement of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion . 
Previous studies have characterized the <START:ggp> CD28 <END> augmentation of <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated signaling in <START:ana> peripheral blood T cells <END> through transcriptional activation of an <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> promoter <START:ggp> CD28 response element <END> ( <START:ggp> CD28RE <END> ) , along with enhanced mRNA stability . 
This study characterized molecular events involved in <START:ggp> CD28 <END> costimulation of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production in <START:ana> LP mononuclear cells ( LPMC ) <END> . 
<START:ana> LPMC <END> exhibited increased <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production in response to <START:ggp> CD28 <END> costimulation , compared with cells activated through <START:ggp> CD2 <END> alone . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion was paralleled by increased expression of <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> , resulting from enhanced <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> stability . 
In contrast to transcriptional activation in <START:ana> PBMC <END> , EMSA revealed that <START:ggp> CD28 <END> coligation of <START:ana> CD2-activated LPMC <END> does not result in increased binding of trans-factors to the <START:ggp> CD28RE <END> , nor did Western blots detect changes in <START:ggp> I-kappaBalpha <END> or <START:ggp> I-kappaBbeta <END> levels following <START:ggp> CD28 <END> coligation . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> CD28 <END> coligation fails to enhance <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter-reporter <END> or <START:ggp> RE/AP <END> construct expression in <START:ana> CD2-activated LPMC <END> . 
The results reported herein indicate that the molecular mechanisms involved in <START:ggp> CD28 <END> cosignaling and regulation of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion in <START:ana> LP T cells <END> are unique to that compartment and differ from those seen in <START:ana> peripheral blood T cells <END> . 
These observations suggest a biological significance for different mechanisms of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> activation in initiation and maintenance of the <START:ggp> cytokine repertoire <END> found in the mucosa . 
Expression of <START:ggp> Th1 and Th2 type cytokines <END> responding to <START:ggp> HBsAg <END> and <START:ggp> HBxAg <END> in chronic hepatitis B patients . 
The <START:ggp> cytokine pattern <END> on viral antigen recognition is believed to exert a profound influence on the resolution of viral infections and viral clearance . 
This study was initiated to investigate whether a <START:ggp> cytokine <END> imbalance oriented toward Th2 type response plays a role in chronic hepatitis B . 
<START:ggp> Cytokine profiles <END> of <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> associated with chronic hepatitis B were analysed by RT-PCR . 
Upon <START:ggp> HBsAg <END> stimulation , expression of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> was detected in 41 % , 8 % , 41 % , and 50 % of the patients , respectively . 
Among these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , the expression of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> was associated with high levels of <START:ggp> serum AST/ALT <END> . 
However , we could not prove that <START:ggp> Th2 type cytokines <END> had a protective effect on <START:ana> hepatocytes <END> . 
Upon <START:ggp> HBxAg <END> stimulation , there was no recognizable association of <START:ggp> cytokine patterns <END> with AST/ALT levels . 
In conclusion , production of a <START:ggp> Th1 cytokine <END> , <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , by <START:ggp> HBsAg <END> -reactive cells was associated with hepatocyte damage in chronic hepatitis B , while no counteracting effect of <START:ggp> Th2 cytokines <END> produced by those cells was observed . 
Apoptosis and growth inhibition in <START:ana> malignant lymphocytes <END> after treatment with arsenic trioxide at clinically achievable concentrations [ see comments ] 
BACKGROUND : Arsenic trioxide ( As2O3 ) can induce clinical remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia via induction of differentiation and programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) . 
We investigated the effects of As2O3 on a panel of <START:ana> malignant lymphocytes <END> to determine whether growth-inhibitory and apoptotic effects of As2O3 can be observed in these cells at clinically achievable concentrations . 
METHODS : Eight <START:ana> malignant lymphocytic cell lines <END> and <START:ana> primary cultures <END> of <START:ana> lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma cells <END> were treated with As2O3 , with or without dithiothreitol ( DTT ) or buthionine sulfoximine ( BSO ) ( an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis ) . 
Apoptosis was assessed by cell morphology , flow cytometry , annexin V protein level , and <START:ggp> terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <END> labeling of <START:ggp> DNA fragments <END> . 
Cellular proliferation was determined by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA and flow cytometry and by use of a mitotic arrest assay . 
Mitochondrial transmembrane potential ( delta psi ( m ) ) was measured by means of rhodamine 123 staining and flow cytometry . 
Protein expression was assessed by western blot analysis or immunofluorescence . 
RESULTS : Therapeutic concentrations of As2O3 ( 1-2 microM ) had dual effects on <START:ana> malignant lymphocytes <END> : 1 ) inhibition of growth through adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) depletion and prolongation of cell cycle time and 2 ) induction of apoptosis . 
As2O3-induced apoptosis was preceded by delta psi ( m ) collapse . 
DTT antagonized and BSO enhanced As2O3-induced ATP depletion , delta psi ( m ) collapse , and apoptosis . 
<START:ggp> Caspase-3 <END> activation , usually resulting from delta psi ( m ) collapse , was not always associated with As2O3-induced apoptosis . 
As2O3 induced PML ( promyelocytic leukemia ) protein degradation but did not modulate expression of <START:ggp> cell cycle-related proteins <END> , including <START:ggp> c-myc <END> , <START:ggp> retinoblastoma protein <END> , <START:ggp> cyclin-dependent kinase 4 <END> , <START:ggp> cyclin D1 <END> , and <START:ggp> p53 <END> , or expression of <START:ggp> differentiation-related antigens <END> . 
CONCLUSIONS : Substantial growth inhibition and apoptosis without evidence of differentiation were induced in most <START:ana> malignant lymphocytic cells <END> treated with 1-2 microM As2O3 . 
As2O3 may prove useful in the treatment of malignant lymphoproliferative disorders . 
Control of cell cycle entry and apoptosis in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> infected by Epstein-Barr virus . 
Infection of <START:ana> human B cells <END> with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) results in activation of the cell cycle and cell growth . 
To interpret the mechanisms by which EBV activates the cell , we have assayed many proteins involved in control of the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle and regulation of apoptosis . 
In EBV infection most of the changes , including the early induction of <START:ggp> cyclin D2 <END> , are dependent on expression of <START:ggp> EBV genes <END> , but an alteration in the <START:ggp> E2F-4 <END> profile was partly independent of viral gene expression , presumably occurring in response to signal transduction activated when the virus binds to its receptor , <START:ggp> CD21 <END> . 
By comparing the expression of genes controlling apoptosis , including those encoding several members of the <START:ggp> BCL-2 family <END> of proteins , the known relative resistance of <START:ana> EBV-immortalized B-cell lines <END> to apoptosis induced by low serum was found to correlate with expression of both <START:ggp> BCL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> A20 <END> . 
A20 can be regulated by the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , which is known to be activated by the <START:ggp> EBV LMP-1 protein <END> . 
Quantitative assays demonstrated a direct temporal relationship between <START:ggp> LMP-1 protein <END> levels and active <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> during the time course of infection . 
<START:ggp> CTLA-4 <END> -Mediated inhibition of early events of T cell proliferation . 
<START:ggp> CTLA-4 <END> engagement by <START:ggp> mAbs <END> inhibits , while <START:ggp> CD28 <END> enhances , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production and proliferation upon T cell activation . 
Here , we have analyzed the mechanisms involved in <START:ggp> CTLA-4 <END> -mediated inhibition of T cell activation of naive <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> using Ab cross-linking . 
<START:ggp> CTLA-4 <END> ligation inhibited CD3/ <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -induced <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> accumulation by inhibiting <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcription , which appears to be mediated in part through decreasing <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> accumulation in the nuclei . 
However , <START:ggp> CTLA-4 <END> ligation did not appear to affect the <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -mediated stabilization of <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> . 
Further , <START:ggp> CTLA-4 <END> engagement inhibited progression through the cell cycle by inhibiting the production of <START:ggp> cyclin D3 <END> , <START:ggp> cyclin-dependent kinase <END> <START:ggp> ( cdk ) 4 <END> , and <START:ggp> cdk6 <END> when the <START:ana> T cells <END> were stimulated with <START:ggp> anti-CD3/CD28 <END> and with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> alone . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> CTLA-4 <END> signaling inhibits events early in T cell activation both at <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcription and at the level of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -independent events of the cell cycle , and does not simply oppose <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -mediated costimulation . 
The <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> cooperates with the <START:ggp> erythropoietin receptor <END> and <START:ggp> c-Kit <END> to enhance and sustain proliferation of <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> in vitro . 
Although <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> Epo <END> ) is essential for the production of <START:ana> mature red blood cells <END> , the cooperation with other factors is required for a proper balance between progenitor proliferation and differentiation . 
In avian <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> , steroid hormones cooperate with <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase receptors <END> to induce renewal of <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> . 
We examined the role of corticosteroids in the in vitro expansion of <START:ana> primary human erythroid cells <END> in liquid cultures and colony assays . 
Dexamethasone ( Dex ) , a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone , cooperated with <START:ggp> Epo <END> and <START:ggp> stem cell factor <END> to induce <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> to undergo 15 to 22 cell divisions , corresponding to a 10 ( 5 ) - to 10 ( 6 ) -fold amplification of <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> . 
Dex acted directly on <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> and maintained the colony-forming capacity of the <START:ana> progenitor cells <END> expanded in <START:ana> liquid cultures <END> . 
The hormone delayed terminal differentiation into <START:ana> erythrocytes <END> , which was assayed by morphology , <START:ggp> hemoglobin <END> accumulation , and the expression of genes characteristic for <START:ana> immature cells <END> . 
Sustained proliferation of <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> could be induced equally well from <START:ana> purified erythroid burst-forming units <END> ( <START:ana> BFU-E <END> ) , from <START:ana> CD34 ( + ) blast cells <END> , and from bone marrow depleted from <START:ana> CD34 ( + ) cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> functions as both a <START:ggp> proapoptotic and antiapoptotic regulatory factor <END> within a single cell type . 
Recently <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> has been shown to have both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic functions . 
In <START:ana> T cell hybridomas <END> , both T cell activators and glucocorticoids induce apoptosis . 
Here we show that blockade of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity , using a <START:ggp> dominant negative IkappaBalpha <END> , has opposite effects on these two apoptotic signals . 
Treatment with PMA plus ionomycin ( P/I ) results in the upregulation of <START:ggp> Fas Ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> FasL <END> ) and induction of apoptosis . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity inhibits the P/I mediated induction of <START:ana> FasL mRNA <END> and decreases the level of apoptosis in these cultures , thus establishing <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> as a <START:ggp> proapoptotic factor <END> in this context . 
Conversely , inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> confers a tenfold increase in glucocorticoid mediated apoptosis , establishing that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> also functions as an antiapoptotic factor . 
We conclude that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> is a context-dependent apoptosis regulator . 
Our data suggests that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> may function as an antiapoptotic factor in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> while functioning as a proapoptotic factor in <START:ana> mature peripheral T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> SOCS-3 <END> is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> and suppresses <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> phosphorylation and lymphocyte proliferation . 
Members of the recently discovered <START:ggp> SOCS/CIS/SSI family <END> have been proposed as regulators of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> signaling , and while targets and mechanisms have been suggested for some family members , the precise role of these proteins remains to be defined . 
To date no <START:ggp> SOCS proteins <END> have been specifically implicated in <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) signaling in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Here we report <START:ggp> SOCS-3 <END> expression in response to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in both <START:ana> T-cell lines <END> and <START:ana> human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> SOCS-3 <END> protein was detectable as early as 30 min following <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> stimulation , while <START:ggp> CIS <END> was seen only at low levels after 2 h . 
Unlike <START:ggp> CIS <END> , <START:ggp> SOCS-3 <END> was rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
Tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> SOCS-3 <END> was observed upon coexpression with <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> and <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> but only weakly with <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> . 
In these experiments , <START:ggp> SOCS-3 <END> associated with <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> and inhibited <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> phosphorylation , and this inhibition was markedly enhanced by the presence of <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor beta chain <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2Rbeta <END> ) . 
Moreover , following <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> stimulation of <START:ana> T cells <END> , <START:ggp> SOCS-3 <END> was able to interact with the <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor complex <END> , and in particular <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphorylated Jak1 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2Rbeta <END> . 
Additionally , in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> expressing <START:ggp> SOCS-3 <END> but not <START:ggp> CIS <END> , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT5b <END> was markedly reduced , while there was only a weak effect on <START:ggp> IL-3-mediated STAT5b <END> tyrosine phosphorylation . 
Finally , proliferation induced by both <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -and <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> was significantly inhibited in the presence of <START:ggp> SOCS-3 <END> . 
The findings suggest that when <START:ggp> SOCS-3 <END> is rapidly induced by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> , it acts to inhibit <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> responses in a classical negative feedback loop . 
<START:ana> Human alveolar macrophages <END> are markedly deficient in <START:ggp> REF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> DNA binding activity . 
Although many functions of <START:ana> human alveolar macrophages <END> are altered compared with their <START:ana> precursor cell <END> , the <START:ana> blood monocyte <END> ( <START:ana> monocyte <END> ) , the reason ( s ) for these functional changes have not been determined . 
We recently reported that <START:ana> human alveolar macrophages <END> do not express <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> DNA binding activity ( Monick , M. M. , Carter , A. B. , Gudmundsson , G. , Geist , L. J. , and Hunninghake , G. W. ( 1998 ) Am. J. Physiol. 275 , L389-L397 ) . 
To determine why <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> do not express <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> DNA binding activity , we first showed that there was not a decrease in expression of the <START:ggp> FOS and JUN proteins <END> that make up the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> complex . 
There was , however , a significant difference in the amounts of the <START:ggp> nuclear protein <END> , <START:ggp> REF-1 <END> ( which regulates <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> DNA binding by altering the redox status of <START:ggp> FOS <END> and <START:ggp> JUN proteins <END> ) , in <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> compared with <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
In addition , in vitro differentiation of <START:ana> monocytes <END> to a <START:ana> macrophage-like cell <END> resulted in decreased amounts of <START:ggp> REF-1 <END> . 
Finally , addition of <START:ggp> REF-1 <END> from <START:ana> activated monocytes <END> to alveolar macrophage nuclear proteins resulted in a marked increase in <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> DNA binding . 
These studies strongly suggest that the process of differentiation of <START:ana> monocytes <END> into <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> is associated with a loss of <START:ggp> REF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity . 
This observation may explain , in part , some of the functional differences observed for <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> compared with <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Development and maturation of secondary lymphoid tissues . 
The secondary lymphoid tissues are located at strategic sites where <START:ggp> foreign antigens <END> can be efficiently brought together with <START:ana> immune system regulatory and effector cells <END> . 
The organized structure of the secondary lymphoid tissues is thought to enhance the sensitivity of antigen recognition and to support proper regulation of the activation and maturation of the <START:ana> antigen-responsive lymphoid cells <END> . 
Although a substantial amount is known about the <START:ggp> cellular elements <END> that compose the lymphoid and nonlymphoid components of the secondary lymphoid tissues , information concerning the signals that control the development of the tissues and that maintain the organized tissue microenvironment remain undefined . 
Studies over the past few years have identified lymphotoxin as a critical signaling molecule not only for the organogenesis of secondary lymphoid tissues but for the maintenance of aspects of their microarchitecture as well . 
Additional signaling molecules that contribute to the formation of normal lymphoid tissue structure are being identified at an accelerating pace . 
Analyses of mouse strains with congenital defects in different aspects of secondary lymphoid tissue development are beginning to clarify the role of these tissues in immune responses and host defense . 
This review focuses on studies defining recently identified crucial signals for the biogenesis of secondary lymphoid organs and for the maintenance of their proper microarchitecture . 
It also discusses new insights into how the structure of these tissues supports effective immune responses . 
Modulation of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> expression : distinct regulatory pathways during activation and replicative senescence . 
The <START:ggp> costimulatory molecule <END> <START:ggp> CD28 <END> has a restricted tissue distribution and is expressed on <START:ana> T cells <END> and some <START:ana> plasmacytoma cells <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> CD28 <END> is constitutively expressed , its expression is transiently down-regulated following T cell activation and declines progressively with in vitro senescence . 
In vivo , <START:ana> CD8+ T cells <END> and , less frequently , <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> may completely lose <START:ggp> CD28 <END> surface expression during chronic infections and with aging . 
This correlates with changes of nuclear protein-binding activities to two motifs , <START:ggp> site alpha and beta <END> , within the <START:ggp> CD28 minimal promoter <END> . 
Both alpha- and beta-bound complexes are found only in lymphoid tissues , in <START:ana> CD28+ T cells <END> , and in some <START:ana> transformed B cells <END> . 
These complexes are coordinately expressed except during replicative senescence , which is characterized by the down-modulation of <START:ggp> site beta <END> -but not <START:ggp> site alpha <END> -binding activities . 
In contrast , T cell activation induces a parallel decline in both site alpha- and beta-binding activities . 
CD4+ and <START:ana> CD8+ T cells <END> differ in their beta-binding profiles , which may explain the more pronounced down-regulation of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> in senescent <START:ana> CD8+ T cells <END> . 
In vivo expanded <START:ana> CD4+CD28null and CD8+CD28null T cells <END> uniformly lack <START:ggp> alpha- and beta- bound complexes <END> , resembling the pattern seen in <START:ana> chronically activated cells <END> and not of <START:ana> senescent cells <END> . 
A role for <START:ggp> RanBP1 <END> in the release of <START:ggp> CRM1 <END> from the <START:ggp> nuclear pore complex <END> in a terminal step of nuclear export . 
We recently developed an assay in which nuclear export of the shuttling <START:ggp> transcription factor NFAT <END> ( <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ) can be reconstituted in permeabilized cells with the <START:ggp> GTPase <END> <START:ggp> Ran <END> and the nuclear export receptor <START:ggp> CRM1 <END> . 
We have now used this assay to identify another export factor . 
After preincubation of <START:ana> permeabilized cells <END> with a <START:ggp> Ran mutant <END> that can not hydrolyze GTP ( <START:ggp> RanQ69L <END> ) , cytosol supports <START:ggp> NFAT <END> export , but <START:ggp> CRM1 <END> and <START:ggp> Ran <END> alone do not . 
The <START:ggp> RanQ69L <END> preincubation leads to accumulation of <START:ggp> CRM1 <END> at the cytoplasmic periphery of the <START:ggp> nuclear pore complex <END> ( <START:ggp> NPC <END> ) in association with the <START:ggp> p62 complex <END> and Can/Nup214 . 
<START:ggp> Ran <END> GTP-dependent association of <START:ggp> CRM1 <END> with these <START:ggp> nucleoporins <END> was reconstituted in vitro . 
By biochemical fractionation and reconstitution , we showed that <START:ggp> RanBP1 <END> restores nuclear export after the <START:ggp> RanQ69L <END> preincubation . 
It also stimulates nuclear export in cells that have not been preincubated with <START:ggp> RanQ69L <END> . 
<START:ggp> RanBP1 <END> as well as <START:ggp> Ran-binding domains <END> of the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic nucleoporin <END> <START:ggp> RanBP2 <END> promote the release of <START:ggp> CRM1 <END> from the <START:ggp> NPC <END> . 
Taken together , our results indicate that <START:ggp> Ran <END> GTP is important for the targeting of export complexes to the cytoplasmic side of the <START:ggp> NPC <END> and that <START:ggp> RanBP1 <END> and probably <START:ggp> RanBP2 <END> are involved in the dissociation of <START:ggp> nuclear export complexes <END> from the <START:ggp> NPC <END> in a terminal step of transport . 
<START:ggp> c-Myc <END> and <START:ggp> E1A <END> induced cellular sensitivity to <START:ana> activated NK cells <END> involves cytotoxic granules as death effectors . 
The contact of <START:ana> natural killer ( NK ) cells <END> with <START:ana> foreign cells <END> and with certain <START:ana> virus-infected or tumor cells <END> triggers the cytolytic machinery of <START:ana> NK cells <END> . 
This triggering leads to exocytosis of the <START:ana> cytotoxic NK cell granules <END> . 
The <START:ggp> oncoproteins <END> <START:ggp> c-Myc <END> and <START:ggp> E1A <END> render cells vulnerable to NK cell mediated cytolysis yet the mechanisms of sensitization are not well understood . 
In a model where <START:ana> foreign cells <END> ( <START:ana> rat fibroblasts <END> ) were cocultured with <START:ana> human IL-2 activated NK cells <END> , we observed that <START:ana> NK cells <END> were capable of efficiently killing their targets only if the cells overexpressed the oncogene <START:ggp> c-Myc <END> or <START:ggp> E1A <END> . 
Both the parental and the <START:ana> oncogene expressing fibroblasts <END> similarly triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the bound <START:ana> NK cells <END> , demonstrating that <START:ana> NK cells <END> were cytolytically activated in contact with both resistant parental and <START:ana> oncogene expressing sensitive target fibroblasts <END> . 
The cell death was independent of <START:ggp> wild-type p53 <END> and was not inhibited by an <START:ggp> anti-apoptotic protein EIB19K <END> . 
These results provided evidence that <START:ggp> c-Myc <END> and <START:ggp> E1A <END> activated the NK cell induced cytolysis at a post-triggering stage of NK cell-target cell interaction . 
In consistence , the <START:ggp> c-Myc <END> and <START:ggp> E1A <END> overexpressing <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> were more sensitive to the cytolytic effects of isolated NK cell-derived granules than <START:ana> parental cells <END> . 
The data indicate that <START:ggp> oncogenes <END> activate the cytotoxicity of NK cell granules . 
This mechanism can have a role in directing the cytolytic action of <START:ana> NK cells <END> towards the <START:ana> virus-infected and cancer cells <END> . 
<START:ana> Unicellular-unilineage erythropoietic cultures <END> : molecular analysis of regulatory gene expression at sibling cell level . 
In vitro studies on hematopoietic control mechanisms have been hampered by the heterogeneity of the analyzed cell populations , ie , lack of lineage specificity and developmental stage homogeneity of <START:ana> progenitor/precursor cells <END> growing in culture . 
We developed unicellular culture systems for unilineage differentiation of <START:ana> purified hematopoietic progenitor cells <END> followed by daughter cell analysis at cellular and molecular level . 
In the culture system reported here , ( 1 ) the <START:ggp> growth factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GF <END> ) stimulus induces <START:ana> cord blood ( CB ) progenitor cells <END> to proliferate and differentiate/mature exclusively along the <START:ana> erythroid lineage <END> ; ( 2 ) this erythropoietic wave is characterized by less than 4 % apoptotic cells ; ( 3 ) asymmetric divisions are virtually absent , ie , nonresponsive <START:ana> hematopoietic progenitors <END> with no erythropoietic potential are forced into apoptosis ; ( 4 ) the system is cell division controlled ( cdc ) , ie , the number of divisions performed by each cell is monitored . 
Single-cell <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase <END> -polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analysis was applied to this culture system to investigate gene expression of diverse <START:ggp> receptors <END> , <START:ggp> markers of differentiation <END> , and <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> ( <START:ggp> EKLF <END> , <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> , <START:ggp> p45 NF-E2 <END> , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , and <START:ggp> SCL/Tal1 <END> ) at discrete stages of erythropoietic development . 
Freshly isolated <START:ana> CD34 ( + ) cells <END> expressed <START:ggp> CD34 <END> , <START:ggp> c-kit <END> , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , and <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> but did not express <START:ggp> CD36 <END> , <START:ggp> erythropoietin receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> EpoR <END> ) , <START:ggp> SCL/Tal1 <END> , <START:ggp> EKLF <END> , NF-E2 , <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , or <START:ggp> glyocophorin A <END> ( <START:ggp> GPA <END> ) . 
In early to intermediate stages of erythroid differentiation we monitored the induction of <START:ggp> CD36 <END> , <START:ggp> Tal1 <END> , <START:ggp> EKLF <END> , <START:ggp> NF-E2 <END> , and <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> that preceeded expression of <START:ggp> EpoR <END> . 
In late stages of erythroid maturation , <START:ggp> GPA <END> was upregulated , whereas <START:ggp> CD34 <END> , <START:ggp> c-kit <END> , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , and <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> were barely or not detected . 
In addition , competitive single-cell RT-PCR was used to assay <START:ana> CD34 mRNA transcripts <END> in <START:ana> sibling CD34 ( + ) CD38 ( - ) cells <END> differentiating in <START:ana> unilineage erythroid cultures <END> : this analysis allowed us to semiquantitate the gradual downmodulation of <START:ana> CD34 mRNA <END> from <START:ana> progenitor cells <END> through their <START:ana> differentiating erythroid progeny <END> . 
It is concluded that this novel culture system , coupled with single-cell RT-PCR analysis , may eliminate the ambiguities intrinsic to molecular studies on heterogeneous populations of <START:ana> hematopoietic progenitors/precursors <END> growing in culture , particularly in the initial stages of development . 
Differences in phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> IL-2R associated JAK/STAT proteins <END> between <START:ana> HTLV-I ( + ) , IL-2-independent and IL-2-dependent cell lines <END> and <START:ana> uncultured leukemic cells <END> from patients with adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia . 
To determine activation status of the <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> -associated ( <START:ggp> Jak/STAT <END> ) pathway in the <START:ana> HTLV-I infected cells <END> , we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> in several <START:ana> HTLV-I ( + ) T-cell lines <END> and in <START:ana> uncultured leukemic T cells <END> isolated from patients with adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia ( ATLL ) . 
Constitutive basal phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> and , usually , <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> was detected in all four <START:ana> IL-2-independent cell lines <END> tested , but in none of the three <START:ana> IL-2-dependent cell lines <END> . 
Similarly , there was no detectable basal phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> in the <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> from ATLL patients ( 0/8 and 0/3 , respectively ) . 
However , stimulation with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> resulted in <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> phosphorylation in both <START:ana> leukemic ATLL cells <END> and <START:ana> IL-2-dependent lines <END> . 
Furthermore , expression of <START:ggp> SHP-1 phosphatase <END> which is a negative regulator of <START:ggp> cytokine receptor <END> signaling , was lost in most <START:ana> IL-2 independent cell lines <END> ( 3/4 ) but not in the leukemic <START:ana> ATLL cells <END> ( 0/3 ) . 
Finally , the <START:ana> HTLV-I ( + ) T-cell lines <END> ( 313 ) but not the control , <START:ana> HTLV-I ( - ) T-cell lines <END> were resistant to rapamycin and its novel analog RAD . 
We conclude that ( 1 ) HTLV-I infection per se does not result in a constitutive phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> proteins ; ( 2 ) malignant transformation in at least some cases of ATLL does not require the constitutive , but may require <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced , activation of the <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> <START:ggp> Jak/STAT <END> pathway ; and ( 3 ) there are major differences in T-cell immortalization mechanism ( s ) which appear to involve <START:ggp> SHP-1 <END> and target molecules for rapamycin and RAD . 
Clonality analysis using <START:ggp> X-chromosome <END> inactivation at the <START:ggp> human androgen receptor gene <END> ( <START:ggp> Humara <END> ) . 
Evaluation of large cohorts of patients with chronic myeloproliferative diseases , secondary neutrophilia , and reactive thrombocytosis . 
Chronic myeloproliferative diseases ( MPDs ) are not associated with consistent cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities . 
Demonstration of clonal cell growth by analysis of <START:ggp> X-chromosome <END> inactivation ( XCI ) patterns in females provides a promising tool for diagnosis . 
However , this technique can be complicated by excessive lyonization of normal cells mimicking clonal cell growth : We analyzed XCI patterns at the <START:ggp> human androgen receptor ( HUMARA ) locus <END> in 146 healthy females , 65 women with secondary neutrophilia , 31 women with reactive thrombocytosis , and 86 women with chronic MPDs . 
A skewed XCI pattern with greater than 75 % amplification of 1 <START:ggp> allele <END> ( <START:ggp> allele <END> ratio > 3 : 1 ) was found in 22 ( 9.1 % ) of 242 control subjects . 
The incidence of skewing was statistically significantly lower in women younger than 30 years ( 2/73 ) compared with women older than 60 years ( 10/53 ) . 
Of 86 patients with a chronic MPD , 71 ( 82 % ) exhibited an <START:ggp> allele <END> ratio greater than 3 : 1 , whereas only 10 ( 12 % ) of 86 age-matched control subjects showed a skewed XCI pattern . 
Although statistical evaluation of the data showed a significant difference between patients with a chronic MPD and control subjects , proof of clonality in individual , especially elderly , patients is difficult . 
<START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> cooperate to promote erythroid cell survival by regulating <START:ggp> bcl-xL <END> expression . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> is essential for normal erythropoiesis . 
By examining in <START:ana> vitro-differentiated embryonic stem cells <END> , we showed previously that in the absence of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , <START:ana> committed erythroid precursors <END> fail to complete maturation and instead undergo apoptosis . 
The mechanisms by which <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> controls cell survival are unknown . 
Here we report that in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> , <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> strongly induces the expression of the <START:ggp> anti-apoptotic protein <END> <START:ggp> bcl-xL <END> , but not the related proteins <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> and <START:ggp> mcl-1 <END> . 
Consistent with a role for <START:ggp> bcl-xL <END> in mediating <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> -induced erythroid cell survival , in <START:ana> vitro-differentiated bcl-xL-/- embryonic stem cells <END> fail to generate viable mature definitive <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> , a phenotype resembling that of <START:ggp> GATA-1 gene <END> disruption . 
In addition , we show that <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> , which is also required for erythroid cell survival , cooperates with <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> to stimulate <START:ggp> bcl-xL <END> gene expression and to maintain erythroid cell viability during terminal maturation . 
Together , our data show that <START:ggp> bcl-xL <END> is essential for normal erythroid development and suggest a regulatory hierarchy in which <START:ggp> bcl-xL <END> is a critical downstream effector of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> -mediated signals . 
<START:ggp> p70 ( s6k ) <END> integrates <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> and rapamycin-regulated signals for <START:ggp> E2F <END> regulation in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
In <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , the <START:ggp> hematopoietic cytokine <END> <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) uses <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> ) -induced signaling pathways to regulate <START:ggp> E2F <END> transcriptional activity , a critical cell cycle checkpoint . 
<START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> also regulates the activity of <START:ggp> p70 ( s6k ) <END> , the <START:ggp> 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase <END> , a response that is abrogated by the macrolide rapamycin . 
This immunosuppressive drug is known to prevent T-cell proliferation , but the precise point at which rapamycin regulates T-cell cycle progression has yet to be elucidated . 
Moreover , the effects of rapamycin on , and the role of <START:ggp> p70 ( s6k ) <END> in , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> activation of <START:ggp> E2Fs <END> have not been characterized . 
Our present results show that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -and <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> -induced pathways for the regulation of <START:ggp> E2F <END> transcriptional activity include both rapamycin-resistant and rapamycin-sensitive components . 
Expression of a <START:ggp> rapamycin-resistant mutant <END> of <START:ggp> p70 ( s6k ) <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> could restore rapamycin-suppressed <START:ggp> E2F <END> responses . 
Thus , the rapamycin-controlled processes involved in <START:ggp> E2F <END> regulation appear to be mediated by <START:ggp> p70 ( s6k ) <END> . 
However , the <START:ggp> rapamycin-resistant p70 ( s6k ) <END> could not rescue rapamycin inhibition of T-cell cycle entry , consistent with the involvement of additional , rapamycin-sensitive pathways in the control of T-cell cycle progression . 
The present results thus show that <START:ggp> p70 ( s6k ) <END> is able to regulate <START:ggp> E2F <END> transcriptional activity and provide direct evidence for the first time for a link between <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> receptors , <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> , and <START:ggp> p70 ( s6k ) <END> that regulates a crucial G1 checkpoint in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Oxidative stress triggers <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> . 
Oxidizing agents are powerful activators of factors responsible for the transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> cytokine-encoding genes <END> involved in tissue injury . 
In this study we show evidence that <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> is a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> whose activity is modulated by H2O2 in <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> , in which endogenous <START:ggp> catalase <END> had previously been inhibited . 
H2O2-induced nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> to form <START:ggp> sequence-specific DNA-bound complexes <END> was evidenced by immunoblotting of nuclear fractions and electrophoretic mobility shift assays , and vanadate was found to strongly synergize with H2O2 . 
Moreover , anti- <START:ggp> STAT3 antibodies <END> specifically precipitated a protein of <START:ggp> 92 kDa <END> that becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine upon lymphocyte treatment with H2O2 . 
Phenylarsine oxide , a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor , and genistein , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , cooperated and cancelled , respectively , the H2O2-promoted <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> nuclear translocation . 
Evidence is also presented , using Fe2+/Cu2+ ions , that.OH generated from H2O2 through Fenton reactions could be a candidate oxygen reactive species to directly activate <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> . 
Present data suggest that H2O2 and vanadate are likely to inhibit the activity of <START:ggp> intracellular tyrosine phosphatase <END> ( s ) , leading to enhanced <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> tyrosine phosphorylation and hence its translocation to the nucleus . 
These results demonstrate that the DNA binding activity of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> can be modulated by oxidizing agents and provide a framework to understand the effects of oxidative stress on the <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> -STAT <END> signaling pathway . 
Transcriptional regulation of T lymphocyte development and function . 
The development and function of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> are regulated tightly by signal transduction pathways that include specific <START:ggp> cell-surface receptors <END> , <START:ggp> intracellular signaling molecules <END> , and <START:ggp> nuclear transcription factors <END> . 
Since 1988 , several families of functionally important <START:ggp> T cell transcription factors <END> have been identified . 
These include the <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> , <START:ggp> LKLF <END> , and <START:ggp> GATA3 zinc-finger proteins <END> ; the <START:ggp> Ets <END> , <START:ggp> CREB/ATF <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel/NFAT transcription factors <END> ; the <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> ; and <START:ggp> HMG box transcription factors <END> such as <START:ggp> LEF1 <END> , <START:ggp> TCF1 <END> , and <START:ggp> Sox4 <END> . 
In this review , we summarize our current understanding of the transcriptional regulation of T cell development and function with particular emphasis on the results of recent gene targeting and transgenic experiments . 
In addition to increasing our understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate T cell development and function , these results have suggested novel targets for genetic and pharmacological manipulation of T cell immunity . 
In vivo inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> T-lineage cells <END> leads to a dramatic decrease in cell proliferation and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production and to increased cell apoptosis in response to mitogenic stimuli , but not to abnormal thymopoiesis . 
To understand the role of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> complexes in T cell development and activation , we have generated transgenic mice in which <START:ggp> RelA <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel complexes <END> were selectively inhibited in the <START:ana> T-lineage cells <END> by specific expression of a trans-dominant form of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
Transgene expression did not affect the thymic development , but led to lowered numbers of splenic <START:ana> T cells <END> and to a dramatic decrease in the ex vivo proliferative response of <START:ana> splenic T lymphocytes <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> expression demonstrated that the perturbation of the proliferation response was not attributable to an abnormal expression of these genes . 
In contrast , expression of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> was strongly inhibited in the <START:ana> transgenic T cells <END> . 
The proliferative deficiency of the <START:ana> transgenic T cells <END> was associated with an increased apoptosis . 
These results point out the involvement of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel family proteins <END> in growth signaling pathways by either <START:ggp> regulating proteins <END> involved in the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> signaling or by functionally interfering with the cell cycle progression . 
Paradoxical priming effects of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> on <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> is a well-known <START:ggp> immunosuppressive and/or anti-inflammatory cytokine <END> . 
However , we report in vitro experimental studies in which <START:ana> IL-10 primed leukocytes <END> and led to an enhanced production of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) upon further stimulation by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . 
<START:ana> Monocytes <END> and <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) prepared from whole blood maintained for 20 h at 37 degrees C in the presence of <START:ggp> recombinant human IL-10 <END> had an enhanced capacity to produce <START:ggp> TNF <END> in response to LPS . 
In addition to <START:ggp> TNF <END> , LPS-induced IL-6 and spontaneous IL-1ra production were also enhanced . 
When isolated <START:ana> PBMC <END> were first cultured for 20 h in the presence of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> on Teflon to prevent adherence , washed to remove <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and then further cultured in plastic dishes for an additional 20 h in the presence of LPS or <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> , an enhanced release of <START:ggp> TNF <END> was observed . 
This was not the case when <START:ana> PBMC <END> were pre-cultured in plastic multidishes in the presence of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> . 
<START:ana> TNF mRNA <END> expression induced by LPS was decreased when the pre-treatment of <START:ana> PBMC <END> with <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> was performed on plastic , whereas this was not the case when cells were pre-cultured with <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> on Teflon . 
Furthermore , NFkappaB translocation following LPS activation was higher after <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> pre-treatment on Teflon than on plastic . 
Interestingly , an enhanced frequency of <START:ggp> CD16 <END> and CD68 ( + ) cells among the CD14 ( + ) cells was observed in the presence of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , independently of the pre-culture conditions of the <START:ana> PBMC <END> . 
Altogether , these results indicate that the <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> -induced up-regulation of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production depends on the prevention of monocyte adherence by <START:ana> red cells <END> in the whole blood assays or by cultures of <START:ana> PBMC <END> on Teflon . 
In contrast , the adherence parameter has no effect on the <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> -induced modulation of some <START:ggp> monocyte surface markers <END> . 
Cell growth-regulated expression of <START:ggp> mammalian MCM5 and MCM6 genes <END> mediated by the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> E2F <END> . 
Initiation of DNA replication requires the function of <START:ggp> MCM gene products <END> , which participate in ensuring that DNA replication occurs only once in the cell cycle . 
Expression of all <START:ggp> mammalian genes <END> of the <START:ggp> MCM family <END> is induced by growth stimulation , unlike yeast , and the mRNA levels peak at G1/S boundary . 
In this study , we examined the transcriptional activities of <START:ggp> isolated human MCM gene promoters <END> . 
<START:ggp> Human MCM5 and MCM6 promoters <END> with mutation in the <START:ggp> E2F sites <END> failed in promoter regulation following serum stimulation and exogenous <START:ggp> E2F <END> expression . 
In addition , we identified a novel <START:ggp> E2F-like sequence <END> in <START:ggp> human MCM6 promoter <END> which cooperates with the authentic <START:ggp> E2F sites <END> in <START:ggp> E2F <END> -dependent regulation . 
Forced expression of <START:ggp> E2F1 <END> could induce expression of all members of the <START:ggp> endogenous MCM genes <END> in <START:ana> rat embryonal fibroblast REF52 cells <END> . 
Our results demonstrated that the growth-regulated expression of <START:ggp> mammalian MCM5 and MCM6 genes <END> , and presumably other MCM members , is primarily regulated by <START:ggp> E2F <END> through binding to <START:ggp> multiple E2F sites <END> in the <START:ggp> promoters <END> . 
An essential role for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> human CD34 ( + ) bone marrow cell <END> survival . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , is important for T-cell activation , B-cell maturation , and human immunodeficiency virus transcription and plays a role in alternatively mediating and protecting against apoptosis in a variety of cell types . 
However , a role for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> human CD34 ( + ) bone marrow cells <END> has not been described . 
We provide evidence here that virtually all <START:ana> human CD34 ( + ) bone marrow cells <END> express <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> that can be activated by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and a variety of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , eg , <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin-3 <END> , and <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> . 
In addition , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> may be required for human <START:ana> CD34 ( + ) bone marrow cell <END> clonogenic function and survival . 
These results offer insight into a new role for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in maintaining survival and function in <START:ana> hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells <END> and suggest that proposed strategies involving inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation as an adjunct to cancer chemotherapy should be approached with caution . 
High molecular weight dextran sulfate increases the activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-regulated promoter <END> in <START:ana> monocyte-derived macrophages <END> . 
It is known that sulfated polysaccharides can mimic the action of <START:ggp> common T-cell mitogens <END> . 
To investigate the molecular basis of the mitogenic effect of high molecular weight dextran sulfate ( HMDS ) , <START:ana> monocyte-derived macrophages <END> were transfected with <START:ggp> recombinant plasmid <END> containing <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) reporter gene <END> under the control of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) promoter <END> , which is regulated by <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
We observed that HMDS , similar to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , increases the expression of <START:ggp> CAT reporter gene <END> suggesting increased activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
The activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> correlated with the increased expression of <START:ggp> B7.1 molecules <END> . 
It was postulated that this <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-regulated promoter <END> might play a role in the activation of the accessory cells as well as the rate of replication of HIV-1 in <START:ana> monocyte-derived macrophages <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> mediate induction of <START:ggp> acid sphingomyelinase <END> during monocytic differentiation . 
Cells from the <START:ana> human monocytic leukemia cell line <END> <START:ana> THP-1 <END> differentiate towards a macrophage-like phenotype when stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate -13- acetate ( PMA ) , 1 , 25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 , and various other agents . 
We demonstrate here that the expression of the <START:ggp> lysosomal enzyme <END> <START:ggp> acid sphingomyelinase <END> ( ASM ; E.C.3.1.4.12 ) is induced during this process and is strongly elevated in differentiated <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> , as well as in differentiated <START:ana> human mononuclear phagocytes <END> . 
Using Northern blotting , <START:ggp> RNase <END> protection assay , and nuclear run-on analyses , we show that the up-regulation of ASM expression is regulated mainly at the level of transcription and that new protein synthesis is required for enhanced ASM activity . 
This cell-type specific induction by PMA treatment was further investigated with respect to transcriptional control . 
A series of <START:ggp> 5 ' deletion derivatives <END> of the <START:ggp> upstream regulatory region <END> were used in transient transfection assays to identify <START:ggp> promoter elements <END> required for basal and inducible gene expression . 
A <START:ggp> PMA responsive element <END> was localized to a region between <START:ggp> -319 and -219 bp upstream <END> of the initiation codon and co-transfections with <START:ggp> transcription factor expression plasmids <END> for <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> resulted in augmented ASM promoter activity , which was abolished when the <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for these two factors were deleted . 
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift assays we demonstrate that this region is specifically bound by <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> . 
These factors are present in nuclear extracts prepared from both induced and uninduced <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> . 
However , the intensity of the complex formed appeared to increase when nuclear extracts from <START:ana> PMA-treated cells <END> were used . 
From these studies , we conclude that a concerted action of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> is essential for the up -regulation of ASM expression during the process of macrophage differentiation . 
LPS-Induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> are <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase <END> dependent and <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> independent . 
BACKGROUND : <START:ggp> Tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) is an important mediator of septic shock . 
Endotoxin ( LPS ) signal transduction in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> leads to activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release . 
Previous studies have implicated activation of both <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) and <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinases <END> ( <START:ggp> PTK <END> ) in LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> production . 
We hypothesized that inhibition of either <START:ggp> PKC <END> or <START:ggp> PTK <END> would decrease LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA binding and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS : <START:ana> Human monocytes <END> were stimulated with PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) alone or LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) with and without a nonspecific <START:ggp> serine/threonine protein kinase <END> inhibitor staurosporine ( Stauro ) , a specific pan- <START:ggp> PKC <END> inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide ( Bis ) , or an inhibitor of <START:ggp> PTK <END> genistein ( Gen ) . 
<START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release in culture supernatants was measured by an ELISA . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA binding was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . 
RESULTS : LPS increased <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA binding and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Nonspecific <START:ggp> protein kinase <END> inhibition inhibited <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release , while specific <START:ggp> PKC <END> inhibition with Bis had no effect on LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA binding or <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release . 
<START:ggp> PTK <END> inhibition with Gen attenuated both LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA binding and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> production in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Direct activation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> with PMA induced both <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> production by <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> are independent of <START:ggp> PKC <END> activity . 
Furthermore , our results provide evidence that <START:ggp> PTK <END> plays a role in LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and thus could be a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory states .

Amelioration of rat cerulein pancreatitis by guamerin-derived peptide , a novel <START:ggp> elastase <END> inhibitor . 
Increased activity of various <START:ggp> proteases <END> is observed in both human and experimental pancreatitis ; however , the information on the effects of specific protease inhibitors on the disease is limited . 
In this study we show that a novel elastase inhibitor , guamerin-derived synthetic peptide ( GDSP ) , improves the parameters of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat . 
The effects of GDSP on pancreatic weight , <START:ggp> serum amylase and lipase <END> , morphologic changes in the pancreas , neutrophil infiltration , and <START:ggp> nuclear factor KB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-KB <END> ) activation were measured in rats infused with supramaximal dose of cerulein ( 5 ( g/kg/h ) for 6 h . 
The effects of GDSP were also measured on superoxide formation by <START:ana> activated human neutrophils <END> . 
The effects of GDSP were compared with those of another elastase inhibitor , elastatinal . 
GDSP significantly inhibited edema formation , neutrophil infiltration , acinar cell damage , and <START:ggp> plasma lipase <END> and <START:ggp> amylase <END> increases caused by cerulein . 
GDSP also completely inhibited superoxide formation in the <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> stimulated by N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenyl-alanine ( fMLP ) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) . 
Elastatinal had some of the same effects as GDSP but was less potent and effective . 
These results demonstrate a beneficial effect of GDSP , a novel specific elastase inhibitor , on the development of rat cerulein pancreatitis . 
A novel <START:ggp> lipopolysaccharide-induced transcription factor <END> regulating <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> gene expression : molecular cloning , sequencing , characterization , and chromosomal assignment . 
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is a potent stimulator of <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> , causing secretion of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) and other inflammatory mediators . 
Given the deleterious effects to the host of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , it has been postulated that <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> gene expression must be tightly regulated . 
The nature of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> ( s ) that control <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> gene transcription in humans remains obscure , although <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> has been suggested . 
Our previous studies pertaining to macrophage response to LPS identified a novel <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> located from -550 to -487 in the <START:ggp> human TNF-alpha promoter <END> that contains transcriptional activity , but lacks any known <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> <START:ggp> -binding sites <END> . 
We have used this DNA fragment to isolate and purify a <START:ggp> 60-kDa protein <END> binding to this fragment and obtained its <START:ggp> amino-terminal sequence <END> , which was used to design <START:ggp> degenerate probes <END> to screen a cDNA library from <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> . 
A novel <START:ggp> cDNA clone <END> ( 1.8 kb ) was isolated and fully sequenced . 
Characterization of this <START:ggp> cDNA clone <END> revealed that its induction was dependent on LPS activation of <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> ; hence , the name <START:ggp> LPS-induced TNF-alpha factor <END> ( <START:ggp> LITAF <END> ) . 
Inhibition of <START:ana> LITAF mRNA <END> expression in <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> resulted in a reduction of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> transcripts . 
In addition , high level of expression of <START:ana> LITAF mRNA <END> was observed predominantly in the placenta , <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocytes <END> , lymph nodes , and the spleen . 
Finally , chromosomal localization using fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that <START:ggp> LITAF <END> mapped to <START:ggp> chromosome 16p12-16p13.3 <END> . 
Together , these findings suggest that <START:ggp> LITAF <END> plays an important role in the activation of the <START:ggp> human TNF-alpha gene <END> and proposes a new mechanism to control <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> gene expression . 
A <START:ggp> human IFNGR1 small deletion hotspot <END> associated with dominant susceptibility to mycobacterial infection [ see comments ] 
The immunogenetic basis of severe infections caused by bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine and environmental mycobacteria in humans remains largely unknown . 
We describe 18 patients from several generations of 12 unrelated families who were heterozygous for 1 to 5 <START:ggp> overlapping IFNGR1 frameshift small deletions <END> and a <START:ggp> wild-type IFNGR1 allele <END> . 
There were 12 independent mutation events at a <START:ggp> single mutation site <END> , defining a <START:ggp> small deletion hotspot <END> . 
Neighbouring sequence analysis favours a small deletion model of slipped mispairing events during replication . 
The mutant alleles encode <START:ggp> cell-surface IFNgamma receptors <END> that lack the <START:ggp> intra-cytoplasmic domain <END> , which , through a combination of impaired recycling , abrogated signalling and normal binding to <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> exert a dominant-negative effect . 
We thus report a hotspot for <START:ggp> human IFNGR1 small deletions <END> that confer dominant susceptibility to infections caused by poorly virulent mycobacteria . 
Characterization of expression of the gene for <START:ggp> human pterin carbinolamine dehydratase/dimerization cofactor <END> of <START:ggp> HNF1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Pterin carbinolamine dehydratase/dimerization cofactor <END> of <START:ggp> HNF1 <END> ( <START:ggp> PCD/DCoH <END> ) is a <START:ggp> dual-function protein <END> . 
In the cytoplasm it acts as a <START:ggp> dehydratase <END> in the regeneration of <START:ggp> tetrahydrobiopterin <END> , the cofactor for <START:ggp> aromatic amino acid hydroxylases <END> . 
In the nucleus , it functions as a <START:ggp> dimerization cofactor <END> of <START:ggp> HNF1 <END> and increases the transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> HNF1 <END> . 
To deepen our understanding of this protein , we characterized its expression in human tissues and cells . 
Human <START:ggp> PCD/DCoH <END> was present predominantly in liver and kidney , with significant amounts in testis and ovary , trace amounts in lung , and undetectable levels in whole brain , heart , and spleen . 
It was expressed in all of the cells that were examined . 
Importantly , it was also present in the nucleus of <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , which lack <START:ggp> HNF1 <END> , and in the cytoplasm of <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> that have little or no <START:ggp> tetrahydrobiopterin <END> . 
The expression of <START:ggp> human PCD/DCoH <END> in the liver and <START:ana> nonhepatic cells <END> was compared at both the mRNA and protein levels . 
Although the mRNA level in liver was only fourfold higher than that in <START:ana> keratinocytes <END> and <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> , the <START:ggp> hepatic PCD/DCoH protein <END> level was 20-fold higher than that in <START:ana> normal human epidermal keratinocytes <END> and <START:ana> dermal fibroblasts <END> . 
Cloning of the <START:ggp> 5 ' and 3 ' untranslated region <END> ( <START:ggp> UTR <END> ) of <START:ggp> human keratinocyte PCD/DCoH <END> revealed that it has 53 bp more of <START:ggp> GC-rich 5 ' untranslated sequence <END> than the published <START:ggp> liver PCD/DCoH <END> . 
In vitro transcription and translation analysis showed that the longer <START:ggp> 5 ' UTR <END> resulted in about a 35 % decrease in translation efficiency . 
These data show that <START:ggp> human PCD/DCoH <END> is not only present in cells where <START:ggp> tetrahydrobiopterin <END> is synthesized or <START:ggp> HNF1 <END> is present but is a widely distributed protein . 
Its differential expression in different tissues and cells is regulated not only at the transcriptional level but also at the translational level . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> regulates Fas/APO-1/CD95- and TCR- mediated apoptosis of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
The maintenance of lymphocyte homeostasis by apoptosis is a critical regulatory mechanism in the normal immune system . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> has been shown to play a role in protecting cells against death mediated by <START:ggp> TNF <END> We show here that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> also has a role in regulating <START:ggp> Fas <END> / <START:ggp> APO-1 <END> / <START:ggp> CD95 <END> -mediated death , a major pathway of <START:ana> peripheral T cell <END> death . 
Transfection of <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> with the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB subunits <END> <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 <END> confers resistance against Fas-mediated apoptosis . 
Reciprocally , inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation by a soluble peptide inhibitor or a dominant form of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> inhibitor , <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> , makes the cells more susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis . 
Furthermore , inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation by a soluble peptide inhibitor rendered a <START:ana> T cell hybridoma <END> more susceptible to TCR-mediated apoptosis . 
Correspondingly , transfection of <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 <END> provided considerable protection from TCR-mediated apoptosis . 
These observations were corroborated by studies on <START:ggp> Fas <END> -mediated death in <START:ana> primary T cells <END> . 
Concanavalin A-activated <START:ana> cycling T cell blasts <END> from mice that are transgenic for the <START:ggp> dominant IkappaB molecule <END> have increased sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis , associated with a down-regulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB complexes <END> in the nucleus . 
In addition , blocking <START:ggp> TNF <END> , itself a positive regulator of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , with <START:ggp> neutralizing antibodies <END> renders the cells more susceptible to anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis . 
In summary , our results provide compelling evidence that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> protects against <START:ggp> Fas <END> -mediated death and is likely to be an important regulator of T cell homeostasis and tolerance . 
T helper differentiation proceeds through Stat1-dependent , Stat4-dependent and Stat4-independent phases . 
Much of our focus in understanding Th1/Th2 development has been on the signals delivered by <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> as final determinants of terminal T cell differentiation . 
Because extinction of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> signaling in early Th2 development could potentially be important in imprinting a more permanent Th2 phenotype on a population of <START:ana> T cells <END> , we have also examined various parameters regulating the <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> signaling pathway . 
Whereas <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> appears to repress functional <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> signaling through inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-12R beta 2 <END> expression , <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> in the mouse , and <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> in the human appear to induce <START:ggp> IL-12R beta 2 <END> expression and promote <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> responsiveness . 
We propose that Th1 development can be considered in two stages , capacitance and development . 
Capacitance would simply involve expression of <START:ggp> IL-12R beta 1 and beta 2 subunits <END> , regulated by TCR , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IFNs <END> . 
The second stage , development , we propose is the true <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> induced developmental stage , involving expression of <START:ggp> Stat4 inducible proteins <END> . 
In the human , this may also occur via <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> , which is able to activate <START:ggp> Stat4 <END> . 
It is perhaps possible that all of <START:ggp> Stat4 <END> actions on Th1 development may be exert directly by <START:ggp> Stat4 <END> at the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma gene <END> , however we suggest that , more likely , <START:ggp> Stat4 <END> may act to induce Th1 development through the induction of other <START:ggp> non-cytokine genes <END> , whose stable expression maintains the transcriptional state of a <START:ana> Th1 cell <END> . 
Lineage-specific activation of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> by <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> in <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> . 
Binding of <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) to its heterodimeric receptor induces activation of the <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT1alpha <END> . 
Selective activation of <START:ggp> STAT1alpha <END> at the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma receptor <END> is achieved by specific interaction between a <START:ggp> cytosolic tyrosine motif <END> including <START:ggp> Y440 <END> in the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain <END> and the <START:ggp> SH2 domain <END> of <START:ggp> STAT1alpha <END> . 
We demonstrate that , in addition to <START:ggp> STAT1alpha <END> , <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> is also activated by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> in <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> . 
The activation of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> was not found in <START:ana> human eosinophils <END> , <START:ana> monocytes <END> , and <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> , although the <START:ggp> STAT3 protein <END> was expressed in these cells . 
The cell type-specific activation of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> was also observed in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> that are differentiated in vitro from <START:ana> human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells <END> . 
These results indicate that a single <START:ggp> cytokine receptor <END> can activate different <START:ggp> STAT family members <END> in a cell-specific manner , which might result in cell-specific gene transcription . 
Alternative polyadenylation events contribute to the induction of <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> in <START:ana> effector T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> is synthesized in three prominent <START:ggp> isoforms <END> . 
These differ in the length of their C terminal peptides and mode of synthesis . 
Due to a switch from the use of a <START:ggp> 3 ' polyA site <END> to a more <START:ggp> proximal polyA site <END> , <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> expression switches from the synthesis of the two longer isoforms in <START:ana> naive T cells <END> to that of short <START:ggp> isoform A <END> in <START:ana> T effector cells <END> . 
The relative low binding affinity of <START:ggp> cleavage stimulation factor <END> <START:ggp> CstF-64 <END> to the <START:ggp> proximal polyA site <END> seems to contribute to its neglect in <START:ana> naive T cells <END> . 
These alternative polyadenylation events ensure the rapid accumulation of high concentrations of <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> necessary to exceed critical threshold levels of <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> for gene induction in <START:ana> effector T cells <END> . 
Estrogen and progesterone induction of survival of <START:ana> monoblastoid cells <END> undergoing <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -induced apoptosis . 
Induction of apoptosis of <START:ana> mononucleated cells <END> is a physiological process for regulating the intensity of the immune response . 
The female steroid hormones estrogen ( E2 ) and progesterone ( Prog ) are known to modulate the reactivity of the immune system ; recently it has been demonstrated that they can regulate induction of apoptosis of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> and <START:ana> osteoblasts <END> . 
<START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -mediated induction of apoptosis has been well characterized in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> . 
We investigated whether E2 and Prog could interfere with <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -induced apoptosis of the <START:ana> monoblastoid U937 cell line <END> . 
Treatment with E2 or Prog increased survival and prevented apoptosis induced by <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> in both undifferentiated and macrophage-like <START:ana> PMA-differentiated U937 cells <END> , as assessed by trypan blue exclusion cell counting , thymidine incorporation , AnnexinV labeling , followed by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation studies . 
This effect can be associated with the activation of specific hormone receptors , since we observed the expression of the <START:ana> estrogen receptor alpha ( ER-alpha ) , ER-beta , and progesterone receptor ( PR ) mRNAs <END> ; the <START:ggp> ER-alpha <END> protein expression was confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis . 
In addition , hormone-mediated survival against apoptosis was concentration dependent , reaching the half-maximal effect at 10 nM and blocked by the ER antagonist ICI 182 , 780 in <START:ana> undifferentiated cells <END> , further supporting a receptor-mediated mechanism of cell survival . 
Other steroid receptor drugs such as Raloxifene , RU486 , or the ICI 182 , 780 in <START:ana> PMA-differentiated cells <END> displayed agonist activity by preventing <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -induced apoptosis as efficiently as the hormones alone , providing further evidence to the notion that steroid receptor drugs may manifest agonist or antagonist activities depending on the cellular context in which they are studied . 
Treatment with E2 was also associated with a time-dependent decrease in the mRNA level of the <START:ggp> proapoptotic Nip-2 protein <END> , supporting the hypothesis that hormone responsiveness of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> is mediated by target gene transcription . 
Together , these results demonstrate that <START:ggp> ER <END> and <START:ggp> PR <END> can be activated by endogenous or exogenous ligands to induce a genetic response that impairs <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -induced apoptosis in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
The data presented here suggest that the <START:ggp> female steroid receptors <END> play a role in regulation of the immune response by preventing apoptosis of <START:ana> monoblastoid cells <END> ; this effect might have important consequences in the clinical use of steroid receptor drugs .

Estrogen and progesterone induction of survival of <START:ana> monoblastoid cells <END> undergoing <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -inuced apoptosis . 
Dicarba-closo-dodecaboranes as a pharmacophore . 
Retinoidal antagonists and potential agonists . 
Synthesis and biological evaluation of the first dicarba-closo-dodecaborane ( carborane ) derivatives of retinoids are described . 
Their retinoidal activity were examined in terms of the differentiation-inducing ability toward <START:ana> human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells <END> . 
High retinoidal activity ( agonist or antagonist for <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR <END> ) requires a carboxylic acid moiety and an appropriate hydrophobic group located at a suitable position on the molecule . 
The 4-carboranyl-substituted compounds ( 7 , 11 ) showed antagonistic activity but no agonistic activity even in the presence of the potent synergist HX630 . 
On the other hand , the 3-carboranyl-substituted compounds ( 8 , 12 ) showed potential agonistic activity , but no antagonistic activity . 
The results indicates that carboranes are applicable as the hydrophobic moiety of biologically active molecules . 
Inhibition of T cell signaling by <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase-targeted hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase <END> ( <START:ggp> HePTP <END> ) . 
Activation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> to produce <START:ggp> cytokines <END> is regulated by the counterbalance of <START:ggp> protein-tyrosine kinases <END> and protein-tyrosine phosphatases , many of which have a high degree of substrate specificity because of physical association with their targets . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase <END> ( <START:ggp> HePTP <END> ) results in suppression of T lymphocyte activation as measured by <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> binding to the <START:ggp> 5 ' promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 gene <END> . 
Efforts to pinpoint the exact site of action and specificity of <START:ggp> HePTP <END> in the signaling cascade revealed that <START:ggp> HePTP <END> acts directly on the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinases <END> <START:ggp> Erk1 and 2 <END> and consequently reduces the magnitude and duration of their catalytic activation in <START:ana> intact T cells <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> HePTP <END> had no effects on <START:ggp> N-terminal c-Jun kinase <END> or on events upstream of the MAP kinases . 
The specificity of <START:ggp> HePTP <END> correlated with its physical association through its noncatalytic <START:ggp> N terminus <END> with <START:ggp> Erk <END> and another <START:ggp> MAP kinase <END> , <START:ggp> p38 <END> , but not <START:ggp> Jnk <END> or other proteins . 
We propose that <START:ggp> HePTP <END> plays a negative role in antigen receptor signaling by specifically regulating <START:ggp> MAP kinases <END> in the cytosol and at early time points of T cell activation before the activation-induced expression of <START:ggp> nuclear dual-specific MAP kinase phosphatases <END> . 
<START:ggp> p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> mediates signal integration of <START:ggp> TCR <END> <START:ggp> /CD28 <END> costimulation in <START:ana> primary murine T cells <END> . 
Optimal T cell activation requires two signals , one generated by <START:ggp> TCR <END> and another by the <START:ggp> CD28 costimulatory receptor <END> . 
In this study , we investigated the regulation of costimulation-induced <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MAPK <END> ) activation in <START:ana> primary mouse T cells <END> . 
In contrast to that reported for <START:ana> human Jurkat T cells <END> , we found that <START:ggp> p38 MAPK <END> , but not <START:ggp> Jun NH2-terminal kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> JNK <END> ) , is weakly activated upon stimulation with either <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> or <START:ggp> anti-CD28 <END> in <START:ana> murine thymocytes <END> and <START:ana> splenic T cells <END> . 
However , <START:ggp> p38 MAPK <END> is activated strongly and synergistically by either <START:ggp> CD3/CD28 <END> coligation or PMA/Ca2+ ionophore stimulation , which mimics <START:ggp> TCR <END> - <START:ggp> CD3/CD28 <END> -mediated signaling . 
Activation of <START:ggp> p38 MAPK <END> correlates closely with the stimulation of T cell proliferation . 
In contrast , PMA-induced <START:ggp> JNK <END> activation is inhibited by Ca2+ ionophore . 
T cell proliferation and production of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induced by both <START:ggp> CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> CD3 <END> <START:ggp> /CD28 <END> ligation and the nuclear expression of the <START:ggp> c-Jun and ATF-2 proteins <END> are each blocked by the <START:ggp> p38 MAPK <END> inhibitor SB203580 . 
Our findings demonstrate that <START:ggp> p38 MAPK <END> 1 ) plays an important role in signal integration during costimulation of <START:ana> primary mouse T cells <END> , 2 ) may be involved in the induction of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> activation and augmentation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> transcriptional activity , and 3 ) regulates whether <START:ana> T cells <END> enter a state of functional unresponsiveness . 
Erythroid gene expression is differentially regulated by <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> , haemin and delta-aminolaevulinic acid in <START:ana> UT-7 cells <END> . 
Erythropoietin ( Epo ) is essential for the later stages of erythropoiesis , acting to promote cell survival and proliferation , but its role in differentiation remains to be defined . 
The <START:ana> UT-7 cell line <END> exhibits both erythroid and megakaryocytic characteristics and can be induced to differentiate along the erythroid pathway by <START:ggp> Epo <END> or the megakaryocytic pathway by phorbol myristic acetate . 
We have compared the effects of <START:ggp> Epo <END> and the chemical inducers , delta-aminolaevulinic acid ( delta-ALA ) and haemin on the differentiation capacity of <START:ana> UT-7 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Epo <END> alone promoted relatively early events in erythroid maturation , without significant changes in haemoglobin production or morphology . 
<START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> and <START:ggp> c-myb <END> were down-regulated by <START:ggp> Epo <END> , and <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> was further down-modulated by the inducers . 
Conversely , <START:ggp> SCL <END> expression was up-regulated by <START:ggp> Epo <END> and further increased by haemin and delta-ALA . 
<START:ggp> Epo <END> caused an increase in the proportion of cells expressing cell surface <START:ggp> glycophorin A <END> ( <START:ggp> GPA <END> ) and up-regulated <START:ggp> beta- and gamma-globin <END> by several fold . 
Both haemin and delta-ALA caused a de novo increase in <START:ggp> alpha-globin <END> expression as well as enhancing <START:ggp> Epo <END> -induced <START:ggp> beta-globin <END> expression , leading to a marked increase in haemoglobin production . 
These results suggest that haemoglobin production in <START:ana> UT-7 cells <END> is limited by a deficiency of <START:ggp> erythroid-specific aminolaevulinic acid synthase <END> ( <START:ggp> ALAS-E <END> ) activity or globin synthesis as a consequence of their immaturity as a <START:ana> multipotential cell line <END> . 
Essential role of <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> in intrapulmonary activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Acute inflammatory injury in rat lung induced by deposition of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin G immune complexes <END> requires expression of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> chemokines <END> as well as activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB <END> . 
There is little direct evidence regarding the role of <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> in these activation events . 
In the present studies , rat lungs were depleted of <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> by airway instillation of liposome-encapsulated dichloromethylene diphosphonate . 
These procedures , which greatly reduced the number of retrievable <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> , suppressed activation of <START:ggp> lung NF-kappaB <END> in the inflammatory model . 
In addition , bronchoalveolar lavage levels of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) and the <START:ggp> CXC chemokine <END> , <START:ggp> macrophage inflammatory protein-2 <END> , were substantially reduced . 
In parallel , upregulation of the <START:ggp> lung vascular adhesion molecule <END> , <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> , was greatly reduced by intrapulmonary instillation of phosphonate-containing liposomes . 
Neutrophil accumulation and development of lung injury were also substantially diminished . 
Lung instillation of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> in alveolar macrophage-depleted rats restored the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation response in whole lung . 
These data suggest that , in this inflammatory model , initial activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> occurs in <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> and the ensuing production of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> may propagate <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation to other cell types in the lung . 
<START:ggp> Interferon-beta <END> mediates stromal cell rescue of <START:ana> T cells <END> from apoptosis . 
The resolution of immune responses is characterized by extensive apoptosis of activated <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
However , to generate and maintain immunological memory , some <START:ana> antigen-specific T cells <END> must survive and revert to a resting G0/G1 state . 
<START:ggp> Cytokines <END> that bind to the common <START:ggp> gamma chain <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> receptor promote the survival of <START:ana> T cell blasts <END> , but also induce proliferation . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> soluble factors <END> secreted by <START:ana> stromal cells <END> induce Tcell survival in a resting G0/G1 state . 
We now report that interferon-beta is the principal mediator of stromal cell-mediated Tcell rescue from apoptosis . 
<START:ggp> Interferon-alpha and -beta <END> promote the reversion of <START:ana> blast Tcells <END> to a resting G0/G1 configuration with all the characteristic features of stromal cell rescue ; such as high <START:ggp> Bcl-XL <END> expression and low <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Type I interferons <END> and <START:ana> stromal cells <END> stimulate apparently identical signaling pathways , leading to <START:ggp> STAT-1 <END> activation . 
We also show that this mechanism may play a fundamental role in the persistence of <START:ana> T cells <END> at sites of chronic inflammation ; suggesting that chronic inflammation is an aberrant consequence of immunological memory . 
Reduction of <START:ggp> tumour necrosis factor alpha <END> expression and signalling in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> from patients with thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia upon treatment with desferrioxamine . 
Recent evidence indicates that the rate of progression of the HIV-1 disease is significantly reduced in thalassaemia major patients upon treatment with high doses of desferrioxamine ( DFX ) . 
The authors have previously demonstrated that in vitro exposure of <START:ana> mononuclear cells <END> to DFX decreases the bioavailability of <START:ggp> tumour necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) which has a stimulatory effect on HIV-1 replication . 
In this study , therefore , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> bioavailability from <START:ana> mononuclear cells <END> isolated from 10 patients with thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia given DFX as compared to 10 untreated subjects has been evaluated . 
Evidence is presented showing that DFX treatment reduces <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> bioavailability ( P < 0.05 ) by inhibiting its steady state ( P < 0.05 ) and by enhancing its inactivation through binding to soluble <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> receptor type II ( P < 0.05 ) . 
We also show that DFX treatment limits the in vivo activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> involved in both <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> gene transcription and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> signalling ( P < 0.005 ) . 
We conclude that <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> bioavailability and signalling are impaired in patients upon DFX treatment . 
This mechanism may contribute to delayed progression of the HIV-1 infection in vivo .

Involvement of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB p50/p65 heterodimer <END> in activation of the <START:ggp> human pro-interleukin-1beta gene <END> at two subregions of the <START:ggp> upstream enhancer element <END> . 
A region between-3134 and -2729 bp upstream from the <START:ggp> transcription site <END> of the <START:ggp> human pro-interleukin 1beta ( proIL-1beta ) gene <END> was identified as an <START:ggp> LPS-responsive enhancer element <END> . 
In this study , the influence of the sequences located <START:ggp> between -3134 and -2987 <END> on the transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> proIL-1beta gene <END> in <START:ana> LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells <END> was examined in detail . 
The results obtained by transient transfection of fos <START:ggp> -CAT constructs <END> that contained <START:ggp> serial 5'-deletion mutations <END> showed that the region between -3134 and -3059 appears to be required for the induction of transcription by LPS . 
Gel shift assay studies with <START:ggp> synthetic oligonucleotides <END> corresponding to partial sequences of the latter region and nuclear extracts from stimulated cells revealed specific <START:ggp> protein binding sites <END> between -3110 and -3090 and between -3079 and -3059 . 
These specific bindings were time and LPS dose dependent . 
The results of supershift analysis using specific antibodies against <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> suggested that both binding complexes contained the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB components <END> <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 <END> , and did not contain other <START:ggp> NF-kappaB proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> p52 <END> , <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , <START:ggp> Rel B <END> ) , <START:ggp> AP-1 proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , <START:ggp> C-Jun <END> ) , <START:ggp> CREB <END> or <START:ggp> C/EBPbeta <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> ) . 
Mutation of either of the putative <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-binding sites <END> in the enhancer element decreased the LPS-stimulated transcriptional activity . 
These data indicated that two <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-binding sites <END> , which are located between <START:ggp> -3134 and -3059 <END> , are critical for the activation of <START:ggp> proIL-1beta gene <END> transcription .

N-acetyl-L-cysteine inhibits primary human T cell responses at the dendritic cell level : association with <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> inhibition . 
N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) is an antioxidant molecule endowed with immunomodulatory properties . 
To investigate the effect of NAC on the induction phase of T cell responses , we analyzed its action on human dendritic cells ( DC ) derived from adherent PBMC cultured with <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage CSF <END> . 
We first found that NAC inhibited the constitutive as well as the LPS-induced activity of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
In parallel , NAC was shown to down-regulate the production of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> by <START:ana> DC <END> as well as their surface expression of <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> , <START:ggp> CD86 <END> ( <START:ggp> B7-2 <END> ) , and <START:ggp> CD40 molecules <END> both at the basal state and upon LPS activation . 
NAC also inhibited DC responses induced by <START:ggp> CD40 <END> engagement . 
The inhibitory effects of NAC were not due to nonspecific toxicity as neither the viability of <START:ana> DC <END> nor their mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis were modified by NAC . 
Finally , we found that the addition of NAC to MLR between <START:ana> naive T cells <END> and allogeneic <START:ana> DC <END> resulted in a profound inhibition of alloreactive responses , which could be attributed to a defect of <START:ana> DC <END> as APC-independent T cell responses were not inhibited by NAC . 
Altogether , our results suggest that NAC might impair the generation of primary immune responses in humans through its inhibitory action on <START:ana> DC <END> . 
<START:ggp> Thrombin-induced p65 homodimer <END> binding to downstream <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> of the promoter mediates endothelial <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> expression and <START:ana> neutrophil <END> adhesion . 
We investigated the mechanisms by which <START:ggp> proinflammatory mediator <END> , <START:ggp> thrombin <END> , released during intravascular coagulation and tissue injury , induces <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> CD54 <END> ) expression in <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> HUVEC <END> with <START:ggp> thrombin <END> resulted in dose- and time-dependent increases in <START:ana> ICAM-1 mRNA <END> and cell surface expression and in <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> -dependent endothelial adhesivity toward <START:ana> polymorphonuclear leukocytes <END> . 
Transient transfection of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> with <START:ggp> ICAM-1 promoter luciferase reporter gene ( ICAM-1LUC ) constructs <END> indicated that deletion of upstream <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> ( <START:ggp> -533 bases <END> from <START:ggp> translation start site <END> ) had no effect on <START:ggp> thrombin <END> responsiveness , whereas mutation/deletion of downstream <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> ( <START:ggp> -223 bases <END> from the <START:ggp> translation start site <END> ) prevented the activation of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 promoter <END> , indicating that the downstream <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> is critical for <START:ggp> thrombin <END> inducibility . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -directed <START:ggp> luciferase <END> activity increased approximately 3-fold when cells transfected with the <START:ggp> plasmid pNF-kappa BLUC <END> containing five copies of <START:ggp> consensus NF-kappa B site <END> linked to a minimal <START:ggp> adenovirus E1B promoter-luciferase gene <END> were exposed to <START:ggp> thrombin <END> , indicating that activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was essential for <START:ggp> thrombin <END> response . 
Gel supershift assays demonstrated that <START:ggp> thrombin <END> induced binding of <START:ggp> NF-kappa Bp65 <END> ( <START:ggp> Rel A <END> ) to downstream <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> of the <START:ggp> ICAM-1 promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> Thrombin <END> receptor activation peptide , a 14-amino-acid peptide representing the new <START:ggp> NH2 terminus <END> of proteolytically activated <START:ggp> receptor-1 <END> , mimicked <START:ggp> thrombin <END> 's action in inducing <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> expression . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> thrombin <END> activates endothelial <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> expression and <START:ana> polymorphonuclear leukocyte <END> adhesion by <START:ggp> NF-kappa Bp65 <END> binding to the downstream <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 promoter <END> after proteolytically activated receptor-1 activation . 
Differential inhibition of <START:ggp> Smad6 <END> and <START:ggp> Smad7 <END> on bone morphogenetic protein- and activin-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Smad6 <END> and <START:ggp> Smad7 <END> prevent ligand-induced activation of <START:ggp> signal-transducing Smad proteins <END> in the <START:ggp> transforming growth factor-beta family <END> . 
Here we demonstrate that both <START:ggp> Smad6 <END> and <START:ggp> Smad7 <END> are <START:ggp> human bone morphogenetic protein-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> hBMP-2 <END> ) -inducible antagonists of <START:ggp> hBMP-2 <END> -induced growth arrest and apoptosis in <START:ana> mouse B cell hybridoma <END> <START:ana> HS-72 cells <END> . 
Moreover , we confirmed that the ectopic expressions of <START:ggp> Smad6 <END> and <START:ggp> Smad7 <END> inhibited the <START:ggp> hBMP-2 <END> -induced <START:ggp> Smad1/Smad5 <END> phosphorylation . 
We previously reported that <START:ggp> Smad7 <END> is an activin A-inducible antagonist of activin A-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in <START:ana> HS-72 cells <END> . 
Interestingly , although mRNA expression of <START:ggp> Smad6 <END> was induced by activin A in <START:ana> HS-72 cells <END> , <START:ggp> Smad6 <END> showed no antagonistic effect on activin A-induced growth arrest and apoptosis . 
Moreover , we found that the ectopic expression of <START:ggp> Smad7 <END> , but not <START:ggp> Smad6 <END> , inhibited the activin A-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in <START:ana> HS-72 cells <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> Smad6 <END> and <START:ggp> Smad7 <END> exhibit differential inhibitory effects in bone morphogenetic protein-2- and activin A-mediated signaling in <START:ana> B lineage cells <END> . 
Retinoic acid induces apoptosis of <START:ana> human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells <END> : involvement of <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptors <END> and <START:ggp> retinoid X receptors <END> depends on lineage commitment of the <START:ana> hematopoietic progenitor cells <END> . 
Retinoids are bifunctional regulators of growth and differentiation of <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> . 
In this study we explored the effects of retinoic acid ( RA ) on apoptosis of <START:ana> human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells <END> isolated from normal bone marrow . 
RA ( 100 nM ) induced an increase in the percentage of <START:ana> dead cells <END> from 24 % to 44 % at day 6 ( p < 0.05 , n = 6 ) as compared to <START:ana> control cells <END> cultured in medium alone . 
The effect was dose dependent and appeared relatively late . 
Significant differences were observed from day 4 onward . 
Apoptosis , or programmed cell death , was demonstrated as the mode of cell death by using the TUNEL assay , which detects single strand nicks in DNA , or by the Nicoletti technique demonstrating a subdiploid population by DNA staining . 
RA previously was found to inhibit <START:ggp> granulocyte colony-stimulating factor <END> -- and not <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> -- stimulated proliferation of <START:ana> CD34+ cells <END> . 
However , we found that RA opposed anti-apoptotic effects of <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> and <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> on <START:ana> CD34+ cells <END> ( <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> : 8 % <START:ana> dead cells <END> at day 6 ; <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> + RA : 20 % ; <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> : 12 % ; <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> + RA : 27 % ) . 
Moreover , RA induced apoptosis of <START:ana> CD34+ cells <END> and <START:ana> CD34+CD71+ cells <END> stimulated with <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> . 
To explore the receptor signaling pathways involved in RA-induced apoptosis , we used selective ligands for <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptors <END> ( RARs ; RO13-7410 ) and <START:ggp> retinoid X receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RXRs <END> ; RO 25-6603 ) . 
We found that <START:ggp> RARs <END> were involved in RA-mediated apoptosis of myeloid progenitor cells , whereas <START:ggp> RARs <END> as well as <START:ggp> RXRs <END> were involved in RA-mediated apoptosis of <START:ana> erythroid progenitor cells <END> . 
Suppressive effects of anti-inflammatory agents on <START:ana> human endothelial cell <END> activation and induction of <START:ggp> heat shock proteins <END> . 
BACKGROUND : Studies from our laboratory have shown that the earliest stages of atherosclerosis may be mediated by an autoimmune reaction against <START:ggp> heat shock protein 60 <END> ( <START:ggp> Hsp60 <END> ) . 
The interactions of <START:ana> Hsp60-specific T cells <END> with arterial <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> EC <END> ) require expression of both <START:ggp> Hsp60 <END> and certain <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> shown to be induced simultaneously in <START:ana> EC <END> by mechanical and other types of stress . 
Recently , it was shown that suppression of T cell-mediated immune responses by cyclosporin A ( CyA ) enhanced atherosclerotic lesion formation in mice . 
In contrast , aspirin was found to lower the risk of myocardial infarction in men . 
These conflicting observations may be due to different effects of anti-inflammatory agents on adhesion molecule and Hsp expression in <START:ana> EC <END> , respectively . 
MATERIAL AND METHODS : In the present study , we analyzed the effects of CyA , aspirin , and indomethacin on T cell proliferation using a proliferation assay . 
To explore the expression of <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> , <START:ggp> monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> ) , and <START:ggp> Hsp60 <END> in <START:ana> human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> HUVECs <END> ) , Northern blot analyses were used . 
To examine the activation status of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) and <START:ggp> heat shock factor-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> HSF-1 <END> ) , electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed . 
RESULTS : With the exception of indomethacin , the used immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents significantly inhibited T cell proliferation in response to <START:ggp> influenza virus antigen <END> in a dose-dependent manner . 
Interestingly , CyA and indomethacin did not suppress <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) -induced adhesion molecule expression on <START:ana> HUVECs <END> , whereas aspirin had an inhibitory effect . 
These observations correlated with the modulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity in <START:ana> EC <END> . 
All agents tested induced expression of <START:ggp> Hsp60 <END> 6 hr after application . 
In addition , aspirin and indomethacin , but not CyA , induced <START:ggp> Hsp70 <END> expression in <START:ana> HUVECs <END> that correlated with induction of <START:ggp> HSF-1 <END> activity . 
CONCLUSION : Our results show that the tested agents ( except indomethacin ) are inhibitors of the T cell-mediated immune response , as expected , that aspirin is an effective suppressor of <START:ggp> adhesion molecule <END> expression , and that all three agents can induce <START:ggp> Hsp60 <END> in <START:ana> HUVECs <END> . 
These data provide the molecular basis for the notion that ( 1 ) part of the anti-atherogenic effect of aspirin may be due to the prevention of the adhesion of <START:ana> sensitized T cells <END> to stressed <START:ana> EC <END> ; ( 2 ) that part of the atherosclerosis-promoting effect of CyA may be due to its potential as an inducer of <START:ggp> Hsp60 <END> expression and its inability to down-regulate <START:ggp> adhesion molecule <END> expression on <START:ana> EC <END> ; and ( 3 ) that down-regulation of <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> expression by aspirin may result in decreased recruitment of <START:ana> monocytes <END> into the arterial intima beneath stressed <START:ana> EC <END> . 
In vivo modulation of <START:ana> glucocorticoid receptor mRNA <END> by inhaled fluticasone propionate in bronchial mucosa and <START:ana> blood lymphocytes <END> in subjects with mild asthma . 
BACKGROUND : In vivo regulation of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) by glucocorticoids provides a means of modulating sensitivity of targeted cells . 
OBJECTIVE : We sought to determine the in vivo modulation of <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> expression by fluticasone propionate ( FP ) in subjects with mild asthma . 
METHODS : Ten atopic asthmatic subjects were treated with FP 250 microg twice daily for 4 weeks . 
Before and after treatment , the patients underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy and sampling of venous blood for measurements of <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> levels . 
A solution hybridization assay was used for quantitative analysis of <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> . 
In addition , a 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion and an adrenocorticotropic hormone test before and after treatment with FP were performed . 
RESULTS : A high interindividual variation in <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> expression was seen . 
However , we detected a significant reduction of the <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> levels in the endobronchial biopsy specimens after FP treatment ( 36.6 +/- 23.1 and 25.0 +/- 10.9 amol <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> /microg RNA , respectively ; P < .01 ) . 
In the peripheral <START:ana> blood lymphocytes <END> an even more striking downregulation of the GR by its cognate ligand was documented ( 30.3 +/- 26.5 and 8.8 +/- 5 amol <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> /microg RNA , respectively ; P < .001 ) , possibly reflecting differences in glucocorticoid sensitivity between tissues . 
A small but significant reduction of the 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion was observed ( 233 +/- 109 and 157 +/- 66 nmol/L , respectively ; P < .01 ) , whereas the feedback regulation of glucocorticoid synthesis by means of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as assessed by the adrenocorticotropic hormone test remained normal after treatment with FP . 
CONCLUSION : The results in this study confirm the potency of the inhaled corticosteroid FP and provide evidence for a considerable tissue-specific interindividual variation in the expression of the <START:ggp> GR <END> . 
[ Corticoids and allergy ] 
Inflammation is constantly observed in allergic reactions . 
Corticosteroids are most effective in preventing the late phase of allergic reaction . 
The action of glucocorticosteroids is mediated through <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> present in the cellular cytoplasm . 
When activated , <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> form a <START:ggp> dimer <END> and bind to DNA after migration into the nucleus . 
Interaction to DNA induces changes in the transcription rate , leading to either gene induction or gene repression . 
Glucocorticoid receptors are also able to interact with transcriptional factors such as <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> ) of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ) . 
Through these actions glucocorticosteroids are susceptible to modify functions of cells involved in the allergic inflammatory response . 
They are in particular able to inhibit most of the pro-inflammatory functions of the <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
Jeg-3 human choriocarcinoma-induced immunosuppression : downregulation of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain <END> , and its <START:ggp> Jak/Stat <END> signaling pathway . 
PROBLEM : The mechanisms of the immunosuppressive and immunosuppression-inducing capacities of <START:ana> Jeg-3 human choriocarcinoma cell line <END> supernatants ( HCSs ) are not yet completely understood . 
The influence on <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> interferon ( IFN ) -gamma <END> production ; <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) alpha <END> - , <START:ggp> beta <END> - , and <START:ggp> gamma-chain <END> ; and the <START:ggp> signaling pathway molecules <END> <START:ggp> Janus kinase <END> <START:ggp> ( Jak ) 1 <END> , <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> , signal transducers and <START:ggp> activators of transcription <END> <START:ggp> ( Stat ) 1 <END> , <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> , and <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> should be investigated . 
METHOD OF STUDY : For assessment of IL production , whole peripheral venous blood from healthy donors was stimulated with phorbol-myristate-acetate and ionomycine . 
Secretion of <START:ggp> ILs <END> was blocked with monensine . 
Intracellular <START:ggp> ILs <END> were analyzed by flow cytometry . 
For <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> and signaling pathway molecule analysis , peripheral <START:ana> blood lymphocytes <END> were stimulated with <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> ( <START:ggp> PHA <END> ) . 
IL-2R chains were measured by flow cytometry , and <START:ggp> Jaks/Stats <END> by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) and Western blot . 
RESULTS : Phorbol-myristate-acetate and ionomycine strongly increase the percent-age of <START:ana> IL-2+ cells <END> ; an additional 50 % HCSs significantly suppresses the percentage to , or below the level of <START:ana> unstimulated cells <END> . 
IFN-gamma production is strongly decreased by HCSs in some cases , but not in others . 
<START:ggp> PHA <END> stimulates IL-2R alpha- , beta- , and gamma-chain expression and their <START:ggp> signaling pathway molecules <END> <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> , <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> , Stat1 , <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> , and <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> . 
50 % HCS downregulates the <START:ggp> alpha-chain <END> and slightly upregulates the <START:ggp> beta-chain <END> . 
Jak1 , Jak3 , Stat1 , Stat3 , and Stat5 expression is suppressed approximately to , or below the level of <START:ana> unstimulated cells <END> . 
CONCLUSIONS : HCS forcefully blocks the production of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ; the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha-chain <END> ; and Jak1 , Jak3 , Stat1 , Stat3 , and Stat5 expression . 
The observed phenomena might be caused by downregulation of an <START:ggp> IL-2R regulation gene <END> , and might play a key role in the expansion of choriocarcinoma , and possibly in the survival of the fetal allograft . 
<START:ana> Apoptosis-resistant T cells <END> have a deficiency in <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -mediated induction of <START:ggp> Fas ligand <END> transcription . 
Apoptosis induced through the <START:ggp> TCR <END> in <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> is mostly mediated by the inducible expression of <START:ggp> Fas ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> FasL <END> ) as a primary event leading to the commitment to death . 
To gain a better understanding of the transcriptional events that regulate this expression , we took advantage of our previously described <START:ana> mutant Jurkat cells <END> . 
These cells are deficient in <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression and apoptosis induced upon <START:ggp> TCR <END> triggering , although their cytokine ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) production is normal . 
Here we show that both a <START:ggp> FasL- and a consensus NF-kappaB- reporter construct <END> are inefficiently induced in these cells compared to <START:ana> wild-type cells <END> . 
In addition , we demonstrate that the inducible transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> FasL reporter <END> is abolished by specific inhibitors of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
Thus , we could trace the deficit of the <START:ana> mutant cells <END> to an inefficient <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation , evidencing a relevant role for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in the regulation of <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
Furthermore , our results suggest that the induction of <START:ggp> FasL <END> versus <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> expression is differentially sensitive to <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> deprivation . 
Decreased <START:ggp> proteasome <END> -mediated degradation in <START:ana> T cells <END> from the elderly : A role in immune senescence . 
Induction of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> is a highly regulated process requiring phosphorylation , ubiquitination , and <START:ggp> proteasome <END> -mediated degradation of the <START:ggp> cytosolic inhibitor <END> <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> . 
Analyses of the regulation of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> in <START:ana> TNF-alpha-treated T lymphocytes <END> from young and elderly donors revealed severely compromised degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> from the elderly . 
Examination of activation-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> did not demonstrate any significant age-related alterations . 
However , examination of <START:ggp> proteasome <END> activity in these <START:ana> T cells <END> using fluorogenic peptide assays revealed a significant age-related decline in chymotryptic activity . 
These results suggest that a decline in <START:ggp> proteasome <END> activity results in a failure to fully degrade <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> in the elderly . 
This failure to degrade <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> may underlie both the observed decrease in <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> induction and the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> receptor expression in <START:ana> TNF-treated T cells <END> during aging . 
Thus , decreased <START:ggp> proteasome <END> -mediated degradation may be central to immune dysfunction that accompanies aging .

Inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -inducible gene expression in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> by <START:ggp> type I and type II interferons <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Th2-type cytokines <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) and <START:ggp> interleukin-13 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> ) , induce expression of a distinct subset of genes in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> , including <START:ggp> FcepsilonRIIb <END> ( <START:ggp> CD23 <END> ) , <START:ggp> 15-lipoxygenase <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor antagonist <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1ra <END> ) , and <START:ggp> type I and type II IL-1 receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1R <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> Type I interferons <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> ) and <START:ggp> type II interferon <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) inhibit induction of these genes by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> . 
However , the mechanism by which <START:ggp> IFNs <END> mediate this inhibition has not been defined . 
In this overview , we discuss the role of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> ( <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 <END> ) in mediating IL-4- and IL-13-induced gene expression in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
We also discuss our recent findings that <START:ggp> type I and type II IFNs <END> suppress <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> / <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> -inducible gene expression by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> . 
The ability of <START:ggp> type I and type II IFNs <END> to inhibit <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> / <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> -induced <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> activity is dose- and time-dependent , and is not unique to <START:ana> monocytes <END> because <START:ggp> IFNs <END> induce the same effects in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> activity is not evident unless cells are preincubated with <START:ggp> IFN <END> for at least 1 h before <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> stimulation . 
Furthermore , inhibition can be blocked by actinomycin D , indicating a requirement for de novo transcription . 
We propose a model in which stimulation of <START:ana> monocytes <END> by <START:ggp> IFN <END> activates de novo synthesis of an <START:ggp> inhibitory factor <END> , possibly one or more members of the <START:ggp> SOCS/ SSI/CIS gene family <END> , capable of suppressing activation of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> . 
Because <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> activation plays an essential role in <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> / <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> -induced gene expression , the ability of <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> to inhibit <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> activity provides an explanation for how <START:ggp> IFNs <END> can suppress <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> / <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> -inducible gene expression . 
<START:ggp> HLA class I <END> -mediated induction of cell proliferation involves <START:ggp> cyclin E <END> -mediated inactivation of Rb function and induction of <START:ggp> E2F <END> activity . 
Chronic rejection of transplanted organs is manifested as atherosclerosis of the blood vessels of the allograft . 
<START:ggp> HLA class I Ags <END> have been implicated to play a major role in this process , since signaling via <START:ggp> HLA class I molecules <END> can induce the proliferation of <START:ana> aortic endothelial <END> as well as <START:ana> smooth muscle cells <END> . 
In this study , we show that <START:ggp> HLA class I <END> -mediated induction of cell proliferation correlates with inactivation of the <START:ggp> Rb protein <END> in the <START:ana> T cell line Jurkat <END> as well as <START:ana> human aortic endothelial cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> HLA class I <END> -mediated inactivation of <START:ggp> Rb <END> can be inhibited specifically by <START:ggp> neutralizing Abs <END> to <START:ggp> basic fibroblast growth factor <END> ( <START:ggp> bFGF <END> ) , suggesting a role for <START:ggp> FGF receptors <END> in the signaling process . 
Signaling through <START:ggp> HLA class I molecules <END> induced <START:ggp> cyclin E <END> -associated kinase activity within 4 h in <START:ana> quiescent endothelial cells <END> , and appeared to mediate the inactivation of <START:ggp> Rb <END> . 
A cdk2 inhibitor , Olomoucine , as well as a <START:ggp> dominant-negative cdk2 construct <END> prevented <START:ggp> HLA class I <END> -mediated inactivation of <START:ggp> Rb <END> ; in contrast , <START:ggp> dominant-negative cdk4 and cdk6 constructs <END> had no effect . 
Furthermore , there was no increase in <START:ggp> cyclin D-associated kinase <END> activity upon <START:ggp> HLA class I <END> ligation , suggesting that <START:ggp> cyclin E-dependent kinase <END> activity mediates <START:ggp> Rb <END> inactivation , leading to <START:ggp> E2F <END> activation and cell proliferation . 
Immunosuppressant PG490 ( triptolide ) inhibits <START:ggp> T-cell interleukin-2 <END> expression at the level of <START:ggp> purine-box/nuclear factor <END> of <START:ana> activated T-cells <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> transcriptional activation . 
PG490 ( triptolide ) is a diterpene triepoxide with potent immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory properties . 
PG490 inhibits <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2 <END> expression by <START:ana> normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and antibody to <START:ggp> CD3 <END> ( IC50 of 10 ng/ml ) , and with PMA and ionomycin ( Iono , IC50 of 40 ng/ml ) . 
In <START:ana> Jurkat T-cells <END> , PG490 inhibits PMA/Iono-stimulated <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcription . 
PG490 inhibits the induction of DNA binding activity at the <START:ggp> purine-box/antigen receptor response element ( ARRE ) /nuclear factor of activated T-cells ( NF-AT ) target sequence <END> but not at the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB site <END> . 
PG490 can completely inhibit transcriptional activation at the <START:ggp> purine-box/ARRE/NF-AT and NF-kappaB target DNA sequences <END> triggered by all stimuli examined ( PMA , PMA/Iono , <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ) . 
PG490 also inhibits PMA-stimulated activation of a <START:ggp> chimeric transcription factor <END> in which the <START:ggp> C-terminal TA1 transactivation domain <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB p65 <END> is fused to the <START:ggp> DNA binding domain <END> of <START:ggp> GAL4 <END> . 
In <START:ana> 16HBE human bronchial epithelial cells <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> expression is regulated predominantly by <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , and PG490 but not cyclosporin A can completely inhibit expression of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> . 
The mechanism of PG490 inhibition of <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> expression differs from cyclosporin A and involves nuclear inhibition of transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and the <START:ggp> purine-box regulator <END> operating at the <START:ggp> ARRE/NF-AT site <END> at a step after specific DNA binding . 
Unexpected and coordinated expression of <START:ggp> Spi-1 <END> , <START:ggp> Fli-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> megakaryocytic genes <END> in four <START:ana> Epo-dependent cell lines <END> established from transgenic mice displaying erythroid-specific expression of a <START:ggp> thermosensitive SV40 T antigen <END> . 
Most <START:ana> erythroleukemic cell lines <END> established in vitro coexpress <START:ggp> erythrocytic and megakaryocytic markers <END> that often are associated with expression of <START:ggp> Spi-1 <END> and/or <START:ggp> Fli-1 transcription factors <END> known as <START:ggp> transactivators of megakaryocyte-specific promoters <END> . 
In the present study , we examined the possibility of establishing <START:ana> new cell lines <END> keeping strictly erythroid-specific properties in vitro through the targeted and conditional immortalization of <START:ana> erythrocytic progenitors <END> . 
For that purpose , we established several lines of transgenic mice displaying erythroid-specific expression of a <START:ggp> thermosensitive SV40 T antigen <END> . 
As expected , these transgenic mice developed splenomegaly due to the massive amplification of <START:ana> Ter 119 positive erythroid nucleated cells <END> expressing <START:ggp> T antigen <END> . 
Despite this drastic effect in vivo , the in vitro immortalization of <START:ana> erythropoietin-dependent erythroid progenitors <END> unexpectedly occurred at low frequency , and all four <START:ana> cell lines <END> established expressed both <START:ggp> erythrocytic ( globins ) and megakaryocytic markers <END> ( <START:ggp> glycoprotein IIb <END> , <START:ggp> platelet factor 4 <END> ) as well as <START:ggp> Spi-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Fli-1 transcripts <END> at permissive temperature . 
Switching the cells to the nonpermissive temperature led to a marked increase in <START:ggp> globin gene <END> expression and concomitant decrease in expression of <START:ggp> Spi-1 <END> , <START:ggp> Fli-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> megakaryocytic genes <END> in an <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> -dependent manner . 
Interestingly , enhanced expression of <START:ggp> Spi-1 and Fli-1 genes <END> already was detected in the <START:ana> Ter 119 positive cell population <END> of transgenic mice spleen in vivo . 
However , like <START:ana> normal Ter 119 erythroid cells <END> , these <START:ana> Ter 119 positive cells <END> from transgenic mice still expressed high levels of <START:ggp> beta-globin <END> and very low or undetectable <START:ggp> glycoprotein IIb <END> and <START:ggp> platelet factor 4 megakaryocytic transcripts <END> . 
Taken together , these data indicate that the unexpected expression of <START:ggp> megakaryocytic genes <END> is a specific property of <START:ana> immortalized cells <END> that can not be explained only by enhanced expression of <START:ggp> Spi-1 and/or Fli-1 genes <END> . 
Fludarabine-induced immunosuppression is associated with inhibition of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> signaling . 
Fludarabine is a nucleoside analog used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies that can induce severe and prolonged immunosuppression . 
Although it can be incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells , fludarabine is also a potent inhibitor of cells with a low growth fraction , thus it must have other mechanisms of action . 
<START:ggp> STAT1 <END> , which is activated in response to many <START:ggp> lymphocyte-activating cytokines <END> including the <START:ggp> interferons <END> , is essential for cell-mediated immunity , as the absence of this protein is associated with prominent defects in the ability to control viral infections . 
Here we show that fludarabine , but not the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A , inhibits the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> -dependent gene transcription in <START:ana> normal resting or activated lymphocytes <END> . 
Fludarabine caused a specific depletion of <START:ggp> STAT1 protein <END> ( and mRNA ) but not of other <START:ggp> STATs <END> . 
This loss of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> was also seen in cells from patients treated with fludarabine in vivo . 
Brief exposure to fludarabine led to a sustained loss of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> , analogous to the prolonged period of immunosuppression induced by exposure to the drug in vivo . 
Thus , <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> may be a useful target in the development of new immunosuppressive and antineoplastic agents . 
Studies into the effect of <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphatase <END> inhibitor phenylarsine oxide on <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> during aging : evidence for altered <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> phosphorylation and degradation . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear Factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> ) is a critical regulator of several genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses . 
Treatment of <START:ana> T cells <END> with a variety of stimuli , including <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , leads to the translocation of the active <START:ggp> p65-50 heterodimer <END> to the nucleus , albeit at a lower level in <START:ana> T cells <END> from the elderly . 
We demonstrate here that pretreatment with PAO results in the inhibition of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> induction in <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> treated <START:ana> T cells <END> , suggesting a role for <START:ggp> PAO-sensitive phosphatase <END> in the activation of the <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> via this pathway in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
Furthermore , it demonstrates that aging does not influence the sensitivity of this <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> . 
Treatment with DMP prior to treatment with PAO and <START:ggp> TNF <END> abolishes the inhibition induced by PAO , in <START:ana> T cells <END> from both young and old donors , alike . 
Finally , we demonstrate that a failure to degrade <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> in cytosols of <START:ana> TNF-treated T cells <END> pretreated with PAO is due to its interference with the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> and not due to its inhibitory effect on proteasomal degradation . 
These data collectively suggest that PAO interferes with the phosphorylation and the regulated degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> , induced by <START:ggp> TNF <END> , without affecting the chymotryptic activity of the <START:ggp> proteasome <END> , independent of age . 
<START:ggp> Spi-C <END> , a novel <START:ggp> Ets protein <END> that is temporally regulated during B lymphocyte development . 
A novel <START:ggp> Ets protein <END> was isolated by yeast one-hybrid screening of a <START:ggp> cDNA library <END> made from <START:ana> lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse splenic B cells <END> , using the <START:ggp> SP6 kappa promoter kappaY element <END> as a bait . 
The novel <START:ggp> Ets protein <END> was most closely related to <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> and <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> within the <START:ggp> DNA binding Ets domain <END> and was therefore named <START:ggp> Spi-C <END> . 
However , <START:ggp> Spi-C <END> may represent a novel subgroup within the <START:ggp> Ets protein family <END> , as it differed significantly from <START:ggp> Spi-B <END> and <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> within <START:ggp> helix 1 <END> of the <START:ggp> Ets domain <END> . 
<START:ggp> Spi-C <END> was encoded by a <START:ggp> single-copy gene <END> that was mapped to <START:ggp> chromosome 10 <END> , <START:ggp> region C <END> . 
<START:ggp> Spi-C <END> interacted with DNA similarly to <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> as judged by methylation interference , band-shift and site selection analysis , and activated transcription of a <START:ggp> kappaY element reporter gene <END> upon co-transfection of <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
<START:ana> Spi-C RNA <END> was expressed in <START:ana> mature B lymphocytes <END> and at lower levels in <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ana> pre-B cell and plasma cell lines <END> were <START:ggp> Spi-C <END> -negative , suggesting that <START:ggp> Spi-C <END> might be a <START:ggp> regulatory molecule <END> during a specific phase of B lymphoid development . 
Glucocorticoid-induced cell death requires autoinduction of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> expression in <START:ana> human leukemic T cells <END> . 
In contrast to the negative autoregulation of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) expression seen in most cells and tissues , <START:ggp> GR <END> expression is positively autoregulated in <START:ana> human leukemic T cells <END> and in other cells sensitive to glucocorticoid-induced cell death . 
To determine whether positive autoregulation is a necessary component of glucocorticoid-induced cell death , a <START:ggp> wild-type GR gene <END> under the control of a <START:ggp> tetracycline-regulated promoter <END> was stably transfected into <START:ana> glucocorticoid-resistant cells <END> lacking endogenous functional receptor . 
<START:ana> Transfectants <END> grown in the presence of tetracycline contained about 15 , 000 receptors/cell , a value approximately equal to basal level <START:ggp> GR <END> expression in <START:ana> glucocorticoid-sensitive 6TG1.1 cells <END> before steroid treatment . 
Under these conditions , dexamethasone had a minimal effect on cell growth , elicited little internucleosomal DNA fragmentation , and induced no cell cycle perturbation . 
In the absence of tetracycline , <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> and protein expression increased 2-3-fold , and cells expressed 48 , 000 receptors , a level nearly equivalent to that present in <START:ana> 6TG1.1 cells <END> after 18 h of autoinduction . 
Under these conditions , dexamethasone markedly inhibited cell growth , caused G1 arrest , and induced significant internucleosomal DNA fragmentation . 
These studies therefore suggest that basal level <START:ggp> GR <END> expression is inadequate to mediate glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in <START:ana> glucocorticoid-sensitive T cells <END> and that positive autoregulation is a necessary component of this process . 
Constitutive activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> primary adult T-cell leukemia cells <END> . 
Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is an etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) . 
The <START:ggp> viral protein <END> <START:ggp> Tax <END> induces the activation and nuclear translocalization of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , which is proposed to play a crucial role in the transformation of <START:ana> T cells <END> by HTLV-I . 
However , the <START:ggp> HTLV-I genes <END> including <START:ggp> Tax <END> are not expressed significantly in <START:ana> primary leukemic cells <END> from ATL patients . 
In this study , we examined the basis for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> freshly isolated leukemic cells <END> from ATL patients . 
We found that <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> from ATL patients , like <START:ana> HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines <END> , display constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA binding activity and increased degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> ( an inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) . 
Whereas the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding activity in <START:ana> Tax-expressing T-cell lines <END> consisted mostly of <START:ggp> p50/c-Rel <END> , fresh ATL samples contained <START:ggp> p50/p50 and p50/p65 heterodimers <END> . 
One <START:ana> T-cell line <END> derived from ATL <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> , TL-Om1 , displayed constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity , as well as enhanced degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> , despite the lack of detectable <START:ggp> Tax <END> expression . 
Interestingly , the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in TL-Om1 consists of <START:ggp> p50/p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> like that in fresh <START:ana> primary leukemic cells <END> . 
Our results suggest that activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> occurs through a <START:ggp> Tax <END> -independent mechanism in <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> of ATL patients , possibly due to differential <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> subunit activation . 
<START:ggp> Interferon-alpha <END> induction of <START:ggp> STATs1 , -3 <END> DNA binding and growth arrest is independent of <START:ggp> Lck <END> and active <START:ggp> mitogen-activated kinase <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Type I <START:ggp> interferons <END> ( <START:ggp> IFNs <END> ) are a family of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> that have antiviral and antiproliferative effects . 
Data regarding the processes by which these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> transduce signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus are becoming increasingly complex . 
The most characterized pathway is via <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> -STAT <END> signaling . 
Previous studies established a potential role for the <START:ggp> Src-family kinase <END> <START:ggp> Lck <END> in <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> -STAT <END> signaling . 
Therefore , this study was designed to analyze the role of <START:ggp> Lck <END> in <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> signaling by using the Jurkat , JCam ( an <START:ana> Lck-defective cell line <END> derived from <START:ana> Jurkat <END> ) , and <START:ana> JCam/Lck <END> ( <START:ana> JCam cells <END> with <START:ggp> Lck <END> restored ) . 
The results show that <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> can induce <START:ggp> MAPK <END> activity , but only in cells containing <START:ggp> Lck <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> STATs1 and -3 <END> are effectively phosphorylated and activated to bind DNA in the absence of <START:ggp> Lck <END> expression in <START:ana> IFN-alpha-treated cells <END> . 
Finally , the results demonstrate that <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> exerts an antiproliferative effect in all three cell lines . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> Lck <END> and active <START:ggp> MAPK <END> do not affect <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> -induced growth arrest or induction of STAT1s1 and -3 DNA binding ability .

Selective activation and functional significance of <START:ggp> p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> in <START:ana> lipopolysaccharide-stimulated neutrophils <END> . 
Activation of <START:ana> leukocytes <END> by proinflammatory stimuli selectively initiates intracellular signal transduction via sequential phosphorylation of <START:ggp> kinases <END> . 
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation of <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> is known to result in activation of <START:ggp> p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MAPk <END> ) ; however , the <START:ggp> upstream activator <END> ( s ) of <START:ggp> p38 MAPk <END> is unknown , and consequences of <START:ggp> p38 MAPk <END> activation remain largely undefined . 
We investigated the <START:ggp> MAPk kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MKK <END> ) that activates <START:ggp> p38 MAPk <END> in response to LPS , the <START:ggp> p38 MAPk isoforms <END> that are activated as part of this pathway , and the functional responses affected by <START:ggp> p38 MAPk <END> activation . 
Although <START:ggp> MKK3 <END> , <START:ggp> MKK4 <END> , and <START:ggp> MKK6 <END> all activated <START:ggp> p38 MAPk <END> in experimental models , only <START:ggp> MKK3 <END> was found to activate recombinant <START:ggp> p38 MAPk <END> in LPS-treated neutrophils . 
Of <START:ggp> p38 MAPk isoforms <END> studied , only <START:ggp> p38alpha <END> and <START:ggp> p38delta <END> were detected in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> . 
LPS stimulation selectively activated <START:ggp> p38alpha <END> . 
Specific inhibitors of <START:ggp> p38alpha MAPk <END> blocked LPS-induced adhesion , nuclear factor-kappa B ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) activation , and synthesis of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> p38alpha MAPk <END> resulted in a transient decrease in <START:ana> TNF-alpha mRNA <END> accumulation but persistent loss of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> synthesis . 
These findings support a pathway by which LPS stimulation of <START:ana> neutrophils <END> results in activation of <START:ggp> MKK3 <END> , which in turn activates <START:ggp> p38alpha MAPk <END> , ultimately regulating adhesion , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation , enhanced gene expression of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , and regulation of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> synthesis . 
The <START:ggp> evolutionarily conserved sequence <END> upstream of the <START:ggp> human Ig heavy chain S gamma 3 region <END> is an <START:ggp> inducible promoter <END> : synergistic activation by <START:ggp> CD40 ligand <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> via cooperative <START:ggp> NF-kappa B and STAT-6 binding sites <END> . 
Germline C gamma gene transcription is a crucial event in the process that leads to switch DNA recombination to <START:ggp> IgG <END> , but its regulation in the human is poorly understood . 
We took advantage of our monoclonal model of <START:ana> germinal center B cell <END> differentiation , <START:ana> IgM+ IgD+ CL-01 cells <END> , to define the role of the <START:ggp> I gamma 3 <END> <START:ggp> evolutionarily conserved sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> ECS <END> ) in the <START:ggp> germline <END> transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> human C gamma 3 gene <END> . 
The <START:ggp> I gamma 3 <END> <START:ggp> ECS <END> lies upstream of the <START:ggp> major I gamma 3 transcription initiation site <END> and displays more than 90 % identity with the corresponding <START:ggp> human I gamma 1 <END> , <START:ggp> I gamma 2 <END> , and <START:ggp> I gamma 4 <END> regions . 
<START:ggp> Reporter luciferase gene vectors <END> containing the <START:ggp> human gamma 3 ECS <END> were used to transfect <START:ana> CL-01 cells <END> , which have been shown to undergo Smu -- > S gamma 3 DNA recombination , upon engagement of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> by <START:ggp> CD40 ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> CD40L <END> ) and exposure to <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> . 
In these transfected <START:ana> CL-01 cells <END> , CD40 : <START:ggp> CD40L <END> engagement and exposure to <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> synergistically induced gamma 3 ECS-dependent <START:ggp> luciferase reporter gene <END> activation . 
Targeted mutational analysis demonstrated that a tandem <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel binding motif <END> is critical for the <START:ggp> gamma 3 ECS <END> responsiveness to both <START:ggp> CD40L <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , while a <START:ggp> STAT-6-binding site <END> is additionally required for <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> inducibility . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that <START:ggp> p50/p65/c-Rel <END> and <START:ggp> STAT-6 <END> are effectively induced by <START:ggp> CD40L <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , respectively , and bind to specific <START:ggp> DNA motifs <END> within the <START:ggp> ECS <END> . 
These partially overlapping <START:ggp> CD40L and IL-4 responsive elements <END> are functionally cooperative as the disruption of one of them prevents synergistic promoter activation . 
Thus , the <START:ggp> gamma 3 ECS <END> is an inducible promoter containing <START:ggp> cis elements <END> that critically mediate <START:ggp> CD40L <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -triggered transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> human C gamma 3 gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> CIITA <END> -induced occupation of <START:ggp> MHC class II promoters <END> is independent of the cooperative stabilization of the <START:ggp> promoter-bound multi-protein complexes <END> . 
Precise regulation of <START:ana> MHC class II <END> expression plays a crucial role in the control of the immune response . 
The <START:ggp> transactivator <END> <START:ggp> CIITA <END> behaves as a master controller of constitutive and inducible <START:ggp> MHC class II gene <END> activation , but its exact mechanism of action is not known . 
Activation of <START:ggp> MHC class II promoters <END> requires binding of at least three distinct <START:ggp> multi-protein complexes <END> ( <START:ggp> RFX <END> , <START:ggp> X2BP <END> and <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> ) . 
It is known that the stability of this binding results from cooperative interactions between these proteins . 
We show here that expression of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> in <START:ana> MHC class II -cells <END> triggers occupation of the promoters by these complexes . 
This observation raised the possibility that the effect of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> on promoter occupation is mediated by an effect on the cooperative stabilization of the <START:ggp> DNA-bound multi-protein complexes <END> . 
We show , however , that the presence of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> does not affect the stability of the higher-order protein complex formed on DNA by <START:ggp> RFX <END> , <START:ggp> X2BP <END> and <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> . 
This suggests other mechanisms for <START:ggp> CIITA <END> -induced promoter occupancy , such as an effect on <START:ggp> chromatin <END> structure leading to increased accessibility of <START:ggp> MHC class II promoters <END> . 
This ability of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> to facilitate promoter occupation is undissociable from its transactivation potential . 
Finally , we conclude that this effect of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> is cell-type specific , since expression of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> is not required for normal occupation of <START:ggp> MHC class II promoters <END> in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> GrpL <END> , a <START:ggp> Grb2 <END> -related <START:ggp> adaptor protein <END> , interacts with <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> to regulate <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cell <END> activation . 
Propagation of signals from the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) involves a number of adaptor molecules . 
<START:ggp> SH2 domain-containing protein 76 <END> ( <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> ) interacts with the <START:ggp> guanine nucleotide exchange factor <END> <START:ggp> Vav <END> to activate the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) , and its expression is required for normal <START:ana> T cell <END> development . 
We report the cloning and characterization of a novel <START:ggp> Grb2-like adaptor molecule <END> designated as <START:ggp> Grb2-related protein of the lymphoid system <END> ( <START:ggp> GrpL <END> ) . 
Expression of <START:ggp> GrpL <END> is restricted to hematopoietic tissues , and it is distinguished from <START:ggp> Grb2 <END> by having a <START:ggp> proline-rich region <END> . 
<START:ggp> GrpL <END> can be coimmunoprecipitated with <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> but not with <START:ggp> Sos1 <END> or <START:ggp> Sos2 <END> from <START:ana> Jurkat cell <END> lysates . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> Grb2 <END> can be coimmunoprecipitated with <START:ggp> Sos1 <END> and <START:ggp> Sos2 <END> but not with <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT/pp36/38 <END> in detergent lysates prepared from <START:ana> anti-CD3 stimulated T cells <END> associated with <START:ggp> Grb2 <END> but not <START:ggp> GrpL <END> . 
These data reveal the presence of distinct complexes involving <START:ggp> GrpL <END> and <START:ggp> Grb2 <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
A functional role of the <START:ggp> GrpL-SLP-76 complex <END> is suggested by the ability of <START:ggp> GrpL <END> to act alone or in concert with <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> to augment <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> activation in <START:ana> Jurkat <END> <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Differential induction of <START:ggp> interferon ( IFN ) -inducible protein 10 <END> following differentiation of a <START:ana> monocyte <END> , <START:ana> macrophage cell <END> lineage is related to the changes of <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> bound to <START:ggp> IFN stimulus response element <END> and <START:ggp> kappaB sites <END> . 
We examined <START:ggp> chemokine <END> gene expression following the differentiation of a <START:ana> monocyte <END> , <START:ana> macrophage cell lineage <END> . 
The <START:ana> human monoblastic cell line <END> , <START:ana> U937 <END> was differentiated to <START:ana> macrophages <END> by the treatment with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , retinoic acid ( RA ) , or vitamin D3 ( VitD3 ) . 
The gene expression of <START:ggp> interferon ( IFN ) -inducible protein 10 <END> ( <START:ggp> IP-10 <END> ) ( a <START:ggp> CXC chemokine <END> ) was markedly augmented by the <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> treatment in PMA -or RA-differentiated <START:ana> U937 cells <END> , but only marginally in undifferentiated or <START:ana> VitD3-treated cells <END> . 
In contrast , another inducible gene expression of <START:ggp> monocyte chemotactic protein-1 <END> ( a <START:ggp> CC chemokine <END> ) and the activation of the <START:ggp> transcriptional factor <END> ( <START:ggp> FcRFgamma <END> ) bound to the <START:ggp> gamma response region <END> were similarly or less abundantly induced by <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> treatment in PMA -or RA-differentiated <START:ana> U937 cells <END> , indicating that increased <START:ana> IP-10 mRNA <END> induction was not due to the augmented ability of the cells to respond to the presence of <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> . 
Increased expression of <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> -induced <START:ana> IP-10 mRNA <END> following the differentiation of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> was mediated largely by augmented transcriptional activity of the gene and was related to differentiation-dependent changes of the proteins bound to <START:ggp> IFN stimulus response element ( ISRE ) <END> and <START:ggp> kB sites <END> , suggesting that these <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> may determine the <START:ana> IP-10 mRNA <END> inducibility by <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> . 
Role of <START:ggp> cellular tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors <END> in <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> transformation by herpesvirus Saimiri <START:ggp> STP <END> . 
The <START:ggp> STP oncoproteins <END> of the herpesvirus saimiri ( HVS ) subgroup A strain 11 and subgroup C strain 488 are now found to be stably associated with <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor ( TRAF ) 1 , 2 , or 3 <END> . 
Mutational analyses identified residues of <START:ggp> PXQXT/S <END> in <START:ggp> STP-A11 <END> as critical for <START:ggp> TRAF <END> association . 
In addition , a somewhat divergent region of <START:ggp> STP-C488 <END> is critical for <START:ggp> TRAF <END> association . 
Mutational analysis also revealed that <START:ggp> STP-C488 <END> induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation that was correlated with its ability to associate with <START:ggp> TRAFs <END> . 
The HVS <START:ggp> STP-C488 <END> P10 -- > R mutant was deficient in human T-lymphocyte transformation to interleukin-2-independent growth but showed wild-type phenotype for marmoset T-lymphocyte transformation in vitro and in vivo . 
The <START:ggp> STP-C488 P10 -- > R mutant <END> was also defective in Rat-1 fibroblast transformation , and fibroblast cell transformation was blocked by a <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> dominant-negative mutant . 
These data implicate <START:ggp> TRAFs <END> in <START:ggp> STP-C488 <END> -mediated transformation of <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> and rodent <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
Other factors are implicated in immortalization of <START:ana> common marmoset T lymphocytes <END> and may also be critical in the transformation of <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> rodent fibroblasts <END> . 
Cleavage of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> SP1 <END> by <START:ggp> caspases <END> during anti-IgM-induced <START:ana> B-cell <END> apoptosis . 
Apoptosis is instrumental in the processes generating the diversity of the B-cell repertoire . 
<START:ana> Autoreactive B-cells <END> are eliminated by <START:ggp> anti-IgM <END> crosslinking after encountering <START:ggp> self-antigens <END> , but precise mechanisms leading to <START:ana> B-cell <END> apoptosis are still not well understood . 
We report here the cleavage of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> SP1 <END> in the <START:ana> human Burkitt lymphoma cell line BL60 <END> during <START:ggp> anti-IgM <END> -induced apoptosis . 
Western blot analysis revealed two cleavage products of approximately <START:ggp> 68 kDa <END> and <START:ggp> 45 kDa <END> after induction of apoptosis . 
Cleavage could be completely inhibited by zDEVD-fmk , an inhibitor specific for <START:ggp> caspase 3-like proteases <END> . 
In-vitro cleavage of <START:ggp> recombinant SP1 <END> by <START:ggp> recombinant caspase 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> CPP32 <END> ) or <START:ggp> caspase 7 <END> ( <START:ggp> Mch 3 <END> ) results in similar cleavage products as those observed in vivo . 
<START:ggp> Recombinant caspase 6 <END> ( <START:ggp> Mch 2 <END> ) primarily generates a 68-kDa cleavage product , as observed after calcium ionophore ( CaI ) induced <START:ana> B-cell <END> apoptosis . 
In contrast , caspase 1 ( ICE ) did not cleave <START:ggp> SP1 <END> in vitro . 
The time course of <START:ggp> SP1 <END> cleavage during anti-IgM-induced apoptosis is paralleled by an increase of caspase activity measured by DEVD-p-nitroanilide ( DEVD-pNA ) cleavage . 
DNA band-shift assays revealed a decrease in the intensity of the full length <START:ggp> SP1 <END> /DNA complex and an increase in the intensity of a smaller complex due to the binding of one <START:ggp> SP1 <END> cleavage product . 
By Edman sequencing we could identify a caspase 3 cleavage site after Asp584 ( D584AQPQAGR ) , generating a 22-kDa C-terminal <START:ggp> SP1 <END> protein fragment which still contains the DNA binding site . 
Our results show the cleavage of the human <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> SP1 <END> in vivo and in vitro , underlining the central role of <START:ggp> caspase 3-like proteases <END> during the process of anti-IgM-induced apoptosis . 
Stimulation of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> on immunogenic human malignant melanomas augments their <START:ana> cytotoxic T lymphocyte <END> -mediated lysis and induces apoptosis . 
Here , we report the functional expression of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> on human malignant melanomas ( MMs ) . 
Comparison of tumor specimen from MM precursor lesions , primary tumors , and metastases revealed that <START:ggp> CD40 <END> surface expression is down-regulated during tumor progression . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> expression was confirmed in 7 <START:ana> human MM cell lines <END> established from immunogenic primary tumors or metastases , whereas 11 <START:ana> cell lines <END> established from advanced stages were <START:ggp> CD40 <END> negative . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> expression could be enhanced in <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -positive MM by stimulation with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> but not by <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -1beta <END> or <START:ggp> CD40 <END> triggering . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> ligation on MM by <START:ana> CD40L-transfected murine L-cells <END> or by a soluble <START:ggp> CD40L fusion protein <END> up-regulated their expression of <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> and <START:ggp> MHC class I and class II molecules <END> and their secretion of <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-a <END> , and <START:ggp> granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> and also induced a rapid activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> CD40 <END> ligation of a <START:ana> HLA-A2+ , MelanA/MART1+ MM cell line <END> enhanced its susceptibility to specific lysis by a <START:ana> HLA-A2-restricted , MelanA/MART-1-specific CTL clone <END> . 
Finally , <START:ggp> CD40 <END> ligation induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in MM . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> CD40 <END> <START:ggp> -CD40L <END> interactions may play an important role in augmenting antitumor immunity and inducing apoptosis in some <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -positive immunogenic human MMs . 
Human immunodeficiency virus-associated Hodgkin 's disease derives from <START:ana> post-germinal center B cells <END> . 
Human immunodeficiency virus-associated Hodgkin 's disease ( HIV-HD ) displays several peculiarities when compared with HD of the general population . 
These include overrepresentation of clinically aggressive histologic types and frequent infection of <START:ana> Reed-Sternberg ( RS ) cells <END> by Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) . 
Recently , we have reported that the histogenesis of HD of the general population may be assessed by monitoring the expression pattern of <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> expressed in <START:ana> germinal center ( GC ) B cells <END> , and of <START:ggp> CD138/syndecan-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> syn-1 <END> ) , a proteoglycan associated with post-GC , terminal <START:ana> B-cell <END> differentiation . 
In this study , we have applied these two markers to the study of HIV-HD histogenesis and correlated their expression status to the virologic features of this disease . 
We have found that <START:ana> RS cells <END> of all histologic categories of HIV-HD consistently display the <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> ( - ) /syn-1 ( + ) phenotype and thus reflect <START:ana> post-GC B cells <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> ( - ) /syn-1 ( + ) <START:ana> RS cells <END> of HIV-HD express <START:ggp> CD40 <END> , they are not surrounded by <START:ana> CD40 ligand-positive ( CD40L+ ) reactive T lymphocytes <END> , which , in HD of the general population , are thought to regulate the disease phenotype through <START:ggp> CD40 <END> <START:ggp> /CD40L <END> interactions . 
Conversely , <START:ana> RS cells <END> of virtually all HIV-HD express the <START:ggp> EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> ) , which , being functionally homologous to <START:ggp> CD40 <END> , may contribute , at least in part , to the modulation of the HIV-HD phenotype . 
<START:ggp> MDS1/EVI1 <END> enhances <START:ggp> TGF-beta1 <END> signaling and strengthens its growth-inhibitory effect but the <START:ggp> leukemia-associated fusion protein <END> <START:ggp> AML1/MDS1/EVI1 <END> , product of the t ( 3 ; 21 ) , abrogates growth-inhibition in response to <START:ggp> TGF-beta1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> MDS1/EVI1 <END> , located on <START:ggp> chromosome 3 band q26 <END> , encodes a <START:ggp> zinc-finger DNA-binding transcription activator <END> not detected in <START:ana> normal hematopoietic cells <END> but expressed in several normal tissues . 
<START:ggp> MDS1/EVI1 <END> is inappropriately activated in <START:ana> myeloid leukemias <END> following chromosomal rearrangements involving <START:ggp> band 3q26 <END> . 
The rearrangements lead either to gene truncation , and to expression of the <START:ggp> transcription repressor EVI1 <END> , as seen in the <START:ggp> t ( 3 ; 3 ) ( q21 ; q26 ) <END> and <START:ggp> inv ( 3 ) ( q21q26 ) <END> , or to gene fusion , as seen in the <START:ggp> t ( 3 ; 21 ) ( q26 ; q22 ) <END> which results in the fusion protein <START:ggp> AML1/MDS1/EVI1 <END> . 
This fusion protein contains the <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AML1 <END> fused in-frame to the entire <START:ggp> MDS1/EVI1 <END> with the exclusion of its first 12 amino acids . 
In this report , we have analyzed the response of the <START:ana> hematopoietic precursor cell line 32Dcl3 <END> , expressing either the <START:ggp> normal protein MDS1/EVI1 <END> or the <START:ggp> fusion protein AML1/MDS1/EVI1 <END> , to factors that control cell differentiation or cell replication . 
The <START:ana> 32Dcl3 cells <END> are <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> -dependent for growth and they differentiate into granulocytes when exposed to <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> . 
They are growth-inhibited by <START:ggp> TGF-beta1 <END> . 
We show that whereas the expression of <START:ggp> MDS1/EVI1 <END> has no effect on granulocytic differentiation induced by <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> , expression of <START:ggp> AML1/MDS1/EVI1 <END> blocks differentiation resulting in cell death . 
This effect is similar to that previously described by others for <START:ana> 32Dcl3 cells <END> that express <START:ggp> transgenic Evil <END> . 
Furthermore , we show that whereas the expression of the fusion protein <START:ggp> AML1/MDS1/EVI1 <END> completely abrogates the growth-inhibitory effect of <START:ggp> TGF-beta1 <END> and allows <START:ana> 32Dcl3 cells <END> to proliferate , expression of the normal protein <START:ggp> MDS1/EVI1 <END> has the opposite effect , and it strengthens the response of cells to the growth-inhibitory effect of <START:ggp> TGF-beta1 <END> . 
By using the yeast two-hybrid system , we also show that <START:ggp> EVI1 <END> ( contained in its entirety in <START:ggp> MDS1/EVI1 <END> and <START:ggp> AML1/MDS1/EVI1 <END> ) physically interacts with <START:ggp> SMAD3 <END> , which is an intracellular mediator of <START:ggp> TGF-beta1 <END> signaling . 
Finally , we have correlated the response of the cells to <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> or <START:ggp> TGF-beta1 <END> with the ability of the normal and <START:ggp> fusion proteins <END> to activate or repress promoters which they can directly regulate by binding to the <START:ggp> promoter site <END> . 
We propose that mutations of <START:ggp> MDS1/EVI1 <END> either by gene truncation resulting in the <START:ggp> transcription repressor EVI1 <END> or by gene fusion to <START:ggp> AML1 <END> lead to an altered cellular response to growth and <START:ggp> differentiation factors <END> that could result in leukemic transformation . 
The different response of myeloid cells ectopically expressing the normal or the <START:ggp> fusion protein <END> to <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> and <START:ggp> TGF-beta1 <END> could depend on the different transactivation properties of these proteins resulting in divergent expression of <START:ggp> downstream genes <END> regulated by the two proteins . 
Abnormalities of cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling in <START:ana> platelets <END> from untreated patients with bipolar disorder . 
BACKGROUND : Abnormalities in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) -dependent phosphorylation system have been recently reported in patients with bipolar disorder . 
We evaluated the immunoreactivity of the <START:ggp> regulatory and catalytic subunits <END> of <START:ggp> cAMP-dependent protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> ) and 1 of its substrates , <START:ggp> Rap1 <END> , in <START:ana> platelets <END> from untreated euthymic , manic , and depressed patients with bipolar disorder and healthy subjects . 
METHODS : <START:ana> Platelets <END> were collected from 112 drug-free patients with bipolar disorder ( 52 euthymic , 29 depressed , and 31 manic ) and 62 healthy subjects . 
The levels of <START:ggp> cAMP-dependent protein kinase <END> and <START:ggp> Rap1 <END> were assessed by Western blot analysis , immunostaining , and computer-assisted imaging . 
RESULTS : The immunolabeling of the <START:ggp> catalytic subunit <END> of <START:ggp> cAMP-dependent protein kinase <END> was significantly different among groups ( P < .001 ) , with higher values in untreated depressed and manic patients with bipolar disorder compared with untreated euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and healthy subjects . 
No significant differences were found in the immunolabeling of the <START:ggp> regulatory subunits <END> ( type I and type II ) of <START:ggp> cAMP-dependent protein kinase <END> . 
The immunolabeling of <START:ggp> Rap1 <END> was significantly higher ( P < .001 ) in untreated euthymic , depressed , and manic patients than in healthy persons . 
CONCLUSIONS : Levels of <START:ggp> Rap1 <END> and the <START:ggp> catalytic subunit <END> of <START:ggp> cAMP-dependent protein kinase <END> are altered in the <START:ana> platelets <END> of bipolar patients . 
These findings may provide clues toward understanding the involvement of cAMP signaling in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder . 
Molecular regulation of <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> expression during the immune response . 
<START:ggp> Cytokine <END> expression by immune system cells plays an important role in the regulation of the immune response . 
On first encounter with antigen , <START:ana> naive CD4+ T helper ( Th ) cells <END> differentiate into <START:ana> cytokine-producing effector cells <END> . 
Two types of effector cells characterized by their distinct expression of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> profiles have been described . 
Th1 cells produce <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , whereas <START:ana> Th2 cells <END> produce <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> . 
In many pathological situations , the balance between Th1 and Th2 immune responses determines the outcome of diverse immunologically mediated clinical syndromes including infectious , autoimmune , and allergic diseases . 
However , the molecular basis for the tissue-specific expression of <START:ggp> Th1/Th2-like cytokines <END> has remained elusive . 
In this review we evaluate the possible in vivo role of different transcription factors and transcriptional mechanisms in T cell differentiation and the immune response . 
<START:ggp> Tcf-1 <END> -mediated transcription in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> : differential role for <START:ggp> glycogen synthase kinase-3 <END> in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Beta-catenin is the vertebrate homolog of the <START:ggp> Drosophila segment polarity gene <END> <START:ggp> Armadillo <END> and plays roles in both cell-cell adhesion and transduction of the Wnt signaling cascade . 
Recently , members of the <START:ggp> Lef/Tcf transcription factor family <END> have been identified as protein partners of <START:ggp> beta-catenin <END> , explaining how <START:ggp> beta-catenin <END> alters gene expression . 
Here we report that in <START:ana> T cells <END> , <START:ggp> Tcf-1 <END> also becomes transcriptionally active through interaction with <START:ggp> beta-catenin <END> , suggesting that the Wnt signal transduction pathway is operational in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> as well . 
However , although Wnt signals are known to inhibit the activity of the <START:ggp> negative regulatory protein kinase <END> <START:ggp> glycogen synthase kinase-3beta <END> ( <START:ggp> GSK-3beta <END> ) , resulting in increased levels of <START:ggp> beta-catenin <END> , we find no evidence for involvement of <START:ggp> GSK-3beta <END> in Tcf-mediated transcription in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
That is , a <START:ggp> dominant negative GSK-3beta <END> does not specifically activate Tcf transcription and stimuli ( lithium or <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> ) that inhibit <START:ggp> GSK-3beta <END> activity also do not activate <START:ggp> Tcf reporter genes <END> . 
Thus , inhibition of <START:ggp> GSK-3beta <END> is insufficient to activate Tcf-dependent transcription in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
In contrast , in <START:ana> C57MG fibroblast cells <END> , lithium inactivates <START:ggp> GSK-3beta <END> and induces Tcf-controlled transcription . 
This is the first demonstration that lithium can alter gene expression of <START:ggp> Tcf-responsive genes <END> , and points to a difference in regulation of Wnt signaling between <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> and <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> SHP2-interacting transmembrane adaptor protein <END> ( <START:ggp> SIT <END> ) , a novel <START:ggp> disulfide-linked dimer <END> regulating human T cell activation . 
<START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> express several <START:ggp> low molecular weight transmembrane adaptor proteins <END> that recruit <START:ggp> src homology ( SH ) 2 domain-containing intracellular molecules <END> to the cell membrane via tyrosine-based signaling motifs . 
We describe here a novel molecule of this group termed <START:ggp> SIT <END> ( <START:ggp> SHP2 interacting transmembrane adaptor protein <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> SIT <END> is a <START:ggp> disulfide-linked homodimeric glycoprotein <END> that is expressed in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
After tyrosine phosphorylation by <START:ggp> src <END> and possibly <START:ggp> syk <END> <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinases <END> <START:ggp> SIT <END> recruits the <START:ggp> SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> SHP2 <END> via an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> SIT <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> downmodulates T cell receptor- and phytohemagglutinin-mediated activation of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) by interfering with signaling processes that are probably located upstream of activation of <START:ggp> phospholipase C <END> . 
However , binding of <START:ggp> SHP2 <END> to <START:ggp> SIT <END> is not required for inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> induction , suggesting that <START:ggp> SIT <END> not only regulates <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> activity but also controls <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> unrelated pathways of T cell activation involving <START:ggp> SHP2 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 <END> , <START:ggp> Jun N-terminal kinase <END> , and <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> are involved in <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -dependent <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> expression in human monocytes . 
In the present study we investigated the possible involvement of the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase family <END> members <START:ggp> extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 <END> ( <START:ggp> ERK1/2 <END> ) and c- <START:ggp> Jun N-terminal kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> JNK <END> ) in mediating <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> gene expression in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> , in particular their role in enhancing <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity . 
Freshly isolated monocytes treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid secreted high levels of <START:ggp> IL-6 protein <END> , which coincided with enhanced binding activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> as well as with phosphorylation and activation of the <START:ggp> ERK1/2 and JNK proteins <END> . 
The ERK pathway-specific inhibitor PD98059 inhibited <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> secretion from <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Transient overexpression of inactive mutants of either <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> or <START:ggp> JNK1 <END> showed that both pathways were involved in kappa B-dependent <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> promoter activity . 
By using PD98059 , we demonstrated that the Raf1/MEK1/ <START:ggp> ERK1/2 <END> pathway did not affect the DNA binding of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> but , rather , acted at the level of transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Interestingly , it was shown that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -mediated gene transcription , both in the context of the <START:ggp> IL-6 promoter <END> as well as on its own , was dependent on both serine kinase activity and interaction with <START:ggp> c-Jun protein <END> . 
We conclude that okadaic acid-induced <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> gene expression is at least partly mediated through the <START:ggp> ERK1/2 <END> and <START:ggp> JNK <END> pathway-dependent activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> transcriptional capacity . 
Our results suggest that the <START:ggp> JNK <END> pathway may regulate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -mediated gene transcription through its phosphorylation and activation of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> ) , a protein required for <START:ana> B lymphocyte <END> immortalization , induces the synthesis of <START:ggp> type I interferon <END> in <START:ana> Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines <END> . 
<START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> ) , a protein involved in cell transformation , interferes with the cellular response to <START:ggp> type I interferons <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-alpha/beta <END> ) . 
We investigated the function of conditionally expressed <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> in the context of the <START:ggp> IFN <END> response in <START:ana> Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> led to the transcriptional activation of both endogenous or transfected <START:ggp> IFN-stimulated genes <END> ( <START:ggp> ISGs <END> ) , genes which contain within their <START:ggp> promoters <END> either the <START:ggp> interferon-stimulated response element <END> ( <START:ggp> ISRE <END> ) or the <START:ggp> gamma interferon activation site <END> ( <START:ggp> GAS <END> ) . 
In search of a molecular mechanism for the transcriptional induction of <START:ggp> ISGs <END> , we observed an <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> -dependent synthesis of IFN-beta mRNA at low levels and the secretion of low amounts of IFN . 
A transfected IFN-beta promoter responded to <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> activation , and a sequence closely resembling a <START:ggp> RBP-Jkappa binding site <END> was pinpointed as a potential target of <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> activity . 
<START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> -dependent transcriptional induction of the <START:ggp> IFN-beta promoter <END> occurred in <START:ana> EBV-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cells <END> , indicating that other <START:ggp> EBV genes <END> were not required for the induction of <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> synthesis . 
PGG-glucan , a soluble beta- ( 1 , 3 ) -glucan , enhances the oxidative burst response , microbicidal activity , and activates an <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-like factor <END> in <START:ana> human PMN <END> : evidence for a <START:ggp> glycosphingolipid beta- ( 1 , 3 ) -glucan receptor <END> . 
PGG-Glucan , a soluble beta- ( 1 , 6 ) -branched beta- ( 1 , 3 ) -linked glucose homopolymer derived from the cell wall of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , is an immunomodulator which enhances leukocyte anti-infective activity and enhances myeloid and megakaryocyte progenitor proliferation . 
Incubation of human whole blood with PGG-Glucan significantly enhanced the oxidative burst response of <START:ana> subsequently isolated blood leukocytes <END> to both soluble and particulate activators in a dose-dependent manner , and increased leukocyte microbicidal activity . 
No evidence for inflammatory <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production was obtained under these conditions . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that PGG-Glucan induced the activation of an <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-like nuclear transcription factor <END> in <START:ana> purified human neutrophils <END> . 
The binding of 3H-PGG-Glucan to human leukocyte membranes was specific , concentration-dependent , saturable , and high affinity ( Kd approximately 6 nM ) . 
A <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> specific to the glycosphingolipid lactosylceramide was able to inhibit activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-like factor <END> by PGG-Glucan , and ligand binding data , including polysaccharide specificity , suggested that the PGG-Glucan binding moiety was lactosylceramide . 
These results indicate that PGG-Glucan enhances neutrophil anti-microbial functions and that interaction between this beta-glucan and <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> is mediated by the glycosphingolipid lactosylceramide present at the cell surface . 
Glucocorticoids promote nonphlogistic phagocytosis of <START:ana> apoptotic leukocytes <END> . 
Phagocyte recognition , uptake , and nonphlogistic degradation of <START:ana> neutrophils <END> and other <START:ana> leukocytes <END> undergoing apoptosis promote the resolution of inflammation . 
This study assessed the effects of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids on this leukocyte clearance mechanism . 
Pretreatment of `` semimature '' 5-day <START:ana> human monocyte-derived macrophages <END> ( M phi ) for 24 h with methylprednisolone , dexamethasone , and hydrocortisone , but not the nonglucocorticoid steroids aldosterone , estradiol , and progesterone , potentiated phagocytosis of <START:ana> apoptotic neutrophils <END> . 
These effects were specific in that the potentiated phagocytosis of <START:ana> apoptotic neutrophils <END> was completely blocked by the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> antagonist RU38486 , and glucocorticoids did not promote 5-day M phi ingestion of <START:ana> opsonized erythrocytes <END> . 
Similar glucocorticoid-mediated potentiation was observed with 5-day M phi uptake of alternative apoptotic `` targets '' ( <START:ana> eosinophils <END> and <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> ) and in uptake of <START:ana> apoptotic neutrophils <END> by alternative <START:ana> phagocytes <END> ( <START:ana> human glomerular mesangial cells <END> and <START:ana> murine M phi <END> elicited into the peritoneum or derived from bone marrow ) . 
Importantly , methylprednisolone-mediated enhancement of the uptake of <START:ana> apoptotic neutrophils <END> did not trigger the release of the <START:ggp> chemokines <END> <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> and <START:ggp> monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 <END> . 
Furthermore , longer-term potentiation by methylprednisolone was observed in <START:ana> maturing human monocyte-derived M phi <END> , with greater increases in 5-day <START:ana> M phi <END> uptake of <START:ana> apoptotic cells <END> being observed the earlier glucocorticoids were added during monocyte maturation into <START:ana> M phi <END> . 
We conclude that potentiation of nonphlogistic clearance of <START:ana> apoptotic leukocytes <END> by <START:ana> phagocytes <END> is a hitherto unrecognized property of glucocorticoids that has potential implications for therapies aimed at promoting the resolution of inflammatory diseases . 
1 , 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 induces differentiation of a <START:ana> retinoic acid-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line <END> ( <START:ana> UF-1 <END> ) associated with expression of <START:ggp> p21 ( WAF1/CIP1 ) <END> and <START:ggp> p27 ( KIP1 ) <END> . 
Retinoic acid ( RA ) resistance is a serious problem for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) who are receiving all-trans RA . 
However , the mechanisms and strategies to overcome RA resistance by <START:ana> APL cells <END> are still unclear . 
The biologic effects of RA are mediated by two distinct families of <START:ggp> transcriptional factors <END> : <START:ggp> RA receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RARs <END> ) and <START:ggp> retinoid X receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RXRs <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> RXRs <END> heterodimerize with <START:ggp> 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ] receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) , enabling their efficient transcriptional activation . 
The <START:ggp> cyclin-dependent kinase ( cdk ) inhibitor <END> <START:ggp> p21 ( WAF1/CIP1 ) <END> has a <START:ggp> vitamin D3-responsive element <END> ( <START:ggp> VDRE <END> ) in its <START:ggp> promoter <END> , and 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 enhances the expression of <START:ggp> p21 ( WAF1/CIP1 ) <END> and induces differentiation of selected <START:ana> myeloid leukemic cell lines <END> . 
We have recently established a novel <START:ana> APL cell line <END> ( <START:ana> UF-1 <END> ) with features of RA resistance . 
1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 can induce growth inhibition and G1 arrest of <START:ana> UF-1 cells <END> , resulting in differentiation of these cells toward <START:ana> granulocytes <END> . 
This 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3-induced G1 arrest is enhanced by all-trans RA . 
Also , 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ( 10 ( -10 ) to 10 ( -7 ) mol/L ) in combination with RA markedly inhibits cellular proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner . 
Associated with these findings , the levels of <START:ggp> p21 ( WAF1/CIP1 ) <END> and <START:ana> p27 ( KIP1 ) mRNA <END> and protein increased in these cells . 
Northern blot analysis showed that <START:ana> p21 ( WAF1/CIP1 ) and p27 ( KIP1 ) mRNA <END> and protein increased in these cells . 
Northern blot analysis showed that <START:ggp> p21 ( WAF1/CIP1 ) <END> and <START:ggp> p27 ( KIP1 ) <END> transcripts were induced after 6 hours ' exposure to 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 and then decreased to basal levels over 48 hours . 
Western blot experiments showed that <START:ggp> p21 ( WAF1/CIP1 ) <END> protein levels increased and became detectable after 12 hours of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 treatment and induction of <START:ggp> p27 ( KIP1 ) <END> protein was much more gradual and sustained in <START:ana> UF-1 cells <END> . 
Interestingly , the combination of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 and RA markedly enhanced the levels of <START:ggp> p27 ( KIP1 ) <END> transcript and protein as compared with levels induced by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 alone . 
In addition , exogenous <START:ggp> p27 ( KIP1 ) <END> expression can enhance the level of <START:ggp> CD11b antigen <END> in <START:ana> myeloid leukemic cells <END> . 
In contrast , RA alone can induce G1 arrest of <START:ana> UF-1 cells <END> ; however , it did not result in an increase of <START:ggp> p21 ( WAF1/CIP1 ) <END> and <START:ggp> p27 ( KIP1 ) <END> transcript and protein expression in RA-resistant cells . 
Taken together , we conclude that 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 induces increased expression of <START:ggp> cdk inhibitors <END> , which mediates a G1 arrest , and this may be associated with differentiation of RA-resistant <START:ana> UF-1 cells <END> toward mature <START:ana> granulocytes <END> . 
Molecular mechanisms of neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion induced by redox imbalance . 
Previous studies have implicated a role for intracellular thiols in the activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> and transcriptional regulation of <START:ggp> endothelial cell adhesion molecules <END> . 
This study was designed to determine whether changes in endothelial cell glutathione ( GSH ) or oxidized glutathione ( GSSG ) can alter neutrophil adhesivity and to define the molecular mechanism that underlies this GSSG/GSH-induced adhesion response . 
Treatment of <START:ana> human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC ) monolayers <END> for 6 hours with 0.2 mmol/L diamide and 1 mmol/L buthionine sulfoximine ( BSO ) decreased GSH levels and increased the ratio of GSSG to GSH without cell toxicity . 
These redox changes are similar to those observed with anoxia/reoxygenation . 
Diamide plus BSO-induced thiol/disulfide imbalance was associated with a biphasic increase in <START:ana> neutrophil <END> adhesion to <START:ana> HUVECs <END> with peak responses observed at 15 minutes ( phase 1 ) and 240 minutes ( phase 2 ) . 
N-Acetylcysteine treatment attenuated <START:ana> neutrophil <END> adhesion in both phases , which indicated a role for GSH in the adhesion responses . 
Interestingly , phase 1 adhesion was inversely correlated with GSH levels but not with the GSSG/GSH ratio , whereas phase 2 <START:ana> neutrophil <END> adhesion was positively correlated with GSSG/GSH ratio but not with GSH levels . 
<START:ggp> Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> and <START:ggp> P-selectin-specific monoclonal antibodies <END> attenuated the increased <START:ana> neutrophil <END> adhesion during both phases , whereas an <START:ggp> anti-E-selectin monoclonal antibody <END> also attenuated the phase 2 response . 
Pretreatment with actinomycin D and cycloheximide or with competing ds-oligonucleotides that contained <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> or <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> cognate DNA sequences significantly attenuated the phase 2 response , which implicated a role for de novo protein synthesis . 
Surface expression of <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> , <START:ggp> P-selectin <END> , and <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> on <START:ana> HUVECs <END> correlated with the phase 1 and 2 <START:ana> neutrophil <END> adhesion responses . 
This study demonstrates that changes in endothelial cell GSSG/GSH cause transcription-independent and transcription-dependent surface expression of different <START:ggp> endothelial cell adhesion molecules <END> , which leads to a 2-phase <START:ana> neutrophil <END> -endothelial adhesion response . 
Glucocorticoid hormone suppression of human <START:ana> neutrophil <END> -mediated tumor cell cytostasis . 
In the present study , we have investigated the effect of glucocorticoid hormones on <START:ana> neutrophil <END> -mediated tumor cell cytostasis and found that hydrocortisone and a synthetic hormone , dexamethasone ( Dex ) , inhibited cytostasis in the presence or absence of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> . 
The effect of Dex was completely reversed by a <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> antagonist , RU38486 . 
To clarify the underlying mechanisms , we examined effects of Dex on the binding avidity of <START:ggp> beta2 integrin <END> on the <START:ana> neutrophil <END> surface and how these might in turn affect <START:ana> neutrophil <END> -to-tumor cell binding . 
Dex was found to inhibit these <START:ana> neutrophil <END> properties , and RU38486 completely suppressed both forms of Dex inhibition . 
Taken together , our findings suggest that glucocorticoid hormone inhibition of <START:ana> neutrophil <END> -mediated tumor cell cytostasis is at least partially due to a lowering of the ligand binding avidity of <START:ggp> beta2 integrin <END> on the <START:ana> neutrophil <END> surface . 
Constitutive activation of an epithelial signal transducer and activator of transcription ( <START:ggp> STAT <END> ) pathway in asthma . 
<START:ggp> Cytokine <END> effects on immunity and inflammation often depend on the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> termed <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription <END> ( <START:ggp> STATs <END> ) , so <START:ggp> STAT <END> signaling pathways are candidates for influencing inflammatory disease . 
We reasoned that selective <START:ggp> IFN <END> responsiveness of the first <START:ggp> STAT family member <END> ( <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> Stat1-dependent immune-response genes <END> such as <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ) , <START:ggp> IFN regulatory factor-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> ) , and <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> itself in <START:ana> airway epithelial cells <END> provides a basis for detecting <START:ggp> cytokine <END> signaling abnormalities in inflammatory airway disease . 
On the basis of nuclear localization and phosphorylation , we found that <START:ggp> epithelial Stat1 <END> ( but not other control <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> ) was invariably activated in asthmatic compared with normal control or chronic bronchitis subjects . 
Furthermore , epithelial levels of activated <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> correlated with levels of expression for <START:ggp> epithelial ICAM-1 <END> , <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> , and in turn , <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> levels correlated with T-cell accumulation in tissue . 
However , only low levels of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> or <START:ana> IFN-gamma-producing cells <END> were detected in airway tissue in all subjects . 
The results therefore provide initial evidence linking abnormal behavior of <START:ggp> STAT <END> pathways for <START:ggp> cytokine <END> signaling to the development of an inflammatory disease . 
In that context , the results also change the current scheme for asthma pathogenesis to one that must include a localized gain in transcriptional signal ordinarily used for a <START:ggp> T helper 1-type cytokine <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) in combination with allergy-driven overproduction of <START:ggp> T helper 2-type cytokines <END> . 
<START:ana> Leukocyte populations <END> , <START:ggp> hormone receptors <END> and apoptosis in eutopic and ectopic first trimester human pregnancies . 
The implantation of <START:ana> trophoblast cells <END> at extrauterine sites still results in decidualization . 
The objective of the present study was to compare decidualization at eutopic and ectopic implantation sites . 
Tissues from women undergoing elective termination of uterine pregnancy and from women with ectopic pregnancy were used to detect the presence of cells important for the maintenance of pregnancy , such as <START:ana> BCL-2+ , CD56+ , CD3+ , CD8+ and CD68+ cells <END> , and the presence of <START:ggp> oestrogen ( ER ) and progesterone receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> PR <END> ) by immunohistochemistry . 
In-situ detection of fragmented DNA was performed to identify <START:ana> apoptotic cells <END> . 
The percentage of <START:ana> CD3+ cells <END> among all <START:ana> immunocompetent cells <END> in the tubal epithelium was 46.6 % ( 39.9 % of <START:ana> CD3+ <END> were also <START:ana> CD8+ <END> ) ; the other 53.4 % were <START:ana> CD68+ cells <END> . 
<START:ana> CD56+ cells <END> were undetectable in ectopic decidua at the feto-maternal interface in ectopic tissue . 
In uterine decidua , we found 29.9 % <START:ana> CD3+ cells <END> ( 2.2 % of CD3+ were CD8+ ) , 51.6 % <START:ana> CD56+ cells <END> and 18.5 % <START:ana> CD68+ cells <END> . 
The ratio of <START:ana> BCL2+ <END> to <START:ana> CD3+ cells <END> in ectopic pregnancy was 0.41 . 
In uterine pregnancy , the ratio of <START:ggp> BCL-2 <END> to CD3 was 0.44 and 0.39 for CD56 . 
Tissues from both ectopic and uterine pregnancies were positive for <START:ggp> PR <END> . 
Fewer <START:ana> apoptotic cell bodies <END> were present in ectopic pregnancy . 
The use of tissue obtained from ectopic pregnancy may become an excellent model to identify the mechanism of trophoblast invasion in eutopic pregnancies . 
<START:ggp> Angiotensin II <END> activates the <START:ggp> proinflammatory transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> renin <END> -angiotensin system may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis . 
A common feature of all stages of atherosclerosis is inflammation of the vessel wall . 
The transcription factor <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) participates in most signaling pathways involved in inflammation . 
This study therefore examined the effect of <START:ggp> angiotensin ( ANG ) II <END> on <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> , a major cellular component of human atheroma , by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . 
<START:ggp> ANG II <END> , like <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> , caused rapid activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> human mononuclear cells <END> isolated from peripheral blood by Ficoll density gradient . 
This <START:ggp> ANG II <END> effect was blocked by the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losartan . 
Specificity of <START:ggp> ANG II <END> -induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation was ascertained by supershift and competition experiments . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> ANG II <END> stimulated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> , but not in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> from the same preparation . 
Together , the data demonstrate the ability of the vasoactive peptide <START:ggp> ANG II <END> to activate inflammatory pathways in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> .

Signal transduction pathways activated in <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> following infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae . 
Chlamydia pneumoniae is an important respiratory pathogen . 
Recently , its presence has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic lesions . 
In this study , we characterized C. pneumoniae-mediated activation of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> and demonstrated an enhanced expression of <START:ggp> endothelial adhesion molecules <END> followed by subsequent rolling , adhesion , and transmigration of <START:ana> leukocytes <END> ( <START:ana> monocytes <END> , <START:ana> granulocytes <END> ) . 
These effects were blocked by <START:ggp> mAbs <END> against <START:ggp> endothelial and/or leukocyte adhesion molecules <END> ( <START:ggp> beta1 and beta2 integrins <END> ) . 
Additionally , activation of different signal transduction pathways in <START:ana> C. pneumoniae-infected endothelial cells <END> was shown : protein tyrosine phosphorylation , up-regulation of phosphorylated <START:ggp> p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation/translocation occurred within 10-15 min . 
Increased <START:ana> mRNA <END> and surface expression of <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> , <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> were noted within hours . 
Thus , C. pneumoniae triggers a cascade of events that could lead to endothelial activation , inflammation , and thrombosis , which in turn may result in or may promote atherosclerosis . 
Transient pseudo-hypoaldosteronism following resection of the ileum : normal level of <START:ggp> lymphocytic aldosterone receptors <END> outside the acute phase . 
Pseudo-hypoaldosteronism ( PHA ) is due to mineralocorticoid resistance and manifests as hyponatremia and hyperkalemia with increased plasma aldosterone levels . 
It may be familial or secondary to abnormal renal sodium handling . 
We report the case of a 54-year-old woman with multifocal cancer of the colon , who developed PHA after subtotal colectomy , ileal resection and jejunostomy . 
She was treated with 6 g of salt daily to prevent dehydration , which she stopped herself because of reduced fecal losses . 
One month later she was admitted with signs of acute adrenal failure , i.e. fatigue , severe nausea , blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg , extracellular dehydration , hyponatremia ( 118 mmol/l ) ; hyperkalemia ( 7.6 mmol/l ) , increased blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) ( 200 mg/dl ) and creatininemia ( 2.5 mg/dl ) , and decreased plasma bicarbonates level ( HCO3- : 16 mmol/l ; N : 27-30 ) . 
However , the plasma cortisol was high ( 66 microg/100 ml at 10 : 00 h ; N : 8-15 ) and the ACTH was normal ( 13 pg/ml , N : 10-60 ) ; there was a marked increase in plasma renin activity ( > 37 ng/ml/h ; N supine < 3 ) , active renin ( 869 pg/ml ; N supine : 1.120 ) , aldosterone ( > 2000 pg/ml ; N supine < 150 ) and plasma AVP ( 20 pmol/l ; N : 0.5-2.5 ) . 
The plasma ANH level was 38 pmol/l ( N supine : 5-25 ) . 
A urinary steroidogram resulted in highly elevated tetrahydrocortisol ( THF : 13.3 mg/24h ; N : 1.4+/-0.8 ) with no increase in tetrahydrocortisone ( THE : 3.16 mg/24h ; N : 2.7+/-2.0 ) excretion , and with low THE/THF ( 0.24 ; N : 1.87+/-0.36 ) and alpha THF/THF ( 0.35 ; N : 0.92+/-0.42 ) ratios . 
The number of <START:ggp> mineralocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> was in the lower normal range for age , while the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> was reduced . 
Small-bowel resection in ileostomized patients causes excessive fecal sodium losses and results in chronic sodium depletion with contraction of the plasma volume and severe secondary hyperaldosteronism . 
Nevertheless , this hyperaldosteronism may be associated with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia suggesting PHA related to the major importance of the colon for the absorption of sodium . 
In conclusion , this case report emphasizes 1 ) the possibility of a syndrome of acquired PHA with severe hyperkalemia after resection of the ileum and colon responding to oral salt supplementation ; 2 ) the major increase in AVP and the small increase in ANH ; 3 ) the strong increase in urinary THF with low THE/THF and alpha THF/THF ratios ; 4 ) the normal number of <START:ggp> lymphocytic mineralocorticoid receptors <END> outside the acute episode . 
Modulation of the immune response by <START:ggp> progesterone-induced lymphocyte factors <END> . 
Rat spleen and <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> express <START:ggp> progesterone receptors <END> whose concentration is increased greatly during the early phase of pregnancy . 
After stimulation of progesterone the expression of receptors was augmented 2-3 times . 
When cells were cultured in the presence of progesterone they released a <START:ggp> soluble factor <END> that inhibited cellular immunoreactions ( MLR , CRC ) and cellular proliferation as measured by thymidine incorporation by <START:ana> spleen-cell culture <END> . 
This factor also inhibited the synthesis of <START:ggp> anti-DNP antibodies <END> by a <START:ana> mouse hybridoma <END> and diminished the proportion of cells in phase S . 
However , the percentage of <START:ggp> asymmetric molecules <END> produced by the <START:ana> hybridoma <END> remained unaltered . 
These results support the hypothesis that <START:ggp> soluble factors <END> released by <START:ana> rat lymphocytes <END> modulate the immune response of the mother and participate in the mechanism that protects the fetus against <START:ggp> antipaternal antibodies <END> . 
Differential regulation of <START:ggp> 4E-BP1 <END> and <START:ggp> 4E-BP2 <END> , two repressors of translation initiation , during <START:ana> human myeloid cell <END> differentiation . 
Human myeloid differentiation is accompanied by a decrease in cell proliferation . 
Because the translation rate is an important determinant of cell proliferation , we have investigated translation initiation during <START:ana> human myeloid cell <END> differentiation using the <START:ana> HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line <END> and the <START:ana> U-937 monoblastic cell line <END> . 
A decrease in the translation rate is observed when the cells are induced to differentiate along the monocytic/macrophage pathway or along the granulocytic pathway . 
The inhibition in protein synthesis correlates with specific regulation of two repressors of translation initiation , <START:ggp> 4E-BP1 <END> and <START:ggp> 4E-BP2 <END> . 
Induction of <START:ana> HL-60 <END> and <START:ana> U-937 <END> cell differentiation into <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> or PMA results in a dephosphorylation and consequent activation of <START:ggp> 4E-BP1 <END> . 
Dephosphorylation of <START:ggp> 4E-BP1 <END> was also observed when <START:ana> U-937 cells <END> were induced to differentiate into <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> following treatment with retinoic acid or DMSO . 
In contrast , treatment of <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> with retinoic acid or DMSO , which results in a granulocytic differentiation of these cells , decreases <START:ggp> 4E-BP1 <END> amount without affecting its phosphorylation and strongly increases <START:ggp> 4E-BP2 <END> amount . 
Taken together , these data provide evidence for differential regulation of the translational machinery during human myeloid differentiation , specific to the monocytic/macrophage pathway or to the granulocytic pathway . 
Nonimmunoglobulin gene hypermutation in <START:ana> germinal center B cells <END> . 
Somatic hypermutation is the most critical mechanism underlying the diversification of <START:ggp> Ig genes <END> . 
Although mutation occurs specifically in <START:ana> B cells <END> during the germinal center reaction , it remains a matter of debate whether the mutation machinery also targets <START:ggp> non-Ig genes <END> . 
We have studied mutations in the <START:ggp> 5 ' noncoding region <END> of the <START:ggp> Bcl6 gene <END> in different subtypes of lymphomas . 
We found frequent hypermutation in follicular lymphoma ( 25 of 59 = 42 % ) ( germinal center cell origin ) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma ( 19 of 45 = 42 % ) ( postgerminal center ) , but only occasionally in mantle cell lymphoma ( 1 of 21 = 4.8 % ) ( pregerminal center ) . 
Most mutations were outside the motifs potentially important for transcription , suggesting they were not important in lymphomagenesis but may , like Ig mutation , represent an inherent feature of the <START:ana> lymphoma precursor cells <END> . 
Therefore , we investigated their normal cell counterparts microdissected from a reactive tonsil . 
Bcl6 mutation was found in 13 of 24 ( 54 % ) clones from the germinal centre but only in 1 of 24 ( 4 % ) clones from the <START:ana> naive B cells <END> of the mantle zone . 
The frequency , distribution , and nature of these mutations were similar to those resulting from the Ig hypermutation process . 
The results show unequivocal evidence of non- <START:ggp> Ig gene <END> hypermutation in <START:ana> germinal center B cells <END> and provide fresh insights into the process of hypermutation and lymphomagenesis . 
Impaired binding of a <START:ggp> DQ2 <END> and <START:ggp> DQ8 <END> -binding HSV VP16 peptide to a <START:ggp> DQA1*0501/DQB1*0302 trans class II heterodimer <END> . 
<START:ggp> DQalpha and DQbeta trans heterodimeric HLA-DQ molecules <END> form in individuals heterozygous for the <START:ggp> DQ2 <END> and <START:ggp> DQ8 <END> specificities . 
Unique functions and disease associations have been postulated for such <START:ggp> trans-dimers <END> , which may be different from <START:ggp> cis-encoded DQ molecules <END> encoded by the corresponding haplotypes . 
We analyzed the ability of the trans-dimer encoded by <START:ggp> HLA-DQA1*0501/DQB1*0302 <END> to bind a peptide antigen which interacts with <START:ggp> DQ molecules <END> encoded by both parental haplotypes . 
Markedly impaired binding was observed , consistent with both the use of different anchor residues and with changes in levels of DQ cis- <START:ggp> dimer <END> availability for peptide binding interactions . 
Detection of <START:ggp> intracellular phosphorylated STAT-1 <END> by flow cytometry . 
We have applied flow cytometry to the investigation of <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> activation of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
This approach uses <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> that distinguish between the native and phosphorylated forms of <START:ggp> STAT-1 <END> . 
It enables rapid and quantitative assessment of <START:ggp> STAT-1 <END> phosphorylation on a discrete cell basis and is both more sensitive and less time consuming than immunoblotting . 
Furthermore , it allows for discrimination between a mixture of cells that differ in their response to <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> . 
This approach should allow for the evaluation of different intracellular signaling pathways using a combination of monoclonal reagents that are specific for native and <START:ggp> activation modified proteins <END> . 
Application of this form of testing should prove valuable in screening for signaling defects in selected patients with recurrent infections . 
In addition , this technique should permit dissection of a full range of cellular signaling pathways at the protein level . 
Activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> by lipopolysaccharide in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> is prevented by inhibitors of <START:ggp> cytosolic phospholipase A2 <END> . 
In <START:ana> monocytes <END> , lipopolysaccharide induces synthesis and activity of the 85-kDa <START:ggp> cytosolic phospholipase A2 <END> . 
This enzyme releases arachidonic acid and lyso-phospholipids from membranes which are metabolized to eicosanoids and platelet-activating-factor . 
These lipid mediators increase activity of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> and expression of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> indicating a function for <START:ggp> cytosolic phospholipase A2 <END> in signal transduction and inflammation . 
We have shown previously that trifluoromethylketone inhibitors of <START:ggp> cytosolic phospholipase A2 <END> suppressed interleukin-1beta protein and steady-state mRNA levels in human <START:ana> lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes <END> . 
In this study , the subcellular mechanisms were analyzed by which trifluoromethylketones interfere with gene expression . 
We found that they reduced the initial <START:ana> interleukin-1beta mRNA <END> transcription rate through prevention of degradation of <START:ggp> inhibitor-kappaB alpha <END> . 
Consequently , cytosolic activation , nuclear translocation and DNA-binding of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> were decreased . 
Trifluoromethylketones ameliorate chronic inflammation in vivo . 
Thus , this therapeutic potency may reside in retention of inactive <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> in the <START:ana> cytosol <END> thereby abrogating <START:ggp> interleukin-1beta <END> gene transcription . 
Cellular disposition of sulphamethoxazole and its metabolites : implications for hypersensitivity . 
1. Bioactivation of sulphamethoxazole ( SMX ) to chemically-reactive metabolites and subsequent protein conjugation is thought to be involved in SMX hypersensitivity . 
We have therefore examined the cellular metabolism , disposition and conjugation of SMX and its metabolites in vitro . 
2. Flow cytometry revealed binding of N-hydroxy ( SMX-NHOH ) and nitroso ( SMX-NO ) metabolites of SMX , but not of SMX itself , to the surface of viable <START:ana> white blood cells <END> . 
Cellular haptenation by SMX-NO was reduced by exogenous glutathione ( GSH ) . 
3. SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO were rapidly reduced back to the parent compound by cysteine ( CYS ) , GSH , <START:ana> human peripheral blood cells <END> and plasma , suggesting that this is an important and <START:ggp> ubiquitous <END> bioinactivation mechanism . 
4. Fluorescence HPLC showed that SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO depleted CYS and GSH in buffer , and to a lesser extent , in cells and plasma . 
5. Neutrophil apoptosis and inhibition of neutrophil function were induced at lower concentrations of SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO than those inducing loss of membrane viability , with SMX having no effect . 
<START:ana> Lymphocytes <END> were significantly ( P < 0.05 ) more sensitive to the direct cytotoxic effects of SMX-NO than <START:ana> neutrophils <END> . 
6. Partitioning of SMX-NHOH into <START:ana> red blood cells <END> was significantly ( P < 0.05 ) lower than with the hydroxylamine of dapsone . 
7. Our results suggest that the balance between oxidation of SMX to its toxic metabolites and their reduction is an important protective cellular mechanism . 
If an imbalance exists , haptenation of the toxic metabolites to bodily proteins including the surface of viable cells can occur , and may result in drug hypersensitivity . 
<START:ggp> Bcl-6 <END> expression in reactive follicular hyperplasia , follicular lymphoma , and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma with hyperplastic germinal centers : heterogeneity of <START:ana> intrafollicular T-cells <END> and their altered distribution in the pathogenesis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma . 
BACKGROUND : The <START:ggp> Bcl-6 gene product <END> , a <START:ggp> nuclear phosphoprotein <END> , is expressed independently of <START:ggp> Bcl-6 <END> gene rearrangement . 
In lymph nodes , expression of <START:ggp> Bcl-6 <END> protein is restricted to <START:ana> germinal center ( GC ) B-cells <END> and 10 % to 15 % of <START:ana> CD3/CD4+ intrafollicular T cells <END> . 
Interfollicular cells are negative for <START:ggp> Bcl-6 protein <END> , except for rare <START:ana> CD3+/CD4+ T cells <END> . 
Recently , we reported cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ( AITL ) with hyperplastic GCs ( AITL/GC ) , and observed that borders of enlarged GCs were ill defined , with features suggestive of an outward migration of <START:ana> GC cells <END> to surrounding interfollicular zones . 
This prompted a study of follicular borders with <START:ggp> Bcl-6 <END> staining in reactive follicular hyperplasias and follicular lymphomas to compare with AITL/GC . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Formalin-fixed paraffin sections were used for immunostaining of <START:ggp> Bcl-6 <END> . 
Six cases of AITL/GC , 12 nonspecific reactive follicular hyperplasia ( FH ) , 7 HIV adenopathy , 10 follicular lymphoma ( FL ) , and 8 typical AITL ( ie , AITL without GC ) were studied . 
Double staining for <START:ggp> Bcl-6/CD20 <END> , <START:ggp> Bcl-6/CD3 <END> , and <START:ggp> Bcl-6/CD57 <END> was performed in selected cases . 
RESULTS : In FH and HIV adenopathy , staining for <START:ggp> Bcl-6 <END> revealed densely populated GCs with well-defined and regular GC borders , whereas <START:ana> Bcl-6+ cells <END> were rare in the interfollicular areas . 
An occasional GC with an ill-defined border was invariably surrounded by a broad mantle zone ; those with indistinct mantle zones had well-defined , regular borders . 
In FL , follicles were densely populated , and their borders were irregular , with some <START:ana> Bcl-6+ cells <END> in the interfollicular zones . 
In AITL/GC , GCs were less dense , GC borders were ill defined and irregular , and the number of <START:ana> interfollicular Bcl-6+ cells <END> was markedly increased . 
Double staining revealed that these <START:ana> interfollicular Bcl-6+ cells <END> in AITL/GC were <START:ana> Bcl6+/CD3+/CD20-/CD57- T cells <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ana> CD3+ intrafollicular T cells <END> were depleted in AITL/GC , whereas they were abundant in FH . 
Intrafollicular <START:ana> CD57+ cells <END> did not stain for <START:ggp> Bcl-6 <END> , and were also depleted in AITL/GC . 
In typical AITL , some neoplastic cells were positive for <START:ggp> Bcl-6 <END> , showing variable degrees of staining . 
CONCLUSIONS : ( 1 ) GCs of AITL/GC differed from those of other reactive follicular hyperplasias and follicular lymphomas , and staining for <START:ggp> Bcl-6 <END> was useful to discern them . 
( 2 ) <START:ana> Intrafollicular CD3+ T cells <END> , many of which were also positive for <START:ggp> Bcl-6 <END> , were markedly depleted in AITL/GC , with increased interfollicular <START:ana> Bcl-6+/CD3+ cells <END> , suggesting an outward migration of <START:ana> intrafollicular T cells <END> in this condition . 
( 3 ) <START:ana> Interfollicular Bcl-6+/CD3+ cells <END> in AITL/GC were too numerous to be accounted for by migration alone , suggesting local proliferation . 
( 4 ) <START:ana> Intrafollicular CD57+ cells <END> were negative for <START:ggp> Bcl-6 <END> , indicating heterogeneity of the <START:ana> intrafollicular T-cell population <END> . 
( 5 ) Some neoplastic cells in AITL stained for <START:ggp> Bcl-6 <END> , suggesting up-regulation of <START:ggp> Bcl-6 <END> expression in this tumor . 
Human cytomegalovirus binding to <START:ana> human monocytes <END> induces immunoregulatory gene expression . 
To continue our investigation of the cellular events that occur following human CMV ( HCMV ) infection , we focused on the regulation of cellular activation following viral binding to <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
First , we showed that viral binding induced a number of <START:ana> immunoregulatory genes <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> , <START:ggp> A20 <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-p105/p50 <END> , and <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> ) in unactivated <START:ana> monocytes <END> and that <START:ggp> neutralizing Abs <END> to the major <START:ggp> HCMV glycoproteins <END> , <START:ggp> gB <END> ( <START:ggp> UL55 <END> ) and <START:ggp> gH <END> ( <START:ggp> UL75 <END> ) , inhibited the induction of these genes . 
Next , we demonstrated that these viral ligands directly up-regulated monocyte gene expression upon their binding to their appropriate cellular receptors . 
We then investigated if HCMV binding also resulted in the translation and secretion of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
Our results showed that HCMV binding to <START:ana> monocytes <END> resulted in the production and release of <START:ggp> IL-1beta protein <END> . 
Because these induced gene products have <START:ggp> NF-kappaB sites <END> in their <START:ggp> promoter regions <END> , we next examined whether there was an up-regulation of nuclear <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> levels . 
These experiments showed that , in fact , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> was translocated to the nucleus following viral binding or purified viral ligand binding . 
Changes in <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> levels correlated with the changes in <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> translocation . 
Lastly , we demonstrated that <START:ggp> p38 <END> kinase activity played a central role in <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> production and that it was rapidly up-regulated following infection . 
These results support our hypothesis that HCMV initiates a signal transduction pathway that leads to monocyte activation and pinpoints a potential mechanism whereby HCMV infection of <START:ana> monocytes <END> can result in profound pathogenesis , especially in chronic inflammatory-type conditions . 
Regulation of the <START:ggp> megakaryocytic glycoprotein IX promoter <END> by the <START:ggp> oncogenic Ets transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Fli-1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Glycoprotein ( GP ) IX <END> is a subunit of the <START:ggp> von Willebrand receptor <END> , <START:ggp> GPIb-V-IX <END> , which mediates adhesion of <START:ana> platelets <END> to the subendothelium of damaged blood vessels . 
Previous characterization of the <START:ggp> GPIX promoter <END> identified a functional Ets site that , when disrupted , reduced promoter activity . 
However , the <START:ggp> Ets protein <END> ( s ) that regulated <START:ggp> GPIX promoter <END> expression was unknown . 
In this study , transient cotransfection of several <START:ggp> GPIX promoter/reporter constructs <END> into <START:ana> 293T kidney fibroblasts <END> with a <START:ggp> Fli-1 expression vector <END> shows that the oncogenic protein <START:ggp> Fli-1 <END> can transactivate the <START:ggp> GPIX promoter <END> when an intact <START:ggp> GPIX Ets site <END> is present . 
In addition , <START:ggp> Fli-1 <END> binding of the <START:ggp> GPIX Ets site <END> was identified in antibody supershift experiments in nuclear extracts derived from <START:ana> hematopoietic human erythroleukemia cells <END> . 
Comparative studies showed that <START:ggp> Fli-1 <END> was also able to transactivate the <START:ggp> GPIbalpha <END> and , to a lesser extent , the <START:ggp> GPIIb promoter <END> . 
Immunoblot analysis identified <START:ggp> Fli-1 protein <END> in lysates derived from <START:ana> platelets <END> . 
In addition , expression of <START:ggp> Fli-1 <END> was identified immunohistochemically in <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> derived from <START:ana> CD34 ( + ) cells <END> treated with the <START:ggp> megakaryocyte differentiation and proliferation factor <END> , <START:ggp> thrombopoietin <END> . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> Fli-1 <END> is likely to regulate <START:ggp> lineage-specific genes <END> during megakaryocytopoiesis . 
Expression of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> in the nucleus of <START:ana> human peripheral blood T lymphocytes <END> . 
According to current models the inhibitory capacity of <START:ggp> I ( kappa ) B ( alpha ) <END> would be mediated through the retention of <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappaB proteins <END> in the <START:ana> cytosol <END> . 
However , <START:ggp> I ( kappa ) B ( alpha ) <END> has also been detected in the nucleus of cell lines and when overexpressed by transient transfection . 
To gain better insight into the potential role of <START:ggp> nuclear I ( kappa ) B ( alpha ) <END> in a physiological context we have analysed its presence in the nucleus of <START:ana> human peripheral blood T lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBL <END> ) . 
We demonstrate the nuclear localization of <START:ggp> I ( kappa ) B ( alpha ) <END> in <START:ana> PBL <END> by different techniques : Western blot , indirect immunofluorescence and electron microscopy . 
Low levels of nuclear <START:ggp> I ( kappa ) B ( alpha ) <END> were detected in resting cells whereas a superinduction was obtained after PMA activation . 
The nuclear pool of <START:ggp> I ( kappa ) B ( alpha ) <END> showed a higher stability than cytosolic <START:ggp> I ( kappa ) B ( alpha ) <END> and was partially independent of the resynthesis of the protein . 
Unexpectedly , the presence of <START:ggp> nuclear I ( kappa ) B ( alpha ) <END> did not inhibit <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding to DNA and this phenomenon was not due to the presence of <START:ggp> IkappaBbeta <END> at the nuclear level . 
Immunoprecipitation experiments failed to demonstrate an association between nuclear <START:ggp> I ( kappa ) B ( alpha ) <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> proteins . 
Our results demonstrate that in resting and <START:ana> PMA-activated human PBL <END> , <START:ggp> I ( kappa ) B ( alpha ) <END> is present in the nucleus in an apparently inactive form unable to disrupt <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding from DNA . 
Impaired <START:ana> fetal thymocyte <END> development after efficient adenovirus-mediated inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
We introduce a new experimental system combining adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) . 
This system allowed us to efficiently express in developing thymocytes a mutant form of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> inhibitor <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> mut-I kappa B <END> ) and to study the maturation defects occurring when <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation is inhibited during fetal development . 
<START:ana> Fetal thymocytes <END> infected with adenovirus containing <START:ggp> mut-I kappa B <END> were found to develop normally until the <START:ggp> CD44 <END> -CD25+ , <START:ggp> CD4 <END> - <START:ggp> CD8 <END> - double-negative stage , while production of more mature double-positive and single-positive populations was strongly decreased . 
Proliferation , as measured by the percentage of cells in cycle appeared normal , as did rearrangement and expression of the <START:ggp> TCR beta-chain <END> . 
However , apoptosis was much higher in FTOC infected with adenovirus containing <START:ggp> mut-I kappa B <END> than in FTOC infected with a control virus . 
Taken together , these results suggest that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> plays a crucial role in ensuring the differentiation and survival of <START:ana> thymocytes <END> in the early stages of their development . 
The relationship between <START:ggp> Ca2+-ATPase <END> and freely exchangeable Ca2+ in the dense tubules : a study in <START:ana> platelets <END> from women . 
The main aims of this work were to examine in women : the relationship between the freely exchangeable Ca2+ ( FECa2+ ) in the dense tubules and the activity of the <START:ggp> sarco ( endo ) plasmic reticulum ( SER ) Ca2+-ATPase ( SERCA ) <END> in <START:ana> platelets <END> , and the relationship of these parameters with blood pressure and <START:ggp> serum lipoproteins <END> . 
Platelets from 14 white and 13 black women in good health were studied . 
The FECa2+ was measured as the ionomycin-evoked Ca2+ release ( in the presence of thapsigargin ) in Ca2+-free medium . 
<START:ggp> SERCA <END> activity was measured as the thapsigargin sensitive , Ca2+ dependent and ouabain resistant , ATP hydrolyses in platelet membranes . 
Relative expressions of <START:ggp> SERCA <END> 2 and 3 isoforms and <START:ggp> Ras-related protein ( Rap ) 1 <END> in platelet membranes were determined by Western immunoblots . 
Highly significant correlations were observed for FECa2+ in the dense tubules with : 1 ) the maximal reaction velocity ( Vmax ) of the <START:ggp> SERCA <END> ( r = 0.592 , P = .0014 ) , and 2 ) <START:ggp> Rapl <END> ( r = 0.551 , P = .0035 ) . 
In addition , negative correlations were observed between FECa2+ in the dense tubules and age . 
No correlations were observed for these variables with blood pressure or <START:ggp> serum lipoproteins <END> . 
We conclude the FECa2+ and the Vmax of the <START:ggp> SERCA <END> are reliable indicators of Ca2+ load in <START:ana> platelets <END> from women . 
However , in women , unlike previous observations in men , these platelet parameters are not correlated with blood pressure and <START:ggp> serum lipoproteins <END> . 
Cobalt chloride-induced signaling in endothelium leading to the augmented adherence of <START:ana> sickle red blood cells <END> and transendothelial migration of <START:ana> monocyte-like HL-60 cells <END> is blocked by PAF-receptor antagonist . 
In response to hypoxia , <START:ana> sickle red blood cells <END> ( <START:ana> SS RBC <END> ) and <START:ana> leukocytes <END> exhibit increased adherence to the vascular endothelium , while diapedesis of <START:ana> leukocytes <END> through the blood vessel increases . 
However , the cellular signaling pathway ( s ) caused by hypoxia is poorly understood . 
We utilized CoCl2 as a mimetic molecule for hypoxia to study cellular signaling pathways . 
We found that in <START:ana> human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> HUVEC <END> ) , CoCl2 at 2 mM concentration induced the surface expression of a subset of <START:ggp> CAMs <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) and activation of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in the nuclear extracts of <START:ana> HUVEC <END> . 
Furthermore , CoCl2 also caused time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase <END> isoform <START:ggp> ERK2 <END> without significantly affecting <START:ggp> ERK1 <END> , indicating <START:ggp> ERK2 <END> is the preferred substrate for <START:ggp> upstream kinase <END> of the <START:ggp> MAPK <END> pathway . 
Inhibitors of <START:ggp> MAP kinase <END> ( PD98059 ) or platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) - receptor antagonist ( CV3988 ) inhibited the CoCl2-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression . 
Augmented expression of <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> led to increased <START:ana> SS RBC <END> adhesion , inhibitable by a <START:ggp> VCAM-1 antibody <END> . 
Additionally , CoCl2 caused a two- to threefold increase in the rate of transendothelial migration of <START:ana> monocyte-like HL-60 cells <END> and a twentyfold increase in phosphorylation of <START:ggp> platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecules <END> ( <START:ggp> PECAM-1 <END> ) . 
The transendothelial migration of <START:ana> monocytes <END> was inhibited by an antibody to <START:ggp> PECAM-1 <END> . 
Both phosphorylation of <START:ggp> PECAM-1 <END> and transendothelial migration of <START:ana> monocytes <END> in response to CoCl2 were inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor ( GF109203X ) and augmented by protein phosphatase inhibitor ( Calyculin A ) . 
Our data suggests that CoCl2-induced cellular signals directing increased expression of <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> in <START:ana> HUVEC <END> involve downstream activation of <START:ggp> MAP kinase <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , while the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> PECAM-1 <END> occurs as a result of activation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> . 
We conclude that PAF-receptor antagonist inhibits the CoCl2 -or hypoxia-induced increase in the adhesion of <START:ana> SS RBC <END> , <START:ggp> PECAM-1 <END> phosphorylation , and the concomitant transendothelial migration of <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Bacterial lipopolysaccharide activates <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> through <START:ggp> interleukin-1 signaling mediators <END> in <START:ana> cultured human dermal endothelial cells <END> and <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> . 
Bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -mediated immune responses , including activation of <START:ana> monocytes <END> , <START:ana> macrophages <END> , and <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> , play an important role in the pathogenesis of Gram-negative bacteria-induced sepsis syndrome . 
Activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> is thought to be required for cytokine release from <START:ana> LPS-responsive cells <END> , a critical step for endotoxic effects . 
Here we investigated the role and involvement of <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) <START:ggp> signal transducer molecules <END> in LPS signaling in <START:ana> human dermal microvessel endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> HDMEC <END> ) and <START:ana> THP-1 monocytic cells <END> . 
LPS stimulation of <START:ana> HDMEC <END> and <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> initiated an <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor <END> -like <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> signaling cascade . 
In transient cotransfection experiments , dominant negative mutants of the <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> signaling pathway , including <START:ggp> MyD88 <END> , <START:ggp> IRAK <END> , <START:ggp> IRAK2 <END> , and <START:ggp> TRAF6 <END> inhibited both <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -and LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> <START:ggp> -luciferase <END> activity . 
LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation was not inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> that is involved in <START:ggp> TNF <END> signaling . 
LPS-induced activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-responsive reporter gene <END> was not inhibited by <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> receptor antagonist . 
<START:ggp> TLR2 <END> and <START:ggp> TLR4 <END> were expressed on the cell surface of <START:ana> HDMEC <END> and <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> . 
These findings suggest that a <START:ggp> signal transduction molecule <END> in the LPS receptor complex may belong to the <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> receptor/toll-like receptor ( TLR ) super family , and the LPS signaling cascade uses an analogous molecular framework for signaling as <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> in <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> and <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> . 
Signal transduction through <START:ggp> interferon-gamma receptor <END> on <START:ana> human eosinophils <END> . 
BACKGROUND : We reported on the constitutive <START:ggp> interferon-gamma receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gammaR <END> ) expression on <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
But signal transduction through <START:ggp> IFN-gammaR <END> on <START:ana> eosinophils <END> remains to be elucidated . 
In this study , we examined the involvement of the <START:ggp> Jak/Stat <END> pathway in the signaling of <START:ana> eosinophils <END> after <START:ggp> IFN-gammaR <END> conjugation by the ligand binding . 
METHODS : <START:ana> Purified peripheral eosinophils <END> were stimulated with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> at 37 degrees C for 1-60 min . 
Tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> IFN-gammaR <END> , <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> , <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> , and <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> was examined by immunoblotting . 
Gel-shift assay was also examined to show the formation of <START:ggp> Stat1alpha-DNA complexes <END> . 
RESULTS : We show that binding of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> to <START:ana> human eosinophils <END> initiated a series of events that resulted in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of not only the <START:ggp> IFN-gammaRalpha chain <END> but also <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> , <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> , and <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> enhanced the DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> . 
CONCLUSION : These data indicate that <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> affects <START:ana> eosinophils <END> through its specific receptor and utilizes the <START:ggp> Jak/Stat <END> pathway as its mode of signaling . 
Expression of <START:ggp> E2A-HLF chimeric protein <END> induced T-cell apoptosis , B-cell maturation arrest , and development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia . 
The <START:ggp> E2A-HLF fusion gene <END> , generated by <START:ggp> t ( 17 ; 19 ) ( q22 ; p13 ) <END> in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , encodes a <START:ggp> chimeric transcription factor <END> in which the <START:ggp> trans-activating domains <END> of <START:ggp> E2A <END> are fused to the <START:ggp> DNA- binding and dimerization domains <END> of <START:ggp> hepatic leukemic factor <END> ( <START:ggp> HLF <END> ) . 
To investigate its biological role , we generated transgenic mice expressing <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> using <START:ggp> Ig enhancer and promoter <END> , which direct transgene expression in cells committed to the lymphoid lineage . 
The transgenic mice exhibited abnormal development in the thymus and spleen and were susceptible to infection . 
The thymus contained small numbers of <START:ana> thymocytes <END> , and TUNEL staining showed that higher population of <START:ana> thymocytes <END> were undergoing apoptosis . 
The spleen exhibited a marked reduction in <START:ana> splenic lymphocytes <END> and the flow cytometric analyses and the in vitro colony formation assays showed that the B-cell maturation was blocked at a very early developmental stage . 
These findings indicated that the expression of <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> induced T-cell apoptosis and B-cell maturation arrest in vivo and that the susceptibility of the transgenic mice to infection was due to immunodeficiency . 
Moreover , several transgenic mice developed acute leukemia , classified as T-ALL based on the surface marker analysis and DNA rearrangements , suggesting that an additional event is required for malignant transformation of <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> expressing <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> . 
Our findings provide insight into the biological function of <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> in lymphoid development and also its role in leukemogenesis . 
<START:ggp> Retinoid X receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> RXR <END> ) agonist-induced activation of dominant-negative <START:ggp> RXR <END> -retinoic acid receptor alpha403 heterodimers is developmentally regulated during myeloid differentiation . 
The multiple biologic activities of retinoic acid ( RA ) are mediated through <START:ggp> RAR <END> and <START:ggp> retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) nuclear receptors <END> that interact with specific <START:ggp> DNA target sequences <END> as <START:ggp> heterodimers <END> ( <START:ggp> RXR-RAR <END> ) or <START:ggp> homodimers <END> ( <START:ggp> RXR-RXR <END> ) . 
RA receptor activation appears critical to regulating important aspects of hematopoiesis , since transducing a <START:ggp> COOH-terminally truncated RARalpha <END> exhibiting dominant-negative activity ( <START:ggp> RARalpha403 <END> ) into normal mouse bone marrow generates <START:ana> hematopoietic growth factor-dependent cell lines <END> frozen at the multipotent progenitor ( EML ) or committed promyelocyte ( MPRO ) stages . 
Nevertheless , relatively high , pharmacological concentrations of RA ( 1 to 10 & mgr ; M ) overcome these differentiation blocks and induce terminal granulocytic differentiation of the <START:ana> MPRO promyelocytes <END> while potentiating <START:ggp> interleukin-3 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> ) -induced commitment of <START:ana> EML cells <END> to the granulocyte/monocyte lineage . 
In the present study , we utilized <START:ggp> RXR <END> -and <START:ggp> RAR <END> -specific agonists and antagonists to determine how RA overcomes the dominant-negative activity of the <START:ggp> truncated RARalpha <END> in these different myeloid developmental stages . 
Unexpectedly , we observed that an <START:ggp> RXR <END> -specific , rather than an <START:ggp> RAR <END> -specific , agonist induces terminal granulocytic differentiation of <START:ana> MPRO promyelocytes <END> , and this differentiation is associated with activation of <START:ggp> DNA response elements <END> corresponding to <START:ggp> RAR-RXR heterodimers <END> rather than <START:ggp> RXR-RXR homodimers <END> . 
This <START:ggp> RXR <END> agonist activity is blocked by <START:ggp> RAR <END> -specific antagonists , suggesting extensive cross-talk between the partners of the <START:ggp> RXR -RARalpha403 heterodimer <END> . 
In contrast , in the more immature , multipotent <START:ana> EML cells <END> we observed that this <START:ggp> RXR <END> -specific agonist is inactive either in potentiating <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> -mediated commitment of <START:ana> EML cells <END> to the <START:ana> granulocyte lineage <END> or in transactivating <START:ggp> RAR-RXR response elements <END> . 
RA -triggered GALdbd- <START:ggp> RARalpha <END> hybrid activity in these cells indicates that the multipotent <START:ana> EML cells <END> harbor substantial nuclear hormone receptor <START:ggp> coactivator <END> activity . 
However , the <START:ggp> histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor <END> trichostatin A readily activates an <START:ggp> RXR-RAR reporter construct <END> in the multipotent <START:ana> EML cells <END> but not in the committed <START:ana> MPRO promyelocytes <END> , indicating that differences in <START:ggp> HDAC-containing repressor complexes <END> in these two closely related but distinct <START:ana> hematopoietic lineages <END> might account for the differential activation of the <START:ggp> RXR-RARalpha403 heterodimers <END> that we observed at these different stages of myeloid development . 
The functional synergy between <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> involves <START:ggp> p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> and is associated with the augmentation of STAT serine phosphorylation . 
<START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> can stimulate <START:ana> mitogen- or CD3-activated T cells <END> to proliferate , produce <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , and kill <START:ana> tumor cells <END> . 
The magnitude of these functional responses is greatly augmented when <START:ana> T cells <END> are activated by the combination of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
Although peripheral blood <START:ana> T cells <END> are largely unresponsive to these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> without prior activation , a small subset of <START:ana> CD8+ T cells <END> ( <START:ana> CD8+CD18bright <END> ) is strongly activated by the combination of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
In this report we show that the functional synergy between <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in <START:ana> CD8+CD18bright T cells <END> correlates with the activation of the <START:ggp> stress kinases <END> , <START:ggp> p38 mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase <END> and <START:ggp> stress-activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) /Jun N-terminal kinase <END> , but not with the activation of the <START:ggp> extracellular signal-regulated kinases <END> . 
The functional synergy between <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> is also associated with a prominent increase in <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> serine phosphorylation over that observed with <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> alone . 
By contrast , <START:ggp> STAT <END> tyrosine phosphorylation is not augmented over that seen with either cytokine alone . 
A specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase completely inhibits the serine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> induced by <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and abrogates the functional synergy between <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> without affecting STAT tyrosine phosphorylation . 
This suggests that p38 MAP kinase may play an important role in regulating STAT serine phosphorylation in response to the combination of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
Furthermore , these findings indicate that the optimal activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> by <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> may depend on an interaction between the <START:ggp> p38 MAP kinase <END> and <START:ggp> Janus kinase/STAT <END> signaling pathways . 
Activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in Mycobacterium tuberculosis -induced <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor <END> expression in <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> . 
Soluble <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha <END> ) has been reported to be increased in the sera of patients with advanced tuberculosis , and levels decline after therapy in accordance with improvement of radiologic findings . 
We investigated expression of the <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha <END> in <START:ana> bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) cells <END> in active pulmonary tuberculosis , and evaluated the mechanism Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces in the <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha <END> using the <START:ana> THP-1 mononuclear phagocyte cell line <END> . 
We found <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha <END> expression to be increased in BAL cells from involved sites of active pulmonary tuberculosis . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> alpha-chain <END> of <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha <END> on <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBM <END> ) was induced by M. tuberculosis by flow cytometry evaluation . 
Northern analysis demonstrated increased <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha <END> gene expression after stimulation with M. tuberculosis which was further induced by <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) . 
The <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha promoter <END> containing the <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) site <END> was transcriptionally induced by M. tuberculosis and this <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> site could confer inducibility to a <START:ggp> heterologous herpes thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter <END> by M. tuberculosis . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) revealed specific binding of nuclear protein to the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB site <END> upon induction with M. tuberculosis . 
Using antibodies against the <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 subunits <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in EMSAs , the involvement of both <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 proteins <END> was further demonstrated . 
Functional expression of the <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha <END> on <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> in M. tuberculosis infection may play an important immunomodulatory role in the host response . 
<START:ggp> Vitamin D receptor <END> <START:ggp> 3'-untranslated region <END> polymorphisms : lack of effect on mRNA stability . 
Allelic variation at the 3'-end of the <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) gene <END> has been associated with a 3-5-fold increased risk of developing prostate cancer and with differences in bone mineralization . 
This genetic diversity does not alter the <START:ggp> VDR protein <END> structurally , but instead may be a marker ( s ) of other , nearby polymorphisms that influence message stability or translation . 
The work reported here was instigated to identify additional <START:ggp> VDR <END> <START:ggp> 3'-UTR <END> polymorphisms that may have functional significance and to then test whether these genetic variants alter message stability . 
Initially , four novel , frequently occurring <START:ggp> sequence variants <END> were identified that associated with two common haplotypes that were described previously . 
These common sequence variants were not found within three <START:ggp> message-destabilizing elements <END> that we mapped within the <START:ggp> 3'-UTR <END> of the <START:ana> vitamin D receptor mRNA <END> . 
Furthermore , the two <START:ggp> VDR 3'-UTR <END> haplotypes conferred an identical half-life on a <START:ggp> heterologous beta-globin reporter gene <END> , in an in vitro assay . 
We therefore conclude that common polymorphisms within the <START:ggp> VDR 3'-UTR <END> do not influence message stability . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -mediated cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis does not require <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> or activating protein-1 activation in primary human T cells . 
The <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> growth hormone is the major growth factor of activated <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> during a developing immune response . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> is required not only for cell cycle progression but also to protect <START:ana> Ag-activated T cells <END> from programmed cell death . 
In several cell types , activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and/or <START:ggp> activating protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) has been demonstrated to be extremely important in blocking apoptosis . 
To determine whether either or both of these <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are involved in cell survival or cell cycle progression in response to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ana> primary human T cells <END> responsive to the growth factor were analyzed for NF-kappa B and AP-1 activation . 
The current study clearly demonstrates that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> does not induce <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> alpha degradation or <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ana> primary human T cells <END> that respond to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> by entering the cell cycle and avoiding apoptosis . 
Similarly , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> neither activates <START:ggp> JNK <END> nor increases <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding activity to a consensus <START:ggp> o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) response element <END> . 
On the other hand , the <START:ggp> growth factor <END> does induce the activation of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> in these cells , as has been previously demonstrated . 
These data show that neither <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> nor <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activation is required for <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -mediated survival or cell cycle progression in activated <START:ana> primary human T cells <END> . 
Estrone potentiates myeloid cell differentiation : a role for <START:ggp> 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase <END> in modulating hemopoiesis . 
Hormones such as 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 ( D3 ) , all-trans retinoic acid , and 9-cis retinoic acid stimulate differentiation of <START:ana> myeloid progenitor cells <END> via their interaction with specific <START:ggp> hormone receptors <END> . 
However , the sensitivity of cells to these agents is not merely governed by the expression of their receptors and the availability of ligand to bind them . 
Recent studies from our group suggested that the actions of D3 and retinoids on myelopoiesis also are influenced by endogenous mechanisms involving other steroid hormones . 
In this study we examined the influence of local estrogen metabolism on the differentiation of <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> and normal primitive <START:ana> myeloid progenitor cells <END> . 
Quantitative thin-layer chromatography ( TLC ) analyses showed that <START:ana> HL60 <END> and <START:ana> normal cells <END> are able to generate estrone ( E1 ) from estradiol ( E2 ) . 
Neither cell population generated significant amounts of E2 from E1 . 
Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Northern analyses confirmed that normal and leukemic <START:ana> myeloid progenitor cells <END> expressed <START:ana> mRNA <END> for the type I and IV isoforms of <START:ggp> 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase <END> . 
Conversion of E2 to E1 was upregulated within 24 hours when <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> were treated with either all-trans retinoic acid or D3 at doses that induce their differentiation toward <START:ana> neutrophils <END> or <START:ana> monocytes <END> , respectively . 
Similarly , D3-induced monocyte differentiation of normal <START:ana> myeloid progenitor cells <END> was associated with increased capacity to generate E1 from E2 . 
When <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> or normal <START:ana> myeloid progenitor cells <END> were exposed to exogenous E1 they became more sensitive to the differentiation-inducing effects of D3 . 
Data presented provide further evidence for the local modulation of myelopoiesis by intracrine mechanisms . 
In particular , our findings suggest that local metabolism of steroids by normal as well as <START:ana> leukemic myeloid cells <END> influences their responsiveness to D3 and retinoids . 
Phosphorylation of <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> inhibits binding to the <START:ggp> CD40 cytoplasmic domain <END> . 
<START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> is a <START:ggp> signal transducing adaptor molecule <END> which binds to the <START:ggp> CD40 cytoplasmic domain <END> . 
We have found that it is phosphorylated , predominantly on serine residues , when transiently overexpressed in <START:ana> 293 cells <END> . 
The phosphorylation appears to be related to the signaling events that are activated by <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> under these circumstances , since two nonfunctional mutants were found to be phosphorylated significantly less than the <START:ggp> wild-type protein <END> . 
Furthermore , the phosphorylation status of <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> had significant effects on the ability of the protein to bind to <START:ggp> CD40 <END> , as evidenced by our observations that the <START:ggp> CD40 cytoplasmic domain <END> interacted preferentially with underphosphorylated <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> and that <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> treatment significantly enhanced the binding of <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> to <START:ggp> CD40 <END> . 
We conclude from these studies that the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> is likely to play an important role in regulating signaling by virtue of its ability to influence the <START:ggp> CD40 <END> <START:ggp> -TRAF2 <END> interaction .

A direct interaction between the <START:ggp> adaptor protein <END> <START:ggp> Cbl-b <END> and the <START:ggp> kinase <END> <START:ggp> zap-70 <END> induces a positive signal in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Engagement of the <START:ggp> T-cell receptor ( TCR ) -CD3 complex <END> induces a rapid increase in the activities of <START:ggp> Src-family <END> and <START:ggp> Syk/Zap-70-family kinases <END> [ 1 ] [ 2 ] . 
These <START:ggp> activated kinases <END> then induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> multiple intracellular proteins <END> , eventually leading to T-cell activation . 
One of the prominent substrates for these <START:ggp> kinases <END> is the <START:ggp> adaptor protein <END> Cbl [ 3 ] and recent studies suggest that <START:ggp> Cbl <END> negatively regulates <START:ggp> upstream kinases <END> such as <START:ggp> Syk <END> and <START:ggp> Zap-70 <END> [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . 
<START:ggp> Cbl-b <END> , a homologue of <START:ggp> Cbl <END> , is widely expressed in many tissues and cells including <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> [ 6 ] [ 7 ] . 
<START:ggp> Cbl-b <END> undergoes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation of the <START:ggp> TCR <END> and cytokine receptors [ 8 ] [ 9 ] . 
The role of <START:ggp> Cbl-b <END> is unclear , however . 
Here , we show that overexpression of <START:ggp> Cbl-b <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> induced the constitutive activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) . 
A loss-of-function mutation in <START:ggp> Cbl-b <END> disrupted the interaction between <START:ggp> Cbl-b <END> and <START:ggp> Zap-70 <END> and nearly completely abrogated the <START:ggp> Cbl-b <END> -mediated activation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
Unlike the proposed role of <START:ggp> Cbl <END> as a negative regulator , our results suggest that the <START:ggp> Cbl <END> homologue <START:ggp> Cbl-b <END> has a positive role in T-cell signaling , most likely via a direct interaction with the <START:ggp> upstream kinase <END> <START:ggp> Zap-70 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Grf40 <END> , A novel <START:ggp> Grb2 family member <END> , is involved in T cell signaling through interaction with <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> and <START:ggp> LAT <END> . 
We molecularly cloned a new <START:ggp> Grb2 family member <END> , named <START:ggp> Grf40 <END> , containing the common <START:ggp> SH3-SH2-SH3 motif <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> Grf40 <END> is predominant in <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> , particularly <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Grf40 <END> binds to the <START:ggp> SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein <END> of 76 kD ( <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> ) via its SH3 domain more tightly than <START:ggp> Grb2 <END> . 
Incidentally , <START:ggp> Grf40 <END> binds to <START:ggp> linker for activation of T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> LAT <END> ) possibly via its <START:ggp> SH2 domain <END> . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> wild-type Grf40 <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> induced a significant increase of <START:ggp> SLP-76-dependent interleukin ( IL ) -2 promoter <END> and <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cell <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) activation upon <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) stimulation , whereas the <START:ggp> COOH-terminal SH3-deleted Grf40 mutant <END> lacked any recognizable increase in <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activity . 
Furthermore , the <START:ggp> SH2-deleted Grf40 mutant <END> led to a marked inhibition of these regulatory activities , the effect of which is apparently stronger than that of the <START:ggp> SH2-deleted Grb2 mutant <END> . 
Our data suggest that <START:ggp> Grf40 <END> is an <START:ggp> adaptor molecule <END> involved in <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated signaling through a more efficient interaction than <START:ggp> Grb2 <END> with <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> and <START:ggp> LAT <END> . 
Modulation of the immune response and tumor growth by activated <START:ggp> Ras <END> . 
As a result of its transforming abilities , <START:ggp> activated Ras <END> is expressed in a great number of cancers . 
The ras mutation frequency varies between 95 % in pancreatic cancer and 5 % in breast cancer . 
In leukemia , the highest frequency ( 30 % ) is found in acute myeloid leukemia . 
The presence of ras mutations has been correlated with a poor prognosis and negative clinical outcome . 
This suggests that <START:ggp> mutated Ras <END> activates mechanisms , which favor tumor growth , enhance the metastatic capacity of tumors or modulate tumor-specific immune responses . 
Several new functions of <START:ggp> Ras <END> , such as downregulation of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex molecules <END> , upregulation of certain <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , <START:ggp> growth factors <END> and <START:ggp> degradative enzymes <END> have been uncovered in the last decade . 
Additionally , <START:ggp> mutated Ras <END> can also serve as a primary target for the development of immunotherapy or drug therapy . 
This review will discuss the mechanisms by which <START:ggp> Ras <END> expressing tumors are able to evade destruction by the immune system and enhance their growth and metastatic potential . 
It will further elaborate on the attempts to develop successful immunotherapy and drug therapy targeting <START:ggp> Ras <END> expressing tumors . 
Modulation of <START:ggp> E2F complexes <END> during G0 to S phase transition in <START:ana> human primary B-lymphocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> pocket protein-E2F complexes <END> are convergence points for cell cycle signaling . 
In the present report , we identified and monitored the <START:ggp> pocket protein-E2F complexes <END> in <START:ana> human primary B-lymphocytes <END> after activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate . 
Consistent with previous data from <START:ana> human and mouse fibroblasts <END> and <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> , <START:ggp> E2F4 <END> and <START:ggp> DP1 <END> form the predominant <START:ggp> E2F heterodimers <END> both in G0 and G1 phases of the human B-lymphocyte cell cycle , whereas <START:ggp> E2F1 and -3 <END> are first detected in late G1 , and their expression levels increase towards S phase . 
Intriguingly , the <START:ggp> major E2F complex <END> that we detected in <START:ana> quiescent human B-lymphocytes <END> is consisted of <START:ggp> pRB <END> , <START:ggp> E2F4 <END> , and <START:ggp> DP1 <END> . 
Though the levels of <START:ggp> DP1 and -2 <END> increase when cells progress from G0 to S , the proportion of <START:ggp> DP1 <END> to <START:ggp> DP2 <END> remains relatively constant during the cell cycle . 
We also observed an increase in electrophoretic mobility of the predominant <START:ggp> E2F components <END> , <START:ggp> DP1 <END> and <START:ggp> E2F4 <END> , as <START:ana> B-lymphocytes <END> progressed from G0 into early G1 . 
This increase in mobility was attributable to dephosphorylation , as lambda phosphatase treatment could convert the <START:ggp> slower migrating forms <END> into the <START:ggp> corresponding faster mobility forms <END> . 
We further demonstrated that this change in phosphorylation status correlates with a decrease in DNA binding activity . 
This modulation of DNA binding activity mediated through the dephosphorylation of <START:ggp> DP1 <END> and <START:ggp> E2F4 <END> could help to explain the lack of in vivo DNA footprinting in late G1 and S phases of <START:ggp> gene promoters <END> negatively regulated through <START:ggp> E2F sites <END> and suggests a novel mechanism for controlling <START:ggp> E2F <END> transcriptional activity during the transition from quiescence to proliferation . 
Engagement of natural cytotoxicity programs regulates <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> expression in the <START:ana> NKL human NK cell line <END> . 
NK cell cytotoxicity is a fast and efficient mechanism of target cell lysis . 
Using transcription analysis , such as multiplex messenger assays , we show here that natural cytotoxicity exerted by the <START:ana> human NKL cell line <END> correlates with mRNA accumulation of <START:ggp> very early activator protein ( AP ) -1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor genes <END> such as <START:ggp> JunB <END> , <START:ggp> FosB <END> and <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> . 
In addition , DNA-binding activities of <START:ggp> Jun-Fos heterodimers <END> were observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays during the course of natural cytotoxicity . 
Interaction between <START:ggp> immunoglobulin-like transcript-2/leukocyte Ig-like receptor 1 <END> on <START:ana> NKL cells <END> and <START:ggp> HLA-B27 <END> on <START:ana> target cells <END> leads to an impairment of NKL natural cytotoxicity , which correlates with an absence of JunB , FosB , and c-Fos transcription , as well as an absence of their DNA-binding activity . 
Our studies thus indicate that , despite the rapidity of NK cell-mediated lysis , <START:ggp> AP-1 transcription factor <END> is activated during the early stage of NK cell cytolytic programs and that engagement of <START:ggp> NK cell inhibitory receptors <END> for <START:ggp> MHC class I molecules <END> impairs the very early activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
Evidence for a polyclonal etiology of palmar fibromatosis . 
<START:ggp> X chromosome <END> inactivation patterns at the androgen receptor locus were evaluated to determine clonality in microdissected lesional tissue and in <START:ana> leukocytes <END> from 2 women with Dupuytren 's disease . 
The tissue from both patients generated a polyclonal pattern of <START:ggp> X chromosome <END> inactivation of the <START:ggp> human androgen receptor gene <END> . 
This finding supports a polyclonal reactive process as the underlying etiology for palmar fibromatosis . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> cyclooxygenase-2 <END> expression by 4-trifluoromethyl derivatives of salicylate , triflusal , and its deacetylated metabolite , 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid . 
The therapeutic potential of drugs that block the induction of <START:ggp> cyclooxygenase-2 <END> has been emphasized . 
When two 4-trifluoromethyl salicylate derivatives [ 2-acetoxy-4-trifluoromethyl-benzoic acid ( triflusal ) and its deacetylated metabolite 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid ( HTB ) ] were compared with aspirin and sodium salicylate as <START:ggp> cyclooxygenase-2 <END> ( COX-2 ) inhibitors , we observed that in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-activated human blood , triflusal , aspirin , and HTB , but not sodium salicylate , inhibited COX-2-mediated prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production ( IC50 = 0.16 , 0.18 , 0.39 , and > 10 mM , respectively ) . 
However , only triflusal and aspirin inhibited <START:ggp> purified COX-2 enzyme <END> . 
To test this apparent discrepancy , we realized that HTB and triflusal ( but neither aspirin nor salicylate ) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of <START:ggp> COX-2 <END> protein expression in <START:ana> peripheral human mononuclear cells <END> . 
This observation was further confirmed in a rat air pouch model in vivo , in which both aspirin and triflusal inhibited PGE2 production ( ID50 = 18.9 and 11.4 mg/kg p.o. , respectively ) but only triflusal-treated animals showed a decrease in <START:ggp> COX-2 <END> expression . 
This different behavior may be , at least in part , due to the ability of HTB and triflusal to block the activation of the transcription factor <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> to a higher extent than aspirin and sodium salicylate . 
Thus , in addition to inhibiting the COX-2 activity at therapeutic concentrations , triflusal is able to block through its metabolite HTB the expression of new enzyme , and hence the resumption of PGE2 synthesis . 
Triflusal and HTB may exert beneficial effects in processes in which de novo <START:ggp> COX-2 <END> expression is involved and , in a broader sense , in pathological situations in which genes under <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> control are up-regulated . 
Evidence for distinct intracellular signaling pathways in <START:ana> CD34+ progenitor <END> to dendritic cell differentiation from a human cell line model . 
Intracellular signals that mediate differentiation of <START:ana> pluripotent hemopoietic progenitors <END> to <START:ana> dendritic cells <END> ( <START:ana> DC <END> ) are largely undefined . 
We have previously shown that <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) activation ( with phorbol ester ( PMA ) alone ) specifically induces differentiation of <START:ana> primary human CD34+ hemopoietic progenitor cells <END> ( <START:ana> HPC <END> ) to <START:ana> mature DC <END> . 
We now find that cytokine-driven ( granulocyte-macrophage CSF and TNF-alpha ) CD34+ <START:ana> HPC <END> -- > DC differentiation is preferentially blocked by inhibitors of <START:ggp> PKC <END> activation . 
To further identify intracellular signals and downstream events important in <START:ana> CD34+ HPC <END> -- > <START:ana> DC <END> differentiation we have characterized a human leukemic cell line model of this process . 
The <START:ana> CD34+ myelomonocytic cell line <END> <START:ana> KG1 <END> differentiates into dendritic-like cells in response to <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage CSF <END> plus <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , or PMA ( with or without the calcium ionophore ionomycin , or <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) , with different stimuli mediating different aspects of the process . 
Phenotypic <START:ana> DC <END> characteristics of <START:ana> KG1 dendritic-like cells <END> include morphology ( <START:ana> loosely adherent cells <END> with long neurite processes ) , <START:ggp> MHC <END> I+/ <START:ggp> MHC <END> IIbright/CD83+/CD86+/ <START:ggp> CD14 <END> - surface Ag expression , and <START:ggp> RelB <END> and <START:ana> DC <END> -CK1 gene expression . 
Functional <START:ana> DC <END> characteristics include fluid phase macromolecule uptake ( FITC-dextran ) and activation of <START:ana> resting T cells <END> . 
Comparison of <START:ana> KG1 <END> to the <START:ana> PMA-unresponsive subline KG1a <END> reveals differences in expression of <START:ggp> TNF receptors 1 and 2 <END> ; <START:ggp> PKC isoforms alpha , beta I , beta II , and mu <END> ; and <START:ggp> RelB <END> , suggesting that these components/pathways are important for <START:ana> DC <END> differentiation . 
Together , these findings demonstrate that cytokine or phorbol ester stimulation of <START:ana> KG1 <END> is a model of <START:ana> human CD34+ HPC <END> to <START:ana> DC <END> differentiation and suggest that specific intracellular signaling pathways mediate specific events in <START:ana> DC <END> lineage commitment . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> adenylate cyclase <END> and <START:ggp> p70 ( S6 ) -kinase <END> activation in <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> up-regulation in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> by <START:ggp> gp41 envelope protein <END> of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 . 
Our previous results show that <START:ggp> recombinant gp41 <END> ( <START:ggp> aa565-647 <END> ) , the <START:ggp> extracellular domain <END> of <START:ggp> HIV-1 transmembrane glycoprotein <END> , stimulates <START:ggp> interleukin-10 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ) production in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
The signal cascade transducing this effect is not yet clear . 
In this study , we examined whether <START:ggp> gp41 <END> -induced <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> up-regulation is mediated by the previously described synergistic activation of cAMP and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> pathways . 
<START:ggp> gp41 <END> induced cAMP accumulation in <START:ana> monocytes <END> in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and the <START:ggp> adenylate cyclase <END> inhibitor SQ 22536 suppressed <START:ggp> gp41 <END> -induced <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> production in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> gp41 <END> failed to stimulate <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding activity in as much as no <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> bound to the <START:ggp> main NF-kappaB-binding site <END> 2 of the <START:ggp> IL-10 promoter <END> after addition of <START:ggp> gp41 <END> . 
We also examined the involvement of other signal transduction pathways . 
Specific inhibitors of <START:ggp> p70 ( S6 ) -kinase <END> ( rapamycin ) , and <START:ggp> Gi protein <END> ( <START:ggp> pertussis toxin <END> ) , prevented induction of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> production by <START:ggp> gp41 <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> , while inhibitors of the <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> ) ( wortmannin ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( <START:ggp> MAPK <END> ) pathway ( PD 98059 ) did not . 
Thus HIV-1 <START:ggp> gp41 <END> -induced <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> up-regulation in <START:ana> monocytes <END> may not involve <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , <START:ggp> MAPK <END> , or <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> activation , but rather may operate through activation of <START:ggp> adenylate cyclase <END> and <START:ggp> pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gi/Go protein <END> to effect <START:ggp> p70 ( S6 ) -kinase <END> activation . 
Analysis of the modulation of transcriptional activity in myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis . 
Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is still associated with a mortality of 60 to 80 % . 
AML is characterized by a block in myeloid differentiation . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> and <START:ggp> C/EBPalpha <END> are responsible for normal myeloid differentiation from <START:ana> stem cells <END> to <START:ana> monocytes <END> or granulocytes . 
In particular , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> induces expression of the <START:ggp> macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) receptor <END> and the development of <START:ana> monocytes <END> , whereas <START:ggp> C/EBPalpha <END> increases the expression of the <START:ggp> granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) receptor <END> and leads to mature <START:ana> granulocytes <END> . 
In AML , chromosomal aberrations result in <START:ggp> oncoproteins <END> such as <START:ggp> AML1/ETO <END> , <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha <END> , or <START:ggp> activated Ras <END> , which can deregulate genes important for normal myelopoiesis . 
Thus , <START:ggp> AML1/ETO <END> can bind to the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> C/EBPalpha <END> , inhibit <START:ggp> C/EBPalpha <END> -dependent transcription , and block granulocytic differentiation . 
However , <START:ggp> AML1/ETO <END> can also synergize with the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AML1 <END> to enhance the activity of the <START:ggp> M-CSF receptor promoter <END> . 
On the other hand , the <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha fusion protein <END> causes transcriptional repression by recruiting the <START:ggp> nuclear corepressor ( N-CoR ) histone deacetylase complex <END> to the DNA , which results in decreased <START:ggp> histone <END> acetylation and a repressive <START:ggp> chromatin <END> organization . 
Here we describe methods to investigate whether and how signaling agonists induce myeloid differentiation and how <START:ggp> oncoproteins <END> might cause AML by modulating the activity of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that are pivotal for normal myeloid development .

<START:ggp> NF-ATc isoforms <END> are differentially expressed and regulated in <START:ana> murine T and mast cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) denotes a family of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that regulate the activation-dependent expression of many <START:ggp> immunologically important proteins <END> . 
At least four distinct genes encode the various family members , and several isoforms of these have been identified as well . 
The overlapping expression patterns and similar in vitro binding and trans-activation activities on various <START:ggp> promoter elements <END> of <START:ggp> NF-AT-regulated genes <END> suggest some redundancy in the function of these proteins . 
However , the phenotypic analysis of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> -deficient mice supports the idea that there are tissue- and gene- specific functions as well . 
In this study we have characterized the expression of <START:ggp> NF-AT cDNAs <END> in murine <START:ana> mast cells <END> . 
The majority of clones identified correspond to two <START:ggp> NF-ATc isoforms <END> that differ only in their <START:ggp> amino-terminal sequence <END> . 
Despite minimal discrepancies in the <START:ggp> coding region <END> , there are striking tissue- and cell type-specific differences in isoform expression patterns . 
Detection of <START:ana> NF-ATc.alpha mRNA <END> is strictly dependent on cell activation signals in both <START:ana> T and mast cell lines <END> . 
In contrast , the <START:ggp> beta isoform <END> is expressed at very low constitutive levels in both cell types but is only up-regulated in response to mast cell activation signals delivered through the <START:ggp> FcepsilonRI <END> or via calcium ionophores . 
These results demonstrate another level of regulation within the <START:ggp> NF-AT family <END> that can contribute to cell type-specific gene expression . 
Crossreactive recognition of viral , self , and bacterial peptide ligands by <START:ana> human class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte clonotypes : <END> implications for molecular mimicry in autoimmune disease . 
The immunodominant , <START:ana> CD8 ( + ) cytotoxic T lymphocyte <END> ( CTL ) response to the HLA-B8-restricted peptide , RAKFKQLL , located in the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus immediate-early antigen <END> , <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> , is characterized by a diverse <START:ggp> T cell receptor ( TCR ) repertoire <END> . 
Here , we show that this diversity can be partitioned on the basis of crossreactive cytotoxicity patterns involving the recognition of a self peptide-RSKFRQIV-located in a <START:ggp> serine/threonine kinase <END> and a bacterial peptide-RRKYKQII-located in <START:ggp> Staphylococcus aureus replication initiation protein <END> . 
Thus <START:ana> CTL clones <END> that recognized the viral , self , and bacterial peptides expressed a highly restricted alphabeta <START:ggp> TCR <END> phenotype . 
The <START:ana> CTL clones <END> that recognized viral and self peptides were more oligoclonal , whereas clones that strictly recognized the viral peptide displayed a diverse <START:ggp> TCR <END> profile . 
Interestingly , the self and bacterial peptides equally were substantially less effective than the cognate viral peptide in sensitizing target cell lysis , and also resulted only in a weak reactivation of <START:ana> memory CTLs <END> in limiting dilution assays , whereas the cognate peptide was highly immunogenic . 
The described crossreactions show that human antiviral , CD8 ( + ) CTL responses can be shaped by peptide ligands derived from autoantigens and environmental bacterial antigens , thereby providing a firm structural basis for molecular mimicry involving class <START:ana> I-restricted CTLs <END> in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease . 
<START:ggp> RFLAT-1 <END> : a new <START:ggp> zinc finger transcription factor <END> that activates <START:ggp> RANTES gene <END> expression in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> RANTES <END> ( <START:ggp> Regulated upon Activation , Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted <END> ) is a <START:ggp> chemoattractant cytokine <END> ( <START:ggp> chemokine <END> ) important in the generation of inflammatory infiltrate and human immunodeficiency virus entry into <START:ana> immune cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> RANTES <END> is expressed late ( 3-5 days ) after activation in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Using expression cloning , we identified the first `` late '' <START:ggp> T lymphocyte associated transcription factor <END> and named it `` <START:ggp> RANTES Factor of Late Activated T Lymphocytes-1 <END> `` ( <START:ggp> RFLAT-1 <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> RFLAT-1 <END> is a novel , phosphorylated , <START:ggp> zinc finger transcription factor <END> that is expressed in <START:ana> T cells <END> 3 days after activation , coincident with <START:ggp> RANTES <END> expression . 
While <START:ggp> Rel proteins <END> play the dominant role in <START:ggp> RANTES gene <END> expression in fibroblasts , <START:ggp> RFLAT-1 <END> is a strong transactivator for <START:ggp> RANTES <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Fas ligand <END> induction in <START:ana> human NK cells <END> is regulated by redox through a <START:ggp> calcineurin-nuclear factors <END> of activated T cell-dependent pathway . 
<START:ggp> Fas ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> FasL <END> ) on cytotoxic lymphocytes is important for mediating apoptosis of activated lymphocytes and other target cells . 
We have reported that NK cell functions , such as proliferation , cell death , and killing activity , are subject to regulation by cellular redox status . 
Here , we report that expression of <START:ggp> FasL protein <END> and <START:ana> mRNA <END> in <START:ana> activated NK cells <END> is also regulated by redox . 
Ligation of <START:ggp> CD16 <END> on <START:ana> IL-2-preactivated NK cells <END> resulted in reduction of intracellular peroxide level as well as induction of <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression . 
This <START:ggp> CD16 <END> -induced <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression was suppressed by oxidative stress , including thiol deprivation or treatment with hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) . 
Addition of thiol-reducing compounds , such as L-cystine , 2-ME , or N-acetyl cysteine , restored <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> CD16 <END> stimulation requires cellular reducing status for <START:ggp> FasL <END> induction in <START:ana> NK cells <END> . 
Because FasL gene activation following <START:ggp> CD16 <END> cross-linking is regulated by the <START:ggp> NF of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) , we examined the effect of oxidative stresses on <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that both thiol insufficiency and H2O2 treatment suppressed DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> and that addition of thiol-reducing compounds reversed or even enhanced it . 
Furthermore , these oxidative stresses inhibited activity of calcineurin , a serine/ <START:ggp> threonine phosphatase <END> that regulates <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation . 
These results suggest that suppression of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> and <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation is a mechanism by which oxidative stress inhibits <START:ggp> FasL <END> induction in <START:ana> activated NK cells <END> and further support the hypothesis that thiol-reducing compounds might be required for maintenance of optimal NK functions under physiologic oxidative conditions . 
Heterogeneity of clonal development in <START:ggp> chronic myeloproliferative disorders <END> . 
Recent reports have suggested a previously unexpected variability in the expression of the <START:ana> dominant neoplastic clone <END> in myeloproliferative disorders ( MPD ) . 
We evaluated 49 female patients with MPD and informative at the <START:ggp> X-linked androgen receptor ( AR ) locus <END> to establish the <START:ggp> X chromosome <END> inactivation pattern of <START:ana> hemopoietic cells <END> . 
Whereas in chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) the <START:ana> granulocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PMN <END> ) were uniformly of monoclonal origin , a striking heterogeneity of clonal development was found in <START:ana> PMN <END> from patients with other MPD , with up to 50 % of them expressing a polyclonal pattern of X inactivation . 
<START:ggp> CD80 <END> and <START:ggp> CD86 <END> are not equivalent in their ability to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> . 
Ligation of either <START:ggp> CD80 <END> ( <START:ggp> B7-1 <END> ) or <START:ggp> CD86 <END> ( <START:ggp> B7-2 <END> ) , two principal ligands for <START:ggp> CD28 <END> , is thought to skew the immune response toward Th1 or Th2 differentiation . 
We have examined early signal transduction pathways recruited following T cell stimulation with either <START:ggp> CD80 <END> or <START:ggp> CD86 <END> . 
<START:ana> Purified human peripheral T cells <END> or <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> were stimulated with Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells expressing either <START:ggp> human CD80 <END> ( <START:ggp> CHO-CD80 <END> ) or <START:ggp> human CD86 <END> ( <START:ggp> CHO-CD86 <END> ) or with <START:ggp> anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody <END> ( mAb ) . 
In the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate , both <START:ggp> CHO-CD80 <END> and <START:ggp> CHO-CD86 <END> , like <START:ggp> anti-CD28 mAb <END> , were capable of stimulating <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production from both <START:ana> human peripheral T cells <END> and <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> CHO-CD80 <END> and <START:ggp> CHO-CD86 <END> , in the presence of <START:ggp> anti-CD3 mAb <END> , costimulated <START:ggp> NFAT <END> -dependent transcriptional activation . 
Several intracellular <START:ggp> signaling proteins <END> , such as <START:ggp> CBL <END> and <START:ggp> VAV <END> , were phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to <START:ggp> CD80 <END> , <START:ggp> CD86 <END> , and <START:ggp> anti-CD28 mAb <END> . 
Surprisingly , although stimulation of <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> with either <START:ggp> CHO-CD80 <END> or <START:ggp> anti-CD28 mAb <END> resulted in robust tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> itself , ligation with <START:ggp> CHO-CD86 <END> was unable to induce detectable <START:ggp> CD28 <END> tyrosyl phosphorylation over a range of stimulation conditions . 
In addition , the association of <START:ggp> phosphoinositide 3-kinase <END> with <START:ggp> CD28 <END> and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma were seen after anti-CD28 mAb and CHO-CD80 stimulation but to a much lesser extent after <START:ggp> CHO-CD86 <END> stimulation . 
Thus , ligation of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> with either <START:ggp> CD80 <END> or <START:ggp> CD86 <END> leads to shared early signal transduction events such as the tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CBL <END> and <START:ggp> VAV <END> , to <START:ggp> NFAT <END> -mediated transcriptional activation , and to the costimulation of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> and <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> production . 
However , <START:ggp> CD80 <END> and <START:ggp> CD86 <END> also induce distinct signal transduction pathways including the tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> and <START:ggp> phospholipase Cgamma1 <END> and the <START:ggp> SH2 <END> -dependent association of <START:ggp> phosphoinositide 3-kinase <END> with <START:ggp> CD28 <END> . 
These quantitative , if not qualitative , differences between signaling initiated by these two ligands for <START:ggp> CD28 <END> may contribute to functional differences ( e.g. Th1 or Th2 differentiation ) in T cell responses . 
Binding of <START:ggp> HMG-I ( Y ) <END> elicits structural changes in a silencer of the <START:ggp> human beta-globin gene <END> . 
Proteins involved in repression of the <START:ggp> human beta-globin gene <END> may be useful in the treatment of sickle cell anemia , in conjunction with therapy to reactivate <START:ggp> fetal globin genes <END> . 
If there is a reciprocal elevation of <START:ggp> gamma-globin <END> expression upon repression , this approach could be useful in additional hemoglobinopathies . 
We previously showed that repression of the beta-globin gene appears to be mediated through two <START:ggp> DNA sequences <END> , <START:ggp> silencers I and II <END> , and identified a protein termed <START:ggp> BP1 <END> which binds to both silencer sequences . 
In this study , we cloned two <START:ggp> cDNAs <END> encoding proteins which bind to an oligonucleotide in <START:ggp> silencer I <END> containing a <START:ggp> BP1 <END> binding site . 
These <START:ggp> cDNAs <END> correspond to <START:ggp> HMG-I <END> and <START:ggp> HMG-Y <END> , isoforms regarded as <START:ggp> architectural proteins <END> . 
We demonstrate that binding of <START:ggp> HMG-I ( Y ) <END> to this oligonucleotide causes bending/flexure of the DNA . 
<START:ggp> HMG-I ( Y ) <END> also binds to a second oligonucleotide containing a <START:ggp> BP1 binding site <END> located in a <START:ggp> negative control region <END> upstream of the <START:ggp> delta-globin gene <END> , suggesting a role for <START:ggp> HMG-I ( Y ) <END> in repression of adult globin genes . 
Expression studies revealed that <START:ggp> HMG-I ( Y ) <END> is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues that do not express <START:ggp> beta-globin <END> , being present in 48 of 50 tissues and six <START:ana> hematopoietic cell lines <END> examined . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> HMG-I ( Y ) <END> expression is down-regulated during differentiation of <START:ana> primary erythroid cells <END> . 
We present a model in which <START:ggp> HMG-I ( Y ) <END> alters DNA conformation to allow binding of <START:ggp> repressor proteins <END> , and in which the relative amount of HMG-I ( Y ) helps to determine the repressive state of the <START:ggp> beta-globin gene <END> . 
Interactions between the <START:ggp> class II transactivator <END> and <START:ggp> CREB binding protein <END> increase transcription of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex class II genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Class II major histocompatibility ( class II ) genes <END> are regulated in a B-cell-specific and gamma interferon-inducible fashion . 
The master switch for the expression of these genes is the <START:ggp> class II transactivator <END> ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) . 
In this report , we demonstrate that one of the functions of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> is to recruit the <START:ggp> CREB binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> CBP <END> ) to <START:ggp> class II promoters <END> . 
Not only functional but also specific binding interactions between <START:ggp> CIITA <END> and <START:ggp> CBP <END> were demonstrated . 
Moreover , a dominant negative form of <START:ggp> CBP <END> decreased the activity of <START:ggp> class II promoters <END> and levels of <START:ggp> class II determinants <END> on the surface of cells . 
Finally , the inhibition of <START:ggp> class II gene <END> expression by the glucocorticoid hormone could be attributed to the squelching of <START:ggp> CBP <END> by the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
We conclude that <START:ggp> CBP <END> , a <START:ggp> histone acetyltransferase <END> , plays an important role in the transcription of <START:ggp> class II genes <END> . 
Role of <START:ggp> cyclic AMP response element-binding protein <END> in cyclic AMP inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -mediated transcription . 
The <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> family of transcription factors regulates the inducible expression of a variety of genes . 
Recently , we showed that elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP inhibits <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -mediated transcription in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> without preventing nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB complexes <END> . 
The present study examined the molecular mechanism of this inhibition . 
We hypothesized that activation of the <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> signaling pathway may inhibit <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -mediated transcription by phosphorylating proteins , such as <START:ggp> cAMP response element-binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> CREB <END> ) , which compete for limiting amounts of the coactivator <START:ggp> CBP <END> . 
Here , we show that the <START:ggp> amino-terminal region <END> ( <START:ggp> amino acids 1-450 <END> ) of <START:ggp> CBP <END> specifically interacts with the <START:ggp> carboxyl-terminal region <END> ( <START:ggp> amino acids 286-551 <END> ) of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> <START:ggp> p65 <END> ( <START:ggp> RelA <END> ) both in vitro and in vivo . 
Functional studies using human <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> demonstrated that overexpression of <START:ggp> CBP <END> rescued cAMP inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -mediated transcription and transcription mediated by a <START:ggp> chimeric protein <END> , <START:ggp> GAL4-p65 ( 286-551 ) <END> , which contained the <START:ggp> GAL4 DNA binding domain <END> fused to the <START:ggp> carboxyl-terminal region <END> of <START:ggp> p65 <END> ( <START:ggp> amino acids 286-551 <END> ) . 
In contrast , overexpression of <START:ggp> CREB <END> inhibited <START:ggp> GAL4 <END> -p65 ( 286-551 ) -mediated transcription . 
These results suggest that activation of the <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> pathway inhibits <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> transcription by phosphorylating <START:ggp> CREB <END> , which competes with <START:ggp> p65 <END> for limiting amounts of <START:ggp> CBP <END> . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> cord blood lymphocytes <END> of healthy neonates and of preterms suffering from respiratory distress syndrome . 
We measured the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) in <START:ana> cord blood lymphocytes <END> and the binding affinity ( Kd ) in 15 term and in 20 preterm babies . 
Thirteen preterms of the latter group received prenatal steroid treatment . 
Seven preterms developed neonatal respiratory distress syndrome ( NRDS ) . 
The number of <START:ggp> GR <END> and the Kd were similar in the term and preterm ( with and without NRDS ) babies . 
The maximum ( 3H ) -thymidine incorporation into DNA of <START:ana> cord blood lymphocytes <END> from all preterms , with or without NRDS was suppressed when compared to that from term babies or adults . 
This could partly be explained by the antenatal steroid treatment . 
Sensitivity ( ID50 ) of the <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> for the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone was the same in all groups . 
In this study on the number and function of <START:ggp> GR <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , we were unable to find a relation between the functionality of the <START:ggp> GR <END> and the development of NRDS . 
Inefficient termination of antigen responses in <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> -deficient mice . 
In order to elucidate the role of <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> , one of the most prominent members of family of <START:ggp> NF-AT transcription factors <END> in <START:ana> peripheral T lymphocytes <END> , in T cell activation and differentiation we created <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> -deficient mice by gene targeting . 
Such <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> -/- mice are born and appear to develop a normal immune system . 
Apart from clear-cut defects in the synthesis of <START:ana> mRNAs <END> for <START:ggp> Th2-type lymphokines <END> , such as <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> , in primary and secondary stimulations of <START:ana> spleen cells <END> in vitro , of a distinct impaired deletion of <START:ana> V beta 11+/CD4+ T lymphocytes <END> from these mice was detected after superantigen injection . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> -/- mice older than 6 weeks show an 2-5 fold increase in number of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
This is correlated with an increased expression of <START:ggp> activation markers <END> <START:ggp> CD44 <END> and <START:ggp> CD69 <END> and decreased expression of <START:ggp> CD62 <END> . 
<START:ggp> AML and Ets proteins <END> regulate the <START:ggp> I alpha1 germ-line promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy chain <END> ( <START:ggp> IgH <END> ) class switch recombination of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> preferentially targets unrearranged <START:ggp> IgH genes <END> that have already been rendered transcriptionally active . 
Transcription of the <START:ggp> germ-line IgH genes <END> is controlled by <START:ggp> intervening ( I ) regions <END> upstream of their switch regions . 
The I alpha1 promoter activates transcription of the <START:ggp> human germ-line C alpha1 gene <END> for <START:ggp> IgA1 <END> and mediates the <START:ggp> transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -beta1 <END> responsiveness of this locus . 
Here we show that the I alpha1 promoter contains several binding sites for the <START:ggp> AML/PEBP2/CBF family of transcription factors <END> and that <START:ggp> AML and Ets proteins <END> are major regulators of the basal and TGF-beta-inducible promoter activity . 
Our data constitute a starting point for studies to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> regulates <START:ggp> IgA <END> production . 
Daidzein and genistein glucuronides in vitro are weakly estrogenic and activate <START:ana> human natural killer cells <END> at nutritionally relevant concentrations . 
Daidzein and genistein glucuronides ( DG and GG ) , major isoflavone metabolites , may be partly responsible for biological effects of isoflavones , such as estrogen receptor binding and <START:ana> natural killer cell <END> ( NK ) activation or inhibition . 
DG and GG were synthesized using 3-methylcholanthrene-induced rat liver microsomes . 
The Km and Vmax for daidzein and genistein were 9.0 and 7.7 micromol/L , and 0.7 and 1.6 micromol/ ( mg protein. min ) , respectively . 
The absence of ultraviolet absorbance maxima shifts in the presence of sodium acetate confirmed that the synthesized products were 7-O-glucuronides . 
DG and GG were further purified by a Sephadex LH-20 column . 
DG and GG competed with the binding of 17beta- ( 3H ) estradiol to <START:ggp> estrogen receptors <END> of B6D2F1 mouse uterine cytosol . 
The concentrations required for 50 % displacement of 17beta- ( 3H ) estradiol ( CB50 ) were : 17beta-estradiol , 1.34 nmol/L ; diethylstilbestrol , 1.46 nmol/L ; daidzein , 1.6 micromol/L ; DG , 14.7 micromol/L ; genistein , 0.154 micromol/L ; GG , 7.27 micromol/L . 
In <START:ana> human peripheral blood NK cells <END> , genistein at < 0.5 micromol/L and DG and GG at 0.1-10 micromol/L enhanced NK cell-mediated <START:ana> K562 cancer cell <END> killing significantly ( P < 0.05 ) . 
At > 0.5 micromol/L , genistein inhibited NK cytotoxicity significantly ( P < 0.05 ) . 
The glucuronides only inhibited NK cytotoxicity at 50 micromol/L . 
Isoflavones , and especially the isoflavone glucuronides , enhanced activation of <START:ana> NK cells <END> by <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) , additively . 
At physiological concentrations , DG and GG were weakly estrogenic , and they activated <START:ana> human NK cells <END> in nutritionally relevant concentrations in vitro , probably at a site different from <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> action . 
Cross-linking of <START:ggp> CD44 <END> on <START:ana> rheumatoid synovial cells <END> up-regulates <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> . 
CD44 is a ubiquitous molecule also known as hyaluronic acid or homing receptor . 
However , the cellular functions and its role in inflammation , for example , rheumatoid synovitis , are currently unknown . 
In this study , we propose a novel function for CD44 . 
Using synovial cells from rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients , we demonstrated that CD44 cross-linking and binding to hyaluronan augmented <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression and subsequently <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> -mediated cell adhesion . 
Briefly , we found that 1 ) <START:ana> rheumatoid synovial cells <END> highly expressed <START:ggp> CD44 <END> ; 2 ) cross-linking of <START:ggp> CD44 <END> markedly but transiently augmented <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression and its mRNA transcription much more than did <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> and TNF-alpha ; 3 ) hyaluronan , especially when fragmented , also up-regulated <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ; 4 ) <START:ggp> CD44 <END> activated the transcription factor AP-1 ; and 5 ) the <START:ggp> integrin <END> -dependent adhesive function of <START:ana> RA synovial cells <END> to <START:ana> T cells <END> was also amplified by <START:ggp> CD44 <END> cross-linking . 
These results indicate that the adhesion of <START:ana> RA synovial cells <END> to matrices such as hyaluronic acid through <START:ggp> CD44 <END> could up-regulate <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression and <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> -mediated adhesion to <START:ana> T cells <END> , which might in turn cause activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> synovial cells <END> in RA synovitis . 
We therefore propose that such cross-talking among distinct adhesion molecules may be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation , including RA synovitis . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation is a critical regulator of human granulocyte apoptosis in vitro . 
During beneficial inflammation , potentially <START:ana> tissue-damaging granulocytes <END> undergo apoptosis before being cleared by phagocytes in a non-phlogistic manner . 
Here we show that the rate of constitutive apoptosis in <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> and <START:ana> eosinophils <END> is greatly accelerated in both a rapid and concentration-dependent manner by the fungal metabolite gliotoxin , but not by its inactive analog methylthiogliotoxin . 
This induction of apoptosis was abolished by the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk , correlated with the inhibition of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) , and was mimicked by a cell permeable inhibitory peptide of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , SN-50 ; other <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> inhibitors , curcumin and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ; and the proteasome inhibitor , MG-132 . 
Gliotoxin also augmented dramatically the early ( 2-6 h ) pro-apoptotic effects of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> and unmasked the ability of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> to induce <START:ana> eosinophil <END> apoptosis . 
In <START:ana> neutrophils <END> , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> caused a gliotoxin-inhibitable activation of an inducible form of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , a response that may underlie the ability of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> to delay apoptosis at later times ( 12-24 h ) and limit its early killing effect . 
Furthermore , cycloheximide displayed a similar capacity to enhance <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> induced neutrophil apoptosis even at time points when cycloheximide alone had no pro-apoptotic effect , suggesting that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> may regulate the production of protein ( s ) which protect <START:ana> neutrophils <END> from the cytotoxic effects of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> . 
These data shed light on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms regulating human granulocyte apoptosis and , in particular , indicate that the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> plays a crucial role in regulating the physiological cell death pathway in <START:ana> granulocytes <END> . 
Role of <START:ggp> Egr-2 <END> in up-regulation of <START:ggp> Fas ligand <END> in normal <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> aberrant double-negative lpr and gld T cells <END> . 
We previously identified a <START:ggp> Fas ligand regulatory element <END> ( <START:ggp> FLRE <END> ) in the <START:ggp> Fas ligand ( fasL ) promoter <END> that binds <START:ggp> Egr family proteins <END> and demonstrated that <START:ggp> Egr-3 <END> ( <START:ggp> PILOT <END> ) but not <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> NGFI-A <END> , <START:ggp> Krox-24 <END> , <START:ggp> Tis-8 <END> , and <START:ggp> Zif-268 <END> ) induces transcription of <START:ggp> fasL <END> . 
The <START:ana> aberrant CD4 ( - ) CD8 ( - ) T cells <END> from lpr/lpr and gld/gld mice , which have mutations in the genes encoding <START:ggp> Fas <END> and <START:ggp> FasL <END> , respectively , have an activated phenotype and constitutively express high levels of <START:ana> fasL mRNA <END> , prompting us to ask what role if any the <START:ggp> FLRE <END> and <START:ggp> Egr family proteins <END> have in this aberrant expression of <START:ggp> fasL <END> . 
Unstimulated <START:ana> MRL-lpr/lpr and C3H-gld/gld CD4 ( - ) CD8 ( - ) T cells <END> constitutively contained high levels of two proteins that bound to the <START:ggp> FLRE <END> . 
Supershift analysis revealed these proteins to be <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Egr-2 <END> ( Krox-20 ) ; <START:ggp> Egr-3 <END> was not detected . 
Activation of <START:ana> normal lymph node cells <END> resulted in increased expression of <START:ggp> Egr-1 , -2 , and -3 <END> . 
As with <START:ggp> egr-3 <END> , expression of <START:ggp> egr-2 <END> was blocked by cyclosporin A . 
Although overexpressed <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> was ineffective , overexpressed <START:ggp> Egr-2 <END> was as potent as <START:ggp> Egr-3 <END> in inducing <START:ggp> fasL promoter-dependent reporter constructs <END> in T cell hybridomas and HeLa cells , and both up-regulated endogenous <START:ana> fasL mRNA <END> in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> FasL-dependent reporter constructs <END> in <START:ana> MRL-lpr/lpr and C3H-gld/gld CD4 ( - ) CD8 ( - ) T cells <END> were constitutively active , and this activity was largely prevented by mutation of the critical <START:ggp> Egr family binding element <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> Egr-2 <END> , in addition to <START:ggp> Egr-3 <END> , regulates <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression in activated normal <START:ana> T cells <END> , and <START:ggp> Egr-2 <END> is likely to play a direct role in aberrant <START:ggp> fasL <END> up-regulation in <START:ana> lpr/lpr and gld/gld CD4 ( - ) CD8 ( - ) T cells <END> . 
The activity of the <START:ggp> CCAAT-box binding factor NF-Y <END> is modulated through the regulated expression of its <START:ggp> A subunit <END> during monocyte to macrophage differentiation : regulation of <START:ggp> tissue-specific genes <END> through a ubiquitous <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
In this study , we analyzed the regulation of <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> expression during human monocyte to macrophage maturation . 
<START:ggp> NF-Y <END> is a ubiquitous and evolutionarily conserved <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> that binds specifically to the <START:ggp> CCAAT motif <END> present in the <START:ggp> 5 ' promoter region <END> of a wide variety of genes . 
We show here that in <START:ana> circulating monocytes <END> , <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> binding activity is not detected on the <START:ggp> CCAAT motif <END> present in the <START:ggp> promoters of genes <END> such as <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II <END> , <START:ggp> gp91-phox <END> , <START:ggp> mig <END> , and fibronectin , whereas during macrophage differentiation , a progressive increase in <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> binding activity is observed on these promoters . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> subunit expression indicates that the absence of <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> activity in <START:ana> circulating monocytes <END> is caused by a lack of the <START:ggp> A subunit <END> . 
Furthermore , addition of the recombinant <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> <START:ggp> A subunit <END> restores <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> binding . 
We show that the lack of <START:ggp> NF-YA protein <END> is due to posttranscriptional regulation and not to a specific proteolytic activity . 
In fact , <START:ana> NF-YA mRNA <END> is present at the same level at all days of monocyte cultivation , whereas the protein is absent in <START:ana> freshly isolated monocytes <END> but is progressively synthesized during the maturation process . 
We thus conclude that the <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> <START:ggp> A subunit <END> plays a relevant role in activating transcription of genes highly expressed in <START:ana> mature monocytes <END> . 
In line with this conclusion , we show that the <START:ggp> cut/CDP protein <END> , a transcriptional repressor that inhibits <START:ggp> gpc91-phox gene <END> expression by preventing <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> binding to the <START:ggp> CAAT box <END> , is absent in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interdomain B <END> in <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> regulates but is not required for <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> signaling function in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
The protein tyrosine kinase <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> plays an important role in T-cell activation and development . 
After <START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> stimulation , <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> associates with the receptor and is phosphorylated on many tyrosines , including Y292 , Y315 , and Y319 within interdomain B . 
Previously , we demonstrated that Y292 negatively regulates <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> function and that Y315 positively regulates <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> function by interacting with <START:ggp> Vav <END> . 
Recent studies have suggested that Y319 also positively regulate <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> function . 
Paradoxically , removal of <START:ggp> interdomain B <END> ( to create the construct designated <START:ggp> Delta <END> ) , containing the Y292 , Y315 , and Y319 sites , did not eliminate the ability of <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> to induce <START:ggp> multiple gene reporters <END> in <START:ana> Syk-deficient DT-40 B cells <END> and <START:ana> ZAP-70/Syk-deficient Jurkat cells <END> . 
Here we show that <START:ggp> Delta <END> still utilizes the same pathways as wild-type <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> to mediate <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> induction . 
This is manifested by the ability of <START:ggp> Delta <END> to restore induction of calcium fluxes and <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> activation and by the ability of dominant negative <START:ggp> Ras <END> and <START:ggp> FK506 <END> to block the induction of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> activity mediated by <START:ggp> Delta <END> . 
Biochemically we show that the stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Vav <END> , <START:ggp> Shc <END> , and <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> itself is diminished , whereas that of <START:ggp> Slp-76 <END> is increased in cells reconstituted with <START:ggp> Delta <END> . 
Deletion of <START:ggp> interdomain B <END> did not affect the ability of <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> to bind to the receptor . 
The in vitro kinase activity of <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> lacking <START:ggp> interdomain B <END> was markedly reduced , but the kinase activity was still required for the protein 's in vivo activity . 
Based on these data , we concluded that <START:ggp> interdomain B <END> regulates but is not required for <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> signaling function leading to cellular responses . 
Differential induction of <START:ggp> DNA-binding activities <END> following <START:ggp> CD19 <END> cross-linking in <START:ana> human B lineage cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> B cell-specific cell surface molecule <END> <START:ggp> CD19 <END> is expressed at all stages of B cell development , including normal plasma cells , and mediates signal transduction via interaction with <START:ggp> cytoplasmic effector proteins <END> . 
Cross-linking <START:ggp> CD19 <END> on early <START:ana> human B lineage cells <END> induces the formation of a <START:ggp> CD19/Vav/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complex <END> , tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CD19 <END> and <START:ggp> Vav <END> , and activation of the <START:ggp> Ras <END> pathway . 
To further explore the ramifications of <START:ggp> CD19 <END> signaling , the current study examined whether phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Elk-1 <END> , activation of <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) , or activation of nuclear factor-kappaB ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> occurred following <START:ggp> CD19 <END> cross-linking . 
The cells used were the <START:ana> BLIN-1 pre-B cell line <END> expressing low levels of <START:ggp> cell surface mu heavy chain <END> associated with <START:ggp> surrogate light chain <END> and the 1E8 immature B cell line expressing <START:ggp> cell surface mu/kappa <END> . 
Lysates from <START:ggp> CD19 <END> cross-linked <START:ana> 1E8 cells <END> induced robust phosphorylation of an <START:ggp> Elk-1 fusion protein <END> in vitro , whereas no phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Elk-1 fusion protein <END> occurred using lysates from <START:ana> CD19 cross-linked BLIN-1 cells <END> . 
An electrophoretic mobility shift assay employing <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> consensus oligonucleotides was used to demonstrate that <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -binding activity increased , while constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -binding activity was not enhanced , following 2 h of <START:ggp> CD19 <END> cross-linking in <START:ana> 1E8 cells <END> . Supershift experiments revealed that <START:ggp> JunD <END> and <START:ggp> c-Fos proteins <END> mediated anti- <START:ggp> CD19 <END> induced <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -binding activity in <START:ana> 1E8 cells <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> CD19 <END> cross-linking in <START:ana> BLIN-1 cells <END> resulted in the induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , but had no apparent effect on <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -binding activity . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> CD19 <END> -mediated signal transduction activates different <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> at juxtaposed stages of B cell development that may culminate in the activation or suppression of distinct sets of <START:ggp> genes <END> . 
Oxidants , <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , and intestinal inflammation . 
It is now well appreciated that chronic gut inflammation is characterized by enhanced production of reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen . 
Some of these oxidants are known to modulate the expression of a variety of genes that are involved in the immune and inflammatory responses . 
For example , certain oxidants are known to activate the <START:ggp> nuclear transcription factor kappa B <END> , which regulates the expression of a variety of different <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> , <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , and <START:ggp> enzymes <END> . 
Oxidants are also known to activate another <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> . 
This <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> is composed of products from the <START:ggp> fos and jun proto-oncogene family <END> and is believed to be important in regulating cell growth and proliferation . 
Finally , oxidants are believed to promote <START:ana> intestinal epithelial cell <END> apoptosis , and the <START:ggp> B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene product <END> is believed to inhibit this phenomenon in an antioxidant-dependent manner . 
Taken together , these observations suggest that nontoxic concentrations of reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen play an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response and in modulating apoptosis . 
Identification of <START:ggp> target genes <END> of the <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct2 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> is expressed predominantly in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> and plays an essential role during the terminal phase of B cell differentiation . 
The <START:ggp> regulatory regions <END> of several genes specifically expressed in <START:ana> B cells <END> contain <START:ggp> functional binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> . 
Nevertheless , none of the genes originally thought to be regulated by <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> were affected in their expression in <START:ana> Oct2-deficient B cells <END> . 
In an attempt to find such elusive <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> <START:ggp> target genes <END> and to understand the molecular function of <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> in B cell development , we isolated <START:ggp> cDNAs <END> for <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> <START:ggp> target genes <END> . 
So far , we have identified five potential targets for <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> : the <START:ggp> membrane glycoprotein <END> <START:ggp> CD36 <END> , the <START:ggp> cysteine-rich secreted protein 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> CRISP-3 <END> ) , a mouse homolog of the <START:ggp> human monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor <END> ( <START:ggp> mEI <END> ) and two unknown <START:ggp> cDNA sequences <END> <START:ggp> Nov1 <END> and <START:ggp> Nov2 <END> . 
These <START:ggp> target genes <END> show quite distinct expression patterns demonstrating that <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in addition to <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> are involved in their regulation . 
Whereas <START:ggp> CD36 <END> and <START:ggp> mEI <END> were expressed in all <START:ana> hematopoetic cell lines <END> containing <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> , . 
<START:ggp> CRISP-3 <END> is pre-B cell-specific , <START:ggp> Nov1 <END> is plasma B cell-specific and <START:ggp> Nov2 <END> is B cell-specifically expressed . 
<START:ggp> RFX-B <END> is the gene responsible for the most common cause of the bare lymphocyte syndrome , an <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> immunodeficiency [ published erratum appears in Immunity 1999 Mar ; 10 ( 3 ) : 399 ] 
The bare lymphocyte syndrome ( BLS ) is characterized by the absence of <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> transcription and humoral- and cellular-mediated immune responses to foreign antigens . 
Three of the four BLS genetic complementation groups have defects in the activity of the <START:ggp> MHC class II transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> RFX <END> . 
We have purified the <START:ggp> RFX complex <END> and sequenced its three subunits . 
The sequence of the smallest subunit describes a novel gene , termed <START:ggp> RFX-B <END> . 
<START:ggp> RFX-B <END> complements the predominant <START:ggp> BLS complementation group <END> ( <START:ggp> group B <END> ) and was found to be mutant in <START:ana> cell lines <END> from this BLS group . 
The protein has no known <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> but does contain three ankyrin repeats that are likely to be important in protein-protein interactions . 
Binding of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> to <START:ggp> STAT5 target sequences <END> in <START:ana> HTLV-I-transformed T cells <END> . 
The type I human T-cell leukemia virus ( HTLV-I ) induces abnormal growth and subsequent transformation of <START:ana> T cells <END> , which is associated with the development of an acute T-cell malignancy termed adult T-cell leukemia . 
A characteristic of <START:ana> HTLV-I-transformed T cells <END> is the constitutive nuclear expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel family <END> of transcription factors , which appears to be essential for the growth of these <START:ana> transformed cells <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel factors <END> are known to induce the expression of <START:ggp> T-cell growth factor interleukin ( IL ) -2 <END> , it is unclear how they participate in the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -independent growth of <START:ana> HTLV-I-transformed cells <END> . 
In this study , we show that certain <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel members <END> , predominantly <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , interact with enhancer sequences for <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> , a key transcription factor mediating <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced T-cell proliferation . 
Reporter gene assays reveal that the binding of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> to the <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> site present in the <START:ggp> Fc gammaR1 gene <END> leads to potent transactivation of this enhancer . 
Binding of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> to the <START:ggp> Fc gammaR1 STAT site <END> also occurs in human <START:ana> peripheral blood T cells <END> immortalized with HTLV-I in vitro and is correlated with enhanced levels of proliferation of these cells . 
These results raise the possibility that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel <END> may participate in the growth control of <START:ana> HTLV-I-transformed T cells <END> by regulating genes driven by both <START:ggp> kappaB <END> and certain <START:ggp> STAT enhancers <END> . 
Activation-dependent transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> human Fas promoter <END> requires <START:ggp> NF-kappaB p50-p65 <END> recruitment . 
<START:ggp> Fas <END> ( <START:ggp> CD95 <END> ) and <START:ggp> Fas ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> CD95L <END> ) are an interacting receptor-ligand pair required for immune homeostasis . 
Lymphocyte activation results in the upregulation of <START:ggp> Fas <END> expression and the acquisition of sensitivity to <START:ggp> FasL <END> -mediated apoptosis . 
Although Fas upregulation is central to the preservation of immunologic tolerance , little is known about the molecular machinery underlying this process . 
To investigate the events involved in activation-induced <START:ggp> Fas <END> upregulation , we have examined mRNA accumulation , fas promoter activity , and protein expression in the <START:ana> Jurkat T-cell line <END> treated with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin ( P/I ) , pharmacological mimics of <START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> activation . 
Although <START:ana> resting Jurkat cells <END> express <START:ggp> Fas <END> , <START:ana> Fas mRNA <END> was induced approximately 10-fold in 2 h upon P/I stimulation . 
Using <START:ggp> sequential deletion mutants <END> of the <START:ggp> human fas promoter <END> in transient transfection assays , we identified a <START:ggp> 47-bp sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> positions -306 to -260 <END> relative to the ATG ) required for activation-driven fas upregulation . 
Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a previously <START:ggp> unrecognized composite binding site <END> for both the <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> at <START:ggp> positions -295 to -286 <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) and supershift analyses of this region documented constitutive binding of <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> in unactivated nuclear extracts and inducible binding of <START:ggp> p50-p65 NF-kappaB heterodimers <END> after P/I activation . 
<START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> transcription factor binding was shown to be mutually exclusive by EMSA displacement studies with purified recombinant <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and recombinant <START:ggp> p50 <END> . 
The functional contribution of the <START:ggp> kappaB-Sp1 composite site <END> in <START:ggp> P/I-inducible fas promoter <END> activation was verified by using kappaB- <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> concatamers ( <START:ggp> -295 to -286 <END> ) in a <START:ggp> thymidine kinase promoter-driven reporter construct <END> and <START:ggp> native promoter constructs <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> overexpressing <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> . 
Site-directed mutagenesis of the critical guanine nucleotides in the <START:ggp> kappaB-Sp1 element <END> documented the essential role of this site in activation-dependent fas promoter induction . 
Evidence for repression of <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> activation in <START:ana> anergic T cells <END> . 
The induction of clonal anergy in a T cell inhibits <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion because of the development of a proximal signal transduction defect . 
Fusion of <START:ana> anergic murine T cells <END> to <START:ana> human Jurkat T leukemia cells <END> and formation of <START:ana> heterokaryons <END> failed to result in a complementation of this signaling defect and restoration of <START:ana> murine IL-2 mRNA <END> inducibility . 
Instead , signal transduction to the human <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> became disrupted . 
<START:ana> Heterokaryons <END> formed by the fusion of <START:ana> anergic murine T cells <END> to <START:ana> normal murine T cells <END> also failed to accumulate <START:ggp> intracellular IL-2 protein <END> in response to stimulation either with the combination of <START:ggp> CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> CD28 mAbs <END> or with ionomycin plus a <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> -activating phorbol ester . 
The results argue against a loss-of-function signaling defect as the sole basis for clonal anergy induction and document the presence of a <START:ggp> dominant-acting repressor molecule <END> that inhibits signal transduction to the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> within viable <START:ana> anergic T cells <END> . 
Comparison of HTLV-I basal transcription and expression of <START:ggp> CREB/ATF-1/CREM family members <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> and <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
HTLV-I is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and is associated with tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-I-associated myelopathy . 
Following integration into the host cell genome , HTLV-I replication is regulated by both host and viral mechanisms that control transcription . 
Low levels of viral transcription ( basal transcription ) occur before expression of the <START:ggp> virally encoded Tax protein <END> ( <START:ggp> Tax <END> -mediated transcription ) . 
Members of the <START:ggp> cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) response element binding ( CREB ) /activating transcription factor 1 ( ATF-1 ) family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> bind three <START:ggp> 21-bp repeats <END> ( <START:ggp> Tax-responsive element-1 <END> , or <START:ggp> TRE-1 <END> ) within the <START:ggp> viral promoter <END> and are important for basal and Tax-mediated transcription . 
Using mitogen stimulated and quiescent <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) and <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , we compared differences in basal transcription and amounts and binding of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> with <START:ggp> TRE-1 <END> . 
We demonstrate that amounts of transcriptionally active <START:ggp> phosphorylated CREB protein <END> ( <START:ggp> P-CREB <END> ) differ between activated <START:ana> PBMC <END> and <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
Following stimulation , <START:ggp> P-CREB <END> levels remain elevated in <START:ana> PBMC <END> for up to 24 hours whereas CREB is dephosphorylated in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> within 4 hours following stimulation . 
The differences in <START:ggp> P-CREB <END> levels between <START:ana> PBMC <END> and <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> were directly correlated with basal transcription of HTLV-I in the two cell types . 
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we determined that the pattern of band migration differed between the two cell types . 
These data demonstrate that <START:ana> PBMC <END> differentially regulate basal HTLV-I transcription compared with <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> , and this differential regulation is due , in part to differential phosphorylation and binding of <START:ggp> CREB/ATF-1 <END> to <START:ggp> TRE-1 <END> in the HTLV-I promoter . 
We demonstrate the utility of using primary lymphocyte models to study HTLV-I transcription in the context of cell signaling and suggest that activated <START:ana> PBMC <END> maintain elevated levels of <START:ggp> P-CREB <END> , which promote basal HTLV-I transcription and enhance viral persistence in vivo . 
Anoxia/reoxygenation-induced tolerance with respect to polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesion to <START:ana> cultured endothelial cells <END> . 
A <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> -mediated phenomenon . 
Exposing <START:ana> human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> HUVECs <END> ) to anoxia/reoxygenation ( A/R ) results in an increase in polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( <START:ana> PMN <END> ) adhesion to <START:ana> HUVECs <END> . 
This A/R-induced hyperadhesion is completely prevented by a previous ( 24 hours earlier ) exposure of <START:ana> HUVECs <END> to A/R . 
This phenomenon has been termed `` A/R tolerance. '' 
Exposing <START:ana> HUVECs <END> to A/R induces an increase in <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) in HUVEC nuclei within 4 hours . 
Interfering with either <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation ( <START:ggp> proteasome <END> inhibitor ) or translocation ( double-stranded oligonucleotides containing <START:ggp> NF-kappaB binding sequence <END> ) prevents the development of A/R tolerance ( ie , the increase in A/R-induced PMN adhesion to <START:ana> HUVECs <END> is the same after the first and second A/R challenges ) . 
NO production by <START:ana> HUVECs <END> is increased after the second A/R challenge , but not after the first A/R challenge . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> NO synthase <END> ( <START:ggp> NOS <END> ) during the second A/R challenge prevents the development of A/R tolerance with respect to PMN adhesion . 
However , while <START:ana> HUVECs <END> contained endothelial <START:ggp> NOS protein <END> , no inducible <START:ggp> NOS <END> was detected in either tolerant or <START:ana> nontolerant cells <END> . 
Further studies indicated that inhibition of <START:ggp> GTP-cyclohydrolase I <END> ( an enzyme involved in de novo synthesis of an important cofactor for <START:ggp> NOS <END> activity , tetrahydrobiopterin ) prevented the generation of NO in <START:ana> A/R-tolerant cells <END> . 
Extracellular generation of NO ( NO donor ) did not effect the hyperadhesion response induced by the initial A/R challenge . 
A/R also induced an oxidant stress in naive <START:ana> HUVECs <END> , but not in <START:ana> A/R-tolerant HUVECs <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> NOS <END> during the second A/R insult results in the generation of an oxidant stress similar to that observed after the first A/R challenge . 
Taken together , the findings of the present study are consistent with a role for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in the development of A/R tolerance ( with respect to <START:ana> PMN <END> adhesion ) , perhaps by transcriptional regulation of <START:ggp> GTP-cyclohydrolase <END> . 
The increased NO production during the second A/R insult reduces PMN adhesion most likely by reducing the intracellular oxidant stress induced by A/R . 
Mildly oxidized <START:ggp> low-density lipoproteins <END> decrease early production of <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> and <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> binding to DNA in <START:ana> activated T-lymphocytes <END> . 
Activated T-lymphocytes are found early in atherosclerosis lesions , but little is known about their role . 
Oxidized <START:ggp> low-density lipoproteins <END> ( <START:ggp> oxLDLs <END> ) are considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the lesions , and we have previously demonstrated that <START:ggp> oxLDLs <END> inhibit not only <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2-receptor <END> expression on the surface of in vitro-activated T-lymphocytes but also their proliferation . 
We have now investigated the effect of <START:ggp> oxLDLs <END> on blast differentiation , on <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> synthesis and on the activation of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) system in activated lymphocytes . 
Mildly <START:ggp> oxLDLs <END> ( 50 and 100 microgram/ml ) decreased the number of <START:ana> lymphoblasts <END> and the level of IL-2 concentration in the culture supernatants after activation of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> by <START:ggp> phytohaemagglutinin <END> and PMA+ionomycin . 
The inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production was observed in the <START:ggp> CD3 <END> ( + ) T-lymphocyte cytoplasm as early as 4 h after activation by PMA+ionomycin . 
The study of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> showed that <START:ggp> oxLDLs <END> led to a decrease of <START:ggp> activation-induced p65/p50 <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> heterodimer binding to DNA , whereas the presence of the constitutive nuclear form of <START:ggp> p50 dimer <END> was unchanged . 
This was correlated with an unchanged level of the active form of the <START:ggp> cytosolic inhibitor protein <END> <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> . 
Taken together , these observations suggest that the immunosuppressive effect of <START:ggp> oxLDLs <END> might operate via a dysregulation of the <START:ana> T-lymphocyte <END> activation mechanisms . 
The <START:ggp> B29 ( immunoglobulin beta-chain ) gene <END> is a genetic target for <START:ggp> early B-cell factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> Early B-cell factor <END> ( <START:ggp> EBF <END> ) is a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> suggested as essential for early <START:ana> B-lymphocyte <END> development by findings in mice where the coding gene has been inactivated by homologous disruption . 
This makes the identification of genetic targets for this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> pertinent for the understanding of early B-cell development . 
The lack of <START:ana> B29 transcripts <END> , coding for the <START:ggp> beta subunit <END> of the B-cell receptor complex , in <START:ana> pro-B cells <END> from <START:ggp> EBF <END> -deficient mice suggested that B29 might be a genetic target for <START:ggp> EBF <END> . 
We here present data suggesting that <START:ggp> EBF <END> interacts with three independent sites within the <START:ggp> mouse B29 promoter <END> . 
Furthermore , ectopic expression of <START:ggp> EBF <END> in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> activated a <START:ggp> B29 promoter-controlled reporter construct <END> 13-fold and induced a low level of expression from the <START:ggp> endogenous B29 gene <END> . 
Finally , mutations in the <START:ggp> EBF <END> binding sites diminished <START:ggp> B29 promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> pre-B cells <END> while the same mutations did not have as striking an effect on the promoter function in <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> of later differentiation stages . 
These data suggest that the <START:ggp> B29 gene <END> is a genetic target for <START:ggp> EBF <END> in early B-cell development . 
Delta-opioid receptors expressed by <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> enhance <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion by increasing <START:ggp> AP-1 complexes <END> and activity of the <START:ggp> NF-AT/AP-1-binding promoter element <END> . 
Recent molecular evidence points to transient and/or stage-specific expression of <START:ggp> delta- and kappa-opioid receptors <END> by <START:ana> thymic and peripheral T lymphocytes <END> . 
Since medical treatments or stress commonly increase opioid levels , it is important to understand the mechanisms by which opioids affect T lymphocyte functions . 
We therefore created and studied a <START:ana> T cell line <END> expressing the <START:ggp> cloned delta-opioid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> DOR1 <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> DOR1 <END> ligation by a specific <START:ggp> DOR1 <END> agonist , deltorphin , augmented <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion by synergizing with signals from <START:ggp> TCR-CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> . 
Reporter gene constructs were used to map this effect of deltorphin to the <START:ggp> AP-1- and NF-AT/AP-1-binding sites <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> DOR1 <END> signaling increased [ Ca2+ ] i , deltorphin enhanced transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> NF-AT/AP-1-binding site <END> via a mechanism independent of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> and distinct from the effects of elevated [ Ca2+ ] i . 
Deltorphin also increased accumulation of <START:ggp> AP-1 transcription factor complexes <END> , suggesting that <START:ggp> DOR1 <END> augments <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion by increasing the <START:ggp> AP-1 component <END> of the <START:ggp> NF-AT/AP-1 transcription factor <END> . 
These results advance the molecular understanding of opioid effects on <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , and in addition , demonstrate regulation of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> synthesis and secretion by the novel mechanism of receptor-mediated <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> induction . 
Induction of <START:ggp> interleukin-12 <END> <START:ana> p40 transcript <END> by <START:ggp> CD40 <END> ligation via activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-12 <END> is produced in response to infection with bacteria or parasites or to bacterial constituents such as LPS in <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> and <START:ana> dendritic cells <END> , and also generated by the interaction between <START:ana> activated T cells <END> and <START:ana> antigen-presenting cells <END> via <START:ggp> CD40-CD40 ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> CD40L <END> ) . 
So far , transcriptional analyses of <START:ggp> p40 <END> have been carried out only using bacterial constituents such as LPS as stimuli . 
In the present study , we have characterized the transcriptional induction of <START:ggp> p40 <END> by <START:ggp> CD40 <END> ligation in a <START:ana> human B lymphoblastoid cell line <END> , <START:ana> Daudi <END> , and a <START:ana> human acute monocytic leukemia cell line <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 <END> . 
These cells , stimulated by an agonistic monoclonal antibody against <START:ggp> CD40 <END> or by transfection with a <START:ggp> CD40L expression vector <END> , secreted <START:ggp> p40 <END> and showed enhanced <START:ana> p40 mRNA <END> expression . 
Sequence analysis of the <START:ggp> p40 promoter region <END> identified two <START:ggp> potential nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB binding sites <END> conserved between mouse and human . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the potential <START:ggp> NF-kappaB binding sequence <END> which is located around <START:ggp> 120 bp upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> in <START:ggp> murine and human p40 genes <END> formed an <START:ggp> NF-kappaB complex <END> with nuclear extract from <START:ana> Daudi cells <END> stimulated by <START:ggp> CD40 <END> ligation . 
Moreover , transfection of <START:ana> Daudi cells <END> with the polymerized <START:ggp> NF-kappaB binding sequence <END> ligated to a <START:ggp> thymidine kinase/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmid <END> greatly induced <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity , but transfection with the <START:ggp> polymerized mutated NF-kappaB binding sequence <END> did not . 
These results suggest that the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB binding site <END> located around 120 bp upstream of the <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> in <START:ggp> murine and human p40 promoter regions <END> could be important for the <START:ggp> p40 <END> induction by <START:ggp> CD40 <END> ligation via activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
High frequency of germ-line <START:ggp> BRCA2 <END> mutations among Hungarian male breast cancer patients without family history . 
To determine the contribution of <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> and <START:ggp> BRCA2 <END> mutations to the pathogenesis of male breast cancer in Hungary , the country with the highest male breast cancer mortality rates in continental Europe , a series of 18 male breast cancer patients and three patients with gynecomastia was analyzed for germ-line mutations in both <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> and <START:ggp> BRCA2 <END> . 
Although no germ-line <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> mutation was observed , 6 of the 18 male breast cancer cases ( 33 % ) carried truncating mutations in the <START:ggp> BRCA2 <END> gene . 
Unexpectedly , none of them reported a family history for breast/ovarian cancer . 
Four of six truncating mutations were novel , and two mutations were recurrent . 
Four patients ( 22 % ) had a family history of breast/ovarian cancer in at least one first- or second-degree relative ; however , no <START:ggp> BRCA2 <END> mutation was identified among them . 
No mutation was identified in either of the genes in the gynecomastias . 
These results provide evidence for a strong genetic component of male breast cancer in Hungary . 
T-cell expression of the <START:ggp> human GATA-3 gene <END> is regulated by a <START:ggp> non-lineage-specific silencer <END> . 
The <START:ggp> GATA-3 transcription factor <END> is required for development of the <START:ana> T-cell lineage <END> and <START:ggp> Th2 cytokine gene <END> expression in <START:ana> CD4 T-cells <END> . 
We have mapped the <START:ggp> DNase-I-hypersensitive ( HS ) regions <END> of the <START:ggp> human GATA-3 gene <END> in <START:ana> T-cells <END> and <START:ana> non-T-cells <END> and studied their transcriptional activities . 
<START:ggp> HS I-III <END> , located 5 ' from the <START:ggp> transcriptional initiation site <END> , were found in <START:ana> hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells <END> , whereas <START:ggp> HS IV-VII <END> , located 3 ' from the <START:ggp> transcriptional start site <END> , were exclusively observed in <START:ana> T-cells <END> . 
Among these <START:ggp> hypersensitive sites <END> , two <START:ggp> transcriptional control elements <END> were found , one in the <START:ggp> first intron <END> of the <START:ggp> GATA-3 gene <END> and the other <START:ggp> between 8.3 and 5.9 kilobases <END> 5 ' from the <START:ggp> GATA-3 transcriptional initiation site <END> . 
The <START:ggp> first intron <END> acted as a strong transcriptional activator in a position-dependent manner and with no cell-type specificity . 
The <START:ggp> upstream regulatory element <END> could confer T-cell specificity to the <START:ggp> GATA-3 promoter <END> activity , and analysis of this region revealed a <START:ggp> 707-base pair silencer <END> that drastically inhibited <START:ggp> GATA-3 promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> non-T-cells <END> . 
Two CAGGTG E-boxes , located at the <START:ggp> 5'- and 3'-ends <END> of the silencer , were necessary for this silencer activity . 
The <START:ggp> 3'-CAGGTG E-box <END> could bind <START:ggp> USF proteins <END> , the <START:ggp> ubiquitous repressor <END> <START:ggp> ZEB <END> , or the <START:ggp> basic helix-loop-helix proteins <END> <START:ggp> E2A <END> and <START:ggp> HEB <END> , and we showed that a competition between <START:ggp> ZEB <END> and <START:ggp> E2A/HEB proteins <END> is involved in the silencer activity . 
Reactive oxygen intermediate-dependent <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation by <START:ggp> interleukin-1beta <END> requires <START:ggp> 5-lipoxygenase <END> or NADPH oxidase activity . 
We previously reported that the role of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) in <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation by <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> was cell specific . 
However , the sources for ROIs in various cell types are yet to be determined and might include <START:ggp> 5-lipoxygenase <END> ( <START:ggp> 5-LOX <END> ) and NADPH oxidase . 
<START:ggp> 5-LOX <END> and <START:ggp> 5-LOX activating protein <END> ( <START:ggp> FLAP <END> ) are coexpressed in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> but not in <START:ana> monocytic or epithelial cells <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> with <START:ggp> interleukin-1beta <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> ) led to ROI production and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation , which could both be blocked by antioxidants or <START:ggp> FLAP <END> inhibitors , confirming that <START:ggp> 5-LOX <END> was the source of ROIs and was required for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in these cells . 
<START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> stimulation of <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> did not generate any ROIs and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> induction was not influenced by <START:ggp> 5-LOX <END> inhibitors . 
However , reintroduction of a functional <START:ggp> 5-LOX <END> system in these cells allowed ROI production and <START:ggp> 5-LOX <END> -dependent <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
In <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> treatment led to a production of ROIs which is independent of the <START:ggp> 5-LOX enzyme <END> but requires the NADPH oxidase activity . 
This pathway involves the <START:ggp> Rac1 <END> and <START:ggp> Cdc42 <END> <START:ggp> GTPases <END> , two enzymes which are not required for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation by <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> in <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> . 
In conclusion , three different cell-specific pathways lead to <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation by <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> : a pathway dependent on ROI production by <START:ggp> 5-LOX <END> in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> , an ROI- and <START:ggp> 5-LOX <END> -independent pathway in <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> , and a pathway requiring ROI production by <START:ggp> NADPH oxidase <END> in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
Cutting edge : dominant effect of <START:ggp> Ile50Val variant <END> of the <START:ggp> human IL-4 receptor alpha-chain <END> in <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis . 
Two variants of the <START:ggp> IL-4R alpha-chain ( IL-4Ralpha ) gene <END> have been recently identified in association with different atopic disorders . 
To clarify the etiological relationship between the two variants , we analyzed responsiveness to <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> of transfectants with four kinds of <START:ggp> IL-4Ralpha <END> carrying either Val or Ile at <START:ggp> 50 <END> and either Gln or Arg at <START:ggp> 551 <END> . 
The substitution of Ile for Val augmented <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> activation , proliferation , and transcription activity of the <START:ggp> Iepsilon promoter <END> by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , whereas that of Arg for Gln did not change these <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> signals . 
Arg551 was not associated with atopic asthma in the Japanese population . 
<START:ggp> CD23 <END> expression and <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> were augmented in <START:ana> Ile50-bearing PBMC <END> , compared with those bearing Val50 . 
Taken together , substitution of Arg551 does not enhance the <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> signal for generation of germline epsilon transcript , whereas the substitution of Ile50 contributes to enhancement of <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis . 
A novel <START:ana> growth-factor-dependent myeloid cell line <END> derived from <START:ana> mouse bone marrow cells <END> contains progenitors endowed with high proliferative potential . 
Constitutive expression of <START:ggp> human colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> CSF-1R <END> ) confers long-lasting <START:ggp> CSF-1 <END> -dependent proliferation to <START:ana> mouse myeloid cell lines <END> . 
We developed mice transgenic for human <START:ggp> CSF-1R <END> because mouse <START:ggp> CSF-1 <END> can not activate human <START:ggp> CSF-1R <END> . 
Then <START:ana> bone marrow cells <END> from transgenic mice were plated onto MS-5 stromal cells expressing the <START:ggp> membrane form <END> of <START:ggp> human CSF-1 <END> ( <START:ana> 2M-1 cells <END> ) in order to combine the hematopoietic supporting properties of <START:ana> stromal cells <END> and the proliferative effects of <START:ggp> CSF-1 <END> . 
Thus , we were able to derive a <START:ana> hematopoietic cell line <END> , called <START:ana> 47.10 <END> , that grew indefinitely under these conditions , whereas no cell line could be developed from nontransgenic mice . 
Proliferation of <START:ana> 47.10 cells <END> is severely affected by neutralizing <START:ggp> anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibodies <END> . 
Morphologic and cytofluorometry analysis established that most <START:ana> 47.10 cells <END> are <START:ana> immature myelomonocytic cells <END> . 
Consistent with this phenotype , the <START:ggp> myeloid transcription factor PU.1 <END> , but not the <START:ggp> erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 <END> , is expressed in <START:ana> 47.10 cells <END> . 
A few <START:ana> 47.10 cells <END> ( 3-5 % ) do not express lineage specific markers ; they differentiate spontaneously to <START:ana> lineage-positive cells <END> after replating on <START:ana> 2M-1 cells <END> . 
In agar cultures , <START:ana> 47.10 cells <END> form 7- and 14-day colonies in response to a cocktail of <START:ggp> granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( 2.5 ng/mL ) , <START:ggp> interleukin-3 <END> ( 1 ng/mL ) , and mouse <START:ggp> CSF-1 <END> ( 10 ng/mL ) . 
Under these conditions , about 0.5 % of <START:ana> 47.10 cells <END> formed large 14-day colonies ( > 1 mm ) composed of <START:ana> mature monocytes <END> and <START:ana> granulocytes <END> , reflecting the presence of progenitors endowed with high proliferative potential ( <START:ana> HPP-47.10 cells <END> ) . 
In conclusion , we have characterized a novel <START:ana> continuous myeloid cell line <END> presenting a hierarchical structure similar to that of the <START:ana> bone marrow progenitor cell compartment <END> . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> expression by the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> JunB <END> during T helper cell differentiation . 
The molecular basis for restricted <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression by <START:ana> T helper 1 ( Th1 ) and T helper 2 ( Th2 ) cells <END> is unclear . 
Previous studies found that <START:ggp> P1 <END> , an element of the <START:ggp> interleukin 4 ( IL-4 ) promoter <END> that binds AP-1 , is important for Th2-restricted <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> expression . 
Here we show that <START:ggp> JunB <END> , but not the other <START:ggp> Jun family members <END> , was selectively induced in <START:ana> Th2 cells <END> and not in <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> during differentiation . 
<START:ggp> JunB <END> has previously been considered to be a negative regulator of transcription . 
However , we show that <START:ggp> JunB <END> binds directly to the <START:ggp> P1 site <END> and synergizes with <START:ggp> c-Maf <END> to activate an <START:ggp> IL-4 luciferase reporter gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> JunB <END> -control of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> expression is mediated by the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> JunB <END> at Thr102 and- 104 by <START:ggp> JNK MAP kinase <END> . 
The synergy between <START:ggp> c-Maf <END> and <START:ggp> JunB <END> can be attributed to cooperative DNA binding , which is facilitated by <START:ggp> JunB <END> phosphorylation . 
In transgenic mice , elevated <START:ggp> JunB <END> levels caused increased expression of several <START:ggp> Th2 cytokines <END> in developing <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> JunB <END> also upregulated <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> expression in response to immunization . 
Thus , the early increase of <START:ggp> JunB <END> protein in <START:ana> Th2 cells <END> can provide the specificity for <START:ggp> c-Maf <END> in <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> expression during T cell development and directs thereby Th2 differentiation . 
<START:ggp> Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 tax protein <END> abrogates <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> dependence in a <START:ana> mouse T-cell line <END> . 
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> , the <START:ggp> viral protein <END> , is thought to be crucial in the development of the disease , since it transforms <START:ana> healthy T cells <END> in vitro and induces tumors in transgenic animals . 
We examined the effect of <START:ggp> Tax <END> activity on the growth of the <START:ana> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) -dependent T-cell line <END> <START:ana> CTLL-2 <END> . 
Stable expression of <START:ggp> Tax <END> in <START:ana> CTLL-2 <END> transformed cell growth from being <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> dependent to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> independent . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> stimulated transcription through <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and the <START:ggp> cyclic AMP-responsive element-like sequence <END> in the HTLV-1 promoter . 
The finding of <START:ggp> Tax <END> mutants segregating these two pathways suggested that the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> pathway was essential for <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -independent growth of <START:ana> CTLL-2 cells <END> while the <START:ggp> CRE <END> pathway was unnecessary . 
However , both pathways were necessary for another transformation-related activity ( colony formation in soft agar ) of <START:ggp> CTLL-2/Tax <END> . 
Our results show that <START:ggp> Tax <END> has at least two distinct activities on <START:ana> T cells <END> , and suggest that <START:ggp> Tax <END> plays a crucial role in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -independent T-cell transformation induced by HTLV-1 , in addition to its well-known <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -dependent cell transformation . 
Accessing Epstein-Barr virus-specific T-cell memory with <START:ana> peptide-loaded dendritic cells <END> . 
The conventional means of studying Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -induced <START:ana> cytotoxic T-lymphocyte <END> ( CTL ) memory , by in vitro stimulation with the latently infected autologous <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cell line <END> ( <START:ana> LCL <END> ) , has important limitations . 
First , it gives no information on memory to <START:ggp> lytic cycle antigens <END> ; second , it preferentially amplifies the dominant components of latent antigen-specific memory at the expense of key subdominant reactivities . 
Here we describe an alternative approach , based on in vitro stimulation with <START:ana> epitope peptide-loaded dendritic cells <END> ( <START:ana> DCs <END> ) , which allows one to probe the CTL repertoire for any individual reactivity of choice ; this method proved significantly more efficient than stimulation with peptide alone . 
Using this approach we first show that reactivities to the immunodominant and subdominant <START:ggp> lytic cycle epitopes <END> identified by <START:ana> T cells <END> during primary EBV infection are regularly detectable in the CTL memory of virus carriers ; this implies that in such carriers chronic virus replication remains under direct T-cell control . 
We further show that subdominant latent cycle reactivities to epitopes in the <START:ggp> latent membrane protein LMP2 <END> , though rarely undetectable in <START:ana> LCL <END> -stimulated populations , can be reactivated by DC stimulation and selectively expanded as polyclonal <START:ana> CTL lines <END> ; the adoptive transfer of such preparations may be of value in targeting certain EBV-positive malignancies . 
Regulation of the <START:ggp> human interleukin-2 gene <END> by the <START:ggp> alpha and beta isoforms <END> of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
The immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids are largely due to transcriptional inhibition of <START:ggp> immunologically relevant genes <END> , such as the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene <END> . 
These effects are mediated by the intracellular <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) . 
In humans , alternative splicing of the <START:ana> GR precursor mRNA <END> gives rise to two receptor isoforms , termed <START:ggp> GRalpha <END> and <START:ggp> GRbeta <END> . 
We previously demonstrated that <START:ggp> GRbeta <END> could antagonize <START:ggp> GRalpha <END> -mediated transactivation of a <START:ggp> glucocorticoid-responsive element ( GRE ) -driven reporter gene <END> in <START:ana> COS-7 cells <END> . 
The present study was designed to analyze the roles of the two <START:ggp> GR isoforms <END> on glucocorticoid-mediated transrepression of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> . 
Using a recently developed transfection technique , we demonstrate that in <START:ana> primary human lymphocytes <END> , stimulation of a <START:ggp> 548 bp IL-2 promoter-luciferase reporter construct <END> by phorbol ester and calcium ionophore is reversed by dexamethasone to a similar extent as in Jurkat T lymphoma cells transfected with a <START:ggp> GRalpha <END> expression vector . 
Transfection of a <START:ggp> GRbeta <END> expression vector alone did not result in <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> repression in response to glucocorticoids . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> GRbeta <END> did not antagonize the repressive effects of <START:ggp> GRalpha <END> on <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activity . 
Surprisingly , overexpression of <START:ggp> GRbeta <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> did not cause significant inhibition of <START:ggp> GRalpha <END> -induced transactivation of a <START:ggp> GRE-dependent luciferase reporter gene <END> either . 
We conclude that the transrepressive effect of glucocorticoids on <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> transcription is exclusively mediated by <START:ggp> GRalpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> GRbeta <END> can neither antagonize <START:ggp> GRalpha <END> -mediated transactivation nor transrepression in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , indicating a cell type-specific pattern of <START:ggp> GRbeta <END> -mediated antiglucocorticoid activity . 
Extinction of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin gene <END> expression in <START:ana> B cells <END> upon fusion with <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> is preceded by rapid nuclear depletion of <START:ggp> essential transcription factors <END> and is accompanied by widespread inactivation of genes expressed in a B cell-specific manner . 
When <START:ana> immunoglobulin ( Ig ) expressing B cells <END> are fused with <START:ana> non-B cells <END> , Ig expression is rapidly suppressed at the level of transcription , a phenomenon termed extinction . 
Here we demonstrate that fusion of <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> with either <START:ana> diploid or tetraploid B cells <END> ( <START:ana> Daudi <END> ) results in widespread extinction of several other <START:ggp> B cell-encoded genes <END> that are expressed in a B cell-specific manner . 
In contrast , expression of <START:ggp> B cell-expressed genes <END> that are not dependent on cell-specific controls is unaffected . 
We show that the molecular mechanism ( s ) underlying <START:ggp> Ig gene <END> extinction can be explained , at least in part , by a lack of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that are essential for <START:ggp> Ig gene <END> transcription . 
These <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are either not produced due to block of transcription of their respective genes ( <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , <START:ggp> OBF-1 <END> , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> ) , or are rendered inactive posttranslationally ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> E47 <END> ) . 
By isolating <START:ana> Daudi x HeLa heterokaryons <END> a few hours after fusion , we have studied the initial fate of two <START:ggp> B cell-specific transcription factors <END> involved in <START:ggp> Ig gene <END> transcription , <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
This report provides the first demonstration that upon fusion with <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , the nuclear contents of <START:ggp> B cell-expressed transcription factors <END> are depleted within a few hours with kinetics that are as fast or faster than that of <START:ggp> Ig gene <END> extinction . 
Thus , the extinguishing mechanism is effective very early after fusion . 
We suggest that extinction of <START:ggp> Ig genes <END> is part of a global mechanism that suppresses the differentiation program foreign to the <START:ana> HeLa phenotype <END> . 
Evidence for suppressed activity of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> at its <START:ggp> proximal binding element <END> <START:ggp> P0 <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter <END> associated with enhanced <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> transcription in <START:ana> T cells <END> of atopic patients . 
Allergen-specific <START:ana> T cells <END> in atopic patients are polarized <START:ana> IL-4-producing Th2 cells <END> , promoting <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis by <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
The molecular basis for increased <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> expression in atopy is not fully understood . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> regulation in general involves the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , of which <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> NFAT2 <END> are most prominent in <START:ana> peripheral T cells <END> . 
Recently , a unique inhibitory role of <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> in <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> control was shown in the mouse . 
In a series of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with protein extracts of <START:ana> highly polarized Th2 clones <END> from atopics and <START:ana> Th1 clones <END> from controls we compared DNA-binding activities at the two <START:ggp> NFAT-binding elements <END> <START:ggp> P0 <END> and <START:ggp> P1 <END> of the crucial proximal human <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter <END> . 
At the most proximal <START:ggp> P0 <END> site , NFAT-containing complexes devoid of <START:ggp> NFAT2 <END> were readily inducible in the <START:ana> Th1 clones <END> , but hardly or not in the <START:ana> Th2 clones <END> . 
In contrast , both in <START:ana> Th1 and Th2 clones <END> NFAT-containing complexes were strongly inducible at the <START:ggp> P1 site <END> , consisting of <START:ggp> NFAT2 <END> and a <START:ggp> P0 <END> -compatible <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activity , without apparent differences between <START:ana> Th1 and Th2 clones <END> . 
Like in <START:ana> Th2 clones <END> , suppressed NFAT- <START:ggp> P0 <END> complex formation was observed also at the polyclonal level in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) of three of five severe atopic dermatitis patients with strongly elevated serum <START:ggp> IgE <END> levels , but not in control <START:ana> PBMC <END> . 
These findings suggest that high-level <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> production in <START:ana> atopic Th2 cells <END> is associated with selective reduction of suppressive <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> activity at the <START:ggp> IL-4 P0 element <END> and that some patients with this multifactorial disease may have a putative systemic disorder at this level . 
Differential expression and phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CTCF <END> , a c-myc transcriptional regulator , during differentiation of human myeloid cells . 
<START:ggp> CTCF <END> is a transcriptional repressor of the c-myc gene . 
Although <START:ggp> CTCF <END> has been characterized in some detail , there is very little information about the regulation of <START:ggp> CTCF <END> activity . 
Therefore we investigated <START:ggp> CTCF <END> expression and phosphorylation during induced differentiation of <START:ana> human myeloid leukemia cells <END> . 
We found that : ( i ) both <START:ana> CTCF mRNA <END> and protein are down-regulated during terminal differentiation in most cell lines tested ; ( ii ) <START:ggp> CTCF <END> down-regulation is retarded and less pronounced than that of <START:ggp> c-myc <END> ; ( iii ) <START:ggp> CTCF protein <END> is differentially phosphorylated and the phosphorylation profiles depend on the differentiation pathway . 
We concluded that <START:ggp> CTCF <END> expression and activity is controlled at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels . 
Glucocorticoid resistance in the squirrel monkey is associated with overexpression of the <START:ggp> immunophilin FKBP51 <END> . 
Squirrel monkeys are neotropical primates that have high circulating cortisol to compensate for expression of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GRs <END> ) with reduced affinity . 
The low binding affinity of squirrel monkey <START:ggp> GR <END> does not result from substitutions in the receptor , because <START:ggp> squirrel monkey GR <END> expressed in vitro exhibits high affinity . 
Rather , squirrel monkeys express a soluble factor that , in mixing studies of cytosol from <START:ana> squirrel monkey lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> SML <END> ) and mouse L929 cells , reduced GR binding affinity by 11-fold . 
In an effort to identify this factor , the cellular levels of components of the <START:ggp> GR heterocomplex <END> in <START:ana> SML <END> and <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> HL <END> ) were compared . 
The <START:ggp> immunophilin FKBP51 <END> was 13-fold higher in <START:ana> SML <END> than in HL cytosol ; <START:ggp> FKBP52 <END> in <START:ana> SML <END> was 42 % of that in HL cytosol . 
A role for changes in <START:ggp> immunophilins <END> , causing glucocorticoid resistance in neotropical primates , is supported by the following : the changes in <START:ggp> FKBP51 <END> and <START:ggp> FKBP52 <END> were observed in cells from other neotropical primates with glucocorticoid resistance ; the elevated level of <START:ggp> FKBP51 <END> was reflected in an abundance of <START:ggp> FKBP51 <END> in <START:ggp> heat shock protein 90 complexes <END> in <START:ana> SML <END> ; when cytosols of <START:ana> SML <END> and <START:ana> L929 cells <END> were mixed , the decrease in GR binding was associated with incorporation of <START:ggp> FKBP51 <END> into <START:ggp> GR heterocomplexes <END> ; the effect of <START:ana> SML <END> cytosol on GR binding was reproduced with cytosol from <START:ana> COS cells <END> expressing squirrel monkey <START:ggp> FKBP51 <END> ; and both the effect of <START:ana> SML <END> cytosol on GR binding and the incorporation of <START:ggp> FKBP51 <END> into <START:ggp> GR heterocomplexes <END> were blocked by FK506 . 
Regulation of GR binding by <START:ggp> FKBP51 <END> represents a previously unrecognized mechanism for regulating glucocorticoid sensitivity . 
High-level replication of human immunodeficiency virus in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> requires <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation through interaction with <START:ana> thymic epithelial cells <END> . 
We have previously demonstrated that interaction of infected <START:ana> thymocytes <END> with autologous <START:ana> thymic epithelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> TEC <END> ) is a prerequisite for a high level of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> ( M.Rothe , L.Chene , M.Nugeyre , F.Barre-Sinoussi , and N.Israel , J.Virol.72 : 5852-5861 , 1998 ) . 
We report here that this activation of HIV replication takes place at the transcriptional level through activation of the <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappaB <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
We first demonstrate that an HIV-1 provirus ( SF-2 strain ) very effectively replicates in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> cocultured with <START:ana> TEC <END> whereas this provirus , with <START:ggp> kappaB sites <END> deleted , fails to replicate . 
We provide evidence that several <START:ggp> NF-kappaB complexes <END> are constitutively found in the nuclei of <START:ana> thymocytes <END> either freshly isolated from the thymus or maintained in coculture with autologous or heterologous <START:ana> TEC <END> . 
The prevalent complex is the <START:ggp> heterodimer p50-p65 <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity is tightly correlated with the transcriptional activity of a <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) of HIV-1 transfected in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> . 
The cotransfection of this <START:ggp> LTR <END> with a mutated <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha molecule <END> formally demonstrates that <START:ggp> LTR <END> transactivation is regulated by members of the <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappaB family <END> in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> . 
We also showed that <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) and to a lesser extent <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> ) , secreted within the coculture , induce <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity and a correlative <START:ggp> LTR <END> transactivation . 
However <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> , a crucial factor for thymopoiesis that is secreted mainly by <START:ana> TEC <END> , is a necessary cofactor for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation elicited by <START:ggp> TNF <END> or <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> . 
Together , these data indicate that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation , required for a high level of HIV replication in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> , is regulated in a specific manner in the thymic microenvironment which provides the necessary cytokines : <START:ggp> TNF <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> . 
Imbalanced expression of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor isoforms <END> in <START:ana> cultured lymphocytes <END> from a patient with systemic glucocorticoid resistance and chronic lymphocytic leukemia . 
The <START:ggp> human glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) is expressed as two alternatively spliced isoforms , <START:ggp> GRalpha <END> and <START:ggp> GRbeta <END> . 
Whereas <START:ggp> GRalpha <END> is a hormone-activated <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> GRbeta <END> does not bind glucocorticoids ( GCs ) , is transcriptionally inactive , and is a potential inhibitor of activated <START:ggp> GRalpha <END> . 
Differential expression of <START:ggp> GR isoforms <END> may play a role in generalized or tissue-specific GC resistance . 
GCs induce apoptosis in <START:ana> neoplastic lymphoid cells <END> ; and , defective apoptosis is implicated in the genesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . 
We studied a patient with generalized GC resistance and CLL . 
GR number in the patient 's <START:ana> transformed lymphocytes <END> was approximately one half that of control cells with a approximately 10-fold reduction in binding affinity for dexamethasone . 
In vitro apoptosis induction in <START:ana> CLL cells <END> was delayed in response to GCs , but not to other apoptosis inducers . 
Sequencing of the <START:ggp> GR cDNA <END> and gene including the 2.3-kb coding region , the intron/exon junctions , the known <START:ggp> 5'-regulatory region <END> , and approximately 300 bp of the <START:ggp> 3'-region <END> revealed no alterations . 
Western blot with an N-terminal antibody showed normal levels of <START:ggp> immunoreactive GR <END> , but quantitative analysis with isoform-specific <START:ggp> C-terminal antibodies <END> revealed a markedly reduced <START:ggp> GRalpha <END> expression , and high <START:ggp> GRbeta <END> expression . 
These findings indicate that imbalanced expression of the <START:ggp> GR isoforms <END> may be a mechanism of GC resistance , and may have implications for tumorigenesis by enhancing cell survival .

Intranuclear targeted delivery of functional <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> by <START:ggp> 70 kDa heat shock protein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> 70 kDa heat shock protein <END> ( <START:ggp> Hsp70 <END> ) is a highly conserved , <START:ggp> ubiquitous protein <END> involved in <START:ggp> chaperoning proteins <END> to various cellular organelles . 
Here we show that when added exogenously to cells , <START:ggp> Hsp70 <END> is readily imported into both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in a cell-type-specific fashion . 
We exploited this ability of <START:ggp> Hsp70 <END> to deliver <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , a key transcriptional regulator of inflammatory responses . 
We demonstrate that a fusion protein composed of a C-terminal <START:ggp> Hsp70 <END> peptide and the <START:ggp> p50 subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> was directed into the nucleus of cells , could bind DNA specifically , and activated <START:ggp> Igkappa <END> expression and <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> production . 
We therefore propose that <START:ggp> Hsp70 <END> can be used as a vehicle for intracytoplasmic and intranuclear delivery of proteins or DNA to modulate gene expression and thereby control immune responses . 
Characterization of the <START:ggp> human elk-1 promoter <END> . 
Potential role of a <START:ggp> downstream intronic sequence <END> for <START:ggp> elk-1 gene <END> expression in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
To characterize the <START:ggp> human elk-1 promoter <END> , we mapped the <START:ggp> transcriptional start site <END> and isolated <START:ana> elk-1-specific genomic phage clones <END> that contained extensive <START:ggp> upstream and downstream sequences <END> . 
A <START:ggp> TATA-like motif <END> was identified immediately upstream of the <START:ggp> transcriptional start site <END> . 
Functional analyses of <START:ggp> DNA fragments <END> containing the <START:ggp> TATA element <END> and the identification of a <START:ggp> DNase I-hypersensitive chromatin site <END> ( <START:ggp> HS 1 <END> ) in close proximity to the <START:ggp> TATA box <END> suggest that the identified <START:ggp> TATA motif <END> is important for <START:ggp> elk-1 <END> transcription in vivo . 
Sequences upstream and downstream from the <START:ggp> TATA box <END> were found to contribute to <START:ggp> elk-1 <END> promoter activity . 
A second hypersensitive site ( HS 2 ) was identified within the first intron in pre-monocytic cells , which express Elk-1 only when differentiating to <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
In a variety of other cell types , which display a constitutive <START:ggp> Elk-1 <END> expression , HS 2 did not exist , suggesting that inducibility of <START:ggp> elk-1 <END> expression is associated with the presence of HS 2 . 
Egr-1 and the serum response factor were found to interact specifically with the <START:ggp> intronic sequence <END> at +265 and +448 , respectively . 
Because <START:ana> Egr-1 mRNA <END> and protein levels were observed to increase significantly before induction of <START:ggp> elk-1 <END> expression , we propose that <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> is important for the regulation of <START:ggp> elk-1 <END> transcription in differentiating <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Immunohistochemical study of <START:ggp> c-fos-positive lymphocytes <END> infiltrated into human squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck during radiation therapy and its clinical significance . 
<START:ggp> C-fos <END> has been reported to be one of the <START:ggp> immediate early genes <END> in signal transduction systems after many kinds of stresses , including ionizing radiation . 
Changes in <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression induced by radiation therapy in tumor tissues have not yet been reported . 
In this study , we have attempted to determine whether <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression is induced by radiotherapy in human squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and to establish a possible correlation between <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression and the therapeutic effects of radiation therapy . 
Twenty-seven patients with tumors of the oral cavity , oropharynx , and maxillary sinus were examined , all of which were confirmed as squamous cell carcinomas . 
After obtaining the patients ' informed consent , biopsies were performed before treatment and at doses of 4 , 10 , and 20 Gy of radiotherapy , and the specimens were preserved in liquid nitrogen for further examination . 
Serial sectioning of 6 micrometer was performed using a cryostat , and samples were immunohistochemically stained using the <START:ggp> streptoavidin <END> <START:ggp> -biotin peroxidase <END> method and a monoclonal antibody against c-fos . 
Three of the 27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma showed slight expression of c-fos in their tumor cells before and/or at 4 or 10 Gy of radiotherapy . 
The tumors showed high radiosensitivity . 
Concerning <START:ana> tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes <END> , the rate of moderate or remarkable grades of <START:ggp> c-fos-positive lymphocytes <END> before radiotherapy and at radiation doses of 4 , 10 , and 20 Gy was 8.0 , 29.2 , 4.8 , and 0 % , respectively . 
The relationship between the immunohistochemical findings and the antitumor effect at a radiation dose of 20 Gy was examined on the corresponding H & E-stained sections . 
In patients whose infiltration of <START:ggp> c-fos-positive lymphocytes <END> into tumor tissues were moderate or remarkable at 4 Gy of radiotherapy , the tumors responded significantly well to radiation therapy ( P < 0.025 , chi2 test ) , and the patients took a significantly favorable clinical course ( P < 0.05 , chi2 test ) . 
In a sample from one of the patients , <START:ggp> c-fos-positive lymphocytes <END> were identified as CD4 positive and CD8 negative . 
Therefore , the high radiosensitivity of squamous cell carcinomas in our samples could be explained by an overexpression of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> in the <START:ana> tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes <END> induced by small doses of radiation therapy , and these <START:ana> activated lymphocytes <END> exerted a cytotoxic effect against the <START:ana> cancer cells <END> . 
Paternal expression of <START:ggp> WT1 <END> in <START:ana> human fibroblasts <END> and <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Wilms ' tumor suppressor gene <END> ( <START:ggp> WT1 <END> ) was previously identified as being imprinted , with frequent maternal expression in human placentae and fetal brains . 
We examined the allele-specific expression of <START:ggp> WT1 <END> in cultured <START:ana> human fibroblasts <END> from 15 individuals . 
Seven of 15 <START:ana> fibroblast lines <END> were heterozygous for <START:ggp> polymorphic alleles <END> , and the expression patterns were variable , i.e. , equal , unequal or monoallelic paternal expression in three , two and two cases , respectively . 
Exclusive paternal expression of <START:ggp> WT1 <END> was also shown in <START:ana> non-cultured peripheral lymphocytes <END> from the latter two individuals . 
The allele-specific expression profiles of other <START:ggp> imprinted genes <END> , <START:ggp> IGF2 <END> and <START:ggp> H19 <END> , on <START:ggp> human chromosome 11 <END> were constant and consistent with those in other tissues . 
Our unexpected observations of paternal or biallelic expression of <START:ggp> WT1 <END> in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> and <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , together with the previous findings of maternal or biallelic expression in placentae and brains , suggest that the allele-specific regulatory system of <START:ggp> WT1 <END> is unique and may be controlled by a putative tissue- and individual-specific modifier . 
T cell reactivity to Sjogren 's syndrome related antigen <START:ggp> La ( SSB ) <END> . 
OBJECTIVE . 
Many patients with primary Sjogren 's syndrome ( SS ) make high titer <START:ggp> IgG autoantibodies <END> to the <START:ggp> La ( SSB ) <END> antigen , suggesting antigen specific T cell-B cell interactions . 
T cell responses to some nuclear antigens , particularly <START:ggp> U1RNP <END> , have been detected in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) and in healthy subjects . 
We investigated T cell reactivity to the <START:ggp> autoantigen SSB <END> in patients with SS and healthy controls . 
METHODS . 
Using the [ 3H ] thymidine proliferation assay , we determined reactivity to <START:ggp> purified recombinant SSB <END> ( <START:ggp> rSSB <END> ) in 20 patients with SS and 19 controls . 
Specificity was determined using tetanus toxoid , endotoxin , and 3 other <START:ggp> autoantigens <END> ( <START:ggp> PBC.M2 <END> , <START:ggp> Sc170 <END> , and <START:ggp> GAD <END> ) . 
Precursor frequency was calculated by limiting dilution analysis . 
HLA Class II dependency was investigated using <START:ggp> anti-Class II monoclonal antibodies <END> . 
HLA-DR typing was by polymerase chain reaction and sequence specific oligonucleotide typing . 
RESULTS . 
Six of 20 patients with SS and 10/19 controls proliferated to La ( <START:ggp> rSSB <END> ) . 
Precursor frequency of <START:ana> anti-SSB T cells <END> was 1 : 77 , 040 and 1 : 115 , 000 in 2 healthy subjects and 1 : 230 , 250 and 1 : 103 , 034 in two patients with SS . 
Anti- <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> abrogated proliferation to <START:ggp> SSB <END> and tetanus toxoid . 
Thirteen of 15 patients with SS and 4/17 controls were <START:ggp> HLA-DR3 <END> positive , with no apparent association of <START:ggp> HLA-DR3 <END> with <START:ggp> SSB <END> reactivity in controls . 
CONCLUSION . 
<START:ana> Anti-La ( SSB ) specific T cells <END> occur in a significant proportion of controls and in some patients with SS . 
The function of <START:ana> SSB T cells <END> in controls remains to be defined . 
They may represent <START:ana> immunoregulatory cells <END> , and further analysis of these cells , and a comparison to those found in patients with SS , may elucidate normal immunoregulation and the derangements that lead to Sjogren 's syndrome . 
Anti-rheumatic compound aurothioglucose inhibits <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> -induced HIV-1 replication in latently infected <START:ana> OM10.1 and Ach2 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> is a potent cellular activator of HIV-1 gene expression . 
Down-regulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation is known to inhibit HIV replication from the <START:ana> latently infected cells <END> . 
Gold compounds have been effectively used for many decades in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . 
We previously reported that gold compounds , especially aurothioglucose ( AuTG ) containing monovalent gold ion , inhibited the DNA-binding of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in vitro . 
In this report we have examined the efficacy of the gold compound AuTG as an inhibitor of HIV replication in latently infected <START:ana> OM10.1 and Ach2 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha <END> -induced HIV-1 replication in <START:ana> OM10.1 <END> or <START:ana> Ach2 cells <END> was significantly inhibited by non-cytotoxic doses of AuTG ( > 10 microM in OM10.1 cells and > 25 F.M in <START:ana> Ach2 cells <END> ) , while 25 microM of the <START:ggp> counter-anion thioglucose <END> ( <START:ggp> TG <END> ) or gold compound containing divalent gold ion , HAuCl3 , had no effect . 
The effect of AuTG on <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent gene expression was confirmed by a transient <START:ggp> CAT <END> assay . 
Specific staining as well as electron microscopic examinations revealed the accumulation of metal gold in the cells , supporting our previous hypothesis that gold ions could block <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -DNA binding by a redox mechanism . 
These observations indicate that the monovalent gold compound AuTG is a potentially useful drug for the treatment of patients infected with HIV . 
Clonality of <START:ana> isolated eosinophils <END> in the hypereosinophilic syndrome . 
The idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome ( IHES ) is a rare disorder characterized by unexplained , persistent eosinophilia associated with multiple organ dysfunction due to eosinophilic tissue infiltration . 
In the absence of karyotypic abnormalities , there is no specific test to detect clonal eosinophilia in IHES . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> X-chromosome <END> inactivation patterns can be used to determine whether proliferative disorders are clonal in origin . 
Methylation of <START:ggp> HpaII and Hha I sites <END> near the <START:ggp> polymorphic trinucleotide repeat <END> of the <START:ggp> human androgen receptor gene <END> ( <START:ggp> HUMARA <END> ) has been shown to correlate with X-inactivation . 
In this study , we have used the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) with nested primers to analyze X-inactivation patterns of the <START:ggp> HUMARA loci <END> in <START:ana> purified eosinophils <END> from female patients with eosinophilia . 
<START:ana> Peripheral blood eosinophils <END> were isolated by their autofluoresence using flow cytometric sorting . 
<START:ana> Eosinophils <END> purified from a female patient presenting with IHES were found to show a clonal pattern of X-inactivation . 
<START:ana> Eosinophil-depleted leukocytes <END> from this patient were polyclonal by <START:ggp> HUMARA <END> analysis , thus excluding skewedness of random X-inactivation . 
After corticosteroid suppression of her blood eosinophilia , a clonal population of <START:ana> eosinophils <END> could no longer be detected in <START:ana> purified eosinophils <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ana> eosinophils <END> purified from a patient with Churg-Strauss syndrome and from six patients with reactive eosinophilias attributed to allergy , parasitic infection , or drug reaction showed a polyclonal pattern of X-inactivation by <START:ggp> HUMARA <END> analysis . 
The finding of clonal eosinophilia in a patient presenting with IHES indicates that such patients may have , in reality , a low-grade clonal disorder that can be distinguished from reactive eosinophilias by <START:ggp> HUMARA <END> analysis . 
Further , the method described can be used to monitor disease progression . 
<START:ggp> GA-binding protein factors <END> , in concert with the <START:ggp> coactivator CREB binding protein/p300 <END> , control the induction of the <START:ggp> interleukin 16 promoter <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin 16 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-16 <END> ) is a <START:ggp> chemotactic cytokine <END> that binds to the <START:ggp> CD4 receptor <END> and affects the activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> and replication of HIV . 
It is expressed as a large <START:ggp> 67-kDa precursor protein <END> ( <START:ggp> pro-IL-16 <END> ) in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , <START:ana> macrophages <END> , and <START:ana> mast cells <END> , as well as in <START:ana> airway epithelial cells <END> from asthmatics after challenge with allergen . 
This <START:ggp> pro-IL-16 <END> is subsequently processed to the mature cytokine of <START:ggp> 13 kDa <END> . 
To study the expression of <START:ggp> IL-16 <END> at the transcriptional level , we cloned the <START:ggp> human chromosomal IL-16 gene <END> and analyzed its promoter . 
The <START:ggp> human IL-16 gene <END> consists of seven <START:ggp> exons <END> and six <START:ggp> introns <END> . 
The <START:ggp> 5 ' sequences <END> up to nucleotide -120 of the human and murine <START:ggp> IL-16 <END> genes share > 84 % sequence homology and <START:ggp> harbor promoter elements <END> for constitutive and inducible transcription in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Although both promoters lack any <START:ggp> TATA box <END> , they contain two <START:ggp> CAAT box-like motifs <END> and three <START:ggp> binding sites <END> of <START:ggp> GA-binding protein ( GABP ) transcription factors <END> . 
Two of these motifs are part of a highly conserved and inducible <START:ggp> dyad symmetry element <END> shown previously to control a remote <START:ggp> IL-2 enhancer <END> and the <START:ggp> CD18 promoter <END> . 
In concert with the <START:ggp> coactivator CREB binding protein/p300 <END> , which interacts with <START:ggp> GABPalpha <END> , the binding of <START:ggp> GABPalpha <END> and <START:ggp> -beta <END> to the <START:ggp> dyad symmetry element <END> controls the induction of <START:ggp> IL-16 promoter <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Supplementing the data on the processing of <START:ggp> pro-IL-16 <END> , our results indicate the complexity of <START:ggp> IL-16 <END> expression , which is tightly controlled at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Tuberculosis and chronic hepatitis B virus infection in Africans and variation in the <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor gene <END> . 
The active metabolite of vitamin D , 1 , 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 , is an important immunoregulatory hormone [ 1 ] . 
Its effects are exerted by interaction with the <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> , which is present on <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> activated T and B lymphocytes <END> . 
Variation in the <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor gene <END> was typed in 2015 subjects from large case-control studies of three major infectious diseases : tuberculosis , malaria , and hepatitis B virus . 
Homozygotes for a polymorphism at <START:ggp> codon 352 <END> ( genotype tt ) were significantly underrepresented among those with tuberculosis ( chi2=6.22 , 1 df , P=.01 ) and persistent hepatitis B infection ( chi2=6.25 , 1 df , P=.01 ) but not in subjects with clinical malaria compared with the other genotypes . 
Therefore , this genetic variant , which predisposes to low bone mineral density in many populations , may confer resistance to certain infectious diseases . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in vitro and in vivo : role of <START:ggp> 26S proteasome <END> . 
It is becoming increasingly apparent that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> plays a critical role in regulating the inflammatory response . 
Data obtained from studies in our laboratories demonstrate that the proteasome plays an important role in the inflammatory cascade by regulating the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Indeed , the availability of selective and orally active proteasome inhibitors should prove useful in delineating the roles of the proteasome and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in other pathophysiological conditions such as cancer and heart disease . 
Tissue factor expression of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> is suppressed by lysophosphatidylcholine . 
The expression of <START:ggp> tissue factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TF <END> ) , the principal initiator of coagulation , is increased during inflammation and atherosclerosis . 
Both conditions are promoted by lysophosphatidylcholine ( lysoPC ) . 
We observed in the present study that lysoPC ( 1 to 10 micromol/L ) dose-dependently reduced <START:ggp> TF <END> activity in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> , as elicited by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . 
Lysophosphatidylethanolamine ( lysoPE ) and other lysophospholipids did not affect LPS-induced TF activity of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
TF antigen expression as elicited by LPS was also lowered by lysoPC . 
Phospholipid analyses indicated a selective increase in the lysoPC content of the <START:ana> monocytes <END> after preincubation with the lysophospholipid . 
LysoPC inhibited the TF activity of <START:ana> Mono Mac-6 cells <END> to a similar extent as in the <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
LPS binding to plasma membrane receptors and internalization of LPS into <START:ana> monocytes <END> were not affected by lysoPC . 
In contrast , LPS-mediated nuclear binding of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB/Rel <END> to a <START:ggp> TF-specific kappaB site <END> was inhibited by lysoPC . 
Induction of <START:ana> TF mRNA <END> expression by LPS tended to be partially reduced by the lysophospholipid . 
Preincubation with lysoPC increased monocytic cAMP levels . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> adenylyl cyclase <END> by pretreatment with <START:ggp> 2'-deoxy-3'-adenosine monophosphate <END> partially reversed the inhibition of TF activity promoted by lysoPC . 
In conclusion , lysoPC markedly decreases LPS-mediated TF expression of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> , the effect probably being mediated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms . 
LysoPC may thus attenuate activation of coagulation during inflammation and atherosclerosis . 
Regulation of fas-ligand expression during activation-induced cell death in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> via <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> . 
T cell receptor engagement activates <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> important for <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> regulation . 
Additionally , this signaling pathway also leads to activation-induced apoptosis in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> that is dependent on FasL transcription and expression . 
Here we demonstrate that <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) , which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of many <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> expressed in <START:ana> activated lymphocytes <END> , also plays a role in T cell activation-induced <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity in a <START:ana> T cell hybridoma <END> leads to decreased <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression and apoptosis upon <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> stimulation . 
We identified the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB site <END> in the <START:ggp> FasL promoter <END> that contributes to such regulation . 
Co-expression of <START:ggp> p65 ( Rel A ) <END> with the <START:ggp> FasL promoter <END> enhanced its activity , and co-expression of <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> dramatically inhibited the <START:ggp> inducible promoter <END> activity . 
In contrast , the <START:ggp> transcription factor AP-1 <END> is not required for activation-induced <START:ggp> FasL <END> promoter activity . 
These results define a role for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in mediating <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression during T cell activation . 
<START:ggp> Promoter sequence <END> , exon : intron structure , and synteny of genetic location show that a <START:ggp> chicken cytokine <END> with T-cell proliferative activity is <START:ggp> IL2 <END> and not <START:ggp> IL15 <END> . 
The gene encoding a <START:ggp> chicken cytokine <END> with T-cell proliferative activity was cloned , sequenced , and mapped . 
The results show that this <START:ggp> cytokine <END> is chicken <START:ggp> IL2 <END> and not <START:ggp> IL15 <END> . 
The exon : intron structure of <START:ggp> chicken IL2 <END> corresponds almost exactly to those of mammalian <START:ggp> IL2s <END> with the exceptions of <START:ggp> exon 2 <END> and <START:ggp> introns <END> 2 and 3 which are shorter . 
Chicken <START:ggp> IL2 <END> contains five repeats of the `` instability '' motif ATTTA in the <START:ggp> 3'untranslated region <END> in <START:ggp> exon 4 <END> . 
It is a <START:ggp> single-copy gene <END> , with neither structural ( amino acid ) nor promoter sequence polymorphisms identified . 
Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence suggests that overall <START:ggp> protein structure <END> is conserved , but the receptor binding sites are not . 
A number of <START:ggp> potential regulatory sequences <END> similar to those found in mammals have been identified in the <START:ggp> promoter <END> . 
These include ( 5'-3 ' ) a composite <START:ggp> NF-AT/ `` AP-1 '' element <END> , a <START:ggp> CD28 response element <END> , an <START:ggp> AP-1 element <END> , an <START:ggp> NF-AT element <END> , and the <START:ggp> AP-1 part of an AP-1/octamer composite element <END> . 
The <START:ggp> mammalian NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> octamer binding sites <END> seem to be absent , although there are alternative potential <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> octamer-binding elements <END> in the <START:ggp> chicken IL2 promoter <END> , in close proximity to their <START:ggp> mammalian homologues <END> . 
Sequence comparisons also predict other potential transcription factor binding sites as yet undescribed in <START:ggp> mammalian IL2 promoters <END> . 
A <START:ggp> Taq I polymorphism <END> was identified which enabled chicken <START:ggp> IL2 <END> to be mapped to <START:ggp> chromosome 4 <END> , linked to <START:ggp> ANX5 <END> , with synteny with <START:ggp> mouse chromosome 3 <END> and <START:ggp> human chromosome 4 <END> . 
This is the first <START:ggp> non-mammalian cytokine gene <END> to be mapped . 
Endothelial production of <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> : modulation by heparin and consequences for mononuclear cell activation . 
Heparin is a polyanionic glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) that can bind with high affinity to a range of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> including <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) and members of the <START:ggp> chemokine superfamily <END> . 
This GAG also possesses immunomodulatory activity in vivo and can antagonize the capacity of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> to induce <START:ggp> class II MHC antigen <END> expression , and to up-regulate <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> , by <START:ana> cultured endothelial cells <END> . 
Previous studies have shown that binding to cell-surface heparan sulphate is essential for optimal activity of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and that free heparin competitively inhibits this sequestration process . 
The present study was performed to increase our understanding of the immunosuppressive activity of heparin by investigation of potential antagonism of the production and function of <START:ggp> monocyte chemotactic peptide-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> ) , a <START:ggp> chemokine <END> important for mononuclear leucocyte recruitment across vascular endothelium . 
It was found that mixture of heparin with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> inhibited up-regulation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein , <START:ggp> STAT-1 <END> produced normally by treatment of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
An inhibition of <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> production was observed that was specifically caused by mixture of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> with heparin-like , and therefore cytokine-binding , GAGs . 
It was also shown that mixture of heparin-like GAGs with <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> inhibited the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> which is normally produced by treatment of <START:ana> mononuclear leucocytes <END> with this <START:ggp> chemokine <END> . 
Blockade of this intracellular signalling event was associated with a reduction in the normal transendothelial migration response towards <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> . 
Results from this study indicate that soluble , heparin-like GAGs can block <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -dependent up-regulation of <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> production by <START:ana> cultured endothelial cells <END> , and can also antagonize the leucocyte-activating and migration-promoting properties of pre-existing <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> . 
These activities may contribute to the immunomodulatory properties of heparin . 
[ Molecular-biologic aspects of interaction between nervous and immune systems ] 
The problem of the neuro-immuno interactions on the level of the <START:ggp> protein trans-factors <END> , stimulating <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene <END> expression was discussed . 
The physico-chemical and functional parameters of the <START:ggp> low molecular nuclear proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> SP <END> and <START:ggp> BP- 14 , 18 , 19 kDs <END> ) isolated from <START:ana> splenic and brain cells <END> of immunized rats were studied . 
The binding of these proteins to the regulatory region of <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> in vitro and stimulation of the <START:ana> IL-2mRNA <END> synthesis in <START:ana> splenic T-lymphocytes culture <END> in normal conditions were shown . 
The protective effect of <START:ggp> SP <END> and <START:ggp> BP <END> on the <START:ana> IL-2mRNA <END> synthesis in stressful conditions and by the <START:ana> T-cells <END> treatment with the CsA was demonstrated . 
<START:ggp> Interferon-alpha <END> activates multiple <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> and upregulates proliferation-associated <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha <END> , <START:ggp> c-myc , and pim-1 genes <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interferon-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> ) is a <START:ggp> pleiotropic cytokine <END> that has antiviral , antiproliferative , and <START:ggp> immunoregulatory <END> functions . 
There is increasing evidence that <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> has an important role in T-cell biology . 
We have analyzed the expression of <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha <END> , <START:ggp> c-myc <END> , and <START:ggp> pim-1 genes <END> in <START:ana> anti-CD3-activated human T lymphocytes <END> . 
The induction of these genes is associated with <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) -induced T-cell proliferation . 
Treatment of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> with <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> upregulated <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha <END> , <START:ggp> c-myc <END> , and <START:ggp> pim-1 gene <END> expression . 
<START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> also <START:ana> sensitized T cells <END> to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced proliferation , further suggesting that <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> may be involved in the regulation of T-cell mitogenesis . 
When we analyzed the nature of <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> capable of binding to <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha <END> , <START:ggp> pim-1 , and IRF-1 GAS elements <END> after <START:ggp> cytokine <END> stimulation , we observed <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> -induced binding of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> , but not <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> to all of these elements . 
Yet , <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> was able to activate binding of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> to the high-affinity IFP53 GAS site . 
<START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 , <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT5a <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT5b <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-12 <END> induced <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> induced <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> binding to the <START:ggp> GAS elements <END> . 
Taken together , our results suggest that <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> have overlapping activities on <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
These findings thus emphasize the importance of <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> as a <START:ggp> T-cell regulatory cytokine <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Megakaryocyte/Platelet-specific enhancer <END> of the <START:ggp> alpha2beta1 integrin gene <END> : two tandem <START:ggp> AP1 sites <END> and the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> signaling cascade . 
The <START:ggp> alpha2beta1 integrin <END> , a collagen receptor on <START:ana> platelets <END> and <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> , is required for normal platelet function . 
Transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> alpha2 integrin gene <END> in cells undergoing megakaryocytic differentiation requires a <START:ggp> core promoter <END> between bp -30 and -92 , a <START:ggp> silencer <END> between bp -92 and -351 , and <START:ggp> megakaryocytic enhancers <END> in the <START:ggp> distal 5 ' flank <END> . 
We have now identified a <START:ggp> 229-bp region <END> of the <START:ggp> distal 5 ' flank <END> of the <START:ggp> alpha2 integrin gene <END> required for <START:ana> high-level enhancer activity in cells <END> with megakaryocytic features . 
Two tandem <START:ggp> AP1 binding sites <END> with dyad symmetry are required for enhancer activity and for <START:ggp> DNA-protein complex <END> formation with members of the <START:ggp> c-fos/c-jun family <END> . 
The requirement for <START:ggp> AP1 <END> activation suggested a role for the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MAPK <END> ) signaling pathway in regulating <START:ggp> alpha2 integrin gene <END> expression . 
Inhibition of the <START:ggp> MAP kinase <END> cascade with PD98059 , a specific inhibitor of <START:ggp> MAPK kinase 1 <END> , prevented the expression of the <START:ggp> alpha2 integrin subunit <END> in cells induced to become megakaryocytic . 
We provide a model of megakaryocytic differentiation in which expression of the <START:ggp> alpha2 integrin gene <END> requires signaling via the <START:ggp> MAP kinase <END> pathway to activate two tandem <START:ggp> AP1 binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> alpha2 integrin enhancer <END> . 
Functional association of <START:ggp> Nmi <END> with <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -and <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> -mediated signaling . 
Using the coiled-coil region of <START:ggp> Stat5b <END> as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen , we identified the association of <START:ggp> Nmi <END> , a protein of unknown function previously reported as an <START:ggp> N-Myc <END> interactor . 
We further show that <START:ggp> Nmi <END> interacts with all <START:ggp> STATs <END> except <START:ggp> Stat2 <END> . 
We evaluated two cytokine systems , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> , and demonstrate that <START:ggp> Nmi <END> augments <START:ggp> STAT <END> -mediated transcription in response to these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
Interestingly , <START:ggp> Nmi <END> lacks an intrinsic <START:ggp> transcriptional activation domain <END> ; instead , <START:ggp> Nmi <END> enhances the association of <START:ggp> CBP/p300 coactivator proteins <END> with <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> , and together with <START:ggp> CBP/p300 <END> can augment IL-2- and IFNgamma-dependent transcription . 
Therefore , our data not only reveal that <START:ggp> Nmi <END> can potentiate <START:ggp> STAT <END> -dependent transcription , but also suggest that it can augment coactivator protein recruitment to at least some members of a group of <START:ggp> sequence-specific transcription factors <END> . 
Lactobacilli and vaginal host defense : activation of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat <END> , <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production , and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Lactobacilli , a component of the normal vaginal flora , can activate the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -1 long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) in the <START:ana> Jurkat T lymphocyte <END> and <START:ana> THP-1 macrophage cell lines <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> LTR <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> was strongly enhanced by vanadate and inhibited by <START:ggp> catalase <END> , implicating H2O2 . 
In contrast , activation in <START:ggp> THP-1 cells <END> occurred in the absence of vanadate and was unaffected by <START:ggp> catalase <END> . 
The active material partitioned into the phenol layer on hot aqueous phenol extraction . 
Lactobacilli also increased <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> -alphaand <START:ggp> interleukin <END> -1betaproduction and activated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ggp> THP-1 cells <END> and increased <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> -alphaproduction by <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Human vaginal fluid specimens had comparable properties , which correlated with their bacterial content . 
These findings suggest the presence in vaginal fluid of agent ( s ) derived from indigenous bacteria that can activate the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> , <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production , and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in cells of <START:ana> macrophage lineage <END> , with possible influence on vaginal physiology and host defense . 
T cell priming enhances <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> expression by increasing <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> . 
The repetitive activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> ( priming ) enhances the expression of many <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , such as IL-4 , but not others , such as <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
Molecular mechanisms underlying selective expression of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> by <START:ana> T cells <END> remain poorly understood . 
Here we show that priming of <START:ana> CD4 T cells <END> selectively enhances <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> expression relative to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression by a transcriptional mechanism involving <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) proteins <END> . 
As detected by in vivo footprinting , priming markedly increases the activation-dependent engagement of the <START:ggp> P0 <END> and <START:ggp> P1 <END> <START:ggp> NFAT-binding elements <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter <END> . 
Moreover , each <START:ggp> proximal P element <END> is essential for optimal <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter <END> activity . 
Activated primed <START:ana> CD4 T cells <END> contain more <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> and support greater <START:ggp> NFAT <END> -directed transcription than unprimed <START:ana> CD4 T cells <END> , while <START:ggp> activator protein 1 <END> binding and <START:ggp> activator protein 1 <END> -mediated transcription by both cell types is similar . 
Increased expression of wild-type <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> substantially increases <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter <END> activity in unprimed <START:ana> CD4 T cells <END> , suggesting <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> may be limiting for <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> gene expression in this cell type . 
Furthermore , a truncated form of <START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> acts as a dominant-negative , reducing <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter <END> activity in primed <START:ana> CD4 T cells <END> and confirming the importance of <START:ggp> endogenous NFAT <END> to increased <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> gene expression by effector T cells . 
<START:ggp> NFAT1 <END> appears to be the major <START:ggp> NFAT family member <END> responsible for the initial increased expression of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> by primed <START:ana> CD4 T cells <END> . 
Differential monocyte adhesion and <START:ggp> adhesion molecule <END> expression in venous and arterial endothelial cells . 
We compared <START:ana> U-937 cell <END> adhesion and <START:ggp> adhesion molecule <END> expression in <START:ana> human umbilical venous <END> ( <START:ana> HUVECs <END> ) and <START:ana> arterial ( HUAECs ) endothelial cells <END> exposed to <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) , <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> , and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . 
<START:ggp> TNF <END> and LPS stimulated <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM <END> ) -1 surface expression and adhesion of <START:ana> U-937 monocyte-like cells <END> to <START:ana> HUVECs <END> but not to <START:ana> HUAECs <END> . 
Antibody studies demonstrated that in <START:ana> HUVECs <END> at least 75 % of the adhesion response is <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> mediated . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-1 <END> stimulated <START:ana> U-937 cell <END> adhesion to and <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> surface expression in both <START:ana> HUVECs <END> and <START:ana> HUAECs <END> . 
Pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 blocked <START:ggp> TNF <END> -and LPS-stimulated <START:ana> U-937 cell <END> adhesion to <START:ana> HUVECs <END> . 
These agents also significantly decreased <START:ggp> TNF <END> -and LPS-stimulated increases in <START:ggp> HUVEC surface VCAM-1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> TNF <END> increased <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> protein and <START:ana> mRNA <END> in <START:ana> HUVECs <END> that was blocked by pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate . 
However , neither <START:ggp> TNF <END> or LPS stimulated <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression in <START:ana> HUAECs <END> . 
<START:ggp> TNF <END> stimulated expression of both <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> and <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> in <START:ana> HUVECs <END> , but in <START:ana> HUAECs <END> , only <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> was increased . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated no difference in the pattern of <START:ggp> TNF <END> -stimulated <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> activation between <START:ana> HUVECs <END> and <START:ana> HUAECs <END> . 
These studies demonstrate a novel and striking insensitivity of arterial endothelium to the effects of <START:ggp> TNF <END> and LPS and indicate a dissociation between the ability of <START:ana> HUAECs <END> to upregulate <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> . 
Functional <START:ggp> testosterone receptors <END> in plasma membranes of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ana> T cells <END> are considered to be unresponsive to testosterone due to the absence of <START:ggp> androgen receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> AR <END> ) . 
Here , we demonstrate the testosterone responsiveness of <START:ana> murine splenic T cells <END> in vitro as well as the presence of <START:ggp> unconventional cell surface receptors <END> for testosterone and <START:ggp> classical intracellular AR <END> . 
Binding sites for testosterone on the surface of both <START:ana> CD4 ( + ) and CD8 ( + ) subsets <END> of <START:ana> T cells <END> are directly revealed with the impeded ligand testosterone-BSA-FITC by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) and flow cytometry , respectively . 
Binding of the plasma membrane impermeable <START:ggp> testosterone-BSA conjugate <END> induces a rapid rise ( < 5 s ) in [ Ca2+ ] i of <START:ana> Fura-2-loaded T cells <END> . 
This rise reflects influx of extracellular Ca2+ through non-voltage-gated and <START:ggp> Ni2+-blockable Ca2+ channels <END> of the plasma membrane . 
The testosterone-BSA-induced Ca2+ import is not affected by cyproterone , a blocker of the <START:ggp> AR <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> AR <END> are not detectable on the surface of <START:ana> intact T cells <END> when using <START:ggp> anti-AR antibodies <END> directed against the <START:ggp> amino and carboxy terminus <END> of the <START:ggp> AR <END> , although <START:ana> T cells <END> contain <START:ggp> AR <END> , as revealed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions and Western blotting . 
<START:ggp> AR <END> can be visualized with the <START:ggp> anti-AR antibodies <END> in the cytoplasm of <START:ana> permeabilized T cells <END> by using CLSM , though <START:ggp> AR <END> are not detectable in cytosol fractions when using the charcoal binding assay with 3H-R1881 as ligand . 
<START:ggp> Cytoplasmic AR <END> do not translocate to the nucleus of <START:ana> T cells <END> in the presence of testosterone , in contrast to <START:ggp> cytoplasmic AR <END> in <START:ana> human cancer LNCaP cells <END> . 
These findings suggest that the <START:ggp> classical AR <END> present in <START:ana> splenic T cells <END> are not active in the genomic pathway . 
By contrast , the <START:ggp> cell surface receptors <END> for testosterone are in a functionally active state , enabling <START:ana> T cells <END> a nongenomic response to testosterone . 
Limited proteolysis for assaying ligand binding affinities of <START:ggp> nuclear receptors <END> . 
The binding of natural or synthetic ligands to <START:ggp> nuclear receptors <END> is the triggering event leading to gene transcription activation or repression . 
Ligand binding to the <START:ggp> ligand binding domain <END> of these <START:ggp> receptors <END> induces conformational changes that are evidenced by an increased resistance of this domain to <START:ggp> proteases <END> . 
<START:ggp> In vitro labeled receptors <END> were incubated with various synthetic or natural agonists or antagonists and submitted to <START:ggp> trypsin <END> digestion . 
Proteolysis products were separated by SDS-PAGE and quantified . 
The amount of <START:ggp> trypsin <END> -resistant fragments was proportional to receptor occupancy by the ligand , and allowed the determination of dissociation constants ( kDa ) . 
Using the <START:ggp> wild-type or mutated human retinoic acid receptor alpha <END> as a model , kDa values determined by classical competition binding assays using tritiated ligands are in agreement with those measured by the proteolytic assay . 
This method was successfully extended to <START:ggp> human retinoic X receptor alpha <END> , <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> , and <START:ggp> progesterone receptor <END> , thus providing a basis for a new , faster assay to determine simultaneously the affinity and conformation of receptors when bound to a given ligand . 
Genes that regulate <START:ggp> interleukin-4 <END> expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-4 <END> is an <START:ggp> immunomodulatory cytokine <END> which plays a central role in the regulation of allergic and atopic immune responses . 
Significant progress has been made in gaining a detailed understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> interleukin-4 gene <END> . 
The recent identification and characterization of several key <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> has helped to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of <START:ggp> T helper cell cytokine gene <END> expression . 
<START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia contain <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) 1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> constitutively phosphorylated on serine residues . 
To explore the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , we examined whether phosphorylation of one or more <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) factors <END> was abnormal in cells from CLL patients . 
No constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation was detected on any <START:ggp> STAT <END> in <START:ana> CLL cells <END> . 
To assess the phosphorylation of serine residues of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> in <START:ana> CLL cells <END> , we raised antibodies that specifically recognize the form of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> phosphorylated on ser-727 and the form of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> phosphorylated on ser-727 . 
We found that in 100 % of patients with CLL ( n = 32 ) , <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> were constitutively phosphorylated on serine . 
This was in contrast to normal peripheral blood <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> or <START:ana> CD5+ ) B cells <END> isolated from tonsils , in which this phosphorylation was absent . 
Serine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> was seen occasionally in other leukemias , but it was a universal finding only in CLL . 
The serine phosphorylation of these <START:ggp> STATs <END> was a continuous process , as incubation of <START:ana> CLL cells <END> with the <START:ggp> kinase inhibitor H7 <END> led to the dephosphorylation of these serine residues . 
The STAT serine kinase in CLL cells has not been identified , and appears to be neither <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> nor <START:ggp> pp70 ( s6k ) <END> . 
In summary , the constitutive serine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> is present in all CLL samples tested to date , although the physiologic significance of this modification remains to be determined . 
Activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression by Gardnerella vaginalis . 
Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) is associated with an increased rate of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) type 1 , and Gardnerella vaginalis is frequently isolated from the genital tracts of women with BV . 
G. vaginalis lysates were found to significantly stimulate HIV expression in <START:ana> monocytoid cells <END> . 
Stimulation was significantly higher when lysates were heated at 100 degrees C for 5 min but was reduced by treatment with <START:ggp> lysozyme <END> or <START:ggp> protease <END> . 
G. vaginalis lysates also activated HIV expression in certain <START:ana> T cell lines <END> . 
G. vaginalis lysates activated HIV long-terminal repeat transcription in <START:ana> HIV-infected cells <END> and increased <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding activity , indicating an effect by G. vaginalis on HIV transcription . 
The activation of HIV production by G. vaginalis suggests that genital tract infection with G. vaginalis increases the risk of HIV transmission by increasing HIV expression in the genital tract . 
This may explain , at least in part , the increased rate of HIV transmission in women with BV . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-10 <END> inhibits expression of both <START:ggp> interferon alpha- and interferon gamma- induced genes <END> by suppressing tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-10 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ) helps maintain <START:ana> polarized T-helper cells <END> in a <START:ana> T-helper lymphocyte 2 ( Th2 ) phenotype <END> . 
Part of this process involves the prevention of the development of <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> , which are a primary source of <START:ggp> interferon gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> ) , a potent activator of <START:ana> monocytes <END> and an inhibitor of Th2 proliferation . 
Because <START:ana> monocytes <END> and macrophages are important mediators of Th1-type responses , such as delayed-type hypersensitivity , we sought to determine if <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> could directly mediate inhibition of IFNgamma- and IFNalpha-induced gene expression in these cells . 
Highly purified <START:ana> monocytes <END> were incubated with <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> for 60 to 90 minutes before the addition of <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> or <START:ggp> IFNalpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> preincubation resulted in the inhibition of gene expression for several <START:ggp> IFN-induced genes <END> , such as <START:ggp> IP-10 <END> , <START:ggp> ISG54 <END> , and <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> . 
The reduction in gene expression resulted from the ability of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> to suppress <START:ggp> IFN <END> -induced assembly of <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) factors <END> to <START:ggp> specific promoter motifs <END> on <START:ggp> IFNalpha- and IFNgamma-inducible genes <END> . 
This was accomplished by preventing the IFN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> , a component of both <START:ggp> IFNalpha- and IFNgamma-induced DNA binding complexes <END> . 
Therefore , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> can directly inhibit <START:ggp> STAT-dependent early response gene <END> expression induced by both <START:ggp> IFNalpha <END> and <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> by suppressing the tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> . 
This may occur through the ability of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> to induce expression of the gene , suppressor of <START:ggp> cytokine signaling 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> SOCS3 <END> ) . 
Clonality analysis of refractory anemia with <START:ana> ring sideroblasts <END> : simultaneous study of clonality and cytochemistry of <START:ana> bone marrow progenitors <END> . 
X chromosome inactivation and polymorphism of the <START:ggp> human androgen receptor ( HUMARA ) gene <END> has been applied for analyzing the clonality of <START:ana> blood cells <END> . 
In the present study , the clonal relationship was investigated between <START:ana> peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PMNCs <END> ) and <START:ana> marrow progenitor cells <END> and the origin of <START:ana> ringed sideroblasts <END> in patients with refractory anemia with <START:ana> ring sideroblasts <END> ( <START:ana> RARS <END> ) by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) of <START:ggp> HUMARA gene <END> . 
The X-inactivation patterns of circulating <START:ana> PMNCs <END> and <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> as well as individual <START:ana> granulocyte colonies <END> grown in vitro from bone marrow cells were analyzed . 
The development of <START:ana> ringed sideroblasts <END> in <START:ana> erythroid colonies <END> by iron staining and their X-inactivation pattern were also examined . 
All three <START:ana> RARS <END> patients showed monoclonal <START:ana> PMNCs <END> . 
In <START:ana> granulocyte colonies <END> , however , two different X-inactivation patterns were observed in all patients , indicating that <START:ana> non-clonal progenitor cells <END> remained in the bone marrow . 
All <START:ana> erythroid colonies <END> consisted of <START:ana> ringed sideroblasts <END> exclusively showed one pattern dominant in those of <START:ana> PMNCs <END> . 
Our findings suggest that <START:ana> non-clonal progenitor cells <END> persist in some <START:ana> RARS <END> cases , that <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> show mosaicism , and that <START:ana> ringed sideroblasts <END> may be derived from an abnormal clone involved in the pathogenesis of this disease . 
Granulosa cell tumor of the ovary . 
Immunohistochemical evidence of low proliferative activity and virtual absence of mutation of the <START:ggp> p53 tumor-suppressor gene <END> . 
BACKGROUND AND METHODS : Because the use of immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of granulosa cell tumor ( GCT ) has not been fully explored , routinely processed ( formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded ) tissue from 11 GCT , adult type , was investigated immunohistochemically ( ABC method ) with a broad spectrum of antibodies against various markers , including <START:ggp> p53 <END> and <START:ggp> Ki-67 <END> . 
All of the tumors exhibited typical morphology , were limited to the ovary ( stage I ) , and 7 cases followed a benign clinical course . 
RESULTS : All the tumors exhibited strong expression of <START:ggp> vimentin <END> , but most other antigens ( including <START:ggp> smooth muscle actin <END> ) were expressed infrequently by a minority of <START:ana> tumor cells <END> or not at all . 
Tumor cells in 9 GCT expressed inhibin A . 
All the tumors exhibited very low proliferative activity , fewer than 10 % of the tumor cell nuclei being stained by the <START:ggp> antibody MIB-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> Ki-67 antigen <END> ) . 
The <START:ggp> antibody D07 <END> revealed marked overexpression of <START:ggp> p53 protein <END> in only one tumor . 
Clinical outcome was not found to be related to immunophenotypic differences . 
CONCLUSIONS : The diagnosis of GCT should be based primarily on the typical morphology revealed by conventional stains , but additional immunohistochemical staining with a small panel of selected antibodies ( for example , against <START:ggp> keratin <END> , <START:ggp> vimentin <END> , and <START:ggp> inhibin A <END> ) may be helpful in a few cases . 
The very low proliferative activity and the lack of overexpression of <START:ggp> p53 protein <END> are consistent with the benign clinical behavior of the majority of GCT . 
Protective effects of <START:ggp> notch-1 <END> on <START:ggp> TCR <END> -induced apoptosis . 
The <START:ggp> Notch receptor protein <END> was originally identified in Drosophila and is known to mediate cell to cell communication and influence cell fate decisions . 
Members of this family have been isolated from invertebrates as well as vertebrates . 
We isolated <START:ggp> mouse Notch-1 <END> in a yeast two-hybrid screen with <START:ggp> Nur77 <END> , which is a protein that has been shown previously to be required for apoptosis in <START:ana> T cell lines <END> . 
The data presented below indicate that <START:ggp> Notch-1 <END> expression provides significant protection to <START:ana> T cell lines <END> from <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated apoptosis . 
These data demonstrate a new antiapoptotic role for <START:ggp> Notch-1 <END> , providing evidence that , in addition to regulating cell fate decisions , <START:ggp> Notch-1 <END> can play a critical role in controlling levels of cell death in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Comparison of primary sensitization of <START:ana> naive human T cells <END> to varicella-zoster virus peptides by <START:ana> dendritic cells <END> in vitro with responses elicited in vivo by varicella vaccination . 
<START:ana> Dendritic cells <END> ( <START:ana> DC <END> ) are potent <START:ana> APC <END> during primary and secondary immune responses . 
The first objective of this study was to determine whether <START:ana> human DC <END> mediate in vitro sensitization of <START:ana> naive CD4+ T cells <END> to <START:ggp> epitopes <END> of the <START:ggp> immediate early 62 ( IE62 ) protein <END> of varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) . 
The induction of <START:ggp> CD4+ <END> T cell proliferative responses to eight synthetic peptides representing amino acid sequences of the <START:ggp> VZV IE62 protein <END> was assessed using <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> DC <END> from VZV-susceptible donors . 
The second objective was to compare in vitro responses of <START:ana> naive T cells <END> with responses to VZV peptides induced in vivo after immunization with varicella vaccine . 
T cell proliferation was induced by three peptides , P1 , P4 , and P7 , in 71-100 % of the donors tested before and after vaccination using <START:ana> DC <END> as <START:ana> APC <END> . 
<START:ana> Monocytes <END> were effective <START:ana> APC <END> for VZV peptides only after immunization . 
Two peptides , P2 and P8 , induced naive T cell proliferation less effectively and were also less immunogenic for <START:ana> T cells <END> from vaccinated or naturally immune donors . 
T cell recognition of specific peptides was concordant between naive , <START:ana> DC <END> -mediated responses , and postvaccine responses using <START:ana> monocytes <END> as <START:ana> APC <END> in 69 % of comparisons ( p = 0.05 ; chi2 ) ; the predictive value of a positive response to an IE62 peptide before immunization for T cell sensitization in vivo was 82 % . 
These observations indicate that primary T cell responses detected in vitro using <START:ana> DC <END> as <START:ana> APC <END> may be useful to characterize the potential immunogenicity of viral protein epitopes in vivo . 
Mechanism of <START:ggp> interleukin-10 <END> inhibition of T-helper cell activation by <START:ggp> superantigen <END> at the level of the cell cycle . 
We have analyzed the effects of <START:ggp> interleukin-10 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ) on the entry of quiescent <START:ana> CD4 ( + ) T cells <END> into the cell cycle upon stimulation with the <START:ggp> superantigen <END> <START:ggp> staphylococcal enterotoxin B <END> ( <START:ggp> SEB <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> arrested cells at G0/G1 . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> treatment prevented the downregulation of <START:ggp> p27 ( Kip1 <END> ) , an <START:ggp> inhibitory protein <END> that controls progression out of the G0 phase of the cell cycle . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> also prevented the upregulation of the <START:ggp> G1 cyclins <END> <START:ggp> D2 <END> and <START:ggp> D3 <END> , proteins necessary for entry and progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle . 
Associated with the inhibition of the cell cycle , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> suppressed <START:ggp> SEB <END> induction of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) . 
Addition of exogenous <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> to <START:ana> IL-10-treated cells <END> significantly reversed the antiproliferative effects of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> effects on the <START:ggp> early G1 proteins <END> <START:ggp> p27 ( Kip1 ) <END> and <START:ggp> cyclin D2 <END> were similarly reversed by exogenous <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
Although this reversal by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> was pronounced , it was not complete , suggesting that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> may have some effects not directly related to the suppression of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production . 
Cell separation experiments suggest that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> can effect purified <START:ana> CD4 ( + ) T cells <END> directly , providing functional evidence for the presence of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> receptors on <START:ana> CD4 ( + ) T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> also inhibited expression of <START:ggp> IL-2 transcriptional regulators <END> <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> , which also inhibit other cell functions . 
Our studies show that the mechanism of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> regulation of quiescent CD4 ( + ) T-cell activation is mainly by blocking induction of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> that is critical to downregulation of <START:ggp> p27 ( Kip1 ) <END> and upregulation of <START:ggp> D cyclins <END> in T-cell activation and entry into the cell cycle . 
<START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibit induction of IL-1 receptor type I and type II gene expression by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> in human <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Th2-type cytokines <END> <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> induce expression of a distinct subset of genes in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
These include <START:ggp> Fc epsilonRII <END> ( <START:ggp> CD23 <END> ) , <START:ggp> 15-lipoxygenase <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor antagonist <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1ra <END> ) , and <START:ggp> type I and type II IL-1 receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1R <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> has been shown to inhibit induction of <START:ggp> CD23 <END> and <START:ggp> 15-lipoxygenase <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> ; however , the effects of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> on type I and type II IL-1R gene expression have not been defined . 
We examined the effects of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> on both basal and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> / <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> -induced <START:ggp> IL-1R gene <END> expression in <START:ana> primary monocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> induced dose- and time-dependent increases in IL-1RI and IL-1RII mRNA levels . 
<START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> decreased basal expression as well as the induction of these genes by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-1RI <END> and IL-1RII mRNA levels by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> was transcriptionally mediated , and correlated directly with decreased production of soluble <START:ggp> IL-1RII <END> . 
Furthermore , the ability to suppress IL-1RI and <START:ggp> IL-1RII <END> mRNA levels was not unique to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> because <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> also inhibited expression of these genes in <START:ana> IL-4/IL-13-stimulated monocytes <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-1R gene <END> expression by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> was not due to down-regulation of <START:ggp> surface IL-4R <END> because pretreatment with these cytokines did not decrease the number of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> binding sites per cell . 
However , suppression of <START:ggp> IL-1R gene <END> expression by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> was associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the <START:ggp> IL-4/IL-13-inducible transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> , suggesting a potential mechanism by which <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> may mediate their suppressive effects . 
These findings demonstrate that certain cytokines , including <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , antagonize the ability of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> to induce increased expression of the IL-1RI and <START:ggp> IL-1RII genes <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Cytokine <END> rescue from glucocorticoid induced apoptosis in <START:ana> T cells <END> is mediated through inhibition of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> . 
We previously reported that dexamethasone ( DEX ) , a synthetic glucocorticoid , causes apoptosis in <START:ana> mature Th cell lines <END> , and that this induction of cell death is prevented by specific <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , namely , by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> and by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> in <START:ana> Th2 cells <END> . 
We now show that this differential rescue by specific <START:ggp> cytokines <END> in <START:ana> Th cells <END> correlates with the level of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> that is regulated by DEX and <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
In both cell types the cellular levels of <START:ana> IkappaBalpha mRNA <END> and protein were evaluated by DEX treatment . 
Interestingly , the DEX-mediated <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> induction was completely inhibited by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , but not <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , in <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> , while the reverse profile was seen in <START:ana> Th2 cells <END> . 
In both cell types , the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> that inhibits the induction of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> by DEX , also rescues these cells from DEX-induced apoptosis , although the rescue cytokine is different in <START:ana> Th1 and Th2 cells <END> . 
Our results imply that <START:ana> T cells <END> need to maintain a certain level of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> transcriptional activity in order to survive ; up- or down-regulation of <START:ggp> nuclear NF kappaB <END> through modulation of <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> expression by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> or DEX may lead to cell survival or cell death , respectively . 
Expression of <START:ggp> transcription factor genes <END> after influenza A virus infection . 
Infection of human <START:ana> monocytes <END> with influenza A virus induces a broad range of <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> and mononuclear cell attracting <START:ggp> chemokines <END> before the <START:ana> infected cells <END> undergo apoptosis . 
The underlying mechanisms by which the corresponding genes are transcriptionally initiated after virus infection are still poorly understood . 
Activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> seems to play an important role in the regulation of many <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokine genes <END> , but can not be the only mechanism , since several <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> lack respective <START:ggp> binding sites <END> in their <START:ggp> promoter regions <END> . 
Therefore , we additionally investigated other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> of possible importance such as <START:ggp> CREB <END> , <START:ggp> CTF <END> , <START:ggp> OTF-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> . 
To explore long-term regulatory mechanisms , we investigated the induction of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> on the gene expression level which may be important to substitute for <START:ggp> metabolized transcription factor proteins <END> after their activation . 
We identified a cell-type-specific differential response : <START:ggp> CREB , CTF , OTF-1 , OFT-2 , and NF-kappa B genes <END> were strongly induced 1 to 4 hours after influenza A virus infection in the <START:ana> monocytic cell line <END> <START:ana> Mono Mac 6 <END> , while in freshly prepared human <START:ana> monocytes <END> no significant changes were detected . 
In infected <START:ana> monocytes <END> , which die by apoptosis , the expression of <START:ggp> CREB <END> , <START:ggp> CTF <END> , and <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> was rather suppressed 8 hours after infection . 
In conclusion , the long-term regulation of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> gene expression in <START:ana> non-proliferating cells <END> seems to be of minor importance after influenza infection since in <START:ana> apoptosisprone cells <END> an immediate availability of <START:ggp> transcription factor proteins <END> is required . 
<START:ana> Peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> isolated from patients with diabetic nephropathy show increased activation of the <START:ggp> oxidative-stress sensitive transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Increased oxidative stress and subsequent activation of the transcription factor <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> has been linked to the development of late diabetic complications . 
To determine whether oxidative stress dependent <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation is evident in patients with diabetic nephropathy we used an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay based semiquantitative detection system which enabled us to determine <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in ex vivo <START:ana> isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
We examined 33 patients with diabetes mellitus ( Type I and Type II ) . 
Patients with diabetic nephropathy showed higher <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding activity in Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays and stronger immunohistological staining for activated <START:ggp> NF-kappaBp65 <END> than patients without renal complications . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding activity correlated with the degree of albuminuria ( r = 0.316 ) and with <START:ggp> thrombomodulin <END> plasma concentrations ( r = 0.33 ) , indicative for albuminuria associated endothelial dysfunction . 
In a 3 day intervention study in which 600 mg of the antioxidant thioctic acid ( alpha-lipoic acid ) per day were given to nine patients with diabetic nephropathy oxidative stress in plasma samples was decreased by 48 % and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding activity in ex vivo <START:ana> isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> by 38 % . 
In conclusion , activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in ex vivo <START:ana> isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> of patients with diabetes mellitus correlates with the degree of diabetic nephropathy . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation is at least in part dependent on oxidative stress since thioctic acid ( alpha-lipoic acid ) reduced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding activity . 
<START:ggp> Osteoclast markers <END> accumulate on cells developing from <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear precursors <END> . 
Recent studies show that <START:ana> human osteoclasts <END> develop in vitro from <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> ; however , special cultures conditions and/or cytokine mobilized peripheral blood are apparently required . 
Here , we report that cells expressing <START:ggp> osteoclast markers <END> differentiate from precursors present in <START:ana> nonmobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) , without the addition of <START:ana> stromal cells <END> , <START:ggp> growth factors <END> , cytokines or steroids ; and characterize their phenotype . 
Three days after establishing high-density <START:ana> PBMC <END> cultures ( 1.5 x 10 ( 6 ) cells/cm2 ) , in serum-containing medium , small <START:ana> adherent colonies <END> of <START:ana> tartrate resistant acid phosphatase positive ( TRAP+ ) cells <END> emerge , amidst massive monocyte cell death . 
These <START:ana> adherent cells <END> have an eccentrically placed , round nucleus , and express low levels of <START:ggp> TRAP <END> and <START:ggp> sodium fluoride-resistant- alpha-naphthyl-acetate-esterase <END> ( <START:ggp> NaF-R-NSE <END> ) . 
Over the next week , this cell population accumulates phenotypic markers of <START:ana> osteoclasts <END> ( <START:ggp> vitronectin receptor <END> [ <START:ggp> VR <END> ] , <START:ggp> calcitonin receptor <END> , <START:ggp> TRAP <END> , <START:ggp> cathepsin K protein <END> , and <START:ana> mRNA <END> ) with increased nuclearity , covering the entire surface by 15 days . 
When cultured on bone , <START:ana> VR+ , TRAP+ cells <END> of low multinuclearity appear and cover up to 50 % of the surface . 
Resorption lacunae can be observed by day 22 . 
Although these pits are not nearly as numerous as the cells of <START:ana> preosteoclast phenotype <END> , they do represent the activity of a subset of <START:ana> osteoclast-like cells <END> that has achieved osteoclastic maturity under these culture conditions . 
Transcripts for <START:ggp> osteoprotegerin ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> OPGL <END> ) , an <START:ggp> osteoclast differentiation factor <END> ( also known as <START:ggp> RANKL <END> and <START:ggp> TRANCE <END> ) are expressed , likely by <START:ana> adherent cells <END> . 
Thus , an adherent population of cells , with preosteoclast/ <START:ana> osteoclast <END> phenotypic properties , arises selectively under simple culture conditions from normal <START:ana> PBMC <END> . 
Further characterization of these cells should identify factors involved in the growth , terminal differentiation and activation of <START:ana> osteoclasts <END> . 
Oleic acid inhibits endothelial activation : A direct vascular antiatherogenic mechanism of a nutritional component in the mediterranean diet . 
Because oleic acid is implicated in the antiatherogenic effects attributed to the Mediterranean diet , we investigated whether this fatty acid can modulate endothelial activation , ie , the concerted expression of <START:ggp> gene products <END> involved in leukocyte recruitment and early atherogenesis . 
We incubated sodium oleate with <START:ana> human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> for 0 to 72 hours , followed by coincubation of oleate with <START:ggp> human recombinant tumor necrosis factor <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -1alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for a further 6 to 24 hours . 
The endothelial expression of <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) , <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> , and <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> was monitored by cell surface enzyme immunoassays or flow cytometry , and steady-state levels of <START:ana> VCAM-1 mRNA <END> were assessed by Northern blot analysis . 
At 10 to 100 micromol/L for > 24 hours , oleate inhibited the expression of all <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> tested . 
After a 72-hour incubation with oleate and a further 16-hour incubation with oleate plus 1 microg/mL LPS , <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression was reduced by > 40 % compared with control . 
Adhesion of <START:ana> monocytoid U937 cells <END> to LPS-treated endothelial cells was reduced concomitantly . 
Oleate also produced a quantitatively similar reduction of <START:ana> VCAM-1 mRNA <END> levels on Northern blot analysis and inhibited <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> activation on electrophoretic mobility shift assays . 
Incubation of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> with oleate for 72 hours decreased the relative proportions of saturated ( palmitic and stearic ) acids in total cell lipids and increased the proportions of oleate in total cell lipids without significantly changing the relative proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids . 
Although less potent than polyunsaturated fatty acids in inhibiting endothelial activation , oleic acid may contribute to the prevention of atherogenesis through selective displacement of saturated fatty acids in cell membrane phospholipids and a consequent modulation of gene expression for molecules involved in monocyte recruitment . 
Both <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> -activation and <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> -independent <START:ggp> BCL2 <END> downregulation are important for <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> -induced apoptosis of <START:ana> 1A9-M cells <END> . 
A unique subclone of a <START:ana> bone marrow-derived stromal cell line <END> , <START:ana> BMS2.4 <END> , produces <START:ggp> soluble factors <END> that inhibit proliferation of several types of <START:ana> hematopoietic cell lines <END> . 
An understanding of these molecules may be informative about negative regulatory circuits that can potentially limit blood cell formation . 
We used expression cloning to identify <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ) as one factor that suppressed growth of a <START:ana> pre-B-cell variant line <END> , <START:ana> 1A9-M <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> induced macrophage-differentiation and apoptosis of <START:ana> 1A9-M cells <END> . 
During this process , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> downregulated expression of <START:ggp> BCL2 <END> in <START:ana> 1A9-M cells <END> and stimulated BCL-XL expression , but had no effect on p53 , Bax , or Bak gene expression . 
Mechanisms for transduction of <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> -induced signals were then evaluated in <START:ana> IL-6-stimulated 1A9-M cells <END> . 
Whereas the <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> ) was phosphorylated and activated , there was no effect on either <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> or <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> . 
The importance of <START:ggp> BCL2 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> on <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> -induced macrophage-differentiation and apoptosis was studied with <START:ana> 1A9-M cells <END> expressing <START:ggp> human BCL2 <END> or a dominant-negative form of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> , respectively . 
<START:ggp> IL-6 <END> -induced apoptosis , but not macrophage-differentiation , was blocked by continuously expressed <START:ggp> BCL2 <END> . 
A <START:ggp> dominant-negative form of Stat3 <END> inhibited both macrophage-differentiation and apoptosis induced by <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> . 
However , diminished <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> activity did not prevent <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> -induced downregulation of the <START:ggp> BCL2 gene <END> . 
Therefore , activation of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> is essential for <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> -induced macrophage-differentiation and programmed cell death in this model . 
Whereas overexpression of <START:ggp> BCL2 <END> abrogates the apoptotic response , <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> -independent signals appear to downregulate expression of the <START:ggp> BCL2 gene <END> . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> pathways in <START:ggp> interleukin-8 <END> production by <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> polymorphonuclear cells <END> stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or <START:ggp> Mycoplasma fermentans membrane lipoproteins <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-8 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> ) is a <START:ggp> chemokine <END> that belongs to the <START:ggp> alpha-chemokine <END> or <START:ggp> CXC subfamily <END> and is produced by a wide variety of human cells , including <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> polymorphonuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PMN <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> IL-8 <END> is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli , notably bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , but little is known about the mechanisms by which these agents mediate <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> induction . 
In this report , we show that <START:ggp> Mycoplasma fermentans lipid-associated membrane proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> LAMPf <END> ) induce the production of high levels of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> by <START:ana> THP-1 ( human monocyte ) cells <END> and <START:ana> PMN <END> at the same extent as LPS . 
It was previously demonstrated that stimulation of monocytic cells with either LPS or <START:ggp> LAMPf <END> led to a series of common downstream signaling events , including the activation of <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase <END> and of <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> cascades . 
By using PD-98059 and SB203580 , two potent and selective inhibitors of <START:ggp> MEK1 <END> ( a <START:ggp> kinase <END> upstream of <START:ggp> ERK1/2 <END> ) and <START:ggp> p38 <END> , respectively , we have demonstrated that both ERK1/2 and p38 cascades play a key role in the production of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> by <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> PMN <END> stimulated with bacterial fractions . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> synthesis in <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> by <START:ggp> C3a <END> and <START:ggp> C3a ( desArg ) <END> . 
The <START:ggp> anaphylatoxin <END> <START:ggp> C3a <END> has been reported to have immunomodulatory effects on a number of different cell types . 
In this study we investigated the effects of <START:ggp> C3a <END> and <START:ggp> C3a ( desArg ) <END> on gene expression and protein secretion of <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> in human <START:ana> PBMCs <END> , either alone or in combination with LPS or <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> . 
<START:ggp> C3a <END> or <START:ggp> C3a ( desArg ) <END> alone exhibited no effect on the expression or secretion of <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> . 
However , when <START:ana> PBMC <END> were stimulated with LPS or <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> , both <START:ggp> C3a <END> and <START:ggp> C3a ( desArg ) <END> were found to enhance <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> release by <START:ana> PBMC <END> in a dose-dependent manner . 
Since <START:ggp> C3a <END> has been shown to induce PGE2 production by <START:ana> monocytes <END> , and PGE2 has been shown to influence cytokine production , we investigated the potential role of PGE2 in <START:ggp> C3a <END> -mediated enhancement of LPS- and IL-1beta-induced IL-6 production . 
Indomethacin blocked PGE2 release , but had no influence on the observed effects of <START:ggp> C3a <END> , suggesting that the effects of <START:ggp> C3a <END> on <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> production are independent of PGE2 formation by <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Northern blot analysis showed that <START:ggp> C3a <END> as well as <START:ggp> C3a ( desArg ) <END> enhanced LPS <START:ana> -induced mRNA <END> levels for <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> . 
Pretreatment of <START:ana> PBMCs <END> with <START:ggp> pertussis toxin <END> blocked the functions of <START:ggp> C3a <END> and <START:ggp> C3a ( desArg ) <END> , indicating that the actions of these two molecules are mediated by a <START:ggp> G protein <END> -coupled pathway . 
Furthermore , we investigated the effects of <START:ggp> C3a <END> and <START:ggp> C3a ( desArg ) <END> on induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> activating protein-1 <END> binding . 
Both molecules enhanced LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> activating protein-1 <END> binding activity . 
These results demonstrate the capacity of intact <START:ggp> C3a <END> and its circulating <START:ggp> des-Arg form <END> to exert immunmodulatory effects in vitro . 
Phenylarsine oxide inhibits ex vivo HIV-1 expression . 
Phenylarsine oxide ( PAO ) , which is described as an inhibitor of <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphatase <END> activity , inhibits H2O2 release from <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMCs <END> ) as measured by electrochemistry . 
Since human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication is known to be favored under oxidative stress conditions , ex vivo experiments using uninfected <START:ana> PBMCs <END> , <START:ana> primary monocytes <END> or a latently infected <START:ana> promonocytic U1 cell line <END> show that HIV-1 replication and reactivation , monitored by <START:ggp> p24 antigen <END> measurement , are inhibited by PAO in a time- and concentration-dependent manner . 
These observations can be linked with the inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation when uninfected monocytes are induced by either <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) or lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . 
Pharmacological control of antigen responsiveness in <START:ana> genetically modified T lymphocytes <END> . 
A <START:ggp> chimeric TCR gene <END> , comprising an <START:ggp> anti-hapten single-chain Ab variable fragment <END> fused to the <START:ggp> transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions <END> of the <START:ggp> human TCR zeta-chain <END> , was used to determine whether the tetracycline-regulatable system could be used to regulate gene expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> were stably transfected with a single vector encoding the <START:ggp> tetracycline trans-activator protein <END> , controlled by a <START:ggp> constitutive promoter <END> , and the <START:ggp> chimeric TCR <END> , under the control of a <START:ggp> trans-activator protein-responsive promoter <END> . 
In the absence of tetracyclines , the transfected <START:ana> T cells <END> were shown to express the <START:ggp> chimeric receptor <END> on the cell surface and could be activated by its <START:ggp> cognate Ag <END> , leading to the secretion of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
When the cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of tetracyclines , surface expression of the <START:ggp> chimeric receptor <END> was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner , and this suppression was sufficient to result in complete loss of responsiveness to the <START:ggp> targeted Ag <END> . 
Prolonged suppression of trans-gene expression for up to 7 days was observed after doxycycline was removed from the cultures , but eventual recovery of surface expression was complete , and the absolute time to recovery was directly proportional to the initial concentration of the drug . 
Pharmacologic control of trans-gene expression in <START:ana> gene-modified T cells <END> will not only facilitate new approaches to the study of different aspects of T cell biology , but will also provide the basis for new gene therapy strategies . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> , fibromyalgia and low back pain . 
Recently , fibromyalgia ( FMS ) was shown to be a disorder associated with an altered functioning of the stress response system . 
FMS patients display a hyperreactive pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) release in response to corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH ) and to insulin-induced hypoglycemia . 
We suggested that negative feedback of cortisol could be deranged . 
Therefore we investigated the properties and function of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) in FMS patients and compared the results with those of healthy persons and patients with chronic low back pain ( LBP a localized pain condition ) . 
Forty primary FMS patients ( F : M = 36 : 4 ) , 28 LBP patients ( 25 : 3 ) and 14 ( 12 : 2 ) healthy , sedentary control persons were recruited for the study . 
Urinary free cortisol excretion in FMS and LBP patients was lower compared to controls . 
Only FMS patients displayed lower CBG and basal serum cortisol concentrations when compared to controls . 
However , plasma free cortisol concentrations were similar in the three groups . 
There was no difference in the number of <START:ggp> GR <END> per cell among the three groups ( FMS : 6498 +/- 252 , LBP : 6625 +/- 284 , controls : 6576 +/- 304 ) , but the dissociation constant ( Kd ) of the FMS ( 14.5 +/- 0.9 nmol/l ) and LBP ( 14.7 +/- 1.3 nmol/l ) subjects was significantly higher than that of the controls ( 10.9 +/- 0.8 nmol/l ) ( p < .05 ) . 
The maximal stimulation of the <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , as measured by the maximal thymidine incorporation ( in the absence of cortisol ) in the FMS group was approximately 1.5 times higher ( p < .05 ) than in the control or LBP group . 
The ED50 ( the cortisol concentration giving 50 % inhibition of the thymidine incorporation ) , however , was identical in all three groups . 
We conclude that FMS patients have a mild hypocortisolemia , increased cortisol feedback resistance in combination probably with a reduced CRH synthesis or release in the hypothalamus . 
The role of the <START:ggp> GR <END> and <START:ggp> mineralocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> MR <END> ) in the CRH regulation in the FMS patients remains to be solved . 
Temporal control of <START:ggp> IgH gene <END> expression in <START:ana> developing B cells <END> by the <START:ggp> 3 ' locus control region <END> . 
The suggested roles of the <START:ggp> downstream 3 ' regions <END> acting as a <START:ggp> Locus Control Region <END> ( <START:ggp> LCR <END> ) , have allowed comparisons to be made between the regulation of the <START:ggp> IgH locus <END> with other model systems whose gene expression is governed by <START:ggp> LCR <END> activity . 
Here we summarize the importance of the <START:ggp> IgH 3'LCR <END> and its putative functional role in <START:ggp> IgH gene <END> expression and compare it with the <START:ggp> 5'LCR regulatory region <END> of the <START:ggp> human beta-globin locus <END> . 
HLA binding characteristics and generation of <START:ana> cytotoxic lymphocytes <END> against peptides derived from <START:ggp> oncogenic proteins <END> . 
AIMS AND BACKGROUND : Structurally altered proteins ( derived from chromosomal translocations or gene mutations ) can be considered tumor specific antigens and represent an attractive target for a T-cell mediated response . 
T lymphocytes recognize antigens in the form of peptides bound to <START:ggp> HLA-molecules <END> . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Peptides derived from <START:ggp> oncogenic proteins <END> were screened for the presence of <START:ggp> HLA binding motifs <END> ; actual binding were evaluated by HLA stabilization experiments using transfectants and specific <START:ggp> anti-HLA antibodies <END> . 
Specific <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> were induced by in vitro peptide sensitization and screened by thymidine uptake or cellular cytotoxic assays . 
RESULTS : We identified peptides derived from <START:ggp> EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein <END> and from <START:ggp> mutated K-RAS protein <END> ( encompassing respectively the <START:ggp> fusion point <END> and the mutation at <START:ggp> position 12 <END> ) that showed <START:ggp> binding motif <END> for <START:ggp> HLA-Cw*0702 <END> and <START:ggp> HLA-A3 <END> respectively . 
The actual binding of these peptides was analysed in a stabilization assay . 
We detected binding for the EWS/FLI-1 peptide and for 5 RAS peptides ( 1 wild type and 4 mutated ) . 
The effect of temperature , <START:ggp> beta 2-microglobulin <END> ( <START:ggp> beta 2-m <END> ) and fetal calf serum ( FCS ) on the binding and the stability of the <START:ggp> HLA/peptide complex <END> was studied . 
A low temperature ( 26 degrees C ) increased the binding both in <START:ggp> HLA-A3 <END> and <START:ggp> HLA-Cw*0702 <END> , while FCS reduced it . 
<START:ggp> beta 2-m <END> increased the binding to the <START:ggp> HLA-A3 molecule <END> but did not influence the binding to the <START:ggp> HLA-Cw*0702 <END> . 
The stability of already formed complexed was somewhat different in the <START:ggp> HLA-A3 <END> and <START:ggp> HLA-Cw*0702 <END> system : both were more stable at 26 degrees C than at 37 degrees C but while the <START:ggp> beta 2-m <END> and FCS did not influence the stability of the <START:ggp> HLA-A3/peptide complex <END> , they seemed to cause opposite effects in the <START:ggp> HLA-Cw*0702 <END> system ( <START:ggp> beta 2-m <END> stabilized and FCS destabilized the complex ) . 
Finally , we were able to generate a specific <START:ana> CD8+ CTL line <END> against a K-RAS mutated peptide . 
CONCLUSIONS : Although <START:ggp> binding motifs <END> and actual HLA binding can be detected in several cases , the generation of a cellular response is infrequent , confirming that HLA binding is necessary but not sufficient to obtain an in vitro response . 
Further optimization of culture conditions , type of <START:ana> Antigen Presenting Cells <END> ( <START:ana> APC <END> ) , peptides , use of stabilizers like <START:ggp> beta 2-m <END> are still needed . 
<START:ggp> OCA-B <END> is a functional analog of <START:ggp> VP16 <END> but targets a separate surface of the <START:ggp> Oct-1 POU domain <END> [ published erratum appears in Mol Cell Biol 1998 Apr ; 18 ( 4 ) : 2430 ] 
<START:ggp> OCA-B <END> is a <START:ggp> B-cell-specific coregulator <END> of the broadly expressed <START:ggp> POU domain transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> OCA-B <END> associates with the <START:ggp> Oct-1 POU domain <END> , a bipartite DNA-binding structure containing a <START:ggp> POU-specific ( POU [ S ] ) domain <END> joined by a flexible linker to a <START:ggp> POU homeodomain <END> ( <START:ggp> POU [ H ] <END> ) . 
Here , we show that <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> alters the activity of <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> in two ways . 
It provides a transcriptional activation domain which , unlike <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> , activates an <START:ggp> mRNA-type promoter <END> effectively , and it stabilizes <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> on the <START:ggp> Oct-1-responsive octamer sequence <END> ATGCAAAT . 
These properties of <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> parallel those displayed by the <START:ggp> herpes simplex virus Oct-1 coregulator <END> <START:ggp> VP16 <END> . 
<START:ggp> OCA-B <END> , however , interacts with a different surface of the DNA-bound <START:ggp> Oct-1 POU domain <END> , interacting with both the <START:ggp> POU ( S ) and POU ( H ) domains <END> and the center of the <START:ggp> ATGCAAAT octamer sequence <END> . 
The OCA-B and <START:ggp> VP16 <END> interactions with the <START:ggp> Oct-1 POU domain <END> are sufficiently different to permit <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> and <START:ggp> VP16 <END> to bind the <START:ggp> Oct-1 POU domain <END> simultaneously . 
These results emphasize the structural versatility of the <START:ggp> Oct-1 POU domain <END> in its interaction with coregulators . 
<START:ggp> Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> couples the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor <END> to the <START:ggp> cell cycle regulator <END> <START:ggp> E2F <END> . 
Cell cycle progression initiated by <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) in <START:ana> T cells <END> is critical for lymphoproliferation and an immune response . 
<START:ggp> Phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PI3K <END> ) is activated by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
However , nuclear targets for <START:ggp> PI3K <END> are not known . 
Here we identify the <START:ggp> cell cycle regulator <END> <START:ggp> E2F <END> as an <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> target in T <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> and <START:ggp> PI3K <END> as the critical signaling pathway . 
We eliminate both <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> and <START:ggp> Raf <END> <START:ggp> /MEK <END> pathways from <START:ggp> E2F <END> regulation . 
<START:ggp> Protein kinase B <END> ( <START:ggp> PKB <END> ) is activated by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> via <START:ggp> PI3K <END> . 
The expression of an active <START:ggp> PKB <END> is sufficient to induce <START:ggp> E2F <END> activity . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> PI3K <END> inhibits phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Rb <END> , induction of <START:ggp> cyclin D3 <END> , and degradation of <START:ggp> p27kip1 <END> . 
These results establish a crucial <START:ggp> PI3K <END> / <START:ggp> PKB <END> -mediated link between the <START:ggp> IL-2 teceptor <END> and the cell cycle machinery . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus oncogene product <END> <START:ggp> latent membrane protein 1 <END> engages the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain protein to mediate B lymphocyte growth transformation and activate NF-kappaB . 
The Epstein-Barr virus <START:ggp> latent membrane protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> ) is essential for the transformation of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> into <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> . 
Previous data are consistent with a model that <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> is a <START:ggp> constitutively activated receptor <END> that transduces signals for transformation through its <START:ggp> carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail <END> . 
One <START:ggp> transformation effector site <END> ( <START:ggp> TES1 <END> ) , located within the <START:ggp> membrane proximal 45 residues <END> of the cytoplasmic tail , constitutively engages <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors <END> . 
Signals from <START:ggp> TES1 <END> are sufficient to drive initial proliferation of infected resting B <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , but most <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cells <END> infected with a virus that does not express the <START:ggp> 155 residues <END> beyond <START:ggp> TES1 <END> fail to grow as <START:ana> long-term cell lines <END> . 
We now find that mutating two tyrosines to an isoleucine at the <START:ggp> carboxyl end <END> of the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic tail <END> cripples the ability of EBV to cause lymphoblastoid cell outgrowth , thereby marking a second <START:ggp> transformation effector site <END> , <START:ggp> TES2 <END> . 
A yeast two-hybrid screen identified <START:ggp> TES2 interacting proteins <END> , including the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain protein <END> ( <START:ggp> TRADD <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> TRADD <END> was the only protein that interacted with <START:ggp> wild-type TES2 <END> and not with <START:ggp> isoleucine-mutated TES2 <END> . 
<START:ggp> TRADD <END> associated with <START:ggp> wild-type LMP1 <END> but not with isoleucine-mutated <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> in mammalian cells , and <START:ggp> TRADD <END> constitutively associated with <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> in <START:ana> EBV-transformed cells <END> . 
In transfection assays , <START:ggp> TRADD <END> and <START:ggp> TES2 <END> synergistically mediated high-level <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> appropriates <START:ggp> TRADD <END> to enable efficient long-term lymphoblastoid cell outgrowth . 
High-level <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation also appears to be a critical component of long-term outgrowth . 
Inhibition of <START:ana> T cell <END> and promotion of natural killer cell development by the <START:ggp> dominant negative helix loop helix factor <END> <START:ggp> Id3 <END> . 
<START:ana> Bipotential T/natural killer ( NK ) progenitor cells <END> are present in the human thymus . 
Despite their bipotential capacity , these progenitors develop predominantly to <START:ana> T cells <END> in the thymus . 
The mechanisms controlling this developmental choice are unknown . 
Here we present evidence that a member ( s ) of the family of <START:ggp> basic helix loop helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors <END> determines lineage specification of <START:ana> NK/T cell progenitors <END> . 
The natural <START:ggp> dominant negative HLH factor <END> <START:ggp> Id3 <END> , which blocks transcriptional activity of a number of known <START:ggp> bHLH factors <END> , was expressed in <START:ana> CD34+ progenitor cells <END> by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer . 
Constitutive expression of <START:ggp> Id3 <END> completely blocks development of <START:ana> CD34+ cells <END> into <START:ana> T cells <END> in a fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) . 
In contrast , development into <START:ana> NK cells <END> in an FTOC is enhanced . 
Thus , the activity of a <START:ggp> bHLH transcription factor <END> is necessary for T lineage differentiation of <START:ana> bipotential precursors <END> , in the absence of which a default pathway leading to NK cell development is chosen . 
Our results identify a molecular switch for lineage specification in <START:ana> early lymphoid precursors <END> of humans . 
Late gene expression from the Epstein-Barr virus <START:ggp> BcLF1 and BFRF3 promoters <END> does not require DNA replication in cis . 
Late gene expression follows and is dependent upon lytic replication of the <START:ggp> viral genome <END> . 
Although experimental evidence is lacking , lytic viral DNA replication is believed to remove modifications or <START:ggp> binding factors <END> from the genome which serve to repress late gene expression during latency or the early lytic cycle . 
We have developed a reporter assay to begin characterizing the mechanisms that regulate late gene expression in Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) . 
In this model system , the activities of <START:ggp> late promoter-reporter fusions <END> are measured following transient transfection into <START:ana> tissue culture cells <END> expressing EBV during different stages of the lytic cycle . 
This system faithfully recapitulates late expression patterns from the endogenous virus , implicating specific <START:ggp> cis-active sequences <END> in the control of late gene expression . 
In addition , these promoters respond only indirectly to the <START:ggp> viral immediate-early transactivator <END> , <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> . 
This indirect response is mediated by other viral or virally induced activities downstream of <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> in the lytic cascade . 
In this system , late gene expression is sensitive to inhibitors of the <START:ggp> viral DNA polymerase <END> such as phosphonoacetic acid , although the reporters lack a eukaryotic origin of replication and are not replicated under the assay conditions . 
Thus , replication of the <START:ggp> transcriptional template <END> is not a prerequisite for expression with late kinetics , a finding inconsistent with the current models which posit a cis-active relationship between lytic EBV DNA replication and late gene expression . 
Rather , analysis of this system has revealed a trans relationship between late gene expression and viral DNA replication and highlights the indirect and complex link between these two events . 
Modulation of mRNA expression of a <START:ggp> novel human myeloid-selective CCAAT/enhancer binding protein gene <END> ( <START:ggp> C/EBP epsilon <END> ) . 
Human <START:ggp> C/EBP epsilon <END> is a newly cloned gene coding for a <START:ggp> CCAAT/enhancer binding protein <END> that may be involved in the regulation of myeloid differentiation . 
Our studies showed that levels of <START:ana> C/EBP epsilon mRNA <END> were markedly increased in <START:ana> NB4 cells <END> ( <START:ana> promyelocytic leukemia line <END> ) , because they were induced by 9-cis retinoic acid ( 9-cis RA ) to differentiate towards <START:ana> granulocytes <END> . 
Accumulation of <START:ana> C/EBP epsilon mRNA <END> occurred as early as 1 hour after exposure of <START:ana> NB4 cells <END> to 9-cis RA ( 5 x 10 ( -7 ) mol/L ) ; and at 48 hours , levels were increased by 5.1-fold . 
Dose-response studies showed that 10 ( -7 ) to 10 ( -6 ) mol/L 9-cis RA ( 12 hours ) resulted in peak levels of <START:ana> C/EBP epsilon mRNA <END> ; but even 10 ( -10 ) mol/L 9-cis RA increased levels of these transcripts . 
<START:ana> NB4 cells <END> pulse-exposed ( 30 minutes ) to all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , washed , and cultured ( 3 days ) with either dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) or hexamethylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) had a prominent increase in levels of <START:ana> C/EBP epsilon mRNA <END> and an increase in granulocytic differentiation , but exposure to either DMSO or HMBA alone had no effect on base levels of C/EBP epsilon and did not induce differentiation . 
Macrophage-differentiation of <START:ana> NB4 <END> reduced levels of <START:ana> C/EBP epsilon mRNA <END> . 
Nuclear run-off assays and half-life studies showed that accumulation of <START:ana> C/EBP epsilon mRNA <END> by 9-cis RA was due to enhanced transcription . 
Furthermore , this <START:ana> C/EBP epsilon mRNA <END> accumulation did not require synthesis of new <START:ggp> protein factors <END> because 9-cis RA induced <START:ana> C/EBP epsilon mRNA <END> accumulation in the absence of new protein synthesis . 
ATRA also induced expression of <START:ggp> C/EBP epsilon protein <END> in <START:ana> NB4 cells <END> , as shown by Western blotting . 
In contrast to the increase of C/EBP epsilon in 9-cis RA-mediated granulocytic differentiation , the DMSO-induced differentiation of <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> down the granulocytic pathway was associated with an initial reduction of <START:ana> C/EBP epsilon mRNA <END> levels . 
In summary , we have discovered that expression of <START:ana> C/EBP epsilon mRNA <END> is markedly enhanced as the <START:ana> NB4 promyelocytes <END> are induced by retinoids to differentiate towards <START:ana> granulocytes <END> . 
This induction of <START:ana> C/EBP epsilon mRNA <END> expression is transcriptionally mediated and occurs in the absence of synthesis of additional <START:ggp> protein factors <END> . 
We suspect that the <START:ggp> C/EBP epsilon promoter/enhancer <END> contains a <START:ggp> retinoic acid-response element <END> that is directly stimulated by retinoids . 
Dual effects of <START:ggp> LPS antibodies <END> on cellular uptake of LPS and LPS-induced proinflammatory functions . 
<START:ana> Human phagocytes <END> recognize bacterial LPS ( endotoxin ) through <START:ggp> membrane CD14 <END> ( <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> ) , a <START:ggp> proinflammatory LPS receptor <END> . 
This study tested the hypothesis that <START:ggp> anti-LPS Abs <END> neutralize endotoxin by blocking cellular uptake through <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> . 
Ab-associated changes in the uptake and cellular distribution of FITC-LPS were assessed by flow cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy in <START:ana> human CD14-transfected Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts <END> ( <START:ana> CHO-CD14 cells <END> ) and <START:ana> human peripheral blood monocytes <END> . 
LPS <START:ggp> core- and O-side chain-specific mAbs <END> inhibited <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> -mediated LPS uptake by both cell types in the presence of serum . 
<START:ggp> O-side chain-specific mAb <END> concurrently enhanced complement-dependent LPS uptake by monocytes through <START:ggp> complement receptor-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> CR1 <END> ) and uptake by <START:ana> CHO-CD14 cells <END> involving another <START:ggp> heat-labile serum factor <END> ( s ) and <START:ggp> cell-associated recognition molecule <END> ( s ) . 
<START:ggp> Core-specific mAb <END> inhibited <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> -mediated uptake of homologous and heterologous LPS , while producing less concurrent enhancement of non- <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> -mediated LPS uptake . 
The modulation by <START:ggp> anti-LPS mAbs <END> of <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> -mediated LPS uptake was associated with inhibition of <START:ggp> LPS-induced nuclear factor-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) translocation and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> secretion in <START:ana> CHO-CD14 cells <END> and monocytes , respectively , while mAb enhancement of non- <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> -mediated LPS uptake stimulated these activities . 
<START:ggp> LPS-specific Abs <END> thus mediate anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory functions , respectively , by preventing target cell uptake of LPS through <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> and augmenting uptake through <START:ggp> CR1 <END> or other <START:ggp> cell receptors <END> . 
Four <START:ggp> P-like elements <END> are required for optimal transcription of the <START:ggp> mouse IL-4 gene <END> : involvement of a distinct set of <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> and <START:ggp> activator protein-1 family proteins <END> . 
We previously identified the <START:ggp> P sequence <END> as a critical <START:ggp> regulatory element <END> of the <START:ggp> human IL-4 promoter <END> . 
In the <START:ggp> mouse IL-4 promoter <END> , there are five elements homologous to the human <START:ggp> P sequence <END> designated <START:ggp> conserved lymphokine element 0 <END> ( <START:ggp> CLE0 <END> ) , <START:ggp> P <END> , <START:ggp> P2 <END> , <START:ggp> P3 <END> and <START:ggp> P4 <END> . 
To characterize the role of these <START:ggp> P-like elements <END> and their <START:ggp> binding factors <END> in the <START:ggp> native promoter <END> , we did transient transfection and electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) . 
Transfection of <START:ana> EL-4 cells <END> with the <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter-reporter constructs <END> carrying <START:ggp> mutated P-like elements <END> showed that four <START:ggp> P-like elements <END> , <START:ggp> CLE0 <END> , <START:ggp> P <END> , <START:ggp> P2 <END> and <START:ggp> P4 <END> , but not <START:ggp> P3 <END> , were required for optimal activation of the <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter <END> . 
EMSA showed that both constitutive and inducible complexes bound to <START:ggp> CLE0 <END> , <START:ggp> P <END> , <START:ggp> P2 <END> and <START:ggp> P4 <END> , whereas only a constitutive complex bound to <START:ggp> P3 <END> . 
In competition and antibody supershift assays in EMSA , complexes formed with <START:ggp> P <END> or <START:ggp> P2 <END> proved to contain <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family proteins <END> as major components . 
<START:ggp> Activator protein ( AP ) -1 family proteins <END> interacted with <START:ggp> CLE0 <END> , P , <START:ggp> P2 <END> and <START:ggp> P4 <END> . 
<START:ggp> NFAT/AP-1 complex <END> formed only with <START:ggp> P <END> and <START:ggp> P2 <END> . 
Cross-competition assays among the <START:ggp> P-like elements <END> revealed <START:ggp> element-specific and common complexes <END> . 
Six tandem repeats of the <START:ggp> P element <END> linked to the <START:ggp> SV40 promoter <END> responded to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate , while that of other elements did not. It would thus appear that components of each <START:ggp> P-like element-binding complexes <END> are not identical and may coordinately contribute to transcriptional activity . 
Constitutive expression <START:ana> c-fos , c-jun , and NF kappa B mRNA <END> is in <START:ana> nucleated fetal blood cells <END> and up-regulation of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> stimulation . 
<START:ana> Fetal and neonatal lymphocytes <END> are relatively resistant to activation and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production when stimulated either via their <START:ggp> T-cell antigen receptors <END> or <START:ggp> lectins <END> . 
The molecular mechanism ( s ) responsible for this phenomenon have not been clearly elucidated . 
We have hypothesized that such defects in fetal/neonatal T-cell activation may be due to lack of expression of the <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory elements <END> required for T-cell activation . 
We used <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase <END> -polymerase chain reaction to examine both fetal and term neonatal cord bloods for mRNA expression of three <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> implicated in T-cell activation : <START:ggp> c-jun <END> , <START:ggp> c-fos <END> , and <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> p50 subunit <END> ) . 
We demonstrate that <START:ana> mRNAs <END> for all three of these regulatory factors are expressed in <START:ana> fetal blood cells <END> by the 27th week of gestation and in term cord bloods . 
Activation of <START:ana> term infant cord blood mononuclear cells <END> with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies <END> resulted in up-regulation of both <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and c-fos <START:ana> mRNAs <END> within 15 min of stimulation . 
However , secretion of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> by <START:ana> anti-CD3-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells <END> was still blunted compared with <START:ana> control cells <END> from adults . 
We conclude that <START:ana> fetal nucleated blood cells <END> constitutively express important genes for <START:ggp> cytokine <END> regulation and are able to increase intracellular accumulation of the <START:ana> mRNAs <END> for these factors in response to <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> stimulation . 
Thus , qualitative differences in the capacity to regulate these factors could not be shown in <START:ana> fetal blood cells <END> . 
Quantitative experiments comparing binding of these <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> to the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> are currently under investigation . 
Nuclear accumulation of <START:ggp> NFAT4 <END> opposed by the <START:ggp> JNK <END> signal transduction pathway . 
The <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) group <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> is retained in the cytoplasm of <START:ana> quiescent cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation is mediated in part by induced nuclear import . 
This process requires calcium-dependent dephosphorylation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> caused by the <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
The <START:ggp> c-Jun amino-terminal kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> JNK <END> ) phosphorylates <START:ggp> NFAT4 <END> on two sites . 
Mutational removal of the <START:ggp> JNK phosphorylation sites <END> caused constitutive nuclear localization of <START:ggp> NFAT4 <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> JNK <END> activation in <START:ana> calcineurin-stimulated cells <END> caused nuclear exclusion of <START:ggp> NFAT4 <END> . 
These findings show that the nuclear accumulation of <START:ggp> NFAT4 <END> promoted by <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> is opposed by the <START:ggp> JNK <END> signal transduction pathway . 
Thiol modulation inhibits the <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -1 <END> -mediated activation of an <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor-associated protein kinase <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
The <START:ggp> interleukin-1 receptor type I <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1RI <END> ) is associated with other proteins thus forming a <START:ggp> complex system <END> by which <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> exerts its various signals . 
The initiating event is still uncertain , but activation of a recently described <START:ggp> receptor-associated protein kinase <END> is one of the earliest events detectable ( Martin et al. , Eur.J.Immunol.1994.24 : 1566 ) . 
<START:ggp> IL-1 <END> signaling is commonly accompanied by oxidative processes and is thought to be subject to redox regulation . 
We therefore investigated whether the activation of the <START:ggp> IL-1RI-associated protein kinase <END> could be a target for redox regulation and whether an altered activity of the kinase could influence <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
A <START:ana> murine T cell line <END> , <START:ana> EL4 <END> , was stimulated with <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> with and without pretreatment with different compounds known to influence the cellular redox status . 
Thiol modifying agents like diamide , menadione , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , diethyl dithiocarbamate or phenylarsine oxide inhibited the <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -induced activation of the <START:ggp> IL-1RI-associated protein kinase <END> . 
N-Acetylcysteine , alpha , alpha'-dipyridyl , aminotriazole or nitrofurantoin did not show any effect . 
The inhibition by PDTC was reversible unless glutathione synthesis was blocked by buthionine sulfoximine . 
The described conditions which inhibited or prevented the activation of the <START:ggp> IL-1RI-associated kinase <END> similarly impaired the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> EL4 cells <END> . 
From these observations we conclude that free thiols in the <START:ggp> IL-1RI complex <END> are essential for the activation of the <START:ggp> IL-1RI-associated protein kinase <END> and that this process is mandatory for <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> signaling leading to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
Switching gears during T-cell maturation : <START:ggp> RANTES <END> and late transcription . 
Although much is understood about the induction of <START:ggp> genes <END> expressed early ( within 24 h ) after T-cell activation , little is known about the regulation of expression of <START:ggp> genes <END> expressed 'late ' ( three or more days ) post-stimulation . 
A better understanding of transcriptional regulation at this important stage of T-cell maturation may yield new insights into T-cell development and new immunotherapeutic targets . 
Involvement of different transduction pathways in <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation by several <START:ggp> inducers <END> . 
Double-stimulation was used to demonstrate that , in a <START:ana> T lymphocytic cell line <END> ( <START:ana> CEM <END> ) , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) rapidly induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> through a signaling pathway which did not involve reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and was different from the activation triggered by either H2O2 or <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) . 
Since these latter compounds were known to activate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation in a redox-sensitive way , we have demonstrated that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation by PMA was resistant to antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) and sensitive to kinase inhibitors staurosporine and H7 while activation by H2O2 or <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> were not . 
Blockade of T-cell activation by dithiocarbamates involves novel mechanisms of inhibition of <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> . 
Dithiocarbamates ( DTCs ) have recently been reported as powerful inhibitors of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in a number of cell types . 
Given the role of this transcription factor in the regulation of gene expression in the inflammatory response , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> inhibitors have been suggested as potential therapeutic drugs for inflammatory diseases . 
We show here that DTCs inhibited both <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) synthesis and membrane expression of <START:ggp> antigens <END> which are induced during T-cell activation . 
This inhibition , which occurred with a parallel activation of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> transactivating functions and expression , was reflected by transfection experiments at the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> level , and involved not only the inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -driven reporter activation but also that of <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) . 
Accordingly , electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) indicated that pyrrolidine DTC ( PDTC ) prevented <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , and <START:ggp> NFAT <END> DNA-binding activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> stimulated with either phorbol myristate acetate plus ionophore or antibodies against the <START:ggp> CD3-T-cell receptor complex <END> and simultaneously activated the binding of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
Furthermore , PDTC differentially targeted both <START:ggp> NFATp and NFATc family members <END> , inhibiting the transactivation functions of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> and mRNA induction of <START:ggp> NFATc <END> . 
Strikingly , Western blotting and immunocytochemical experiments indicated that PDTC promoted a transient and rapid shuttling of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> and <START:ggp> NFATc <END> , leading to their accelerated export from the nucleus of <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
We propose that the activation of an NFAT kinase by PDTC could be responsible for the rapid shuttling of the <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , therefore transiently converting the sustained transactivation of this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> that occurs during lymphocyte activation , and show that <START:ggp> c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> JNK <END> ) can act by directly phosphorylating <START:ggp> NFATp <END> . 
In addition , the combined inhibitory effects on <START:ggp> NFAT <END> and <START:ggp> NF-KB <END> support a potential use of DTCs as immunosuppressants . 
Activation of a <START:ggp> novel gene <END> in <START:ggp> 3q21 <END> and identification of intergenic fusion transcripts with <START:ggp> ecotropic viral insertion site I <END> in leukemia . 
We have identified a <START:ggp> novel gene <END> , <START:ggp> GR6 <END> , located within the leukemia breakpoint region of <START:ggp> 3q21 <END> , that is normally expressed in early fetal development but not in adult peripheral blood . 
<START:ggp> GR6 <END> is activated in the <START:ana> UCSD-AML1 cell line <END> and in a <START:ana> leukemic sample <END> , both of which carry a <START:ggp> t ( 3 ; 3 ) ( q21 ; q26 ) <END> . 
In <START:ana> UCSD-AML1 <END> , we have also identified <START:ana> fusion transcripts <END> between the <START:ggp> ecotropic viral insertion site I ( EVI1 ) gene <END> in <START:ggp> 3q26 <END> and <START:ggp> GR6 <END> and between <START:ggp> EVI1 <END> and <START:ggp> Ribophorin I <END> that maps 30 kb telomeric to <START:ggp> GR6 <END> in <START:ggp> 3q21 <END> . 
All fusions splice the <START:ggp> 5 ' ends <END> of the <START:ggp> 3q21 genes <END> into <START:ggp> exon 2 <END> of the <START:ggp> EVI1 <END> gene , an event that is similar to the normal intergenic splicing of <START:ggp> MDS1-EVI1 <END> and to those previously documented in leukemias with <START:ggp> t ( 3 ; 21 ) <END> and <START:ggp> t ( 3 ; 12 ) <END> , in which acute <START:ggp> myelogenous leukemia 1-EVI1 fusions <END> and <START:ggp> ETV6-EVI1 fusions <END> , respectively , occur . 
The <START:ggp> Ribophorin I-EVI1 fusion <END> in particular may be a common occurrence in <START:ggp> t ( 3 ; 3 ) <END> . 
The <START:ggp> A-myb transcription factor <END> in <START:ana> neoplastic and normal B cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> myb family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> has been strongly implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in the haematopoietic system . 
The <START:ggp> v-myb oncogene <END> , carried by avian defective retroviruses , causes leukaemias in the chicken and transforms <START:ana> haematopoietic cells <END> in vitro . 
Its normal cellular equivalent <START:ggp> c-myb <END> , has been shown to promote the proliferation and block the differentiation of <START:ana> haematopoietic cells <END> in several experimental models and is required for fetal haematopoiesis . 
Two other members of the family have been cloned more recently , <START:ggp> A-myb <END> and <START:ggp> B-myb <END> , which show sequence homology with <START:ggp> c-myb <END> in several domains , of which the <START:ggp> DNA binding domain <END> as well as other <START:ggp> regulatory domains <END> . 
Both have been shown to be <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
<START:ggp> B-myb <END> is also involved in the control of proliferation and differentiation , but , unlike <START:ggp> c-myb <END> , it is expressed in many cell types . 
The third member of the <START:ggp> family <END> , <START:ggp> A-myb <END> , shows the most restricted pattern of expression , suggesting a very specific role for this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> A-myb <END> is expressed in a subpopulation of <START:ana> normal B lymphocytes <END> activated in vivo and localised in the germinal center of peripheral lymphoid organs and is not detected at significant levels in all other mature or <START:ana> immature haematopoietic populations <END> studied , including <START:ana> bone marrow cells <END> , <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , <START:ana> granulocytes <END> , <START:ana> monocytes <END> , either at rest or after in vitro activation . 
These studies indicate that <START:ggp> A-myb <END> plays a role during a narrow window of <START:ana> normal B cell <END> differentiation . 
<START:ggp> A-myb <END> expression has also been studied in a wide range of <START:ana> neoplastic B cells <END> , representing the whole spectrum of B cell differentiation . 
<START:ggp> A-myb <END> is strongly expressed in Burkitt 's lymphomas ( BL ) and slg+ B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemias ( B-ALL ) and not in all other leukaemias/lymphomas tested , with the exception of a subset of CLL ( about 25 % of cases ) . 
It is intriguing that the <START:ggp> A-myb genome <END> has been localised relatively close to the <START:ggp> c-myc gene <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 8 <END> , suggesting that the c-myc translocation in BL and B-ALL may affect <START:ggp> A-myb <END> transcription . 
Studies are in progress to investigate the functional relationship between <START:ggp> A-myb <END> and <START:ggp> c-myc <END> , particularly in the context of <START:ana> BL cells <END> and to determine whether <START:ggp> A-myb <END> is deregulated in these cells . 
Expression of <START:ggp> bcl-6 protein <END> in normal skin and epidermal neoplasms . 
<START:ggp> Bcl-6 protein <END> is a recently identified novel <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> whose deregulated expression is associated with diffuse large B cell lymphomas . 
It was recently shown by us that the protein is located in <START:ana> germinal center B cells <END> and their <START:ana> neoplastic counterparts <END> . 
In the present study , the expression of <START:ggp> bcl-6 protein <END> on normal epidermis , benign , and malignant tumors originating from <START:ana> epidermal cells <END> , and <START:ana> squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) cell lines <END> are investigated . 
With the use of immunohistochemistry , <START:ggp> bcl-6 protein <END> was shown to stain intensely on <START:ana> normal prickle cells <END> , but none to only slightly on <START:ana> epidermal basal cells <END> . 
Papillomas and keratoacanthomas copied their normal counterparts in the mode of expression . 
Various levels of expression were found on seborrheic keratoses , while the expression level on basal cell epitheliomas was low . 
Peculiarly , eccrine poromas and undifferentiated spindle-shaped basal cell epitheliomas were totally unstained . 
Squamous cell carcinomas showed a variety of expression levels , while two undifferentiated spindle-shaped carcinomas and one undifferentiated <START:ana> SCC cell line <END> remained unstained . 
These results suggest that the expression of <START:ggp> bcl-6 protein <END> may be associated with morphological differentiation in normal and <START:ana> neoplastic epidermal cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Sp3 <END> mediates transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> leukocyte integrin genes <END> <START:ggp> CD11C <END> and <START:ggp> CD11B <END> and cooperates with c-Jun to activate <START:ggp> CD11C <END> . 
The <START:ggp> leukocyte integrin genes <END> <START:ggp> CD11c <END> and <START:ggp> CD11b <END> are expressed predominately in myelomonocytic cells . 
In previous experiments , the <START:ggp> -70 to -65 and -121 to -103 regions <END> of the <START:ggp> CD11c promoter <END> and the <START:ggp> -66 to -59 region <END> of the <START:ggp> CD11b promoter <END> were shown to be essential for <START:ggp> Sp1- <END> mediated activation of these genes . 
In vivo genomic footprinting had also revealed cell-specific binding of protein , presumably <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , to these regions . 
In this study , electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed that the <START:ggp> Sp1-related factor <END> , <START:ggp> Sp3 <END> , also binds at or near these same regions . 
Cotransfection of <START:ggp> Sp3 <END> along with <START:ggp> CD11c promoter-luciferase constructs <END> into <START:ana> Sp-deficient Drosophila Schneider 2 cells <END> showed that <START:ggp> Sp3 <END> could activate the <START:ggp> CD11c promoter <END> . 
Deletion of both the <START:ggp> -70 to -65 and -121 to -103 regions <END> of the <START:ggp> CD11c promoter <END> resulted in the loss of activation by <START:ggp> Sp3 <END> . 
Both sites showed activation by <START:ggp> Sp3 <END> ; however , the <START:ggp> -70 to -65 region <END> was more responsive to <START:ggp> Sp3 <END> than to <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> . 
Similar transfection analysis of the <START:ggp> -66 to -59 region <END> of the <START:ggp> CD11b promoter <END> showed <START:ggp> Sp3 <END> -dependent expression . 
Further , cotransfection analysis in <START:ana> Drosophila cells <END> showed that <START:ggp> Sp3 <END> , as was previously shown for <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , also synergizes with <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> to activate <START:ggp> CD11c <END> . 
Antisense experiments that knocked out endogenous <START:ggp> Sp3 <END> expression in the <START:ana> myelomocytic cell line <END> , <START:ana> HL60 <END> , revealed that <START:ggp> Sp3 <END> participates in activation of the <START:ggp> CD11c and CD11b promoters <END> in vivo . 
The <START:ggp> winged-helix transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Trident <END> is expressed in actively <START:ana> dividing lymphocytes <END> . 
We recently identified the <START:ggp> winged-helix transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Trident <END> and described its expression pattern in <START:ana> synchronized fibroblasts <END> . 
We have now studied <START:ggp> Trident <END> expression in <START:ana> cell lines <END> , <START:ana> differentiating thymocytes <END> and in lymphocytes derived from peripheral blood . 
During T cell differentiation , expression peaked in the <START:ana> actively dividing immature single positive cells <END> . 
In peripheral blood lymphocytes , expression of <START:ana> Trident mRNA <END> was absent , but could be induced upon stimulation with mitogens in vitro . 
These observations imply a function for <START:ggp> Trident <END> in <START:ana> dividing lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Estrogen receptor <END> diminishes DNA-binding activities of <START:ggp> chicken GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> CACCC-binding proteins <END> . 
The <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) repressed erythroid differentiation and <START:ggp> erythroid-specific gene <END> expression . 
In this study , we investigated the effect of <START:ggp> ER alpha <END> ( referred to throughout as <START:ggp> ER <END> ) on DNA-binding activities of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> involved in regulating the expression of <START:ggp> erythroid-specific genes <END> , and , in particular , the <START:ggp> histone H5 gene <END> . 
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we found that in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate , <START:ggp> human ER <END> reduced the binding activities of <START:ggp> chicken immature erythrocyte nuclear extracted proteins <END> to <START:ggp> GATA and CACCC sites <END> in the <START:ggp> H5 promoter and enhancer <END> . 
In contrast , the binding activities of <START:ggp> NF1 <END> and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> were not affected by <START:ggp> ER <END> . 
Binding of <START:ggp> ER <END> to an <START:ggp> estrogen response element <END> was enhanced by addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate . 
This lysate was also necessary for <START:ggp> ER <END> to diminish the DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> . 
These results suggest that additional factor ( s ) are necessary for full <START:ggp> ER <END> function . 
Both <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> CACCC-binding proteins <END> are critical for the developmentally regulated expression of <START:ggp> erythroid-specific genes <END> . 
We hypothesize that interference in DNA-binding activities of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> CACCC-binding proteins <END> is the mechanism by which the <START:ggp> ER <END> inhibits regulation of these genes . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> Id3 <END> cell cycle function by Cdk-2-dependent phosphorylation . 
The functions of <START:ggp> basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors <END> in activating differentiation-linked gene expression and in inducing G1 cell cycle arrest are negatively regulated by members of the <START:ggp> Id family of HLH proteins <END> . 
These <START:ggp> bHLH antagonists <END> are induced during a mitogenic signalling response , and they function by sequestering their <START:ggp> bHLH targets <END> in <START:ggp> inactive heterodimers <END> that are unable to bind to specific <START:ggp> gene regulatory ( E box ) sequences <END> . 
Recently , cyclin E-Cdk2- and cyclin A-Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of a single conserved serine residue ( Ser5 ) in <START:ggp> Id2 <END> has been shown to occur during late G1-to-S phase transition of the cell cycle , and this neutralizes the function of <START:ggp> Id2 <END> in abrogating <START:ggp> E-box-dependent bHLH <END> homo -or heterodimer complex formation in vitro ( E.Hara , M.Hall , and G.Peters , EMBO J.16 : 332-342 , 1997 ) . 
We now show that an analogous cell-cycle-regulated phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Id3 <END> alters the specificity of <START:ggp> Id3 <END> for abrogating both <START:ggp> E-box-dependent bHLH <END> homo- or heterodimer complex formation in vitro and E-box-dependent <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> function in vivo . 
Furthermore , compared with <START:ggp> wild-type Id3 <END> , an <START:ggp> Id3 Asp5 mutant <END> ( mimicking phosphorylation ) is unable to promote cell cycle S phase entry in <START:ana> transfected fibroblasts <END> , whereas an <START:ggp> Id3 Ala5 mutant <END> ( ablating phosphorylation ) displays an activity significantly greater than that of <START:ggp> wild-type Id3 protein <END> . 
Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation therefore provides a switch during late G1-to-S phase that both nullifies an early G1 cell cycle regulatory function of <START:ggp> Id3 <END> and modulates its target <START:ggp> bHLH <END> specificity . 
These data also demonstrate that the ability of <START:ggp> Id3 <END> to promote cell cycle S phase entry is not simply a function of its ability to modulate <START:ggp> bHLH <END> heterodimer-dependent gene expression and establish a biologically important mechanism through which Cdk2 and Id-bHLH functions are integrated in the coordination of cell proliferation and differentiation . 
Molecular cloning and functional characterization of <START:ggp> murine cDNA encoding transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NFATc <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factors <END> of the <START:ggp> NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) family <END> play important roles in immune and inflammatory responses by regulating the expression of genes encoding <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> immunoregulatory proteins <END> . 
Here we describe cloning and characterization of full-length <START:ggp> cDNA encoding murine ( m ) NFATc <END> which predicts that the protein has all the <START:ggp> conserved structural motifs <END> of <START:ggp> NFAT family members <END> , including the rel homology domain , the <START:ggp> NFAT homology domain <END> and the nuclear translocation signals . 
<START:ggp> mNFATc <END> complexed with <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> bound specifically to the <START:ggp> murine IL-2 NFAT recognition sequence <END> and activated transcription from the <START:ggp> co-transfected IL-2 promoter <END> in <START:ana> COS-7 cells <END> . 
Northern blot analysis showed that the <START:ggp> cDNA probe <END> hybridized with a 4.5 kb transcript which is highly inducible in <START:ana> murine T cells <END> . 
By Northern and in situ hybridization , <START:ana> mNFATc transcript <END> was detected from the early stage of development . 
In the mouse embryo , <START:ana> mNFATc transcript <END> was strongly expressed in thymus , lung and submandibular gland and weakly in skeletal muscle and heart suggesting that <START:ggp> mNFATc <END> may have a role both in embryogenesis and in <START:ana> mature T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> cooperates with the <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> pathway to synergistically increase <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> transcription via downstream <START:ggp> TRE-like cAMP response elements <END> . 
<START:ggp> Activating protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) binding <START:ggp> TPA responsive elements <END> ( <START:ggp> TRE <END> ) are located downstream of the <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> in the <START:ggp> U5 region <END> of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) . 
These <START:ggp> downstream sequence elements <END> , termed <START:ggp> DSE <END> , can bind both <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> CREB/ATF <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Recently , we demonstrated that the <START:ggp> DSE <END> are also <START:ggp> cAMP-responsive elements <END> ( <START:ggp> CRE <END> ) , since they mediated activation signals elicited by <START:ggp> cholera toxin <END> ( <START:ggp> Ctx <END> ) , a potent activator of the cAMP-dependent <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> ( <START:ggp> PKA <END> ) signal transduction pathway . 
In the present study , we demonstrate that the <START:ggp> HIV-1 DSE <END> can mediate the transcriptional synergy elicited by the combination of <START:ggp> Ctx <END> and <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> Ctx <END> combined with <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> or <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> to produce a synergistic increase in <START:ggp> p24 antigen <END> production in <START:ana> U1 promonocytic cells <END> . 
Transfection studies of <START:ggp> LTR reporter constructs <END> indicated that mutation of the <START:ggp> DSE sites <END> abrogated the <START:ggp> LTR <END> -mediated synergy induced by <START:ggp> Ctx <END> and <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> , whereas the synergy induced by <START:ggp> Ctx <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> was unaffected , suggesting <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> cooperate differently with the cAMP <START:ggp> /PKA <END> activation pathway to induce HIV-1 expression in <START:ana> U1 cells <END> . 
Because the <START:ggp> DSE <END> are also <START:ggp> TRE <END> sites , we assessed the effect of the agonist combinations on <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -dependent transcription . 
<START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> as well as <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> cooperated with <START:ggp> Ctx <END> to produce a synergistic activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -mediated transcription . 
These data indicate that the <START:ggp> TRE-like cAMP-responsive DSE sites <END> within the <START:ggp> 5'-untranslated leader <END> can mediate the transcriptional cooperativity between <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> and the cAMP <START:ggp> /PKA <END> pathway . 
Since the <START:ggp> DSE <END> and <START:ggp> TRE <END> sites can not bind <START:ggp> CREB/ATF homodimers <END> , we propose a mechanism in which the HIV-1 <START:ggp> DSE <END> bind <START:ggp> heterodimers <END> composed of both <START:ggp> AP-1 and CREB/ATF proteins <END> .

Association of glucocorticoid insensitivity with increased expression of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor beta <END> . 
In many chronic inflammatory disorders , glucocorticoid ( GC ) insensitivity is a challenging clinical problem associated with life-threatening disease progression . 
The molecular basis of GC insensitivity , however , is unknown . 
Alternative splicing of the <START:ana> GC receptor ( R ) pre-messenger RNA <END> generates a second <START:ggp> GCR <END> , termed <START:ggp> GCR-beta <END> , which does not bind GCs but antagonizes the transactivating activity of the classic <START:ggp> GCR <END> , termed <START:ggp> GCR-alpha <END> . 
In the current study , we demonstrate that GC-insensitive asthma is associated with a significantly higher number of <START:ana> GCR-beta-immunoreactive cells <END> in peripheral blood than GC-sensitive asthmatics or normal controls . 
Furthermore , we show that patients with GC-insensitive asthma have cytokine-induced abnormalities in the DNA binding capability of the <START:ggp> GCR <END> . 
These abnormalities can be reproduced by transfection of <START:ana> cell lines <END> with the <START:ggp> GCR-beta <END> gene resulting in significant reduction of their <START:ggp> GCR-alpha <END> DNA binding capacity . 
We conclude that increased expression of <START:ggp> GCR-beta <END> is <START:ggp> cytokine <END> inducible and may account for GC insensitivity in this common inflammatory condition . 
Epstein-Barr virus <START:ggp> EBNA3C <END> represses <START:ggp> Cp <END> , the major promoter for <START:ggp> EBNA <END> expression , but has no effect on the promoter of the <START:ggp> cell gene CD21 <END> . 
<START:ggp> EBNA3C <END> is a potent repressor of transcription when bound to DNA as a fusion with the <START:ggp> DNA binding domain <END> ( <START:ggp> DBD <END> ) of GALA . 
A survey of promoters has revealed that the <START:ggp> wild-type , unfused EBNA3C <END> can specifically repress expression from <START:ggp> reporter plasmids <END> containing the Epstein-Barr virus <START:ggp> Cp latency-associated promoter <END> . 
Repression of <START:ggp> Cp <END> activity required <START:ggp> amino acids 207 to 368 <END> , which encompasses a region resembling a <START:ggp> basic DBD <END> adjacent to a <START:ggp> leucine zipper DNA binding motif <END> and a site which binds to the <START:ggp> cellular factor CBF1/RBP-Jkappa <END> . 
However , amino acids 207 to 368 are dispensable when the protein is bound to DNA as a fusion with the GAL4 <START:ggp> DBD <END> , thus implicating this region in DNA binding . 
Mutation of the <START:ggp> CBF1/RBP-Jkappa binding site <END> in <START:ggp> EBNA3C <END> abrogated repression , strongly suggesting that <START:ggp> CBF1/RBP-Jkappa <END> is necessary for targeting the viral protein to <START:ggp> Cp <END> . 
Consistent with this result , mutation of the <START:ggp> EBNA2 response element <END> ( a <START:ggp> CBF1/RBP-Jkappa binding site <END> ) in <START:ggp> Cp <END> also prevented significant repression . 
In addition , <START:ggp> amino acids 346 to 543 <END> , which were previously defined as important for the repressor activity of the <START:ggp> GAL4-EBNA3C fusion proteins <END> , also appear to be necessary for the repression of <START:ggp> Cp <END> . 
Since repression by these fusions was not observed in all cell types , it seems likely that <START:ggp> EBNA3C <END> either depends on a <START:ggp> corepressor <END> which may interact with <START:ggp> amino acids 346 to 543 <END> or is modified in a cell-specific manner in order to repress . 
These data are consistent with <START:ggp> EBNA3C <END> contributing to the regulation of <START:ggp> EBNA <END> expression in <START:ana> latently infected B cells <END> through <START:ggp> CBF1/RBP-Jkappa <END> and another factor , but this need not directly involve <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> . 
Finally , although it has been reported that <START:ggp> EBNA3C <END> can upregulate <START:ggp> CD21 <END> in some <START:ana> B cells <END> , we were unable to demonstrate any effect of <START:ggp> EBNA3C <END> on <START:ggp> reporter plasmids <END> which contain the <START:ggp> CD21 promoter <END> . 
Relationship between <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> and response to glucocorticoid therapy in ulcerative colitis . 
PURPOSE : To clarify the relationship between the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> and the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis , we investigated the number and apparent dissociation constant of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes <END> of patients with ulcerative colitis . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Eleven patients with ulcerative colitis ( 5 who responded to intravenous glucocorticoids and 6 who did not ) and ten control subjects were studied . 
The number and apparent dissociation constant of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> were measured using a whole-cell binding assay . 
Results were expressed as a median ( interquartile range ) . 
RESULTS : The number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> from the six nonresponders , five responders , and ten healthy controls were 4922 ( range , 4484-5643 ) , 3413 ( range , 3183-4450 ) , and 3610 ( range , 2594-3979 ) binding sites/cell , respectively . 
The apparent dissociation constant of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> from the nonresponders , responders , and healthy controls were 7.03 ( range , 5.66-10 ) , 4.27 ( range , 4-5.13 ) , and 6.18 ( range , 5.86-6.74 ) nM , respectively . 
Nonresponders had a significant increase both in the number of <START:ggp> binding sites <END> and in the apparent dissociation constant compared with responders ( P = 0.045 ; P = 0.029 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : The increased number and apparent dissociation constant of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> are closely associated with the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy . 
The measurement of the number and apparent dissociation constant of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> may be useful in predicting response to glucocorticoids . 
Cooperation of <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> and <START:ggp> NF kappa B/rel <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -induced up-regulation of the <START:ggp> human IgE germline promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> Ig heavy chain <END> class switching is directed by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> inducing transcription from unrearranged <START:ggp> CH genes <END> . 
Subsequently , such <START:ana> primed cells <END> can undergo switch recombination to express the selected new isotype . 
In the case of <START:ggp> IgE <END> class switching , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> activates the <START:ggp> IgE germline promoter <END> by inducing the interaction of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4STAT <END> ) with a <START:ggp> responsive DNA element <END> in the <START:ggp> proximal region <END> of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> . 
This study describes the characterization of two additional <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> that interact with members of the <START:ggp> NF kappa B/rel transcription factor family <END> in an <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -independent fashion . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that the <START:ggp> nucleoprotein complex <END> formed on the <START:ggp> upstream site <END> ( <START:ggp> NF kappa B1 <END> ) contains the <START:ggp> classical p50/p65 heterodimer <END> . 
The complex on the <START:ggp> proximal site <END> ( <START:ggp> NF kappa B2 <END> ) appears to be composed of <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> relB <END> . 
<START:ggp> IgE germline promoter reporter gene constructs <END> carrying point mutations in the <START:ggp> NF kappa B2 <END> site were largely unresponsive to <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> stimulation in transient transfection experiments , while plasmids with similar mutations in the <START:ggp> NF kappa B1 <END> site responded to <START:ggp> cytokine <END> stimulation better than the <START:ggp> wild-type promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> NF kappa B2 <END> effect was dependent on the presence of the <START:ggp> STAT6 binding site <END> , demonstrating that the <START:ggp> NF kappa B2 motif <END> is necessary but not sufficient for mediating <START:ggp> cytokine <END> up-regulation . 
In addition , the combination of a <START:ggp> NF kappa B/rel binding site <END> and the <START:ggp> STAT6 response element <END> conferred <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> inducibility to a <START:ggp> heterologous minimal promoter <END> , while the individual sites had no effect . 
The available data suggest that the <START:ggp> NF kappa B2 nucleoprotein complex <END> may cooperate with <START:ggp> DNA-bound STAT6 <END> to achieve <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -dependent activation of the <START:ggp> human IgE germline gene <END> . 
Alcohol-induced regulation of <START:ggp> nuclear regulatory factor-kappa beta <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Acute ethanol exposure has the capacity to modulate immune functions , particularly , to down regulate monocyte production of <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> . 
However , the intracellular mechanisms for these effects of ethanol are yet to be understood . 
Considering that <START:ggp> nuclear regulatory factor-kappa beta <END> <START:ggp> ( NF-kappa B ) /Rel <END> is a common <START:ggp> regulatory element <END> of the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> of the <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokine genes <END> , herein , we tested the hypothesis that acute ethanol affects <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
<START:ana> Adherence-isolated monocytes <END> showed constitutive DNA binding activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
A clinically relevant dose ( 25 mM ) of acute ethanol treatment in vitro increased <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity in <START:ana> monocytes <END> with a preferential induction of the inhibitory , <START:ggp> p50/p50 <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel homodimer <END> , and resulted in no induction of the <START:ggp> p65/p50 heterodimer <END> . 
In contrast , lipopolysaccharide stimulation primarily induced the <START:ggp> p65/p50 heterodimer <END> that has been shown to result in gene activation . 
Thus , such unique activation of the <START:ggp> inhibitory p50/p50 homodimer <END> by acute ethanol treatment may result in inhibition rather than activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-regulated inflammatory cytokine genes <END> . 
Consequently , these results suggest that physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol may affect production of <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> , such as <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin-1 beta <END> , and <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> by disrupting <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> signaling in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
LPS tolerance in <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> : three 3 ' cytosins are required in the <START:ggp> DNA binding motif <END> for detection of upregulated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p50 homodimers <END> . 
When <START:ana> monocytes <END> are stimulated with LPS ( lipopolysaccharide ) repeatedly then the initially high expression of the <START:ggp> TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ) gene <END> is only very low , i.e. the cells are tolerant to LPS . 
Tolerant cells still express the <START:ggp> CD14 receptor <END> and they can still be activated to mobilize <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> into nucleus . 
Analysis of the binding proteins employing the -605 motif of the <START:ggp> human TNF promoter <END> ( GGGGCTGTCCC ) revealed that in tolerant cells of the <START:ana> human monocytic cell line <END> <START:ana> Mono Mac 6 <END> there is a predominance of <START:ggp> p50p50 <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
We now show that a <START:ggp> mutant motif <END> that exchanges the terminal 3 ' C for a G fails to bind the <START:ggp> p50 homodimer <END> that is upregulated in LPS toler ant <START:ana> human Mono Mac 6 cells <END> . 
The same is true for nuclear extracts taken from the <START:ana> murine P388D1 macrophage cell line <END> when tested with the <START:ggp> -516 motif <END> of the <START:ggp> murine TNF promoter <END> ( GGGGGCTTTCCC ) . 
Here the <START:ggp> wild type motif <END> gives efficient binding of <START:ggp> p50p50 <END> that again is upregulated in <START:ana> tolerant cells <END> whereas a mutant with a 3 ' G shows hardly any binding of <START:ggp> p50p50 <END> . 
Conversely , the <START:ggp> murine kappa light chain enhancer motif <END> ( GGGGACTTTCCG ) does not efficiently bind the nuclear <START:ggp> p50p50 <END> from <START:ana> tolerant murine P388 macrophages <END> . 
Binding is , however , readily detected when the 3 ' G is replaced by a C . 
These data show that the detection of upregulated <START:ggp> p50 homodimers <END> in LPS <START:ana> tolerant cells <END> is dependent on subtle differences in the sequence of the <START:ggp> DNA binding motif <END> . 
Cyclosporin A inhibits early mRNA expression of <START:ggp> G0/G1 switch gene 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> G0S2 <END> ) in <START:ana> cultured human blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) may achieve its immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting the <START:ggp> calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> which is required for activation of <START:ggp> target genes <END> by members of the <START:ggp> NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) transcription factor family <END> . 
Among these <START:ggp> target genes <END> is the gene encoding <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL2 <END> ) , a <START:ggp> cytokine <END> facilitating progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle . 
However , <START:ggp> IL2 <END> does not reverse CsA inhibition , suggesting that at least one other <START:ggp> NFAT-sensitive gene <END> may be involved . 
The <START:ggp> human G0/G1 switch gene <END> , <START:ggp> G0S2 <END> , has potential <START:ggp> NFAT-binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> 5 ' flank <END> and encodes a <START:ggp> small basic potential phosphoprotein <END> of unknown function . 
Using a sensitive , reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assay , <START:ggp> G0S2 <END> mRNA levels were assayed in <START:ana> cultured blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
Freshly isolated cells contain high levels of <START:ana> G0S2 mRNA <END> which rapidly decline . 
This `` spontaneous stimulation '' is also noted with some other <START:ggp> G0S genes <END> and has been attributed to some aspect of the isolation procedure . 
In cells that have been preincubated to lower mRNA levels , there is a transient increase in <START:ana> G0S2 mRNA <END> , peaking between 1-2 h , in response to Concanavalin-A ( ConA ) , or to the combination of phorbol ester ( TPA ) , and the calcium ionophore , ionomycin . 
Both these responses are inhibited by CsA . 
Our results suggest that <START:ggp> G0S2 <END> expression is required to commit cells to enter the G1 phase of the cell cycle , and that , while not excluding other possible targets , early inhibition of <START:ggp> G0S2 <END> expression by CsA may be important in achieving immunosuppression . 
<START:ggp> G0S2 <END> may be of value as a reporter gene for analyzing the mechanism of action of CsA and its influence on the positive and negative selection of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> in response to self and not-self antigens . 
<START:ggp> c-Rel and p65 subunits <END> bind to an <START:ggp> upstream NF-kappaB site <END> in <START:ggp> human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor promoter <END> involved in phorbol ester response in <START:ana> 5637 cells <END> . 
To further clarify the complex transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> human GM-CSF gene <END> , which was extensively investigated in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> , we have studied the role of an upstream <START:ggp> NF-kappaB like site <END> in the <START:ana> 5637 non-lymphoid cell line <END> , which derives from a bladder carcinoma and constitutively produces <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> . 
This sequence , named the A element , has an active role on <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> transcription and is responsive to the <START:ggp> tumor promoter PMA <END> in transient transfection experiments . 
We describe here a <START:ggp> heterodimeric binding complex <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB subunits <END> ( <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> and <START:ggp> p65 <END> ) which is identical to the one obtained using the <START:ggp> HIV-LTR-kappaB site <END> as recognition sequence and different from the one ( <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> and <START:ggp> p50 <END> ) observed with nuclear extracts from <START:ana> Mo T-lymphoid HTLV-II infected cells <END> . 
Repression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 through the novel cooperation of <START:ggp> human factors <END> <START:ggp> YY1 <END> and <START:ggp> LSF <END> [ published erratum appears in J Virol 1998 Feb ; 72 ( 2 ) : 1709 ] 
A subpopulation of <START:ana> stably infected CD4+ cells <END> capable of producing virus upon stimulation has been identified in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -positive individuals ( T.-W.Chun , D.Finzi , J.Margolick , K.Chadwick , D.Schwartz , and R.F.Siliciano , Nat.Med.1 : 1284-1290 , 1995 ) . 
Few host factors that directly limit HIV-1 transcription and could support this state of nonproductive HIV-1 infection have been described . 
<START:ggp> YY1 <END> , a widely distributed <START:ggp> human transcription factor <END> , is known to inhibit <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) transcription and virus production . 
<START:ggp> LSF <END> ( also known as <START:ggp> LBP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> UBP <END> , and <START:ggp> CP-2 <END> ) has been shown to repress LTR transcription in vitro , but transient expression of <START:ggp> LSF <END> has no effect on <START:ggp> LTR <END> activity in vivo . 
We report that both <START:ggp> YY1 <END> and <START:ggp> LSF <END> participate in the formation of a complex that recognizes the initiation region of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> . 
Further , we have found that these factors cooperate in the repression of <START:ggp> LTR <END> expression and viral replication . 
This cooperative function may account for the divergent effects of <START:ggp> LSF <END> previously observed in vitro and in vivo . 
Thus , the cooperation of two general cellular transcription factors may allow for the selective downregulation of HIV transcription . 
Through this mechanism of gene regulation , <START:ggp> YY1 <END> and <START:ggp> LSF <END> could contribute to the establishment and maintenance of a population of cells stably but nonproductively infected with HIV-1 . 
Analysis of interactions between <START:ggp> huGATA-3 <END> transcription factor and three <START:ggp> GATA regulatory elements <END> of <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> , by surface plasmon resonance . 
Relative affinities of <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory elements <END> for their respective factor have been essentially studied by bandshift analysis . 
Here we report a real-time study of factor/DNA interactions using a surface plasmon resonance approach and further characterization of <START:ggp> recovered proteins <END> involved in this interaction . 
For this purpose , <START:ggp> human GATA-3 <END> , either recombinant or in nuclear extracts , and three <START:ggp> natural GATA elements <END> of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> sites 1 , 2 , and 3 <END> ) were chosen , in which only <START:ggp> site 2 <END> is a noncanonical <START:ggp> GATA site <END> . 
Direct analysis of sensorgrams , with <START:ggp> recombinant huGATA-3 <END> , allowed the comparison of association and dissociation profiles of the three <START:ggp> DNA regions <END> and their ranking according to their relative affinities . 
This result , confirmed by competitions with each <START:ggp> GATA site <END> , demonstrated the higher relative affinity ( at least sevenfold ) of site 3 . 
Interactions between the canonical and unique <START:ggp> GATA site 3 <END> and nuclear extracts were also studied in real time and provided information on its association and dissociation rates for native <START:ggp> huGATA-3 <END> . 
Finally , recovered protein was identified as genuine <START:ggp> huGATA-3 <END> by SDS-PAGE , Western blotting , and bandshift assays .

Stable transfection of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> with sense or <START:ggp> antisense RXR-alpha cDNA <END> suggests a role for <START:ggp> RXR-alpha <END> in the control of monoblastic differentiation induced by retinoic acid and vitamin D . 
Although retinoic acid ( RA ) has been known for many years to be a modulating agent that plays a role in generating both <START:ana> granulocytes <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> , the molecular mechanism underlying this role has not been defined in the <START:ana> monoblast lineage <END> . 
In particular , the part played by the <START:ggp> retinoid X receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RXRs <END> ) , which are members of the <START:ggp> steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptor family <END> , has not been explored . 
In this study , therefore , the <START:ana> human monoblastic leukemia cell line U937 <END> has been used as a model system to investigate the role of one of the <START:ggp> RXRs <END> , <START:ggp> RXR-alpha <END> , in monoblast differentiation . 
<START:ana> RXR-alpha mRNA <END> was present in untreated <START:ana> U937 cells <END> , and levels increased after induction of differentiation with phorbol ester . 
The same was found for <START:ana> RXR-beta mRNA <END> . 
Using plasmids containing sense or <START:ggp> antisense RXR-alpha sequences <END> under the control of an inducible promoter , we generated stably transfected cell lines which expressed either increased or decreased levels of <START:ggp> RXR-alpha <END> , respectively . 
The <START:ana> sense cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> U alpha S <END> and its clonal derivative alpha <START:ana> G2S <END> ) showed increased sensitivity to RA , while the <START:ana> antisense cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> U alpha A <END> and its clonal derivative alpha <START:ana> B5A <END> ) showed decreased sensitivity to RA , as demonstrated by growth inhibition and by regulation of an <START:ggp> RA-responsive reporter gene <END> . 
Both <START:ana> U alpha A <END> and alpha <START:ana> B5A <END> also failed to respond to another modulating agent , 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol ( DHCC ) , but only <START:ana> U alpha S <END> and not <START:ggp> alpha G2S <END> showed an enhanced response to DHCC . 
The combination of RA and DHCC together inhibited growth of both sense and <START:ana> antisense cell lines <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> alpha G2S <END> exhibited increased expression of <START:ggp> CD11b <END> and <START:ggp> CD54 <END> , while <START:ana> alpha B5A cells <END> showed increased expression of <START:ggp> CD102 <END> , suggesting that <START:ggp> RXR-alpha <END> has a role in regulating expression of <START:ggp> cell adhesion molecules <END> in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
These results demonstrate that <START:ggp> RXR-alpha <END> has a role in mediating growth inhibition and cell adhesion during myelomonocytic differentiation , and suggest that different species of <START:ggp> heterodimers <END> involving <START:ggp> RXR-alpha <END> may control the acquisition of different features of mature monocyte/macrophage function . 
Transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 gene <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> expressing <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein <END> . 
Recruitment and extravasation of <START:ana> T cells <END> through the blood-brain barrier are favored by <START:ggp> adhesion molecule <END> -mediated interactions of <START:ana> circulating T cells <END> with <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> . 
Since a common pathological finding in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) -associated diseases is the infiltration of <START:ana> HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes <END> into various organs , we have looked for the profile of <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> expressed by <START:ana> HTLV-1-transformed T cells <END> . 
Flow cytometry analysis indicated that these cells were expressing high levels of <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> [ <START:ggp> CD106 <END> ] ) , a 110-kDa member of the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin gene superfamily <END> , first identified on <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> stimulated with <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> . 
This adhesion molecule was also expressed by <START:ana> T cells <END> obtained from one patient with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis but not by <START:ana> activated T cells <END> isolated from one normal blood donor . 
The role of the <START:ggp> viral trans-activator Tax protein <END> in the induction of <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> was first indicated by the detection of this <START:ggp> adhesion molecule <END> on <START:ana> Jurkat T-cell clones <END> stably expressing the tax gene . 
The effect of <START:ggp> Tax <END> on <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> gene transcription was next confirmed in <START:ana> JPX-9 cells <END> , a subclone of <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , carrying the <START:ggp> tax sequences <END> under the control of an <START:ggp> inducible promoter <END> . 
Furthermore , deletion and mutation analyses of the <START:ggp> VCAM-1 promoter <END> performed with <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs <END> revealed that <START:ggp> Tax <END> was trans activating the <START:ggp> VCAM-1 promoter <END> via two <START:ggp> NF-kappaB sites <END> present at bp -72 and -57 in the <START:ggp> VCAM-1 gene promoter <END> , with both of them being required for the <START:ggp> Tax <END> -induced expression of this <START:ggp> adhesion molecule <END> . 
Finally , gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the nuclear translocation of proteins specifically bound to these two <START:ggp> NF-kappaB motifs <END> , confirming that <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> was induced on <START:ana> Tax-expressing cells <END> in a <START:ggp> kappaB <END> -dependent manner . 
Collectively , these results therefore suggest that the exclusive <START:ggp> Tax <END> -induced expression of <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> on <START:ana> T cells <END> may represent a pivotal event in the progression of HTLV-1-associated diseases . 
<START:ggp> HIV-1 Vpr <END> suppresses immune activation and apoptosis through regulation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> [ see comments ] 
The <START:ggp> HIV-1 accessory gene product <END> <START:ggp> Vpr <END> can influence viral pathogenesis by affecting viral replication as well as host cell transcription and proliferation . 
We have investigated the effects of <START:ggp> Vpr <END> on host cell activation and confirm that it influences cellular proliferation . 
However , we have also found that <START:ggp> Vpr <END> modulates T-cell receptor ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) -triggered apoptosis in a manner similar to that of glucocorticoids . 
In the absence of <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated activation , <START:ggp> Vpr <END> induces apoptosis whereas in its presence , <START:ggp> Vpr <END> interrupts the expected induction of apoptosis . 
This regulation of apoptosis is linked to <START:ggp> Vpr <END> suppression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity via the induction of <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Further , <START:ggp> Vpr <END> suppresses expression of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , all of which are <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -dependent . 
The effects of <START:ggp> Vpr <END> could be reversed by RU486 . 
Our finding that <START:ggp> Vpr <END> can regulate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> supports the hypothesis that some aspects of viral pathogenesis are the consequence of cell dysregulation by <START:ggp> Vpr <END> . 
Tissue transglutaminase-dependent posttranslational modification of the <START:ggp> retinoblastoma gene product <END> in <START:ana> promonocytic cells <END> undergoing apoptosis . 
The <START:ggp> retinoblastoma gene product <END> ( <START:ggp> pRB <END> ) plays an important role in controlling both cell release from the G1 phase and apoptosis . 
We show here that in the early phases of apoptosis , <START:ggp> pRB <END> is posttranslationally modified by a tissue transglutaminase ( <START:ggp> tTG <END> ) -catalyzed reaction . 
In fact , by employing a novel haptenized lysis synthetic substrate which allows the isolation of glutaminyl-tTG substrates in vivo , we identified <START:ggp> pRB <END> as a potential tTG substrate in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> undergoing apoptosis . 
In keeping with this finding , we showed that apoptosis of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> is characterized by the rapid disappearance of the 105 , 000- to 110 , 000-molecular-weight <START:ggp> pRB <END> forms concomitantly with the appearance of a smear of immunoreactive products with a molecular weight of greater than 250 , 000 . 
The shift in <START:ggp> pRB <END> molecular weight was reproduced by adding exogenous purified tTG to extracts obtained from viable <START:ana> U937 cells <END> and was prevented by dansylcadaverine , a potent enzyme inhibitor . 
The effect of the <START:ggp> pRB <END> posttranslational modification during apoptosis was investigated by determining the <START:ggp> E2F-1 <END> levels and by isolating and characterizing <START:ana> pRB-null clones <END> from <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
Notably , the lack of <START:ggp> pRB <END> in these <START:ana> U937-derived clones <END> renders these <START:ana> p53-null cells <END> highly resistant to apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal , calphostin C , and ceramide . 
Taken together , these data suggest that <START:ggp> tTG <END> , acting on the <START:ggp> pRB protein <END> , might play an important role in the cell progression through the death program . 
<START:ggp> STAT3 <END> is a <START:ggp> serine kinase target <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin 2 <END> and <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> signals converge upon serine 727 . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STATs 3 and 5 <END> ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) . 
We now show that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> regulation of <START:ggp> STAT3 proteins <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> is a complex response involving activation of two forms of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> : 90-kDa <START:ggp> STAT3alpha <END> and an <START:ggp> 83-kDa carboxyl-terminal truncated STAT3beta <END> . 
The phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> on serine residues is also required for competent <START:ggp> STAT <END> transcription . 
A critical <START:ggp> serine phosphorylation site <END> in <START:ggp> STAT3alpha <END> is at position 727 . 
In this study we have produced an antisera specific for <START:ggp> STAT3alpha proteins <END> phosphorylated on serine 727 and used this to monitor the phosphorylation of this residue during T lymphocyte activation . 
Our results show that phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT3alpha <END> on serine 727 is not constitutive in <START:ana> quiescent T cells <END> but can be induced by the <START:ggp> cytokine IL-2 <END> . 
Interestingly , triggering of the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor complex <END> or activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> with phorbol esters also induces phosphorylation of serine 727 but without simultaneously inducing <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> tyrosine phosphorylation or DNA binding . 
Hence , the present results show that <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> serine phosphorylation can be regulated independently of the tyrosine phosphorylation of this molecule . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor complex <END> induction of <START:ggp> STAT3alpha <END> serine 727 phosphorylation is dependent on the activity of the <START:ggp> MEK <END> <START:ggp> /ERK <END> pathway . 
Previous studies have identified H-7-sensitive kinase pathways that regulate <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> DNA binding . 
We show that H-7-sensitive pathways regulate <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> DNA binding in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Nevertheless , we show that <START:ggp> H-7-sensitive kinases <END> do not regulate <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> tyrosine phosphorylation or phosphorylation of serine 727 . 
These results thus show that <START:ggp> STAT3 proteins <END> are targets for multiple kinase pathways in <START:ana> T cells <END> and can integrate signals from both <START:ggp> cytokine receptors <END> and <START:ggp> antigen receptors <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel family members <END> regulating the <START:ggp> ICAM-1 promoter <END> in <START:ana> monocytic THP-1 cells <END> . 
A <START:ggp> kappa B-site <END> was identified in the promoter of the <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) gene <END> , which is involved in regulation of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> expression by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) and glucocorticoids . 
We now report on the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> which bind and transactivate this <START:ggp> enhancer sequence <END> . 
In vitro , the <START:ggp> ICAM-1 kappa B site <END> appeared to bind <START:ggp> RelA <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel homodimers <END> as well as heterodimers with <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 <END> , but weakly <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 homodimers <END> . 
In addition , both <START:ggp> RelA <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , but not <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 <END> , were shown to transactivate an <START:ggp> ICAM-1 kappa B-reporter construct <END> . 
In <START:ana> monocytic THP-1 cells <END> <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> induced two <START:ggp> nuclear complexes <END> which in vitro bound to the <START:ggp> ICAM-1 kappa B site <END> . 
Using antibodies in an electrophoretic mobility supershift assay , one of these complexes was shown to contain <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 <END> and <START:ggp> RelA <END> , and to bind with higher affinity to the <START:ggp> consensus kappa B site <END> in the <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> . 
The second complex contained <START:ggp> RelA <END> , and exhibited higher affinity towards the <START:ggp> ICAM-1 kappa B <END> than to the <START:ggp> HIV kappa B site <END> . 
The <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> was shown to repress activity of both the <START:ggp> RelA homodimer <END> and the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1/RelA heterodimer <END> . 
We argue that in vivo <START:ggp> RelA homodimers <END> are likely to play a dominant role in <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -induced <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> transcription in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
Competent transcription initiation by <START:ggp> RNA polymerase II <END> in <START:ana> cell-free extracts <END> from xeroderma pigmentosum groups B and D in an optimized RNA transcription assay . 
The human autosomal recessive disease , xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) , can result from mutations in any one of seven genes , designated <START:ggp> XPA <END> through <START:ggp> XPG <END> . 
Of these , the <START:ggp> XPB and XPD genes <END> encode proteins that are subunits of a <START:ggp> general transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> TFIIH <END> , involved in both nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and initiation of mRNA transcription by <START:ggp> RNA polymerase II <END> . 
In humans , mutation of the <START:ggp> XPB or XPD gene <END> impairs NER , resulting in hyper-sensitivity to sunlight and greatly increased skin tumor formation . 
However , no transcription deficiency has been demonstrated in either XP-B or XP-D . 
We have employed an optimized cell-free RNA transcription assay to analyze transcription activity of XP-B and XP-D . 
Although the growth rate was normal , the <START:ana> XP-B and XP-D cells <END> contained reduced amounts of <START:ggp> TFIIH <END> . 
Extracts prepared from <START:ana> XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells <END> exhibited similar transcription activity from the <START:ggp> adenovirus major late promoter <END> when compared to that in extracts from normal cells . 
Thus , we conclude that the <START:ana> XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells <END> do not have impaired RNA transcription activity . 
We consider the possible consequences of the reduced cellular content of <START:ggp> TFIIH <END> for the clinical symptoms in XP-B or XP-D patients , and discuss a 'conditional phenotype ' that may involve an impairment of cellular function only under certain growth conditions . 
A novel form of the <START:ggp> myeloid-specific zinc finger protein <END> ( <START:ggp> MZF-2 <END> ) . 
BACKGROUND : Myeloid cell development is controlled by tissue-specific <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
<START:ggp> Human myeloid zinc finger protein <END> ( <START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> ) is a putative transcription factor containing <START:ggp> 13 zinc fingers <END> , and has been suggested that it regulates the development of <START:ana> neutrophilic granulocytes <END> . 
RESULTS : Here , we have isolated the <START:ggp> murine and human cDNAs <END> which encode a novel form of <START:ggp> MZF protein <END> ( <START:ggp> MZF-2 <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> Murine and human MZF-2 proteins <END> consisted of 814 and 775 amino acids , respectively , and have identity of 75.3 % between them . 
The <START:ggp> C-terminal half <END> of <START:ggp> human MZF-2 <END> , carrying the <START:ggp> zinc finger domains <END> , was completely identical with that of <START:ggp> human MZF-1 <END> , whereas the <START:ggp> N-terminal half <END> of <START:ggp> MZF-2 <END> was different from the corresponding region of human <START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> , and was coded by distinct <START:ggp> exons <END> . 
<START:ana> MZF-2 mRNA <END> was expressed in myeloid cells , particularly in the cells committed to the <START:ana> neutrophilic lineage <END> , and down-regulated by <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> . 
CONCLUSIONS : <START:ana> MZF-1 and MZF-2 mRNAs <END> seem to be produced by the alternative use of two different <START:ggp> transcription initiation sites <END> . 
The distinct <START:ggp> N-terminal half <END> of <START:ggp> MZF-2 <END> carries two characteristic domains , a <START:ggp> leucine-rich domain <END> called <START:ggp> LeR <END> and an <START:ggp> acidic domain <END> , which suggests a unique function of <START:ggp> MZF-2 <END> in neutrophil development . 
Impaired cortisol binding to <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in hypertensive patients . 
We compared glucocorticoid receptor binding characteristics and glucocorticoid responsiveness of <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> ( <START:ana> HML <END> ) from hypertensive patients and matched normotensive volunteers . 
We also considered associations of these variables with plasma <START:ggp> renin <END> activity , aldosterone , cortisol , corticotropin , and electrolyte concentrations . 
We calculated binding affinity ( Kd ; nmol/L ) and capacity ( Bmax ; sites/cell ) for dexamethasone and cortisol from homologous and heterologous competition curves for specific [ 3H ] dexamethasone binding sites on <START:ana> HML <END> isolated from the blood of normotensive volunteers and subjects with essential hypertension . 
Glucocorticoid responsiveness of <START:ana> HML <END> was evaluated as IC50 values ( nmol/L ) for dexamethasone and cortisol for the inhibition of <START:ggp> lysozyme <END> release . 
We measured plasma hormones by radioimmunoassay . 
Kd values ( mean+/-SE ) for cortisol in <START:ana> HML <END> of hypertensive patients were higher than in control subjects ( 24.6+/-2.4 versus 17.5+/-1.7 nmol/L , P < .04 ) . 
Binding capacity ( 4978+/-391 versus 4131+/-321 sites/cell ) , Kd values for dexamethasone ( 6.7+/-0.5 versus 5.7+/-0.3 nmol/L ) , and IC50 values for dexamethasone ( 3.4+/-0.3 versus 3.1+/-0.2 nmol/L ) and cortisol ( 12.2+/-1.6 versus 9.5+/-0.3 nmol/L ) were not significantly different . 
Patients with <START:ggp> renin <END> values less than 0.13 ng angiotensin I/L per second were markedly less sensitive to cortisol than those with higher values . 
Both Kd ( 30.3+/-2.5 versus 19.2+/-2.4 nmol/L ) and IC50 values ( 15.5+/-1.8 versus 8.9+/-1.2 nmol/L ) for cortisol were significantly higher in patients with lower <START:ggp> renin <END> values ( P < .03 ) . 
Other variables , including plasma hormone and electrolyte values and binding characteristics for dexamethasone , were not different . 
These data suggest that cortisol binding to <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> is slightly impaired in patients with essential hypertension . 
In vivo , this could lead to inappropriate binding of cortisol to mineralocorticoid receptors . 
Hence , decreased sensitivity to cortisol is associated with <START:ggp> renin <END> suppression . 
This hypothesis is supported by evidence of hypertension and low <START:ggp> renin <END> activity , which others have described in patients with primary glucocorticoid resistance due to mutations of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
<START:ggp> PU.1/Pip <END> and <START:ggp> basic helix loop helix zipper transcription factors <END> interact with <START:ggp> binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> CD20 promoter <END> to help confer lineage- and stage-specific expression of <START:ggp> CD20 <END> in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD20 <END> is a <START:ggp> B-lineage-specific gene <END> expressed at the pre-B-cell stage of B-cell development that disappears on differentiation to <START:ana> plasma cells <END> . 
As such , it serves as an excellent paradigm for the study of lineage and developmental stage-specific gene expression . 
Using in vivo footprinting we identified two sites in the promoter at <START:ggp> -45 and -160 <END> that were occupied only in <START:ggp> CD20 <END> + B cells . 
The <START:ggp> -45 site <END> is an <START:ggp> E box <END> that binds <START:ggp> basic helix-loop-helix-zipper proteins <END> whereas the <START:ggp> -160 site <END> is a <START:ggp> composite PU.1 and Pip binding site <END> . 
Transfection studies with <START:ggp> reporter constructs <END> and various expression vectors verified the importance of these sites . 
The <START:ggp> composite PU.1 and Pip site <END> likely accounts for both lineage and stage-specific expression of <START:ggp> CD20 <END> whereas the <START:ggp> CD20 E box binding proteins <END> enhance overall promoter activity and may link the promoter to a <START:ggp> distant enhancer <END> . 
Glucocorticoids and the immune function in the human immunodeficiency virus infection : a study in hypercortisolemic and cortisol-resistant patients . 
Immunological studies in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -positive patients suggest that the disease progression is accompanied by a defective production of type <START:ggp> 1 cytokines <END> ( <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> ] , an increased production of <START:ggp> type 2 cytokines <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ) , and an increased production of <START:ggp> IgE <END> . 
HIV infection is also associated with activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis function and increased plasma and urinary cortisol concentrations . 
As cortisol is involved in the physiological regulation of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , a study was conducted to examine <START:ggp> cytokine <END> patterns in two groups of hypercortisolemic patients , one with normal sensitivity to glucocorticoids and the other with glucocorticoid resistance . 
Ten HIV-infected patients with normal receptor affinity to glucocorticoids ( AIDS-C ) , 10 HIV-infected patients with low receptor affinity to glucocorticoids ( AIDS-GR ) , and 20 healthy subjects were studied . 
Receptor characteristics of <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> were evaluated by [ 3H ] dexamethasone binding . 
Serum cortisol and urinary free cortisol were measured by RIA . 
Serum ACTH and <START:ggp> IgE <END> were measured by immunoradiometric assay , and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . 
AIDS-C patients showed low <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and high <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , and <START:ggp> IgE <END> concentratios ; conversely , AIDS-GR patients showed high <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and low <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IgE <END> concentrations . 
Thus , in HIV infection , elevated cortisol levels suppress cell-mediated immunity and stimulate humoral immunity , whereas this response is not detected in cortisol-resistant patients . 
These findings indicate that cortisol and its receptors are critically involved in the regulation of immune function in HIV infection . 
Monocytic differentiation of <START:ana> HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells <END> correlates with the induction of <START:ggp> Bcl-xL <END> . 
Treatment of <START:ana> human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells <END> with phorbol esters ultimately induces the differentiation of these cells along the <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage lineage <END> , whereas treatment with retinoic acid or DMSO induces granulocytic/neutrophillic differentiation . 
In this study , we demonstrate the disparate fates of <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> treated with the phorbol ester 12 , 13-phorbol dibutyric acid ( PDBu ) or DMSO . 
After DMSO treatment , <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> eventually died via apoptosis , whereas the viability of <START:ana> PDBu-treated cells <END> was not affected during the same interval . 
The levels of the apoptosis effector proteins <START:ggp> Bak <END> and <START:ggp> Bad <END> were enhanced , whereas there was a slight down-regulation of the <START:ggp> apoptosis suppressor protein <END> <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> after treatment of the cells with PDBu and DMSO . 
Treatment with DMSO resulted in the elevation of the <START:ggp> apoptosis effector <END> <START:ggp> Bax <END> , whereas treatment with PDBu did not significantly alter the levels of this protein . 
However , treatment of <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> with PDBu induced the rapid expression of the <START:ggp> apoptosis suppressor protein <END> <START:ggp> Bcl-xL <END> , whereas the expression of this protein remained unaltered in DMSO-treated cells . 
The generality of this finding was confirmed by the induction of <START:ggp> Bcl-xL <END> in <START:ana> human myeloid U-937 cells <END> , <START:ana> human peripheral blood monocytes <END> exposed to phorbol ester , and <START:ana> mouse thioglycollate-activated and resident peritoneal macrophages <END> . 
<START:ana> PDBu-treated HL-60 cells <END> remained viable for 7 days and thereafter began to die via apoptosis , with a concomitant down-regulation of <START:ggp> Bcl-xL <END> . 
In conclusion , we propose that <START:ggp> Bcl-xL <END> expression is associated with differentiation and survival of <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> along the <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage lineage <END> . 
Monochloramine inhibits phorbol ester-inducible neutrophil respiratory burst activation and T cell <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> receptor expression by inhibiting inducible <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> activity . 
Monochloramine derivatives are long lived physiological oxidants produced by <START:ana> neutrophils <END> during the respiratory burst . 
The effects of chemically prepared monochloramine ( NH2Cl ) on <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) and <START:ggp> PKC <END> -mediated cellular responses were studied in <START:ana> elicited rat peritoneal neutrophils <END> and <START:ana> human Jurkat T cells <END> . 
Neutrophils pretreated with NH2Cl ( 30-50 microM ) showed a marked decrease in the respiratory burst activity induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , which is a potent <START:ggp> PKC <END> activator . 
These cells , however , were viable and showed a complete respiratory burst upon arachidonic acid stimulation , which induces the respiratory burst by a <START:ggp> PKC <END> -independent mechanism . 
The <START:ana> NH2Cl-treated neutrophils <END> showed a decrease in both <START:ggp> PKC <END> activity and PMA-induced phosphorylation of a <START:ggp> 47-kDa protein <END> , which corresponds to the <START:ggp> cytosolic factor <END> of <START:ggp> NADPH oxidase <END> , <START:ggp> p47 ( phox ) <END> . 
<START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> pretreated with NH2Cl ( 20-70 microM ) showed a decrease in the expression of the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> <START:ggp> receptor alpha chain <END> following PMA stimulation . 
This was also accompanied by a decrease in both <START:ggp> PKC <END> activity and nuclear transcription factor- <START:ggp> kappaB <END> activation , also without loss of cell viability . 
These results show that NH2Cl inhibits <START:ggp> PKC <END> -mediated cellular responses through inhibition of the inducible <START:ggp> PKC <END> activity . 
Evidence that calcineurin is rate-limiting for primary human lymphocyte activation . 
Cyclosporine ( CsA ) is both a clinical immunosuppressive drug and a probe to dissect intracellular signaling pathways . 
In vitro , CsA inhibits <START:ggp> lymphocyte gene <END> activation by inhibiting the <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> activity of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> ( <START:ggp> CN <END> ) . 
In clinical use , CsA treatment inhibits 50-75 % of <START:ggp> CN <END> activity in <START:ana> circulating leukocytes <END> . 
We modeled this degree of <START:ggp> CN <END> inhibition in <START:ana> primary human leukocytes <END> in vitro in order to study the effect of partial <START:ggp> CN <END> inhibition on the downstream signaling events that lead to gene activation . 
In <START:ana> CsA-treated leukocytes <END> stimulated by calcium ionophore , the degree of reduction in <START:ggp> CN <END> activity was accompanied by a similar degree of inhibition of each event tested : dephosphorylation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cell proteins <END> , nuclear DNA binding , activation of a <START:ggp> transfected reporter gene construct <END> , IFN-gamma and IL-2 mRNA accumulation , and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> production . 
Furthermore , the degree of <START:ggp> CN <END> inhibition was reflected by a similar degree of reduction in lymphocyte proliferation and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> production in the <START:ana> allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures <END> . 
These data support the conclusion that <START:ggp> CN <END> activity is rate-limiting for the activation of <START:ana> primary human T lymphocytes <END> . 
Thus , the reduction of <START:ggp> CN <END> activity observed in CsA-treated patients is accompanied by a similar degree of reduction in <START:ggp> lymphocyte gene <END> activation , and accounts for the immunosuppression observed . 
Selection of <START:ggp> down-regulated sequences <END> along the monocytic differentiation of <START:ana> leukemic HL60 cells <END> . 
In order to dissect the molecular mechanisms of monocytic differentiation we have developed a subtractive hybridisation method based on a simplified 'representational difference analysis' . 
We have selected <START:ggp> 16 sequences <END> and confirmed their down-regulation along the TPA-induced monocytic differentiation of <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> . 
Among these sequences we have identified the <START:ggp> alpha-tubulin <END> , the <START:ggp> TaxREB protein <END> and two <START:ggp> ribosomal protein sequences <END> which had not been previously described as differentially expressed . 
These results add to our knowledge about the molecules implicated along the monocytic differentiation and growth arrest of <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> and provide a first step in the study of their respective roles . 
Control of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity by the <START:ggp> I kappa B beta inhibitor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is maintained in an inactive cytoplasmic state by <START:ggp> I kappa B inhibitors <END> . 
In <START:ana> mammalian cells <END> , <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B beta proteins <END> have been purified and shown to be the inhibitors of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> through their association with the <START:ggp> p65 or c-Rel subunits <END> . 
In addition , we have isolated a third <START:ggp> NF-kappa B inhibitor <END> , <START:ggp> I kappa B epsilon <END> ( 1 ) . 
Upon treatment with a large variety of inducers , <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> , <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> are proteolytically degraded , resulting in <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation into the nucleus . 
Here we show that in <START:ana> E29.1 T cell hybridoma <END> <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> are equally associated with <START:ggp> p65 <END> and that <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> is degraded in response to <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> in contrast to what has been originally published . 
Our data also suggest that , unlike <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> , <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> is constitutively phosphorylated and resynthesized as a <START:ggp> hypophosphorylated form <END> . 
The absence of slow migrating forms of <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> following stimulation suggests that the phosphorylation does not necessarily constitute the signal-induced event which targets the molecule for proteolysis . 
Agonistic activity of a <START:ggp> CD40-specific single-chain Fv <END> constructed from the <START:ggp> variable regions <END> of <START:ggp> mAb G28-5 <END> . 
A <START:ggp> single-chain Fv <END> ( <START:ggp> sFv <END> ) was expressed from the <START:ggp> variable regions <END> of the CD40-specific <START:ggp> mAb G28-5 <END> . 
The molecule bound <START:ggp> CD40 <END> with a high affinity ( 2.2 nM ) and was a monomer in solution . 
Surprisingly , <START:ggp> G28-5 sFv <END> was a potent <START:ggp> CD40 agonist <END> that rapidly crosslinked <START:ggp> CD40 <END> on the cell surface but did not crosslink <START:ggp> CD40-Ig <END> in solution . 
<START:ggp> G28-5 sFv <END> was a more potent agonist than <START:ggp> G28-5 IgG <END> and was able to stimulate <START:ggp> CD40 <END> responses by <START:ana> B cells <END> and monocytes . 
<START:ggp> G28-5 IgG <END> partially blocked , whereas <START:ggp> G28-5 sFv <END> augmented <START:ggp> CD40 <END> responses during stimulation with <START:ggp> natural ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> gp39-CD8 fusion protein <END> ) . 
These results indicate that the functional activity of ligands built from the <START:ggp> binding site <END> of <START:ggp> G28-5 <END> is highly dependent upon the size and physical properties of the molecule both in solution and on the cell surfaces . 
<START:ggp> C/EBP <END> activates the <START:ggp> human corticotropin-releasing hormone gene promoter <END> . 
The purpose of these studies was to identify whether transcription factors , associated with cytokine signalling , affected promoter activity of the <START:ggp> corticotropin releasing hormone ( CRH ) gene <END> . 
Fragments of a 3.6 kb sequence of the <START:ggp> human CRH gene promoter <END> were amplified by PCR and ligated upstream of a <START:ggp> CAT reporter <END> . 
These constructs were transfected into a variety of cell lines , either alone or together , with <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> expression vectors . 
Basal activity of a <START:ggp> 3070 bp CRH promoter fragment <END> was only seen in neuronal and <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> . 
Promoter activity was increased by the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> C/EBPbeta <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> ) and more strongly , by <START:ggp> C/EBPdelta <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-IL6beta <END> ) . 
Increased <START:ggp> CRH <END> promoter activity following phorbol ester treatment was inhibited by a dominant negative <START:ggp> NF-IL6 mutant <END> , showing that the effects of phorbol ester were principally mediated by <START:ggp> C/EBP <END> . 
Moreover , the inverse changes in the expression of <START:ggp> CRH <END> in the hypothalamus and spleens of arthritic rats were paralleled by similar inverse changes in <START:ggp> NF-IL6beta <END> expression in these organs . 
These data show that some <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> associated with <START:ggp> cytokine <END> signalling can also activate the <START:ggp> CRH promoter <END> . 
Aberrant splicing of the <START:ggp> TSG101 and FHIT genes <END> occurs frequently in multiple malignancies and in normal tissues and mimics alterations previously described in tumours . 
Intragenic deletions of <START:ggp> TSG101 <END> , the human homolog of a <START:ggp> mouse gene <END> ( <START:ggp> tsg101 <END> ) that acts to suppress malignant cell growth , were reported in <START:ana> human breast tumours <END> . 
We screened <START:ggp> TSG101 <END> for somatic mutations in DNA and RNA samples isolated from a variety of common human malignancies , <START:ana> EBV-immortalised B-cells <END> , and normal lung parenchyma . 
Intragenic <START:ggp> TSG101 <END> deletions in <START:ana> RNA transcripts <END> were frequently found in all types of samples . 
Analysis of DNA failed to show genomic rearrangements corresponding to transcripts containing deletions in the same samples . 
The breakpoints of most transcript deletions coincide with genuine or cryptic <START:ggp> splice site sequences <END> , suggesting that they result from alternative or aberrant splicing . 
A similar spectrum of transcript deletions has previously been described in the <START:ggp> putative tumour suppressor gene <END> <START:ggp> FHIT <END> . 
We analysed <START:ggp> FHIT <END> in the same series of <START:ana> RNA samples <END> and detected truncated <START:ana> FHIT transcripts <END> frequently in both tumour and normal tissues . 
In addition , transcripts from <START:ggp> TSG101 <END> , <START:ggp> FHIT <END> and seven other genes were analysed in RNA isolated from <START:ana> normal peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> . 
Large <START:ggp> TSG101 <END> and <START:ggp> FHIT <END> intragenic transcript deletions were detected and these appeared to be the predominant transcript in <START:ana> 'aged ' lymphocytes <END> . 
Similar alterations were not detected in transcripts of the other genes which were analysed . 
Our findings demonstrate that <START:ana> truncated TSG101 and FHIT transcripts <END> are commonly detected in both normal and malignant tissues and that a significant fraction of these are likely to be the result of aberrant splicing . 
While we can not exclude that alterations in <START:ggp> TSG101 <END> and <START:ggp> FHIT <END> occur during cancer development , our data indicate that in this context the commonly observed transcript abnormalities are misleading . 
Inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis of <START:ana> human and rat T lymphocytes <END> by curcumin , a curry pigment . 
Curcumin ( diferuoylmethane ) , the yellow pigment in the rhizome of tumeric ( Curcuma longa ) , an ingredient of curry spice , is known to exhibit a variety of pharmacological effects including antitumor , antiinflammatory , and antiinfectious activities . 
Although its precise mode of action remains elusive , curcumin has been shown to suppress the activity of the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> in cells stimulated to proliferate . 
In this study , we observed that curcumin ( 50 microM ) inhibited proliferation of <START:ana> rat thymocytes <END> stimulated with concanavalin A ( Con A ) as well as that of <START:ana> human Jurkat lymphoblastoid cells <END> in the logarithmic growth phase . 
The pigment also inhibited apoptosis in <START:ana> dexamethasone-treated rat thymocytes <END> and in <START:ana> UV-irradiated Jurkat cells <END> as judged by DNA ladder formation , cellular morphological changes , and flow cytometry analysis . 
The inhibition of apoptosis by curcumin in <START:ana> rat thymocytes <END> was accompanied by partial suppression of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity . 
Complete suppression of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity was observed in <START:ana> Con A-treated , proliferating thymocytes <END> . 
The capacity of curcumin to inhibit both cell growth and death strongly implies that these two biological processes share a common pathway at some point and that curcumin affects a common step , presumably involving a modulation of the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-7 <END> upregulates the <START:ggp> interleukin-2-gene <END> expression in <START:ana> activated human T lymphocytes <END> at the transcriptional level by enhancing the DNA binding activities of both nuclear factor of <START:ana> activated T cells <END> and <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> . 
In the present report , we studied the role of the <START:ggp> stromal-derived cytokine interleukin-7 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> ) in the <START:ggp> IL-2-gene <END> regulation in <START:ana> activated T lymphocytes <END> . 
Production of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> requires the formation of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> involved in the <START:ggp> IL-2-gene <END> regulation . 
<START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> <START:ggp> ( TCR ) /CD3 <END> engagement results in the activation of nuclear factor of <START:ana> activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) , <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) , and <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> ) , whereas the <START:ggp> CD28 responsive complex <END> ( <START:ggp> CD28RC <END> ) is activated in response to the <START:ggp> CD28 <END> signal . 
Costimulation of <START:ana> phytohemagglutinin/anti-CD28 activated T lymphocytes <END> with <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> induces a fivefold enhanced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -mRNA accumulation and a 2.5-fold enhanced protein secretion . 
The <START:ggp> IL-2-gene <END> transcription rate is increased 3.4-fold , indicating that the effect of <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> is in part mediated at the transcriptional level . 
The molecular mechanisms underlying the <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> effect involve the upregulation of the DNA binding activity of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ( 60 % ) and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ( 120 % ) , without affecting the activities of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> and <START:ggp> CD28RC <END> , which was confirmed by transfection assays . 
We also show that the <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> -induced enhancement of the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -DNA binding activity is not cyclosporin A-sensitive . 
Since <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> is part of the <START:ggp> NFAT complex <END> , we conclude that the <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> -signaling pathway is involved in the activation of the <START:ggp> fos and jun proteins <END> of which <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> consists . 
The spatial distribution of <START:ggp> human immunoglobulin genes <END> within the nucleus : evidence for gene topography independent of cell type and transcriptional activity . 
The three-dimensional positioning of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin ( Ig ) genes <END> within the nucleus of <START:ana> human cells <END> was investigated using in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy . 
The visualization of <START:ggp> heavy and light chain genes <END> in <START:ana> B-lymphoid cells <END> showed that the three <START:ggp> Ig genes <END> are differentially and nonrandomly distributed in different nuclear subvolumes : the <START:ggp> kappa genes <END> were found to be preferentially confined to an outer nuclear volume , whereas the <START:ggp> gamma and lambda genes <END> consistently occupied more central positions within the nucleus , the <START:ggp> lambda genes <END> being more interior when compared with the <START:ggp> gamma genes <END> . 
The data further show that these overall topographical distributions are independent of gene transcriptional activity and are conserved in <START:ana> different cell types <END> . 
Although subtle gene movements within those defined topographical regions can not be excluded by this study , the results indicate that tissue specificity of gene expression is not accompanied by drastic changes in gene nuclear topography , rather suggesting that gene organization within the nucleus may be primarily dependent on structural constraints imposed on the respective <START:ggp> chromosomes <END> . 
Dominant <START:ana> cytotoxic T lymphocyte <END> response to the <START:ggp> immediate-early trans-activator protein <END> , <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> , in persistent type A or B Epstein-Barr virus infection . 
Five healthy human leukocyte antigen-B8 ( HLA-B8 ) -positive virus carriers were studied to investigate the <START:ana> CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte <END> ( CTL ) response to an HLA-B8-restricted peptide , RAKFKQLLQ , located in the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) immediate-early trans-activator protein <END> , <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> . 
Of the 5 virus carriers , 4 were infected with type A and 1 with type B EBV . 
Using limiting-dilution analysis of <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> , a high RAKFKQLLQ-specific CTL precursor frequency was demonstrated after specific peptide or autologous lymphoblastoid cell line stimulation in both type A and type B EBV carriers . 
The RAKFKQLLQ-specific CTL precursor frequencies in all 5 persons were at least as dominant as those observed with two other <START:ggp> EBV-associated , HLA-B8-restricted latent epitopes <END> , FLRGRAYGL and QAKWRLQTL . 
These findings show that healthy virus carriers maintain a high frequency of <START:ana> BZLF1-specific memory T cells <END> , potentially to control virus spread from <START:ana> lytically infected cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> DNA binding domain <END> of the <START:ggp> A-MYB <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> is responsible for its B cell-specific activity and binds to a <START:ggp> B cell 110-kDa nuclear protein <END> . 
Expression studies as well as the use of transgenic animals have demonstrated that the <START:ggp> A-MYB <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> plays central and specific role in the regulation of <START:ana> mature B cell <END> proliferation and/or differentiation . 
Furthermore , it is highly expressed in <START:ana> Burkitt 's lymphoma cells <END> and may participate in the pathogenesis of this disease . 
We have therefore investigated the transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> A-MYB <END> and its regulation in several <START:ana> human lymphoid cell lines <END> using co-transfection assays and show that <START:ggp> A-MYB <END> is transcriptionally active in all the <START:ana> B cell lines <END> studied , but not in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
In particular the best <START:ana> responder cell line <END> was the <START:ana> Burkitt 's cell line Namalwa <END> . 
The activity of <START:ggp> A-MYB <END> in <START:ana> B and not T cells <END> was observed when either an artificial construct or the <START:ggp> c-MYC promoter <END> was used as a reporter . 
Furthermore , the <START:ggp> functional domains <END> responsible for DNA binding , transactivation , and negative regulation , previously characterized in a fibroblast context , were found to have similar activity in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
The region of <START:ggp> A-MYB <END> responsible for the B cell specific activity was defined to be the <START:ggp> N-terminal 218 amino acids <END> containing the <START:ggp> DNA binding domain <END> . 
Finally , a <START:ggp> 110-kDa protein <END> has been identified in the nuclei of all the <START:ana> B , but not T , cell lines <END> that specifically binds to this <START:ggp> A-MYB N-terminal domain <END> . 
We hypothesize that this <START:ggp> 110-kDa protein <END> may be a functionally important <START:ggp> B cell-specific co-activator <END> of <START:ggp> A-MYB <END> . 
Transcription factor <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> activity down-regulates Fas and CD23 expression in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Activation of mature <START:ana> B cells <END> via <START:ggp> Ag receptor <END> cross-linking induces transient expression of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> . 
Although the activating signals leading to <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> induction have been studied extensively , little is known about the genes that are placed further downstream within this activation cascade and that are transcriptionally regulated by <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> . 
To identify such <START:ggp> target genes <END> , we established <START:ana> Egr-1-overexpressing transfectants <END> from the <START:ana> murine B cell line K46 <END> and from <START:ana> human Ramos B cells <END> . 
All clones derived from <START:ana> K46 B cells <END> showed increased expression of <START:ggp> CD44 <END> . 
Most interestingly , expression of <START:ggp> CD95 <END> ( <START:ggp> Fas/Apo-1 <END> ) and of <START:ggp> CD23 <END> was down-regulated in all <START:ana> K46 transfectants <END> . 
As a consequence , they became resistant to apoptosis induced by <START:ggp> anti-CD95 Ab <END> treatment . 
Similarly , the <START:ana> Egr-1-expressing Ramos cells <END> showed reduced levels of <START:ggp> CD95 <END> expression . 
Thus , <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> seems to control the expression of <START:ggp> downstream target genes <END> not only as a transcriptional activator , but also as a <START:ggp> repressor molecule <END> . 
In <START:ana> B cells <END> , <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> therefore plays a critical role in integrating the short-lived signal delivered by triggering of the <START:ggp> Ag receptor <END> into phenotypic changes , including repression of <START:ggp> CD95 <END> and <START:ggp> CD23 <END> transcription . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity by I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta stability . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> must be released from <START:ggp> cytoplasmic inhibitory molecules <END> ( <START:ggp> I kappa Bs <END> ) in order to move to the nucleus and to activate its <START:ggp> target genes <END> . 
Little is known about the mechanisms regulating the maintenance of <START:ggp> constitutive nuclear NF-kappa B <END> in some cell-types and of sustained nuclear <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity after stimulation . 
Increased turnover has been implicated in the regulation of constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity in <START:ana> mature B cells <END> . 
We therefore compared the turnover of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> in <START:ana> mature B cells <END> and <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
Both proteins display a high turnover in <START:ana> B cells <END> although <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> is considerably more stable than <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
The half-life of both inhibitors is increased in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
In contrast , all other <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> /I kappa B molecules tested are relatively stable in both cell-types . 
The elevated turnover of endogenous <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> in <START:ana> Namalwa cells <END> is inhibited by a proteasome inhibitor and thus seems to be driven by the same degradation machinery as the slower turnover in <START:ana> non-B cells <END> . 
Furthermore , we investigated the processes involved in persistent activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
TNF-alpha signaling leads to a rapid depletion of cellular <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> pools . 
<START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> is efficiently resynthesized whereas <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> levels stay low for a prolonged time . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity can be detected for several hours after stimulation . 
We found that removal of the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> containing medium causes a rapid decrease in <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kappa B <END> . 
A phosphoform of newly synthesized <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> is visible when degradation by the <START:ggp> proteasome <END> is inhibited and new <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> displays the same properties regarding phosphorylation and degradation in response to a second inducer . 
There is no significant difference in the turnover of pre- and post-inductive <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
These observations suggest that resynthesis of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and removal of the stimulus are obligatory steps for the inactivation of <START:ggp> nuclear NF kappa B <END> . 
Selection of a diverse <START:ggp> TCR repertoire <END> in response to an <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus-encoded transactivator protein <END> <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> by <START:ana> CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes <END> during primary and persistent infection . 
We investigated the <START:ggp> CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) repertoire <END> to an HLA B8-restricted peptide , RAKFKQLLQ , located in the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) immediate-early protein <END> , <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> . 
Repertoire selection was monitored by determining the <START:ggp> TCR beta chain sequences <END> of <START:ana> RAKFKQLLQ-specific CTL <END> established from primary infected and healthy virus carriers . 
PCR analysis of <START:ana> spontaneous EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> LCL <END> ) from three individuals with primary infection showed that two were infected with type A and one with type B EBV . 
<START:ana> Polyclonal and clonal CTL <END> that were generated by stimulating <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> with an <START:ana> HLA B8+ homozygous LCL lysed T cell blasts <END> pulsed with the peptide , RAKFKQLLQ ; lysis of certain HLA B8+ LCL targets was associated with the abundance of <START:ana> BZLF1 transcripts <END> . 
<START:ggp> TCR beta <END> analysis showed that while there was loop length restriction in the putative peptide contact site of all responding <START:ggp> beta chains <END> , diverse and <START:ana> unique ( non-recurrent ) TCR beta clonotypes <END> were selected in individuals during primary infection and continued to emerge after long-term virus exposure . 
<START:ggp> TCR <END> -contact site heterogeneity was excluded as the selective force in diversity generation since the epitope-encoded sequences were found to be identical within endogenous virus isolates . 
In this first study of <START:ggp> TCR repertoire <END> selection for an <START:ggp> EBV lytic antigen <END> , a <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> -reactive component of diverse clonotypes was identified in primary type A or type B EBV infection which was sustained in the EBV-specific memory response throughout life-long infection . 
This diversity selection is likely to play a critical role in maintaining a balanced viral load throughout EBV persistence . 
Molecular mechanisms of anoxia/reoxygenation-induced neutrophil adherence to <START:ana> cultured endothelial cells <END> . 
The objectives of this study were to ( 1 ) determine the time course of neutrophil adhesion to monolayers of <START:ana> human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> HUVECs <END> ) that were exposed to 60 minutes of anoxia followed by 30 to 600 minutes of reoxygenation and ( 2 ) define the mechanisms responsible for both the early ( minutes ) and late ( hours ) hyperadhesivity of <START:ana> postanoxic HUVECs <END> to <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> . 
The results clearly demonstrate that anoxia/reoxygenation ( A/R ) leads to a biphasic increase in neutrophil adhesion to <START:ana> HUVECs <END> , with peak responses occurring at 30 minutes ( phase 1 ) and 240 minutes ( phase 2 ) after reoxygenation . 
Oxypurinol and <START:ggp> catalase <END> inhibited phase-1 adhesion , suggesting a role for <START:ggp> xanthine oxidase <END> and H2O2 . 
In comparison , <START:ggp> platelet activating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> PAF <END> ) contributed to both phases of neutrophil adhesion . 
<START:ggp> Anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> anti-P-selectin antibodies <END> ( <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> [ <START:ggp> mAbs <END> ] ) attenuated phase-1 neutrophil adhesion , consistent with roles for constitutively expressed <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> and enhanced surface expression of preformed <START:ggp> P-selectin <END> . 
Phase-2 neutrophil adhesion was attenuated by an <START:ggp> anti-E-selectin mAb <END> , indicating a dominant role of this adhesion molecule in the late phase response . 
Pretreatment with actinomycin D and cycloheximide or with competing ds-oligonucleotides containing the <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> or <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> <START:ggp> cognate DNA sequences <END> significantly attenuated phase-2 response , suggesting a role for de novo macromolecule synthesis . 
Surface expression of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> , <START:ggp> P-selectin <END> , and <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> on <START:ana> HUVECs <END> correlated with the phase-1 and -2 neutrophil adhesion responses . 
Collectively , these findings indicate that A/R elicits a two-phase neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion response that involves transcription-independent and transcription-dependent surface expression of different <START:ggp> endothelial cell adhesion molecules <END> . 
Characterization of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> signaling determinants regulating <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> signaling to <START:ana> B cells <END> is important for generating an effective humoral immune response . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> ligation leads to B cell activation events such as proliferation , Ig secretion , isotype switching , and up-regulation of <START:ggp> cell surface molecules <END> , as well as the generation of <START:ana> memory B cells <END> . 
Many of these events are dependent upon the ability of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> to activate the transcription factor <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) . 
To define the <START:ggp> CD40 <END> signaling components upstream of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation and the functional consequences downstream of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation , we examined <START:ana> mouse B cell transfectants <END> expressing <START:ggp> wild-type or mutant human CD40 <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> CD40 cytoplasmic domain <END> truncation and point mutants defined a <START:ggp> 10-amino acid CD40 cytoplasmic signaling determinant <END> required for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
A threonine residue at <START:ggp> position 234 <END> , previously shown to be important for <START:ggp> CD40 <END> association with <START:ggp> TNF receptor-associated factor 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> ) , <START:ggp> TRAF3 <END> , and <START:ggp> TRAF5 <END> , was not required for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
This suggests that in <START:ana> B cells <END> , <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation can occur independently of <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> and <START:ggp> TRAF5 <END> association . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation was independent of the <START:ggp> transmembrane domain <END> of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> , suggesting that it is independent of <START:ggp> p23 <END> , a molecule that associates with <START:ggp> CD40 <END> in a region other than the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> . 
Proteasome-dependent inhibitory kappa B alpha ( <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> ) and <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> degradation occurred downstream of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> ligation and preceded <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> nuclear translocation . 
CD40- or pervanadate-mediated I kappa B tyrosine phosphorylation was not detected . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation correlated with the ability of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> to induce Ab secretion and the up-regulation of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> LFA-1 <END> . 
However , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation was insufficient for <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -mediated up-regulation of <START:ggp> B7-1 <END> , <START:ggp> Fas <END> , and <START:ggp> CD23 <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD30 <END> -dependent degradation of <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> : implications for negative regulation of <START:ggp> TRAF <END> signaling and the control of cell survival . 
<START:ggp> CD30 <END> is a <START:ggp> cell-surface receptor <END> that can augment lymphocyte activation and survival through its ability to induce the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD30 <END> , however , has also been implicated in the induction of apoptotic cell death of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
Here we show that one of the effects of <START:ggp> CD30 <END> signal transduction is to render cells sensitive to apoptosis induced by the <START:ggp> type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNFR1 <END> ) . 
This sensitization is dependent on the <START:ggp> TRAF-binding sites <END> within the <START:ggp> CD30 <END> <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> . 
One of the proteins that binds to these sites is <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> , a <START:ggp> signal transduction molecule <END> that is also utilized by <START:ggp> TNFR1 <END> to mediate the activation of several downstream <START:ggp> kinases <END> and <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
During <START:ggp> CD30 <END> signal transduction , we found that binding of <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> to the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> of <START:ggp> CD30 <END> results in the rapid depletion of <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> and the associated protein <START:ggp> TRAF1 <END> by proteolysis . 
These data suggest a model in which <START:ggp> CD30 <END> limits its own ability to transduce cell survival signals through signal-coupled depletion of <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> . 
Depletion of intracellular <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> and its <START:ggp> coassociated proteins <END> also increased the sensitivity of the cell to undergoing apoptosis during activation of <START:ggp> death-inducing receptors <END> such as <START:ggp> TNFR1 <END> . 
Consistent with this hypothesis , expression of a <START:ggp> dominant-negative form <END> of <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> was found to potentiate <START:ggp> TNFR1 <END> -mediated death . 
These studies provide a potential mechanism through which <START:ggp> CD30 <END> , as well as other <START:ggp> TRAF-binding members <END> of the <START:ggp> TNFR superfamily <END> , can negatively regulate cell survival . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> myeloid-associated genes <END> in <START:ana> human hematopoietic progenitor cells <END> . 
The distribution of <START:ggp> myeloid lineage-associated cytokine receptors <END> and <START:ggp> lysosomal proteins <END> was analyzed in <START:ana> human CD34+ cord blood cell ( CB ) subsets <END> at different stages of myeloid commitment by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . 
The highly specific <START:ggp> granulomonocyte-associated lysosomal proteins <END> <START:ggp> myeloperoxidase <END> ( <START:ggp> MPO <END> ) and <START:ggp> lysozyme <END> ( <START:ggp> LZ <END> ) , as well as the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , were already detectable in the most immature <START:ana> CD34+Thy-1+ subset <END> . 
<START:ana> Messenger RNA <END> ( <START:ana> mRNA <END> ) levels for the <START:ggp> granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) receptor <END> , <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage ( GM ) -CSF receptor alpha subunit <END> and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptors I ( p55 ) and II ( p75 ) <END> were also detected in this subset in addition to <START:ggp> c-kit <END> and <START:ggp> flt-3 <END> , receptors known to be expressed on <START:ana> progenitor cells <END> . 
By contrast , the <START:ggp> monocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) receptor <END> was largely absent at this stage and in the <START:ana> CD34+Thy-1-CD45RA- subsets <END> . 
The <START:ggp> M-CSF receptor <END> was first detectable in the <START:ana> myeloid-committed CD34+Thy-l-CD45RA+ subset <END> . 
All other molecules studied were found to be expressed at this stage of differentiation . 
Different cocktails of the identified ligands were added to <START:ana> sorted CD34+Thy-1+ single cells <END> . 
Low proliferative capacity was observed after 1 week in culture in the presence of <START:ggp> stem cell factor <END> ( <START:ggp> SCF <END> ) + <START:ggp> Flt-3 ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> FL <END> ) + <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> . 
Addition of <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> to this basic cocktail consistently increased the clonogenic capacity of <START:ana> single CD34+Thy-1+ cells <END> , and this effect was further enhanced ( up to 72.3 +/- 4.3 % on day 7 ) by the inclusion of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> . 
In conclusion , the presence of <START:ana> myeloid-associated growth factor receptor transcripts <END> in <START:ana> CD34+ CB subsets <END> does not discriminate the various stages of differentiation , with the exception of the <START:ggp> M-CSF receptor <END> . 
In addition , we show that <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> is a potent costimulatory factor of the very <START:ana> immature CD34+Thy-1+ CB subset <END> . 
Induction of <START:ggp> endothelial cell surface adhesion molecules <END> by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> is blocked by protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors : role of the <START:ggp> nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B <END> . 
Recent studies from our laboratory have indicated that <START:ggp> protein tyrosine phosphatase <END> ( <START:ggp> PTPase <END> ) inhibitors can down-modulate the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) -mediated activation of the <START:ggp> nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> ML-1a <END> , a <START:ana> monocytic cell line <END> ( Singh and Aggarwal , J. Biol. Chem. 1995 : 270 : 10631 ) . 
Since <START:ggp> TNF <END> is one of the major inducers of various <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> in human endothelial cells and their expression is known to require the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , we examined the effect of <START:ggp> PTPase <END> inhibitors on the <START:ggp> TNF <END> -mediated induction of <START:ggp> intracellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) -1 <END> , <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) -1 <END> and <START:ggp> endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule ( ELAM ) -1 <END> . 
Like <START:ana> ML-1a <END> , <START:ana> human dermal microvessel endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> MVEC <END> ) treated with <START:ggp> TNF <END> rapidly activated ( within 30 min ) <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ; this effect was completely abolished by co-treatment with phenylarsine oxide ( PAO ) , a specific inhibitor of <START:ggp> PTPase <END> . 
The induction of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> , <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> ELAM-1 <END> by <START:ggp> TNF <END> in <START:ana> MVEC <END> occurred within 6 h and was also completely down-regulated by PAO in a dose-dependent manner . 
PAO was found to be effective even when added 3 h after <START:ggp> TNF <END> , suggesting a rapid mode of action of this inhibitor . 
Besides PAO , other inhibitors of <START:ggp> PTPase <END> , including pervanadate and diamide , also blocked <START:ggp> TNF <END> -dependent <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation and induction of all the three <START:ggp> adhesion proteins <END> . 
Consistent with these results , the attachment of monocytes to <START:ana> MVEC <END> was also blocked by the <START:ggp> PTPase <END> inhibitors . 
Thus , overall , our results demonstrate that a <START:ggp> PTPase <END> is involved either directly or indirectly in the pathway leading to the induction of <START:ggp> endothelial cell adhesion molecules <END> by <START:ggp> TNF <END> . 
Because of their role in cell adhesion , <START:ggp> PTPase <END> may provide a novel target of drug development for treatment of inflammation , atherogenesis , and tumor metastasis . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> and its inhibitor <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha/MAD-3 <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and during human tuberculosis . 
<START:ana> Blood monocytes <END> from patients with active tuberculosis are activated in vivo , as evidenced by an increase in the stimulated release of <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> , such as <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , and the spontaneous expression of <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> . 
Further , <START:ana> monocytes <END> from patients demonstrate an augmented susceptibility to a productive infection with HIV-1 in vitro . 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its components are strong signals to activate <START:ana> monocytes <END> to production of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
In this study we examined the basis of activation of <START:ana> monocytes <END> during active tuberculosis and by M. tuberculosis . 
We found a constitutive degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> , the major <START:ggp> cytoplasmic inhibitor <END> of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) , in freshly isolated <START:ana> PBMC <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> from patients with tuberculosis . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> levels in <START:ana> PBMC <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> from healthy subjects or from patients with nontuberculous pulmonary conditions were intact . 
Further , by electrophoretic mobility shift assay , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was activated in <START:ana> monocytes <END> from tuberculous patients . 
The expression of <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> gene , which is responsive to activation by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , was up-regulated in <START:ana> PBMC <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> from patients , but not in <START:ana> mononuclear cells <END> from healthy subjects or those with nontuberculous lung diseases . 
By contrast , the expression of other <START:ggp> adherence-associated early genes <END> , such as <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> , was not up-regulated in <START:ana> PBMC <END> of tuberculous patients . 
Further , M. tuberculosis and its <START:ggp> tuberculin <END> , <START:ggp> purified protein derivative <END> , induced the degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> and the expression of <START:ana> I kappa B-alpha mRNA <END> , and purified protein derivative induced the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Cooperation of <START:ggp> Spi-1/PU.1 <END> with an <START:ggp> activated erythropoietin receptor <END> inhibits apoptosis and <START:ggp> Epo <END> -dependent differentiation in <START:ana> primary erythroblasts <END> and induces their Kit ligand-dependent proliferation . 
<START:ggp> Spi-1/PU.1 <END> is a <START:ggp> myeloid- and B-cell specific transcription factor <END> which is also involved in Friend virus-induced murine erythroleukemia . 
The pre-leukemic phase of Friend erythroleukemia results from activation of the <START:ggp> erythropoietin receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> EpoR <END> ) by the <START:ggp> spleen focus forming virus ( SFFV ) envelope glycoprotein <END> , followed by the emergence of leukemic clones characterized by overexpression of <START:ggp> Spi-1 <END> and mutation of the <START:ggp> p53 tumor suppressor gene <END> . 
We developed a heterologous system to analyze the contribution of these alterations to the induction of primary erythroblast transformation . 
<START:ana> Avian erythroblasts <END> expressing the <START:ggp> activated mouse EpoR ( R129C ) <END> differentiated into <START:ana> erythrocytes <END> in response to <START:ggp> hEpo <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> Spi-1 <END> in these cells inhibited this ability to differentiate and rescued the cells from the apoptotic cell death program normally induced upon <START:ggp> hEpo <END> withdrawal . 
Although devoid of any effect by itself , a <START:ggp> mutant p53 <END> cooperated with <START:ggp> Spi-1 <END> and <START:ggp> EpoR ( R129C ) <END> to reinforce both phenotypes . 
Analysis of erythroblasts co-expressing <START:ggp> Spi-1 <END> and the <START:ggp> wild-type mouse EpoR <END> showed that differentiation arrest and inhibition of apoptosis depended on specific cooperation between <START:ggp> Spi-1 <END> and <START:ggp> EpoR ( R129C ) <END> . 
This cooperation was also required to induce the sustained proliferation of <START:ana> differentiation-blocked erythroblasts <END> in response to ligand activation of the <START:ggp> endogenous tyrosine kinase receptor <END> <START:ggp> c-Kit <END> . 
These results show that Spi-1/ <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> requires signals emanating from specific cytokine and growth factor receptors to affect the survival , proliferation and differentiation control of <START:ana> primary erythroblasts <END> . 
They also suggest that the function of <START:ggp> Spi-1/PU.1 <END> in the late phase of Friend leukemia requires specific signaling from the <START:ggp> gp55-modified EpoR <END> generated during the early phase of the disease . 
The role of <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B proteins <END> in viral oncogenesis and the regulation of viral transcription . 
<START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B <END> is a <START:ggp> ubiquitous transcription factor <END> that consists of <START:ggp> multiple polypeptide subunits <END> , and is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms that involve protein-protein interactions , phosphorylation , ubiquitination , proteolytic degradation , and nucleocytoplasmic translocation . 
The sophisticated control of <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B <END> activity is not surprising since this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> is involved in a wide array of cellular responses to extracellular cues , associated with growth , development , apoptosis , and pathogen invasion . 
Thus , it is not unexpected that this versatile cellular homeostatic switch would be affected by a variety of viral pathogens , which have evolved mechanisms to utilize various aspects of <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B <END> activity to facilitate their replication , cell survival and possibly evasion of immune responses . 
This review will cover the molecular mechanisms that are utilized by mammalian oncogenic viruses to affect the activity of <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> and the role of <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B <END> in the regulation of viral gene expression and replication . 
Cellular and molecular mechanisms of <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> synthesis in atopic diseases : a study with <START:ana> allergen-specific human helper T cells <END> . 
BACKGROUND : <START:ggp> Cytokines <END> produced by <START:ana> helper T cells <END> are intimately involved in chronic allergic diseases associated with eosinophilic inflammation . 
OBJECTIVE : We investigated the production of <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> , a potent growth factor and chemotactic factor for <START:ana> eosinophils <END> , by <START:ana> CD4+ T lymphocytes <END> in patients with asthma . 
METHODS : <START:ana> Allergen-specific T cell clones <END> and <START:ana> T cell hybridomas <END> were established from the <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> of patients with asthma , and the responses to various stimuli were determined . 
RESULTS : After nonspecific stimulation , <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> production by <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> from both atopic and nonatopic subjects with asthma was significantly enhanced compared with that by cells from healthy controls . 
<START:ana> Peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> from atopic asthma patients both proliferated and produced <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> after incubation with mite allergen , suggesting that <START:ana> mite-specific helper T cells <END> were involved in the eosinophilic inflammation of atopic asthma . 
A human <START:ggp> IL-5 promoter/enhancer luciferase gene construct <END> transfected into <START:ana> IL-5-producing T cell clones <END> was clearly transcribed after stimulation , indicating that the 515 base pair <START:ggp> IL-5 gene segment <END> upstream of the coding region was sufficient to respond to activating signals in human <START:ana> helper T cells <END> . 
The same gene segment was not transcribed in <START:ana> IL-5-nonproducing T cell clones <END> , suggesting that human T cell <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level . 
Experiments with <START:ana> T cell hybridomas <END> confirmed these findings and suggested that a <START:ggp> unique transcription factor <END> may be essential for human <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> gene transcription . 
CONCLUSION : Enhanced <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> production by <START:ana> helper T cells <END> seems to cause the eosinophilic inflammation of both atopic and nonatopic asthma . 
Elucidation of <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> -specific regulatory mechanisms may facilitate the development of novel treatments for allergic diseases associated with eosinophilic inflammation . 
Cyclosporin A inhibits monocyte <START:ggp> tissue factor <END> activation in cardiac transplant recipients . 
BACKGROUND : Fibrin deposition and thrombosis have been implicated in both allograft rejection and vasculopathy after cardiac transplantation . 
Because <START:ana> monocytes <END> play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of intravascular coagulation activation through their ability to synthesize <START:ggp> tissue factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TF <END> ) , we asked ( 1 ) whether monocyte <START:ggp> TF <END> activation occurs in cardiac transplant recipients and ( 2 ) whether monocyte <START:ggp> TF <END> expression is affected by treatment with cyclosporin A ( CsA ) . 
METHODS AND RESULTS : We measured levels of <START:ggp> TF <END> activity in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> and <START:ana> highly purified monocytes/macrophages <END> from 10 consecutive cardiac transplant recipients and 10 healthy control subjects . 
<START:ggp> TF <END> activity generated by both <START:ana> unstimulated <END> and <START:ana> endotoxin-stimulated cells <END> was significantly higher in transplant recipients than in control subjects ( P < .05 ) . 
Increased monocyte <START:ggp> TF <END> expression in transplant recipients was shown to be adversely affected by treatment with CsA : <START:ggp> TF <END> induction was markedly reduced by CsA serum concentrations reaching peak CsA drug levels . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> TF <END> induction in the presence of high CsA blood concentrations was also observed when stimulation of cells was performed with <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> or <START:ggp> interleukin-1beta <END> . 
As shown by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and electrophoretic mobility shift assay , respectively , treatment with CsA leads to decreased <START:ana> TF mRNA <END> expression and reduced activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB transcription factor <END> , which is known to contribute to the induction of the <START:ggp> TF promotor <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates that <START:ggp> TF <END> activation , occurring in <START:ana> mononuclear cells <END> of cardiac transplant recipients , is inhibited by treatment with CsA . 
Inhibition of monocyte <START:ggp> TF <END> induction by CsA may contribute to its successful use in cardiac transplant medicine and might be useful in managing further settings of vascular pathology also known to involve <START:ggp> TF <END> expression and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> induce heterodimerization of <START:ggp> STAT5 isoforms <END> in <START:ana> human peripheral blood T lymphoblasts <END> . 
Despite differences in T cell responses induced by <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> , both <START:ggp> cytokines <END> modulate T cell functions by activation of <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) proteins <END> . 
We examined the contribution of the two isoforms of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT5A <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5B <END> , to IL-2- and IL-7-induced activation of <START:ana> human peripheral blood T lymphoblasts <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> cytokines <END> induced assembly of <START:ggp> STAT5A <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5B <END> containing complexes capable of binding to the <START:ggp> interferon-gamma activation sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> GAS <END> ) , and these complexes rapidly translocated ( within 1 min ) into the nucleus of <START:ana> IL-2- or IL-7-treated cells <END> . 
The kinetics of this translocation were delayed in <START:ana> IL-7-treated <END> as compared to <START:ana> IL-2-treated cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> were equivalent in their ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT5A <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5B <END> and to facilitate binding of these <START:ggp> STATs <END> to an <START:ggp> immobilized GAS element <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> induced substantial amounts of <START:ggp> STAT5A <END> <START:ggp> /STAT5B <END> heterodimerization . 
Moreover , we observed constitutive association of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> with each <START:ggp> STAT5 isomer <END> . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> induce assembly of <START:ggp> STAT heterodimers <END> in a similar manner and that subsequent cellular responses may be driven by induction of similar sets of <START:ggp> genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> regulates inducible <START:ggp> Oct-2 gene <END> expression in <START:ana> precursor B lymphocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> POU transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> regulate the activity of <START:ggp> octamer-dependent promoters <END> , including those that direct transcription from rearranged <START:ggp> immunoglobulin genes <END> . 
Unlike <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> , which is constitutively expressed in many cell types , <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> expression is restricted primarily to <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> and can be induced in <START:ana> precursor B cells <END> by stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . 
However , the precise factors that mediate this induction mechanism remain unknown . 
In the present study , we monitored <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> expression in cells arrested for the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , an <START:ggp> LPS-responsive member <END> of the <START:ggp> Rel transcription factor family <END> . 
Despite stimulation with LPS , disruption of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> signaling pathway in <START:ana> precursor B cells <END> led to the loss of inducible <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> DNA binding activity in vitro and the suppression of <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> -directed transcription in vivo . 
This biochemical defect correlated with a specific block to <START:ggp> Oct-2 gene <END> expression at the level of transcription , whereas the expression of <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> was unaffected . 
The finding that <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> is under <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> control highlights an important cross-talk mechanism involving two distinct <START:ggp> transcription factor families <END> that regulate <START:ana> B lymphocyte <END> function . 
Suppression of <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> expression by <START:ggp> human class II trans-activator constructs <END> lacking the <START:ggp> N-terminal domain <END> . 
The <START:ggp> class II trans-activator <END> ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) is a <START:ggp> bi- or multi-functional domain protein <END> which plays a critical role in the expression of <START:ggp> MHC class II genes <END> . 
We report that removal of the <START:ggp> N-terminal 151 amino acids <END> , encompassing all of the <START:ggp> acidic domain <END> but leaving intact the <START:ggp> proline/serine/threonine-rich domain <END> , results in a mutant protein with potent suppressive properties for <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> expression . 
<START:ana> HeLa cells <END> stably or transiently transfected with <START:ggp> mutant CIITA constructs <END> showed up to 99 % suppression of <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> antigen induction by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and marked suppression of <START:ana> HLA-DRA mRNA <END> expression . 
Transient transfection of a B lymphoma line resulted in up to 89 % reduction of constitutive <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> expression within 5 days and suppression of <START:ana> HLA-DRA mRNA <END> synthesis . 
Helenalin , an anti-inflammatory sesquiterpene lactone from Arnica , selectively inhibits <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> [ see comments ] 
Alcoholic extracts prepared form Arnicae flos , the collective name for flowerheads from Arnica montana and A. chamissonis ssp. foliosa , are used therapeutically as anti-inflammatory remedies . 
The active ingredients mediating the pharmacological effect are mainly sesquiterpene lactones , such as helenalin , 11alpha , 13-dihydrohelenalin , chamissonolid and their ester derivatives . 
While these compounds affect various cellular processes , current data do not fully explain how sesquiterpene lactones exert their anti-inflammatory effect . 
We show here that helenalin , and , to a much lesser degree , 11alpha , 13-dihydrohelenalin and chamissonolid , inhibit activation of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
This difference in efficacy , which correlates with the compounds ' anti-inflammatory potency in vivo , may be explained by differences in structure and conformation . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , which resides in an inactive , <START:ggp> cytoplasmic complex <END> in <START:ana> unstimulated cells <END> , is activated by phosphorylation and degradation of its <START:ggp> inhibitory subunit <END> , <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> . 
Helenalin inhibits <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in response to four different stimuli in <START:ana> T-cells <END> , <START:ana> B-cells <END> and <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> and abrogates <START:ggp> kappaB <END> -driven gene expression . 
This inhibition is selective , as the activity of four other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> , <START:ggp> TBP <END> , <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT 5 <END> was not affected . 
We show that inhibition is not due to a direct modification of the active <START:ggp> NF-kappaB heterodimer <END> . 
Rather , helenalin modifies the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/IkappaB complex <END> , preventing the release of <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> . 
These data suggest a molecular mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effect of sesquiterpene lactones , which differs from that of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , indomethacin and acetyl salicylic acid . 
The <START:ggp> tax protein <END> of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 mediates the transactivation of the <START:ggp> c-sis/platelet-derived growth factor-B promoter <END> through interactions with the <START:ggp> zinc finger transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> NGFI-A/Egr-1 <END> . 
Transcriptional up-regulation of the <START:ggp> c-sis/platelet-derived growth factor-B ( PDGF-B ) proto-oncogene <END> by the <START:ggp> Tax protein <END> of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 has been implicated as one possible mechanism of cellular transformation by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 . 
In previous work , we identified an essential site in the <START:ggp> c-sis/PDGF-B promoter <END> , <START:ggp> Tax-responsive element 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> TRE1 <END> ) , necessary for transactivation by <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
We also identified <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , Sp3 , and <START:ggp> NGFI-A/Egr-1 <END> as the <START:ggp> primary nuclear transcription factors <END> binding to <START:ggp> TRE1 <END> which mediate <START:ggp> Tax <END> responsiveness . 
In the present work , we have investigated the mechanism ( s ) whereby <START:ggp> Tax <END> transactivates the <START:ggp> c-sis/PDGF-B proto-oncogene <END> . 
In vitro transcription assays showed that <START:ggp> Tax <END> was able to significantly increase the transcriptional activity of a template containing the <START:ggp> -257 to +74 region <END> of the <START:ggp> c-sis/PDGF-B promoter <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis showed that <START:ggp> Tax <END> increased the DNA binding activity of both <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> NGFI-A/Egr-1 <END> using a <START:ggp> TRE1 probe <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> Tax mutants <END> showed that two mutants , <START:ggp> IEXC29S <END> and <START:ggp> IEXL320G <END> , were unable to significantly transactivate the <START:ggp> c-sis/PDGF-B promoter <END> . 
Finally , co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that <START:ggp> Tax <END> is able to stably bind to both <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> NGFI-A/Egr-1 <END> . 
Interestingly , co-immunoprecipitation analysis also revealed that <START:ggp> Tax <END> mutant <START:ggp> IEXC29S <END> is unable to interact with <START:ggp> NGFI-A/Egr-1 <END> , whereas <START:ggp> Tax <END> mutant <START:ggp> IEXL320G <END> is able to interact with <START:ggp> NGFI-A/Egr-1 <END> . 
Nuclear localization of <START:ggp> RelB <END> is associated with effective antigen-presenting cell function . 
<START:ana> Dendritic cells <END> ( <START:ana> DC <END> ) are potent <START:ana> APCs <END> that enter resting tissues as precursors and , after Ag exposure , differentiate and migrate to draining lymph nodes . 
The phenotype of <START:ggp> RelB <END> knockout mice implicates this member of the <START:ggp> NF kappa B/Rel family <END> in <START:ana> DC <END> differentiation . 
To further elucidate the role of <START:ggp> RelB <END> in <START:ana> DC <END> differentiation , <START:ana> mRNA <END> , intracellular protein expression , and DNA binding activity of <START:ggp> RelB <END> were examined in immature and differentiated <START:ana> human DC <END> , as well as other <START:ana> PB mononuclear cell populations <END> . 
<START:ggp> RelB <END> protein and <START:ana> mRNA <END> were detected constitutively in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> and in <START:ana> activated monocytes <END> , <START:ana> differentiated DC <END> , and <START:ana> monocyte-derived DC <END> . 
Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated <START:ggp> RelB <END> within the <START:ana> differentiated lymph node interdigitating DC <END> and <START:ana> follicular DC <END> , but not <START:ana> undifferentiated DC <END> in normal skin . 
Active nuclear <START:ggp> RelB <END> was detected by supershift assay only in differentiated <START:ana> DC <END> derived from either <START:ana> PB precursors <END> or <START:ana> monocytes <END> and in <START:ana> activated B cells <END> . 
These <START:ana> RelB+ APC <END> were potent stimulators of the <START:ggp> MLR <END> . 
The data indicate that <START:ggp> RelB <END> expression is regulated both transcriptionally and post-translationally in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> . 
Within the nucleus , <START:ggp> RelB <END> may specifically transactivate genes that are critical for <START:ana> APC <END> function . 
<START:ggp> NF-AT <END> activation induced by a <START:ggp> CAML <END> -interacting member of the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) is a key event underlying lymphocyte action . 
The <START:ggp> CAML ( calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand ) protein <END> is a coinducer of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> activation when overexpressed in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
A member of the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily <END> was isolated by virtue of its affinity for <START:ggp> CAML <END> . 
Cross-linking of this <START:ggp> lymphocyte-specific protein <END> , designated <START:ggp> TACI <END> ( <START:ggp> transmembrane activator and CAML-interactor <END> ) , on the surface of <START:ana> transfected Jurkat cells <END> with <START:ggp> TACI-specific antibodies <END> led to activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> . 
<START:ggp> TACI <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> was specifically blocked by a <START:ggp> dominant-negative CAML mutant <END> , thus implicating <START:ggp> CAML <END> as a signaling intermediate . 
<START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> and the control of apoptosis . 
The process of apoptosis is used to eliminate <START:ana> unwanted cells <END> from a wide variety of organisms . 
Various extracellular signals , often converging in common intracellular pathways , can induce apoptosis in a cell-type-specific fashion . 
Recent work from several laboratories has demonstrated that <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> regulate apoptosis in many cell types . 
In most cells , <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> appear to mediate survival signals that protect cells from apoptosis ; however , under some circumstances , activation of these factors may also promote apoptosis . 
A thiol antioxidant regulates <START:ggp> IgE isotype <END> switching by inhibiting activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> . 
The <START:ggp> binding site <END> for <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) is present at the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> of the <START:ggp> germline Cepsilon gene <END> , but there is little information on whether this factor is involved in regulating <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis by <START:ana> human B cells <END> . 
Accordingly , we studied the role of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ggp> germline <END> Cepsilon transcription by using two <START:ana> human Burkitt 's lymphoma B cell lines <END> , <START:ana> DND39 <END> and <START:ana> DG75 <END> . 
In both <START:ana> cell lines <END> , n-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a potent thiol antioxidant , inhibited the triggering of the nuclear expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and by <START:ggp> anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> activated <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) 6 <END> in addition to <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , NAC treatment or the transfection of decoy oligodeoxynucleotides for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> or <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> only partly blocked <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -induced <START:ggp> germline <END> Cepsilon transcription . 
However , these two decoy oligodeoxynucleotides together almost completely abrogated <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -induced <START:ggp> germline <END> Cepsilon transcription . 
Of note , <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -mediated enhancement of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -driven <START:ggp> germline <END> Cepsilon transcription was markedly decreased by NAC or by a decoy oligodeoxynucleotide for <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
The effect of NAC was also examined on deletional switch recombination underlying the isotype switch to <START:ggp> IgE <END> . 
NAC inhibited the generation of <START:ggp> Smu/Sepsilon switch fragments <END> in normal <START:ana> human B cells <END> costimulated with <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody <END> . 
It also abolished <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -induced upregulation of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> but promoted upregulation of CD23 . 
These results suggest that coordination of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> may be required for induction of <START:ggp> germline <END> Cepsilon transcription by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , and that <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation may be important in regulating both enhancement of <START:ggp> germline <END> Cepsilon transcription and class switching to <START:ggp> IgE <END> . 
Pathogenesis . 
There are many hypotheses concerning the pathogenesis of endometriosis , though no single theory can explain all cases . 
It is likely that several mechanisms are involved . 
Early studies concentrated on the histogenesis of the endometriotic lesion . 
Recent evidence has implicated components of the immune system in the pathogenesis of endometriosis . 
This review considers the evidence for different theories of the histogenesis of endometriosis and discusses possible immune factors that may be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease . 
<START:ggp> ATF1 <END> and <START:ggp> CREB <END> trans-activate a <START:ggp> cell cycle regulated histone H4 gene <END> at a <START:ggp> distal nuclear matrix associated promoter element <END> . 
Proteins of the ATF/ <START:ggp> CREB <END> class of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> stimulate gene expression of several <START:ggp> cell growth-related genes <END> through <START:ggp> protein kinase A-related cAMP response elements <END> . 
The promoter activity of <START:ggp> cell cycle regulated histone H4 genes <END> is regulated by at least four <START:ggp> principal cis-acting elements <END> which mediate G1/S phase control and/or enhancement of transcription during the cell cycle . 
Using protein-DNA interaction assays we show that the <START:ggp> H4 promoter <END> contains two ATF/ <START:ggp> CREB <END> recognition motifs which interact with <START:ggp> CREB <END> , <START:ggp> ATF1 <END> , and <START:ggp> ATF2 <END> but not with <START:ggp> ATF4/CREB2 <END> . 
One <START:ggp> ATF/CRE motif <END> is located in the <START:ggp> distal promoter <END> at the <START:ggp> nuclear matrix-associated Site IV <END> , and the second motif is present in the <START:ggp> proximal promoter <END> at <START:ggp> Site I <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> ATF/CRE motifs <END> overlap <START:ggp> binding sequences <END> for the <START:ggp> multifunctional YY1 transcription factor <END> , which has previously been shown to be nuclear matrix associated . 
Subnuclear fractionation reveals that there are two <START:ggp> ATF1 isoforms <END> which appear to differ with respect to DNA binding activity and partition selectively between nuclear matrix and nonmatrix compartments , consistent with the role of the nuclear matrix in regulating gene expression . 
Site-directed mutational studies demonstrate that <START:ggp> Site I <END> and <START:ggp> Site IV <END> together support ATF1- and CREB-induced trans-activation of the <START:ggp> H4 promoter <END> . 
Thus , our data establish that <START:ggp> ATF/CREB factors <END> functionally modulate <START:ggp> histone H4 gene <END> transcription at <START:ggp> distal and proximal promoter elements <END> . 
Is celiac disease due to molecular mimicry between gliadin peptide <START:ggp> -HLA class II molecule <END> -T cell interactions and those of some <START:ggp> unidentified superantigen <END> ? 
This paper presents a new hypothesis for the etiology and pathogenesis of celiac disease ( CD ) . 
It is our contention that CD is triggered by the binding of one or more gliadin peptides to <START:ggp> CD-associated HLA class II molecules <END> . 
Furthermore , we propose that these putative CD peptides bind to oligosaccharide residues on <START:ggp> HLA class II molecules <END> distal to the <START:ggp> peptide-binding groove <END> invoking recognition and binding by specialized subsets of <START:ana> gamma delta T cell receptor-bearing lymphocytes <END> . 
The binding of these <START:ana> gamma delta T cells <END> serves as a signal for abrogation of oral tolerance to <START:ggp> ingested proteins <END> setting in motion a series of immune responses directed against the small intestinal epithelium of CD patients . 
CD patients are victimized by this self-distructed immune response because of inheritance of certain combinations of HLA-DQ and DR haplotypes . 
Dimers encoded by <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> haplotypes may be the <START:ggp> primary restriction elements <END> for lectin-like , gliadin peptides while the degree of immune suppression ( or lack thereof ) to ingested gliadins is governed by inherited <START:ggp> HLA-DQ <END> haplotypes . 
Finally , we speculate that molecular mimicry between one or more gliadin peptides and some , as yet unidentified , <START:ggp> bacterial or viral superantigen <END> plays a role in disease pathogenesis . 
Epstein-Barr virus <START:ggp> latent membrane protein-1 <END> triggers <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity via the <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> N-terminal kinase cascade . 
The Epstein-Barr virus <START:ggp> latent membrane protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> ) is an <START:ggp> integral membrane protein <END> which transforms <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> and is essential for EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization . 
<START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> has been shown to trigger cellular <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity which , however , can not fully explain the oncogenic potential of <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> . 
Here we show that <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> induces the activity of the <START:ggp> AP-1 transcription factor <END> , a dimer of <START:ggp> Jun/Jun or Jun/Fos proteins <END> . 
<START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> effects on <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> are mediated through activation of the <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> N-terminal kinase ( <START:ggp> JNK <END> ) cascade , but not the <START:ggp> extracellular signal-regulated kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> Erk <END> ) pathway . 
Consequently , <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> triggers the activity of the <START:ggp> c-Jun N-terminal transactivation domain <END> which is known to be activated upon <START:ggp> JNK <END> -mediated phosphorylation . 
Deletion analysis indicates that the 55 <START:ggp> C-terminal amino acids <END> of the <START:ggp> LMP-1 molecule <END> , but not its <START:ggp> TRAF interaction domain <END> , are essential for <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activation . 
<START:ggp> JNK <END> -mediated transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> is the direct output of <START:ggp> LMP <END> -1-triggered signaling , as shown by an inducible <START:ggp> LMP-1 mutant <END> . 
Using a <START:ggp> tetracycline-regulated LMP-1 allele <END> , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> JNK <END> is also an effector of non-cytotoxic <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> signaling in <START:ana> B cells <END> , the physiological target cells of EBV . 
In summary , our data reveal a novel effector of <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> , the SEK/ <START:ggp> JNK <END> / <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> / <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> pathway , which contributes to our understanding of the immortalizing and transforming potential of <START:ggp> LMP-1 <END> . 
Abnormal apoptosis and cell cycle progression in humans exposed to methyl tertiary-butyl ether and benzene contaminating water . 
1. In this study we hypothesized that in individuals with certain genetic makeup , MTBE , benzene or their metabolites act as adducts and may induce programmed cell death . 
2. Our study involved a group of 60 male and female subjects who were exposed to MTBE and benzene-contaminated water concentrations up to 76 PPB for MTBE and 14 PPB for benzene , for a period of 5 to 8 years . 
For comparison , we recruited a control group consisting of 32 healthy males and females with similar age distribution and without a history of exposure to MTBE or benzene . 
3 . <START:ana> Peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBL <END> ) of both groups were tested for the percentage of <START:ana> apoptotic cells <END> and cell cycle progression using flow cytometry . 
4. When <START:ana> apoptotic lymphocytes <END> from exposed individuals were compared to <START:ana> apoptotic lymphocytes <END> from the control group , statistically-significant differences between each mean group were detected ( 26.4 +/- 1.8 and 12.1 +/- 1.3 , respectively ) , indicating an increased rate of apoptosis in 80.5 % of exposed individuals ( P < 0.0001 , Mann-Whitney U-Test ) . 
MTBE and benzene-induced apoptosis is attributed to a discrete block within the cell cycle progression . 
Because cell cycle analysis showed that in <START:ana> PBL <END> from chemically-exposed individuals , between 20-50 % of cells were accumulated at the S-G2/M boundaries . 
5. One of the <START:ggp> signaling molecules <END> which mediates programmed cell death is <START:ggp> nuclear factor Kappa-B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was examined as one of the many molecular mechanisms for mediating cell death by MTBE and benzene . 
Indeed , addition of inhibitors of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , to the <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> of the chemically-exposed group was capable of inhibiting programmed cell death by 40 % . 
This reversal of apoptosis almost to the control level by inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation may indicate involvement of this <START:ggp> signaling molecule <END> in MTBE and benzene induction of programmed cell death . 
Purification and characterization of the <START:ggp> human SR 31747A-binding protein <END> . 
A <START:ggp> nuclear membrane protein <END> related to <START:ggp> yeast sterol isomerase <END> . 
SR 31747A , defined as a sigma ligand , is a novel immunosuppressive agent that blocks proliferation of <START:ana> human and mouse lymphocytes <END> . 
Using a radiolabeled chemical probe , we here purified a target of SR 31747A and called it <START:ggp> SR 31747A-binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> SR-BP <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> Purified SR-BP <END> retained its binding properties and migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a <START:ggp> Mr 28 , 000 protein <END> . 
Cloning of the <START:ggp> cDNA <END> encoding <START:ggp> human SR-BP <END> shows an <START:ggp> open reading frame <END> for a <START:ggp> 223-amino acid protein <END> , which is homologous to the recently cloned <START:ggp> sigma 1 receptor <END> . 
Interestingly , the deduced amino acid sequence was found to be related to <START:ggp> fungal C8-C7 sterol isomerase <END> , encoded by the <START:ggp> ERG2 gene <END> . 
The <START:ggp> ERG2 gene product <END> has been identified recently as the molecular target of SR 31747A that mediates antiproliferative effects of the drug in yeast . 
Northern blot analysis of <START:ggp> SR-BP <END> gene expression revealed a single transcript of <START:ana> 2 kilobases <END> which was widely expressed among organs , with the highest abundance in liver and the lowest abundance in brain . 
Subcellular localization analysis in various cells , using a <START:ggp> specific monoclonal antibody <END> raised against <START:ggp> SR-BP <END> , demonstrated that this protein was associated with the nuclear envelope . 
When studying the binding of SR 31747A on membranes from yeast expressing <START:ggp> SR-BP <END> , we found a pharmacological profile of <START:ggp> sigma 1 receptors <END> ; binding was displaced by ( + ) -pentazocine , haloperidol , and ( + ) -SKF 10 , 047 , with ( + ) -SKF 10 , 047 being a more potent competitor than ( - ) -SKF 10 , 047 . 
Scatchard plot analysis revealed Kd values of 7.1 nM and 0.15 nM for ( + ) -pentazocine and SR 31747A , respectively , indicating an affinity of <START:ggp> SR-BP <END> 50-fold higher for SR 31747A than for pentazocine . 
Additionally , we showed that pentazocine , a competitive inhibitor of SR 31747A binding , also prevents the immunosuppressive effect of SR 31747A . 
Taken together , these findings strongly suggest that <START:ggp> SR-BP <END> represents the molecular target for SR 31747A in mammalian tissues , which could be critical for T cell proliferation . 
<START:ggp> Phospholipase C gamma 1 <END> overexpression and activation induced by <START:ggp> interferon beta <END> in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> : an <START:ggp> ISGF3 <END> -independent response . 
<START:ggp> Interferons <END> exert their antiviral , antiproliferative and <START:ggp> immunoregulatory <END> activities by stimulating the expression of several genes . 
Such genes disclose a common element within their <START:ggp> promoters <END> , defined <START:ggp> Interferon Stimulated Response Element <END> ( <START:ggp> ISRE <END> ) , which binds a <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> ( s ) translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus ( <START:ggp> ISGF3 <END> ) after the binding of <START:ggp> interferon <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN <END> ) to the specific receptor . 
Here we report the induction of the synthesis and of the hydrolytic activity of <START:ggp> phospholipase C gamma 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> PLC gamma 1 <END> ) in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> by <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> . 
The increased level of <START:ggp> PLC gamma 1 <END> becomes evident after 90 min of <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> treatment and is still detectable after 24 h . 
Neither the <START:ggp> PLC gamma 1 <END> overexpression induced by <START:ggp> IFN <END> nor the increased hydrolytic activity of the <START:ggp> enzyme <END> appear to be affected by pretreatment of the cells with the protein <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> inhibitor genistein , which is known to prevent the association of <START:ggp> ISGF3 <END> components . 
These results suggest that in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> can activate other <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> ( s ) distinct from <START:ggp> ISGF3 <END> to regulate <START:ggp> PLC gamma 1 <END> expression . 
In addition , the ability of this <START:ggp> enzyme <END> to hydrolyse PIP2 , also in the presence of genistein , implies the possibility that this enzyme can exert its hydrolytic activity independently of <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase <END> activation . 
Negative regulation by <START:ggp> HLA-DO <END> of <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> -restricted antigen processing . 
<START:ggp> HLA-DM <END> is a <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II-like molecule <END> that facilitates antigen processing by catalyzing the exchange of invariant chain-derived peptides ( CLIP ) from <START:ggp> class II molecules <END> for antigenic peptides . 
<START:ggp> HLA-DO <END> is a second <START:ggp> class II-like molecule <END> that physically associates with <START:ggp> HLA-DM <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> HLA-DO <END> was shown to block <START:ggp> HLA-DM <END> function . 
Purified <START:ggp> HLA-DM-DO complexes <END> could not promote peptide exchange in vitro . 
Expression of <START:ggp> HLA-DO <END> in a <START:ana> class II+ and DM+ , DO- human T cell line <END> caused the accumulation of <START:ggp> class II-CLIP complexes <END> , indicating that <START:ggp> HLA-DO <END> blocked DM function in vivo and suggesting that <START:ggp> HLA-DO <END> is an important modulator of class II-restricted antigen processing . 
<START:ggp> Vitamin D receptor <END> : no evidence for allele-specific mRNA stability in cells which are heterozygous for the <START:ggp> Taq I restriction enzyme <END> polymorphism . 
Allelic variations of the <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) gene <END> have been associated with the risk of developing prostate cancer in men and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women . 
Three <START:ggp> RFLPs <END> ( <START:ggp> TaqI <END> , <START:ggp> ApaI <END> , <START:ggp> BsmI <END> ) define two common haplotypes : BAt and baT . 
None of these <START:ggp> polymorphisms <END> change the <START:ggp> translated protein <END> . 
Since <START:ggp> sequence variations <END> in the <START:ggp> 3 ' UTR <END> of <START:ggp> VDR <END> have been linked to the different haplotypes , investigators have proposed that the stability of <START:ana> VDR mRNA <END> is influenced by allelic variations . 
Indirect evidence suggested that <START:ggp> allele T <END> is less stable than <START:ggp> allele t <END> . 
In this study , we used a RT-PCR based approach to compare the stability of the <START:ggp> big T and small t allele <END> in <START:ana> normal heterozygous lymphocytes <END> and the <START:ana> heterozygous cell lines <END> <START:ana> NB4 <END> ( myeloid leukemia ) and <START:ana> PC-3 <END> and <START:ana> DU 145 <END> ( prostate cancers ) . 
In all three cases , we did not find a significant difference in stability . 
Interestingly , we consistently observed 30 % less <START:ggp> RT-PCR product <END> derived from the <START:ana> small t allele mRNA <END> in steady state , a finding which also speaks against a higher stability of the <START:ana> small t allele mRNA <END> . 
These results indicate a variation in transcriptional regulation rather than mRNA stability between the <START:ggp> alleles <END> . 
We hypothesize that an unknown gene or genes in linkage with the <START:ggp> polymorphisms <END> is ( are ) responsible for the relationship between risk of prostate cancer and <START:ggp> VDR <END> <START:ggp> polymorphisms <END> . 
Replication of human immunodeficiency virus-1 in <START:ana> primary human T cells <END> is dependent on the autocrine secretion of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> through the control of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> activation . 
<START:ggp> Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha <END> controls T-cell activation and is a major inducer of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -1 replication in <START:ana> chronically infected cells <END> . 
Therefore , we have investigated its role in primary cultures of <START:ana> HIV-infected human T lymphocytes <END> by using neutralizing <START:ggp> anti-TNF-alpha antibodies <END> or <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> . 
Primary resting T lymphocytes produced <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and supported HIV replication after T-cell receptor activation . 
Addition of neutralizing <START:ggp> anti-TNF-alpha antibodies <END> drastically reduced <START:ggp> p24 antigen <END> release and prevented <START:ggp> CD4+ <END> cell depletion associated with infection . 
<START:ggp> Anti-TNF-alpha <END> also prevented <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) activation , and a good correlation between this inhibition and inhibition of HIV replication was observed . 
Moreover , supplementing the cultures with high doses of IL-2 reverted anti- <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> inhibition of cell proliferation but did not affect the inhibition of HIV <START:ggp> p24 antigen <END> release or <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in the same cultures . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> anti-TNF-alpha <END> inhibited <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) -driven transcription of a <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> in <START:ana> primary T cells <END> in response to activation , either in the presence or the absence of <START:ggp> HIV-1 Tat <END> . 
Our results support an important role for autocrine <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> secretion in controlling HIV replication in <START:ana> primary T cells <END> because of its ability to maintain <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> elevated in the nucleus of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Hypoxia enhances induction of <START:ggp> endothelial ICAM-1 <END> : role for metabolic acidosis and <START:ggp> proteasomes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ) is an important molecule in promotion of polymorphonuclear neutrophil transendothelial migration during inflammation . 
Coincident with many inflammatory diseases is tissue hypoxia . 
Thus we hypothesized that combinations of hypoxia and inflammatory stimuli may differentially regulate expression of <START:ggp> endothelial ICAM-1 <END> . 
<START:ana> Human endothelial cells <END> were exposed to hypoxia in the presence or absence of added lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and examined for expression of functional <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> . 
Although hypoxia alone did not induce <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> , the combination of LPS and hypoxia enhanced ( 3 +/- 0.4-fold over normoxia ) <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> expression . 
Combinations of hypoxia and LPS significantly increased lymphocyte binding , and such increases were inhibited by addition of <START:ggp> anti-ICAM-1 antibodies <END> or antisense oligonucleotides . 
Hypoxic endothelia showed a > 10-fold increase in sensitivity to inhibitors of <START:ggp> proteasome <END> activation , and combinations of hypoxia and LPS enhanced <START:ggp> proteasome <END> -dependent cytoplasmic-to-nuclear localization of the <START:ggp> nuclear transcription factor-kappa B p65 ( Rel A ) subunit <END> . 
Such <START:ggp> proteasome <END> activation correlated with hypoxia-evoked decreases in both extracellular and intracellular pH . 
We conclude from these studies that endothelial hypoxia provides a novel , <START:ggp> proteasome <END> -dependent stimulus for <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> induction . 
Differanisole A , a novel antitumor antibiotic , enhances growth inhibition and differentiation of <START:ana> human myeloid leukemia cells <END> induced by 9-cis retinoic acid . 
Differanisole A , 3 , 5-dichloro-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-n-propylbenzoic acid , inhibited growth of <START:ana> human myeloid leukemia cells <END> . 
The compound induced G1 arrest and granulocytic differentiation of <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> , although the differentiation-inducing effect was modest . 
Differanisole A and 9-cis retinoic acid ( 9cisRA ) synergistically inhibited the growth and induced functional and morphologic differentiation of <START:ana> HL-60 and NB4 cells <END> , whereas the combined treatment with differanisole A and all-trans retinoic acid or 1alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was less effective . 
Similar results were obtained in primary culture of <START:ana> leukemia cells <END> from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia . 
The synergistic effect on growth inhibition and induction of differentiation required simultaneous treatment with differanisole A and 9cisRA . 
Differanisole A and an RXR-specific ligand ( Ro47-5944 ) cooperatively inhibited the cell growth , while the combined effect of differanisole A and an RAR-specific ligand Am80 was just additive . 
Differanisole A in combination with 9cisRA may have implications for therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients . 
The activation of the <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> <START:ggp> /STAT5 <END> pathway is commonly involved in signaling through the <START:ggp> human IL-5 receptor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> JAK ( Janus kinase ) family <END> of <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinases <END> and the <START:ggp> STATs <END> ( <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription <END> ) have been shown to be activated in response to a number of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> growth factors <END> . 
In this study , we evaluated the activation of <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> /STAT <END> pathway upon <START:ggp> human interleukin-5 <END> ( <START:ggp> hIL-5 <END> ) stimulation of two different <START:ana> hIL-5-responsive cell lines <END> , <START:ana> hIL-5 receptor alpha-subunit ( hIL-5R alpha ) cDNA-transfected TF-1 <END> ( <START:ana> TF-h5R alpha <END> ) and <START:ana> butyric-acid-treated YY-1 <END> ( <START:ana> YY-Bu <END> ) , and <START:ana> peripheral eosinophils <END> . 
Immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> and activation of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> were induced upon stimulation with <START:ggp> hIL-5 <END> in all three cell types , while <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> activation was only observed in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> <START:ggp> /STAT5 <END> activation is a common <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> /STAT <END> pathway for <START:ggp> hIL-5 <END> -mediated signal in these cells . 
Dysregulation of <START:ggp> monocytic nuclear factor-kappa B <END> by oxidized <START:ggp> low-density lipoprotein <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) /Rel transcription factors <END> may be involved in atherosclerosis , as is suggested by the presence of activated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in human atherosclerotic lesions . 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of <START:ggp> oxidized LDL <END> ( <START:ggp> oxLDL <END> ) on the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> system in human <START:ana> THP-1 monocytic cells <END> as well as <START:ana> adherent monocytes <END> . 
Our results demonstrate that short-term incubation of these cells with <START:ggp> oxLDL activated p50/p65 <END> containing <START:ggp> NF-kappa B dimers <END> and induced the expression of the <START:ggp> target gene IL-8 <END> . 
This activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was inhibited by the antioxidant and H2O2 scavenger pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and the <START:ggp> proteasome <END> inhibitor PSI . 
The <START:ggp> oxLDL <END> -induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation was accompanied by an initial depletion of <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> followed by a slight transient increase in the level of this inhibitor protein . 
In contrast , long-term treatment with <START:ggp> oxLDL <END> prevented the lipopolysaccharide-induced depletion of <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> , accompanied by an inhibition of both <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation and the expression of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta genes <END> . 
These observations provide additional evidence that <START:ggp> oxLDL <END> is a potent modulator of gene expression and suggest that ( dys ) regulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> is likely to play an important role in atherogenesis . 
Suppression of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> CD18 <END> -mediated leukocyte adhesion to the corneal endothelium by dexamethasone . 
PURPOSE : To demonstrate that leukocyte adhesion to <START:ana> cultured corneal endothelial cells <END> is mediated by the <START:ggp> CD18 antigen <END> , and to determine whether dexamethasone directly suppresses adhesion by inhibiting activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> ) . 
METHODS : Cultured bovine corneal endothelium was stimulated for 6 hours by 40 micron/ml <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> ) . 
Dexamethasone was added 1 hour before <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> stimulation in the dexamethasone group . 
After stimulation , neutrophils separated from a healthy human volunteer were added with or without <START:ggp> anti-CD18 antibody <END> . 
The culture plate was settled for 15 minutes at 37 degrees C , and then <START:ana> neutrophils <END> were activated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine for 5 minutes . 
Nonadherent <START:ana> neutrophils <END> were removed by sealing and inverting the culture well . 
The intracellular localization of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> after <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> simulation was determined by confocal immunocytochemistry using an <START:ggp> anti-p65 antibody <END> . 
RESULTS : Neutrophil adhesion to <START:ana> cultured corneal endothelial cells <END> increased significantly on exposure to <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> ( 451.4+/-45.4 cells/mm2 , n = 16 ) compared to control ( 156.7+/-27.3 cells/mm2 , n = 16 , P < 0.01 ) . 
This increased adhesion was suppressed by the addition of <START:ggp> anti-CD18 antibody <END> ( 157.6+/-25.1 cells/mm2 , n = 8 , P < 0.01 ) and by pretreatment with 10 ( -7 ) M dexamethasone ( 207.9+/-31.5 cells/mm2 , n = 10 , P < 0.01 ) . 
Immunocytochemistry 60 minutes after stimulation revealed that <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> was located in the cytoplasm in <START:ana> unstimulated cells <END> ; however , the addition of <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> caused <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> to translocate into the nucleus . 
Pretreatment with dexamethasone tapered <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> translocation into the nucleus . 
CONCLUSIONS : Leukocyte adhesion to the corneal endothelium was shown to be mediated by <START:ggp> CD18 <END> expressed on <START:ana> activated leukocytes <END> . 
Pretreatment of the endothelium with dexamethasone inhibited leukocyte adhesion ; this may be due in part to the suppression of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> entry into the nucleus . 
Molecular characterization and pattern of tissue expression of the gene for <START:ggp> neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin <END> from humans . 
<START:ggp> Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin <END> ( <START:ggp> NGAL <END> ) is a <START:ggp> 25-kDa lipocalin <END> first identified as a protein stored in specific granules of the <START:ana> human neutrophil <END> . 
The protein is believed to bind small lipophilic substances such as bacterial derived formylpeptides and lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) and might function as a modulator of inflammation . 
To characterize the regulation of <START:ggp> NGAL <END> further , we have cloned and sequenced a <START:ggp> 5869-bp region <END> of the <START:ggp> NGAL gene <END> including 1695 bp of the <START:ggp> 5 ' nontranscribed region <END> and a <START:ggp> 3696-bp coding region <END> encompassing <START:ggp> seven exons and six introns <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcriptional start sites <END> were identified by an <START:ggp> RNase <END> protection assay . 
The <START:ggp> NGAL <END> gene is highly homologous to the <START:ggp> mouse gene 24p3 <END> . 
<START:ggp> NGAL <END> was expressed in bone marrow and in tissues that are prone to exposure to microorganisms . 
Potential <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> were identified in the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> of the <START:ggp> NGAL gene <END> by computer analysis and include <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> CTF/CBP <END> , the <START:ggp> hematopoietic transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , and the <START:ggp> LPS-inducible factor NF-kappa B <END> . 
<START:ana> Human neutrophils <END> express <START:ana> GH-N gene transcripts <END> and the <START:ggp> pituitary transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Pit-1b <END> . 
Since <START:ggp> GH <END> stimulates the development and function of <START:ana> granulocytes <END> , we investigated the expression of <START:ggp> GH <END> in <START:ana> granulocyte subsets <END> . 
By immunocytochemistry , 25 +/- 7 % of the <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> were shown to express <START:ggp> immunoreactive GH <END> , whereas <START:ana> eosinophils <END> were negative . 
Reversed transcription ( RT ) -PCR analysis demonstrated <START:ana> GH mRNA <END> in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> . 
Restriction analysis revealed that <START:ana> neutrophils <END> express the <START:ggp> GH-N gene <END> but not the <START:ggp> GH-V gene <END> . 
Furthermore , we demonstrated by western blot analysis that <START:ana> neutrophils <END> express an alternatively spliced variant of the <START:ggp> pituitary transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Pit-1 <END> , designated <START:ggp> Pit-1b <END> . 
The ability of <START:ggp> BHRF1 <END> to inhibit apoptosis is dependent on stimulus and cell type . 
The development of resistance to host defense mechanisms such as tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - and Fas-mediated apoptosis of <START:ana> transformed <END> or <START:ana> virus-infected cells <END> may be a critical component in the development of disease . 
To find genes that protect cells from apoptosis , we used an expression cloning strategy and identified <START:ggp> BHRF1 <END> , an <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) early-lytic-cycle protein <END> with distant homology to <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> , as an <START:ggp> anti-apoptosis protein <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> BHRF1 <END> in <START:ana> MCF-Fas cells <END> conferred nearly complete resistance against both <START:ggp> anti-Fas antibody <END> and TNF-mediated apoptosis . 
In addition , <START:ggp> BHRF1 <END> protected these cells from monocyte-mediated killing but failed to protect them from killing mediated by <START:ana> lymphokine-activated killer cells <END> . 
The ability of <START:ggp> BHRF1 <END> to protect <START:ana> MCF-Fas cells <END> from apoptosis induced by various stimuli was identical to that of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> and <START:ggp> Bcl-xL <END> . 
Moreover , the mechanism of action of <START:ggp> BHRF1 <END> resembled that of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> and <START:ggp> Bcl-xL <END> as it inhibited TNF- and anti-Fas-induced activation of two enzymes participating in the apoptosis pathway , <START:ggp> cytosolic phospholipase A2 <END> and <START:ggp> caspase-3/CPP32 <END> , but did not interfere with the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-like transcription factors <END> . 
A putative function of <START:ggp> BHRF1 <END> in <START:ana> EBV-infected epithelial cells <END> may be to protect virus-infected cells from TNF- and/or anti-Fas- induced cell death in order to maximize virus production . 
Surprisingly , expression of neither <START:ggp> BHRF1 <END> nor <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> in a <START:ana> B-cell line <END> , <START:ana> BJAB <END> , protected the cells from anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis even though they increased the survival of <START:ana> serum-starved cells <END> . 
Thus , the protective role of <START:ggp> BHRF1 <END> against apoptosis resembles that of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> in being cell type specific and dependent on the apoptotic stimulus . 
Genomic organization , sequence , and transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> human eotaxin gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> Eotaxin <END> is an <START:ggp> eosinophil specific beta-chemokine <END> assumed to be involved in eosinophilic inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis , allergic rhinitis , asthma and parasitic infections . 
Its expression is stimulus- and cell-specific . 
We here describe the genomic organisation ( 3 <START:ggp> exons <END> of 132 , 112 and 542 bp and 2 <START:ggp> introns <END> of 1211 and 378 bp ) and sequence including 3 kb of DNA from the immediate <START:ggp> 5 ' upstream region <END> of the <START:ggp> human eotaxin gene <END> . 
Among the <START:ggp> regulatory promoter elements <END> potentially regulating <START:ggp> eotaxin gene <END> expression and/or mediating the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs we identified <START:ggp> consensus sequences <END> known to interact with <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> like <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , a <START:ggp> NF-kappa-B like consensus sequence <END> and <START:ggp> gamma-interferon- as well as glucocorticoid response elements <END> . 
Differential interaction of <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> with the <START:ggp> leukocyte-specific pp52 promoter <END> in <START:ana> B and T cells <END> . 
The leukocyte-specific , cytoskeleton-binding pp52 ( LSP-1 , WP-34 ) protein is widely expressed in multiple leukocyte lineages , including <START:ana> B and T lymphocytes <END> , <START:ana> granulocytes <END> , and <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
We previously detected a <START:ggp> tissue-specific promoter <END> preceding the exon encoding the <START:ggp> N terminus <END> of the <START:ggp> pp52 leukocyte protein <END> . 
Here we describe the functional characterization of this promoter and identification of the factors in <START:ana> B and T cells <END> that regulate its activity . 
The <START:ggp> pp52 promoter <END> contains an initiator specifying the unique <START:ggp> 5 ' terminus <END> of <START:ana> pp52 mRNA <END> , tandem pairs of <START:ggp> Ets and SP1 motifs <END> , and a <START:ggp> lone C/EBP motif <END> . 
All these motifs are essential and collectively control transcriptional activity . 
DNA binding studies and Ab supershift assays revealed that different combinations of factors interact with these motifs in <START:ana> B cells <END> vs <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Ets motifs <END> are preferentially bound by <START:ggp> PU-1 <END> in B cell extracts from all stages of development , whereas a different <START:ggp> Ets family member <END> reacts with these motifs in T cell extracts . 
The <START:ggp> C/EBP motif <END> is bound by <START:ggp> Ig/EBP-1 <END> in pre-B cell and T cell extracts , but is replaced by <START:ggp> nuclear factor-IL-6beta <END> or a <START:ggp> nuclear factor-IL-6beta-Ig/EBP-1 heterodimer <END> in plasmacytoma cell extracts . 
Despite its reported role as a negative regulator of transcription , <START:ggp> Ig/EBP-1 <END> appears to exert a stimulatory effect on this <START:ggp> promoter <END> . 
These findings reveal the features controlling the <START:ggp> pp52 promoter <END> in <START:ana> B and T cells <END> and provide the foundation for determining the regulation of this <START:ggp> promoter <END> in other <START:ana> leukocyte lineages <END> . 
Regulation of B-cell commitment to <START:ana> plasma cells <END> or to <START:ana> memory B cells <END> . 
During humoral immune responses , B-lymphocyte activation is followed by differentiation along either the plasma cell pathway or the memory B-cell pathway . 
Recent studies suggest that <START:ggp> CD40-CD40 ligand <END> , <START:ggp> OX-OX40 ligand <END> , a group of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and intracellular transcriptional factors may all contribute to B-lymphocyte differentiation control . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor <END> binding sites downstream of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription start site <END> are important for virus infectivity . 
When transcriptionally active , the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) <START:ggp> promoter <END> contains a nucleosome-free region encompassing both the <START:ggp> promoter/enhancer region <END> and a large region ( <START:ggp> 255 nucleotides <END> [ nt ] ) downstream of the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> . 
We have previously identified new binding sites for <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> downstream of the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> ( <START:ggp> nt 465 to 720 <END> ) : three <START:ggp> AP-1 sites <END> ( I , II , and III ) , an <START:ggp> AP3-like motif <END> ( <START:ggp> AP3-L <END> ) , a <START:ggp> downstream binding factor ( DBF ) site <END> , and <START:ggp> juxtaposed Sp1 sites <END> . 
Here , we show that the <START:ggp> DBF site <END> is an <START:ggp> interferon-responsive factor ( IRF ) binding site <END> and that the <START:ggp> AP3-L motif <END> binds the <START:ggp> T-cell-specific factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
Mutations that abolish the binding of each factor to its cognate site are introduced in an infectious HIV-1 molecular clone to study their effect on HIV-1 transcription and replication . 
Individual mutation of the DBF or <START:ggp> AP3-L <END> site as well as the double <START:ggp> mutation AP-1 ( III ) /AP3-L <END> did not affect HIV-1 replication compared to that of the wild-type virus . 
In contrast , proviruses carrying mutations in the <START:ggp> Sp1 sites <END> were totally defective in terms of replication . 
Virus production occurred with slightly delayed kinetics for viruses containing combined mutations in the <START:ggp> AP-1 ( III ) <END> , <START:ggp> AP3-L <END> , and <START:ggp> DBF sites <END> and in the <START:ggp> AP3-L <END> and <START:ggp> DBF-sites <END> , whereas viruses mutated in the <START:ggp> AP-1 ( I , II , III ) <END> and <START:ggp> AP3-L sites <END> and in the AP-1 ( I , II , III ) , <START:ggp> AP3-L <END> , and <START:ggp> DBF sites <END> exhibited a severely defective replicative phenotype . 
No RNA-packaging defect could be measured for any of the mutant viruses as determined by quantification of their <START:ana> HIV genomic RNA <END> . 
Measurement of the transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 promoter <END> after transient transfection of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 provirus DNA <END> or of <START:ggp> long terminal repeat-luciferase constructs <END> showed a positive correlation between the transcriptional and the replication defects for most mutants . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptor <END> regulates expression of <START:ggp> L-selectin <END> and <START:ggp> CD11/CD18 <END> on <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> [ see comments ] 
BACKGROUND : Recent studies have raised the hypothesis that glucocorticoids could diminish the ability of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> to direct leukocyte traffic into inflamed tissues by inhibiting expression of the <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> <START:ggp> endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 <END> and <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> . 
The aim of the present study was to investigate whether glucocorticoids also regulate the expression of <START:ggp> L-selectin <END> and <START:ggp> CD11/CD18 <END> <START:ggp> integrins <END> on <START:ana> human neutrophil granulocytes <END> . 
METHODS AND RESULTS : Incubation of human whole blood with <START:ggp> platelet-activating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> PAF <END> , 1 mumol/L ) evoked downregulation of <START:ggp> L-selectin <END> and upregulation of <START:ggp> CD11/CD18 <END> <START:ggp> adhesion receptors <END> on neutrophils as measured by flow cytometry . 
While dexamethasone ( 0.1 nmol/L to 100 mumol/L ) did not affect expression of <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> on <START:ana> resting neutrophils <END> , it attenuated the <START:ggp> PAF <END> -induced changes in <START:ggp> L-selectin <END> and <START:ggp> CD18 <END> expression in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion with IC50 values of 31 and 13 nmol/L , respectively . 
These effects of dexamethasone were completely aborted by RU-486 ( 10 mumol/L ) , which blocks transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> , and by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( 35.5 mumol/L ) . 
Dexamethasone , up to a concentration of 1 mumol/L , neither affected significantly the release of <START:ggp> granule enzymes <END> nor interfered with <START:ggp> PAF <END> binding to its <START:ggp> membrane receptors <END> . 
CONCLUSIONS : Our results show that glucocorticoids at clinically relevant concentrations exert specific actions on expression of <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> on <START:ana> activated neutrophils <END> , which are mediated through ligation of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> and induction of protein synthesis , and suggest a novel mechanism by which anti-inflammatory corticosteroids may inhibit leukocyte accumulation . 
The immediate-early gene product <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> regulates the <START:ggp> human interleukin-2 receptor beta-chain promoter <END> through <START:ggp> noncanonical Egr and Sp1 binding sites <END> . 
The <START:ggp> interleukin-2 IL-2 receptor beta-chain <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2Rbeta <END> ) is an essential component of the receptors for <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> IL-2Rbeta <END> is constitutively expressed by lymphocytes , its expression can be further induced by a number of stimuli , including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) . 
We have now characterized factors that bind to an enhancer region located between <START:ggp> nucleotides -170 and -139 <END> of the human <START:ggp> IL-2Rbeta promoter <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> Sp3 <END> bound to the <START:ggp> 5 ' portion <END> of this region , whereas a <START:ggp> PMA-inducible factor <END> ( <START:ggp> PIF <END> ) mainly bound to its <START:ggp> 3 ' portion <END> and bound to the <START:ggp> Sp binding motifs <END> as well . 
In <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> , induction of <START:ggp> PIF <END> DNA binding activity was rapidly induced , required de novo protein synthesis , and was sustained at a high level for at least 23 h . 
Interestingly , <START:ggp> PIF <END> was constitutively activated in <START:ana> human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-transformed MT-2 cells <END> . 
In this paper , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> PIF <END> is <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> based on its recognition by anti- <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> antisera in gel mobility shift assays , even though the <START:ggp> IL-2Rbeta DNA binding motif <END> differed substantially from the canonical <START:ggp> Egr-1 binding site <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> bound to the <START:ggp> Sp binding site <END> . 
In <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , both sites were required for maximal <START:ggp> IL-2Rbeta <END> promoter activity , and in HeLaS3 cells , transfection of <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> could drive activity of a reporter construct containing both sites . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> could form a complex with kinetics that correlated with the production of <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> upon PMA stimulation . 
Thus , <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> physically and functionally cooperate to mediate maximal <START:ggp> IL-2Rbeta promoter <END> activity . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> HSF2-beta <END> inhibits <START:ggp> hemin <END> -induced heat shock gene expression and erythroid differentiation in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
Acquisition of heat shock factor 2 ( HSF2 ) DNA binding activity is accompanied by induced transcription of <START:ggp> heat shock genes <END> in hemin-treated <START:ana> K562 cells <END> undergoing erythroid differentiation . 
Previous studies revealed that <START:ggp> HSF2 <END> consists of two alternatively spliced isoforms , <START:ggp> HSF2-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> HSF2-beta <END> , whose relative abundance is developmentally regulated and varies between different tissues . 
To investigate whether the molar ratio of <START:ggp> HSF2-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> HSF2-beta <END> isoforms is crucial for the activation of <START:ggp> HSF2 <END> and whether the <START:ggp> HSF2 <END> isoforms play functionally distinct roles during the hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation , we generated cell clones expressing different levels of <START:ggp> HSF2-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> HSF2-beta <END> . 
We show that in parental <START:ana> K562 cells <END> , the <START:ggp> HSF2-alpha isoform <END> is predominantly expressed and <START:ggp> HSF2 <END> can be activated upon hemin treatment . 
In contrast , when <START:ggp> HSF2-beta <END> is expressed at levels exceeding those of <START:ggp> endogenous HSF2-alpha <END> , the hemin-induced DNA binding activity and transcription of <START:ggp> heat shock genes <END> are repressed , whereas overexpression of <START:ggp> HSF2-alpha <END> results in an enhanced <START:ggp> hemin <END> response . 
Furthermore , the <START:ggp> hemin <END> -induced accumulation of <START:ggp> globin <END> , known as a marker of erythroid differentiation , is decreased in cells overexpressing <START:ggp> HSF2-beta <END> . 
We suggest that <START:ggp> HSF2-beta <END> acts as a negative regulator of <START:ggp> HSF2 <END> activity during hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation of <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
Sequential development of structural and functional alterations in <START:ana> T cells <END> from tumor-bearing mice . 
The <START:ggp> TCR alpha beta or -gamma delta chains <END> bind the peptide ligand , whereas the associated <START:ggp> CD3 delta epsilon gamma <END> and <START:ggp> TCR zeta subunits <END> couple the <START:ggp> TCR <END> to intracellular signal transduction components . 
Recently , several groups have described marked alterations in signal transduction elements in <START:ana> T cells <END> from cancer patients or in mice bearing tumor for a few weeks ( > 26 days ) . 
The sequence in which these alterations develop is unknown . 
The aim of this study was to explore the kinetics of the development of alterations in signal transduction molecules ( <START:ggp> TCR zeta chain <END> , <START:ggp> NF kappaB family proteins <END> , and <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase p56 ( lck ) <END> ) in mice bearing MC38 colon adenocarcinoma . 
The results demonstrate that alterations in <START:ggp> NF kappaB family proteins <END> , specifically the failure of <START:ggp> p65 <END> translocation to the nucleus , occur earlier and more frequently than the decrease in <START:ggp> zeta-chain <END> . 
These defects are paralleled by an impaired ability to produce <START:ggp> Th1 cytokines <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) . 
These initial changes are followed by the eventual loss of <START:ggp> TCR zeta chain <END> and <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> and a marked decrease in cytotoxic function . 
An increased rate of lysosomal degradation is one of the mechanisms responsible for the loss of <START:ggp> zeta-chain <END> . 
HLA-DMA and HLA-DMB gene expression functions through the conserved <START:ggp> S-X-Y region <END> . 
The <START:ggp> MHC class II homologous proteins <END> <START:ggp> HLA-DMA <END> and <START:ggp> HLA-DMB <END> function in the loading of peptides onto <START:ggp> class II molecules <END> . 
Like the <START:ggp> class II genes <END> , the <START:ggp> HLA-DM genes <END> contain upstream regulatory sequences similar to the <START:ggp> S-X-Y regulatory region <END> as well as additional putative regulatory sites . 
To determine whether the <START:ggp> DM genes <END> are regulated in a similar manner as <START:ggp> class II genes <END> , a series of in vivo and in vitro analyses was performed . 
Deletion analysis showed that expression from the <START:ggp> DM promoters <END> is dependent on the conserved <START:ggp> S-X-Y region <END> . 
The <START:ggp> class II-specific transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> RFX <END> and <START:ggp> CIITA <END> are also required for expression , as cell lines deficient in these factors failed to allow transcription from the <START:ggp> DM promoters <END> . 
In addition , in vivo footprint analysis showed the putative <START:ggp> X and Y boxes <END> to be occupied by <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in <START:ana> wild-type B cells <END> , but not in <START:ana> RFX-deficient B cells <END> . 
In <START:ana> astrocytes <END> , <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> treatment induced increased occupancy of these sites . 
None of the other putative regulatory sites was occupied in vivo , indicating that they may not be functional . 
Finally , gel shift analysis showed synergistic complex formation between proteins that bind to the putative <START:ggp> X boxes <END> of the DM genes , as is found for the <START:ggp> DRA gene <END> . 
Therefore , the <START:ggp> DM genes <END> share a common mechanism of regulation with the <START:ggp> class II genes <END> . 
Effect of adenovirus 2 on cellular gene activation in <START:ana> blood-derived monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
We have investigated the effect of adenovirus 2 ( Ad2 ) infection on <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> monocyte-derived macrophages <END> with regard to expression of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> . 
In monocytes , the virus was bound to the surface without being internalized . 
On the other hand , Ad2 was internalized by <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
No virus replication and no transcription of the <START:ggp> Ad2 early genes <END> was observed in either of the cells . 
Ad2 infection induced transient increase in the <START:ana> mRNA <END> levels for <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> in both <START:ana> monocytes <END> and in <START:ana> macrophages <END> , although the kinetics of the transcription was slightly different . 
The production of both <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , measured by ELISA tests , was enhanced in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
In <START:ana> macrophages <END> , a slight enhancement of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> production was seen , whereas <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> was not detected . 
The data indicate that <START:ggp> cellular genes <END> might be activated by Ad2 virus infection in nonpermissive cells where no <START:ggp> viral gene products <END> could be detected . 
Structure and function analysis of the <START:ggp> human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen promoter <END> : evidence for the role of <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and not of <START:ggp> c-Myb <END> or <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> in myelomonocytic lineage-specific expression . 
The <START:ggp> human myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen <END> ( <START:ggp> MNDA <END> ) is expressed specifically in <START:ana> maturing cells <END> of the myelomonocytic lineage and in <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> granulocytes <END> . 
Epitope enhancement was used to confirm the strict lineage- and stage-specific expression of <START:ggp> MNDA <END> in bone marrow as well as in other paraffin-embedded fixed tissues . 
A <START:ggp> 1-kb region <END> of the gene that includes <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking sequence <END> was reported earlier to contain functional promoter activity and was specifically demethylated in <START:ana> expressing cells <END> in contrast to <START:ana> null cells <END> . 
Further analysis has revealed that this <START:ggp> 1-kb fragment <END> promotes higher reporter gene activity in <START:ggp> MNDA <END> <START:ana> -expressing cells <END> than <START:ana> non-expressing cells <END> , indicating cell-specific differences in transactivation . 
This sequence contains <START:ggp> consensus elements <END> consistent with myeloid-specific gene expression , including a <START:ggp> PU.1 consensus site <END> near the major <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> and a cluster of <START:ggp> c-Myb sites <END> located several hundred bases upstream of this region . 
However , analysis of <START:ggp> deletion mutants <END> localized nearly all of the promoter activity to a short region ( <START:ggp> -73 to -16 <END> ) that did not include the cluster of <START:ggp> c-Myb sites <END> . 
A 4-bp mutation of the <START:ggp> core Sp1 consensus element <END> ( <START:ggp> GC box <END> ) ( -20 ) reduced overall promoter activity of the <START:ggp> 1-kb fragment <END> . 
Mutation of the <START:ggp> PU.1 site <END> did not significantly affect promoter activity . 
Only a small region ( -35 to +22 ) including the <START:ggp> Sp1 element <END> and <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> , but not the <START:ggp> PU.1 site <END> was footprinted . 
The 4-bp mutation of the core <START:ggp> Sp1 consensus element <END> abolished footprinting at the site and an antibody super-shift reaction showed that <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> is one of the factors binding the <START:ggp> consensus site <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Sp1 site <END> also co-localizes with a <START:ggp> DNase I hypersensitive site <END> . 
The results indicate that DNA methylation , <START:ggp> chromatin <END> structure , and transactivation at an <START:ggp> Sp1 site <END> contribute to the highly restricted expression of this <START:ggp> myelomonocytic lineage specific gene <END> . 
Critical <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domains <END> of <START:ggp> human interleukin-9 receptor alpha chain <END> in <START:ggp> interleukin <END> -9-mediated cell proliferation and signal transduction . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-9 receptor ( IL-9R ) complex <END> consists of a <START:ggp> ligand-specific alpha chain <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2R gamma chain <END> . 
In this study , two regions in the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> of <START:ggp> human IL-9Ralpha <END> were found to be important for <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> -mediated cell growth . 
A <START:ggp> membrane-proximal region <END> that contains the <START:ggp> BOX1 consensus sequence <END> is required for <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> -induced cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Janus kinases <END> ( <START:ggp> JAKs <END> ) . 
Deletion of this region or internal deletion of the <START:ggp> BOX1 motif <END> abrogated <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> -induced cell proliferation and signal transduction . 
However , substitution of the <START:ggp> Pro-X-Pro <END> in the <START:ggp> BOX1 motif <END> with <START:ggp> Ala-X-Ala <END> failed to abolish <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> -induced cell proliferation but decreased <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> JAK kinases <END> , <START:ggp> insulin receptor substrate-2 <END> , and <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> ) and expression of <START:ggp> c-myc <END> and <START:ggp> junB <END> . 
Another important region is downstream of the <START:ggp> BOX1 motif <END> and contains a <START:ggp> STAT3 binding motif <END> <START:ggp> YLPQ <END> . 
Deletion of this region significantly impaired <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> -induced cell growth , activation of <START:ggp> JAK kinases <END> , <START:ggp> insulin receptor substrate-2 <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> and expression of <START:ggp> early response genes <END> . 
A point mutation changing <START:ggp> YLPQ <END> into <START:ggp> YLPA <END> greatly reduced <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> and expression of <START:ggp> c-myc <END> but did not affect cell proliferation . 
These results suggest that cooperation or cross-talk of signaling molecules associated with different domains of <START:ggp> IL-9Ralpha <END> other than <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> is essential for <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> -mediated cell growth . 
<START:ggp> Bcl-2 protein <END> inhibits bufalin-induced apoptosis through inhibition of <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> activation in <START:ana> human leukemia U937 cells <END> . 
In a previous study , we demonstrated that bufalin , which is an active principle of Chinese medicine , chan'su , caused apoptosis in <START:ana> human leukemia U937 cells <END> by anomalous activation of <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MAPK <END> ) via the signaling pathway of <START:ggp> Ras <END> , <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> MAPK kinase-1 <END> . 
Here , we report the effect of overexpression of <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> on the signaling pathway of apoptosis that is induced by bufalin . 
The results indicated that the apoptosis induced by bufalin in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> was significantly inhibited by overexpression of the <START:ggp> Bcl-2 protein <END> . 
No significant difference was detected in the activation of <START:ggp> MAPK kinase-1 <END> that is induced by bufalin in wild-type or <START:ana> Bcl-2-overexpressed U937 cells <END> ; however , the activation of <START:ggp> MAPK <END> by bufalin was significantly attenuated in the cells overexpressing <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> . 
Bufalin treatment <START:ggp> activated activator protein-1 <END> transcriptional activity ; however , this activation was decreased to 40 % in <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> -overexpressed <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> acts downstream of <START:ggp> MAPK kinase-1 <END> but upstream of <START:ggp> MAPK <END> and suggest that , in the signaling pathway of the apoptotic process induced by bufalin , the transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> may be down-regulated through the inhibition of <START:ggp> MAPK <END> activity by <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> . 
Pancreatic islet expression studies and polymorphic DNA markers in the genes encoding <START:ggp> hepatocyte nuclear factor-3alpha , -3beta , -3gamma , -4gamma , and -6 <END> . 
The genes encoding the functionally related <START:ggp> hepatocyte nuclear factors <END> <START:ggp> HNF-1alpha <END> and <START:ggp> HNF-4alpha <END> play a critical role in normal pancreatic beta-cell function . 
Mutations in these <START:ggp> liver-enriched transcription factors <END> result in two forms of early-onset type 2 diabetes ( maturity-onset diabetes of the young [ MODY ] ) , MODY3 and MODY1 , which are characterized by impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion , early disease onset , and autosomal dominant inheritance . 
The transcriptional hierarchy of HNFs suggests that other proteins of the regulatory cascade might be responsible for other forms of MODY and/or late-onset type 2 diabetes . 
In this study , we show that <START:ggp> HNF-3alpha , -3beta , -3gamma , -4gamma , and -6 <END> are expressed in <START:ana> pancreatic beta-cells <END> . 
We report the identification and characterization of <START:ggp> simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphisms <END> in the genes encoding <START:ggp> HNF-3alpha <END> , <START:ggp> -3beta <END> , <START:ggp> -3gamma <END> , <START:ggp> -4gamma <END> , and <START:ggp> -6 <END> and the mapping of <START:ggp> HNF-6 <END> to <START:ggp> chromosome bands <END> <START:ggp> 15q21.1-21.2 <END> by fluorescence in situ hybridization . 
These markers will be useful to study the role of genetic variation in these genes in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes . 
Induction of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B/Rel <END> nuclear activity in <START:ana> human peripheral blood T lymphocytes <END> by <START:ggp> anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibodies <END> . 
Monoclonal antibodies against either monomorphic or polymorphic determinants of <START:ggp> class I antigen <END> induced in <START:ana> PBMC <END> and highly <START:ana> purified T lymphocytes <END> the nuclear activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel complexes <END> . 
These included both <START:ggp> p50/p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p50/p65 dimers <END> , recognized by <START:ggp> specific antibodies <END> in EMSA . 
The induced <START:ggp> complexes <END> were detectable in extracts of cells incubated with <START:ggp> anti-class I monoclonal antibody <END> ( <START:ggp> mAb <END> ) for 1.5 h ; the induction was maximal at 5 h , persistent at 16 h and no longer observed at 40 h . 
The <START:ggp> mAb <END> failed to induce <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> nuclear activity in cells incubated in the presence of 3 , 4-dichloroisocoumarin , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> degradation . 
Together , these results suggest that class I triggering can induce the activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> nuclear activity in <START:ana> peripheral blood T lymphocytes <END> , thereby modulating the expression of genes regulated by these <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
<START:ggp> Anti-Ehrlichia chaffeensis antibody <END> complexed with E. chaffeensis induces potent <START:ana> proinflammatory cytokine mRNA <END> expression in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> through sustained reduction of <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> and activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligatory intracellular bacterium that infects <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> and is the etiologic agent of human ehrlichiosis in the United States . 
Our previous studies showed that the exposure of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> to E. chaffeensis induces the expression of <START:ggp> interleukin-1beta <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> ) , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-10 genes <END> in vitro but not the expression of <START:ana> tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and IL-6 mRNAs <END> . 
In this study , the effect of <START:ggp> anti-E. chaffeensis antibody <END> complexed with E. chaffeensis on the expression of <START:ggp> major proinflammatory cytokines <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> was examined . 
<START:ana> Human monocytic cell line THP-1 <END> was treated with E. chaffeensis which had been preincubated with human anti-E. chaffeensis serum for 2 h , and the levels of <START:ana> cytokine mRNAs <END> were evaluated by competitive reverse transcription-PCR . 
<START:ggp> Anti-E. chaffeensis antibody <END> complexed with E. chaffeensis significantly enhanced mRNA expression of <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> in <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> . 
The expression of <START:ana> TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNAs <END> was also induced . 
The levels of secreted <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> during 24 h of stimulation were comparable to those induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide at 1 microg/ml . 
Fab fragment of <START:ggp> anti-E. chaffeensis immunoglobulin G <END> complexed with E. chaffeensis did not induce any of these three cytokines , indicating that ehrlichial binding is required for <START:ana> IL-1beta mRNA <END> expression and that binding of the <START:ggp> immune complex <END> to the <START:ggp> Fc gamma receptor <END> is required for <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and <START:ana> IL-6 mRNA <END> expression and enhanced <START:ana> IL-1beta mRNA <END> expression . 
Furthermore , prolonged degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> and activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> were demonstrated in <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> exposed to anti-E. chaffeensis serum and E. chaffeensis . 
This result implies that development of <START:ggp> anti-E. chaffeensis antibody <END> in patients can result in the production of <START:ggp> major proinflammatory cytokines <END> , which may play an important role in the pathophysiology of ehrlichiosis and immune responses to it . 
The <START:ggp> class II trans-activator CIITA <END> interacts with the <START:ggp> TBP-associated factor TAFII32 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> class II trans- activator <END> ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) is the main transcriptional co-activator for the expression of <START:ggp> MHC class II proteins <END> . 
Its <START:ggp> N-terminal 125 amino acids <END> function as an <START:ggp> independent transcriptional activation domain <END> . 
Analyses of the <START:ggp> primary amino acid sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> activation domain <END> predict the presence of three <START:ggp> alpha-helices <END> , each with a high proportion of acidic residues . 
Using site-directed mutagenesis , we found that two of these predicted <START:ggp> alpha-helices <END> are required for full transcriptional activation by <START:ggp> CIITA <END> . 
Moreover , a <START:ggp> CIITA protein <END> in which both functional <START:ggp> alpha-helices <END> have been deleted displays a dominant negative phenotype . 
This <START:ggp> activation domain <END> of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> interacts with the <START:ggp> 32 kDa subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> general transcription complex <END> <START:ggp> TFIID <END> , <START:ggp> TAFII32 <END> . 
Decreased transcriptional activation by <START:ggp> N-terminal deletions <END> of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> is correlated directly with their reduced binding to <START:ggp> TAFII32 <END> . 
We conclude that interactions between <START:ggp> TAFII32 <END> and <START:ggp> CIITA <END> are responsible for activation of <START:ggp> class II genes <END> . 
Characterization of <START:ggp> interleukin-10 receptor <END> expression on <START:ana> B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells <END> . 
<START:ana> B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) cells <END> accumulate in vivo in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle , suggesting that their malignant expansion is due , at least in part , to a delay in cell death . 
However , the cellular or <START:ggp> molecular factors <END> responsible for a delay in B-CLL cell death are unknown . 
B-CLL cells do express receptors for <START:ggp> interferon-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> ) and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , and activation of both has been shown to promote B-CLL survival in vitro by preventing apoptosis . 
The <START:ggp> interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) receptor <END> is another member of the <START:ggp> IFN receptor family <END> , but its ligand , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , has been reported to induce apoptosis in <START:ana> B-CLL cells <END> . 
In the current study , we undertook a biochemical analysis of <START:ggp> IL-10 receptor <END> expression on freshly isolated <START:ana> B-CLL cells <END> and characterized the functional responsiveness of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> binding to its <START:ggp> constitutively expressed receptor <END> . 
We show that <START:ana> B-CLL cells <END> bind <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> with significant specificity and express between 47 and 127 <START:ggp> IL-10 receptor <END> sites per cell , with a dissociation constant in the range of 168 to 426 x 10 ( -12 ) mol/L . 
Ligand binding and activation of the <START:ggp> IL-10 receptor <END> expressed on <START:ana> B-CLL cells <END> results in the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> proteins . 
This pattern of <START:ggp> STAT protein <END> phosphorylation is identical to <START:ggp> IL-10 receptor <END> activation on <START:ana> normal cells <END> and similar to <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> ) and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> ) receptor activation in <START:ana> CLL <END> . 
Further , in consecutive samples of fresh blood obtained from patients with <START:ana> B-CLL cells <END> , the addition of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibited <START:ana> B-CLL <END> proliferation , enhanced <START:ana> B-CLL <END> differentiation , but did not induce apoptosis . 
Indeed , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> , like <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , was able to significantly reduce the amount of B-CLL cell death caused by hydrocortisone-induced apoptosis . 
We conclude that <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , which signal through the <START:ggp> interferon family <END> of receptors , have comparable functional effects on <START:ana> B-CLL cells <END> . 
Involvement of the <START:ggp> N-terminal region <END> of the <START:ggp> human mineralocorticoid receptor hormone-binding domain <END> in agonist and antagonist binding as revealed by a <START:ggp> new monoclonal antibody <END> . 
To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of binding to the <START:ggp> human mineralocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> hMR <END> ) , we developed a new <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> ( <START:ggp> mAb <END> ) raised against the <START:ggp> hormone-binding domain <END> ( <START:ggp> HBD <END> ) . 
For this purpose , mice were immunized with a <START:ggp> fusion protein <END> including the sequence <START:ggp> Thr729-Lys984 <END> of <START:ggp> hMR <END> . 
After ELISA screening , <START:ggp> mAb 18C7 <END> was selected for its specificity towards the <START:ggp> HBD <END> . 
This antibody recognized both the denatured and <START:ggp> native MR forms <END> , as well as the <START:ggp> hetero-oligomeric MR form <END> and the <START:ggp> transformed MR state <END> . 
By using several <START:ggp> HBD subfragments <END> , the <START:ggp> mAb 18C7 epitope <END> was located in the <START:ggp> N-terminal region <END> of the <START:ggp> HBD <END> from <START:ggp> Thr729 to Leu765 <END> . 
We then studied the effect of the antibody on aldosterone and progesterone binding to the <START:ggp> hMR <END> . 
When <START:ggp> 18C7 <END> was incubated with <START:ggp> liganded MR <END> , it was able to partly displace ( 20 % ) the hormone from its binding site . 
When <START:ggp> 18C7 <END> was incubated with <START:ggp> MR <END> before aldosterone or progesterone , the antibody inhibited 75-80 % of the binding . 
The effect of <START:ggp> 18C7 <END> on the binding was similar with both hormones . 
A sucrose gradient analysis indicated the simultaneous presence of two kinds of receptor complexes : the <START:ggp> steroid-MR complex <END> and the <START:ggp> antibody-MR complex <END> . 
After its associated proteins , especially the <START:ggp> heat-shock protein hsp90 <END> , had been cross-linked with the <START:ggp> hMR <END> by dimethylpimelimidate , <START:ggp> 18C7 <END> was still able to react with the receptor . 
Our results indicated that the <START:ggp> epitope <END> recognized by <START:ggp> 18C7 <END> was directly implicated in hormone binding . 
The lack of steroid binding of <START:ggp> HBD <END> mutants with the <START:ggp> Thr729-Leu765 sequence <END> deleted [ Jalaguier , Mesnier , Leger and Auzou ( 1996 ) J.Steroid Biochem.Mol.Biol.57 , 43-50 ] supports this hypothesis . 
Because of the similar behaviours of aldosterone and progesterone , we conclude that the <START:ggp> N-terminal Thr729-Leu765 region <END> of the <START:ggp> HBD <END> is similarly involved in the binding of both hormones . 
Molecular cloning of <START:ggp> SLAP-130 <END> , an <START:ggp> SLP-76-associated substrate <END> of the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor-stimulated protein tyrosine kinases <END> . 
Previous work has demonstrated that <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> , a <START:ggp> Grb2-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein <END> , augments <START:ggp> Interleukin-2 promoter <END> activity when overexpressed in the <START:ana> Jurkat T cell line <END> . 
This activity requires regions of <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> that mediate protein-protein interactions with other molecules in <START:ana> T cells <END> , suggesting that <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> -associated proteins also function to regulate signal transduction . 
Here we describe the molecular cloning of <START:ggp> SLAP-130 <END> , a <START:ggp> SLP-76-associated phosphoprotein <END> of 130 kDa . 
We demonstrate that <START:ggp> SLAP-130 <END> is hematopoietic cell-specific and associates with the <START:ggp> SH2 domain <END> of <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> . 
Additionally , we show that <START:ggp> SLAP-130 <END> is a substrate of the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor-induced protein <END> <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> . 
Interestingly , we find that in contrast to <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> , overexpression of <START:ggp> SLAP-130 <END> diminishes <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> -induced activation of the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 promoter <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> and interferes with the augmentation of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 promoter <END> activity seen when <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> is overexpressed in these cells . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> recruits a negative regulator , <START:ggp> SLAP-130 <END> , as well as positive regulators of signal transduction in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Molecular actions of prolactin in the immune system . 
The <START:ggp> immunoregulatory <END> properties of prolactin , a pituitary peptide hormone , have received renewed attention . 
The <START:ggp> prolactin receptor <END> , a member of the <START:ggp> hematopoietin/cytokine receptor superfamily <END> , is ubiquitously expressed by cells in the immune system . 
Certain subpopulations of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> synthesize and secrete biologically active prolactin , which suggests that prolactin can act as an autocrine and/or paracrine factor to modulate the activities of cells of the immune system . 
This review focuses on the molecular actions of prolactin in the immune system . 
Emphasis is given to recent information about the molecular mechanisms of prolactin receptor signal transduction , and the <START:ggp> signaling molecules <END> and <START:ggp> prolactin-inducible target genes <END> that participate in these responses . 
In particular , the <START:ggp> prolactin-inducible interferon regulatory factor-1 gene <END> and its roles in mediating diverse immune responses . 
Transcriptional regulation during myelopoiesis . 
The coordinated production of all <START:ana> blood cells <END> from a <START:ana> common stem cell <END> is a highly regulated process involving successive stages of commitment and differentiation . 
From analyses of mice deficient in <START:ggp> transcription factor genes <END> and from the characterizations of <START:ggp> chromosome breakpoints <END> in human leukemias , it has become evident that <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are important regulators of hematopoiesis . 
During myelopoiesis , which includes the development of <START:ana> granulocytic and monocytic lineages <END> , <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> from several families are active , including <START:ggp> AML1/CBF beta <END> , <START:ggp> C/EBP <END> , <START:ggp> Ets <END> , <START:ggp> c-Myb <END> , <START:ggp> HOX <END> , and <START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> . 
Few of these factors are expressed exclusively in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> ; instead it appears that they cooperatively regulate transcription of <START:ggp> myeloid-specific genes <END> . 
Here we discuss recent advances in transcriptional regulation during myelopoiesis . 
Activation of transcription factor <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by phagocytic stimuli in human neutrophils . 
Phagocytosis represents an important physiological trigger for the inducible expression of several genes in <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> . 
Here , we report that a DNA-binding activity primarily consisting of the classical <START:ggp> NF-kappa B heterodimer <END> , <START:ggp> p50/RelA <END> , is induced in <START:ana> phagocytosing neutrophils <END> . 
Under these conditions , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation was found to be a rapid and transient response , reaching a maximum by 10-15 min , and returning to near-basal levels by 30 min . 
In neutrophils undergoing the phagocytosis of opsonized yeasts , the onset of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation was paralleled by a decline in immunoreactive <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> protein levels , and the cellular <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> -alpha pool was replenished by 30 min , in agreement with our gel shift data . 
We conclude that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation could constitute one of the mechanisms whereby the expression of <START:ggp> kappa B-responsive genes <END> is enhanced in <START:ana> phagocytosing neutrophils <END> . 
To our knowledge , this represents the first demonstration that phagocytic stimuli can induce <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> . 
Induction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> by Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans . 
Because candidiasis and cryptococcosis are common in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected persons , the effect of Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans on HIV expression in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> was examined . 
Stimulation of the latently <START:ana> HIV-infected myelomonocytic cell line <END> OM-10.1 with C. neoformans and C. albicans in the presence of pooled human serum caused a ratio-dependent increase in HIV production . 
Induction of HIV by C. neoformans was enhanced by <START:ggp> anti-capsular antibody <END> , while induction by both organisms was inhibited by <START:ggp> anti-TNF-alpha antibody <END> . 
In THP-1 cells transfected with <START:ggp> HIV plasmid constructs <END> , both organisms induced transcription from the <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> that was dependent on intact <START:ggp> NF-kappaB binding sequences <END> . 
Thus , C. neoformans and C. albicans enhance HIV expression in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> through a TNF-alpha- and NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism . 
In HIV-infected patients , such enhancement may further impair host immunity and could accelerate the course of HIV disease . 
Nuclear levels of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> correlate with syncytium-forming capacity of <START:ana> 8e51 cells <END> , expressing a defective HIV virus . 
The <START:ggp> double NF-kappaB site <END> identified in the <START:ggp> LTR <END> of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 ( HIV-1 ) has been demonstrated to be necessary for efficient viral transcription . 
In this report we present the characterisation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB subunits <END> engaged in complexes binding to the <START:ggp> HIV-1 NF-kappaB site <END> in <START:ana> human 8e51 T-cells <END> , that harbour a defective HIV-1 . 
At least four different specific <START:ggp> NF-kappaB complexes <END> are present in the nucleus of these cells . 
With the use of <START:ggp> specific antibodies <END> we have determined the composition of each complex using electrophoretic mobility shift assays . 
The results show the presence of several <START:ggp> NF-kappaB family members , <END> with the transactivating <START:ggp> RelA <END> being engaged in multiple complexes . 
The importance of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB complexes <END> in viral functions has been established comparing the level of NF-kappaB DNA-binding complexes with syncytia-forming activity of <START:ana> 8e51 cells <END> . 
In fact , <START:ana> 8e51 cells <END> that had almost lost their syncytia-forming capacity were found to contain at least 10 times less active <START:ggp> NF-kappaB DNA-binding complex <END> than the <START:ana> actively fusing cells <END> . 
The correlation is specific as the level of at least three other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> did not change . 
<START:ggp> c-Myb <END> and <START:ggp> Ets proteins <END> synergize to overcome transcriptional repression by <START:ggp> ZEB <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Zfh family <END> of <START:ggp> zinc finger/homeodomain proteins <END> was first identified in Drosophila where it is required for differentiation of tissues such as the central nervous system and muscle . 
<START:ggp> ZEB <END> , a vertebrate homolog of <START:ggp> Zfh-1 <END> , binds a subset of <START:ggp> E boxes <END> and blocks myogenesis through transcriptional repression of <START:ggp> muscle genes <END> . 
We present evidence here that <START:ggp> ZEB <END> also has an important role in controlling <START:ggp> hematopoietic gene <END> transcription . 
Two families of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that are required for normal hematopoiesis are <START:ggp> c-Myb <END> and <START:ggp> Ets <END> . 
These factors act synergistically to activate transcription , and this synergy is required for transcription of at least several important <START:ggp> hematopoietic genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> ZEB <END> blocks the activity of <START:ggp> c-Myb <END> and <START:ggp> Ets <END> individually , but together the factors synergize to resist this repression . 
Such repression imposes a requirement for both <START:ggp> c-Myb <END> and <START:ggp> Ets <END> for transcriptional activity , providing one explanation for why synergy between these factors is important . 
The balance between repression by <START:ggp> ZEB <END> and transcriptional activation by <START:ggp> c-Myb <END> <START:ggp> /Ets <END> provides a flexible regulatory mechanism for controlling gene expression in <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> . 
We demonstrate that one target of this positive/negative regulation in vivo is the <START:ggp> alpha4 integrin <END> , which play a key role in normal hematopoiesis and function of <START:ana> mature leukocytes <END> . 
Comparison of the <START:ggp> transactivation domains <END> of <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> and <START:ana> mammary epithelial cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Stat <END> ( <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription <END> ) and <START:ggp> Jak <END> ( <START:ggp> Janus kinases <END> ) proteins are central components in the signal transduction events in <START:ana> hematopoietic and epithelial cells <END> . 
They are rapidly activated by various <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , hormones , and growth factors . 
Upon ligand binding and <START:ggp> cytokine receptor <END> dimerization , <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by <START:ggp> Jak kinases <END> . 
Activated <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> form homo- or heterodimers , translocate to the nucleus , and induce transcription from responsive genes . 
<START:ggp> Stat5 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> are <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> active in <START:ana> mammary epithelial cells <END> and immune cells . 
Prolactin activates <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> , and <START:ggp> interleukin-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) activates <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> cytokines <END> are able to stimulate cell proliferation , differentiation , and survival . 
We investigated the transactivation potential of <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> and found that it is not restricted to lymphocytes . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -dependent activation of <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> was also observed in <START:ana> HC11 mammary epithelial cells <END> . 
In these cells , <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> activation led to the induction of the <START:ggp> beta-casein gene promoter <END> . 
The induction of this promoter was confirmed in <START:ana> COS7 cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> was able to further enhance <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -induced gene transcription through the action of <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> . 
Deletion analysis of the <START:ggp> carboxyl-terminal region <END> of <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> and recombination of this region with a <START:ggp> heterologous DNA binding domain <END> allowed the delimitation and characterization of the transactivation domain of <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> . 
The potencies of the <START:ggp> transactivation domains <END> of <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> , <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> , and <START:ggp> viral protein VP16 <END> were compared . 
<START:ggp> Stat6 <END> had a transactivation domain which was about 10-fold stronger than that of <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> . 
In <START:ana> pre-B cells <END> ( Ba/F3 ) , the transactivation domain of <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> was <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> regulated , independently from its DNA binding function . 
<START:ggp> ETS1 <END> , <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> and <START:ggp> AP1 <END> synergistically transactivate the <START:ggp> human GM-CSF promoter <END> . 
Activation of <START:ana> helper T cells <END> results in coordinate expression of a number of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> involved in differentiation , proliferation and activation of the haematopoietic system . 
<START:ggp> Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) is one such <START:ggp> cytokine <END> , whose increased expression results mostly from increases in transcription . 
<START:ggp> Cis-acting elements <END> with <START:ggp> NFkappaB , AP1 and ETS-like binding motifs <END> have been identified in the promoter region of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> , and are important or essential for transcriptional activity following T cell activation . 
<START:ggp> ETS1 <END> is a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> of the <START:ggp> ETS family <END> that is expressed in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
We have previously shown that <START:ggp> ETS1 <END> can transactivate <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> , but only after the cells have been stimulated by treatment with PMA and ionomycin , agents that mimic T cell activation . 
Thus we proposed that <START:ggp> ETS1 <END> , which is expressed constitutively in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , may act in concert with <START:ggp> PMA/ionomycin inducible factors <END> . 
Here we show that <START:ggp> ETS1 <END> can transactivate a <START:ggp> GM-CSF reporter construct <END> in unstimulated <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , providing that either <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> or <START:ggp> AP1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are supplied by co-transfection . 
We confirm that binding of endogenous <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> and <START:ggp> AP1 <END> is induced following PMA/ionomycin treatment of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Transactivation by <START:ggp> ETS1 <END> , <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> and <START:ggp> AP1 <END> is synergistic , and mutation of the individual binding sites reveals that the transcriptional activities of these factors are interdependent . 
Our results suggest that constitutive <START:ggp> ETS1 <END> , and inducible <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> and <START:ggp> AP1 <END> , cooperate as part of a higher order <START:ggp> transcriptional complex <END> in activated <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Abnormal <START:ana> T lymphocyte <END> development induced by targeted overexpression of <START:ggp> IkappaB alpha <END> . 
A role in thymic maturation for factors of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB family <END> has long been suspected , but not yet proven . 
Transgenic mice with a lymphocyte-specific defect in <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation were produced by targeted expression of human <START:ggp> IkappaB alpha <END> . 
The thymic cellularity of these mice was significantly decreased . 
The proportion of mature , <START:ana> TCRhigh thymocytes <END> of the <START:ana> alphabeta lineage <END> was reduced , and the remaining <START:ana> TCRhigh population <END> contained an unusually high proportion of <START:ana> double-positive cells <END> . 
This defect in maturation resulted in a transgene dose-dependent reduction in <START:ana> peripheral T lymphocytes <END> , with the <START:ana> CD8 lineage <END> being more severely affected . 
These data provide direct evidence for the involvement of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel family proteins <END> in late stages of <START:ana> T lymphocyte <END> development , coincident with positive and negative selection . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> is a functional <START:ggp> activation antigen <END> and <START:ggp> B7-independent T cell costimulatory molecule <END> on normal <START:ana> human lung fibroblasts <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> is an important signaling and activation Ag found on certain <START:ana> bone marrow-derived cells <END> . 
Recently , <START:ggp> CD40 <END> also has been shown to be expressed by <START:ana> mesenchymal cells <END> , including <START:ana> human fibroblasts <END> . 
Little is known about the role of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
The current study investigates the hypothesis that <START:ggp> CD40 <END> expressed on <START:ana> lung fibroblasts <END> is an activation structure and mechanism for interaction with <START:ana> hemopoietic cells <END> . 
Communication between resident tissue <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> is necessary for normal wound healing , and can be pathologic , resulting in tissue fibrosis . 
Signaling through <START:ggp> CD40 <END> with soluble <START:ggp> CD40 <END> ligand stimulated fibroblast activation , as evidenced by mobilization of nuclear factor-kappaB and by induction of the proinflammatory and chemoattractant <START:ggp> cytokines <END> <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> . 
<START:ana> IFN-gamma-primed lung fibroblasts <END> costimulate T lymphocyte proliferation utilizing <START:ggp> CD40 <END> , but not the well-studied <START:ggp> costimulatory molecules <END> <START:ggp> B7-1 <END> and <START:ggp> B7-2 <END> . 
Data reported herein support the hypothesis that cognate interactions between <START:ana> tissue fibroblasts <END> and infiltrating T lymphocytes , via the <START:ggp> CD40 <END> <START:ggp> /CD40L <END> pathway , augment inflammation and may promote fibrogenesis by activating both cell types . 
Biphasic control of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation induced by the triggering of <START:ggp> HLA-DR antigens <END> expressed on <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
The regulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation following the triggering of <START:ggp> HLA-DR antigens <END> by <START:ggp> mAb L243 <END> has been studied at various times in <START:ana> Raji cells <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated a strong increase of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA binding after triggering of <START:ggp> HLA-DR antigens <END> . 
Using <START:ggp> TNF-alpha-activity neutralizing antibodies <END> , the authors demonstrated that the upregulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was found to depend , at later time point , on an autocrine effect of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> secreted following triggering of <START:ggp> HLA-DR antigens <END> . 
In contrast , it was found to be <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> independent in the early time point . 
Moreover , the upregulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity is regulated by the triggering of selected <START:ggp> epitopes <END> of <START:ggp> HLA-DR antigens <END> . 
In fact , <START:ggp> mAb L243 <END> but not the <START:ggp> staphylococcal superantigens <END> , <START:ggp> staphylococcal exotoxin toxic shock syndrome toxin-I <END> or <START:ggp> staphylococcal enterotoxin B <END> , regulate the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase type II <END> gene expression in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
Role for a novel <START:ggp> 5 ' palindromic octamer sequence <END> . 
Expression of the gene encoding <START:ggp> human inosine- 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) type II <END> , an <START:ggp> enzyme <END> catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the generation of guanine nucleotides , is increased more than 10-fold in <START:ana> activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes <END> and is required for T cell activation . 
We have examined the <START:ggp> 5'-regulatory sequences <END> that are important for the transcriptional regulation of this gene in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> DNase I <END> mapping of <START:ggp> genomic DNA <END> identified a <START:ggp> hypersensitive element <END> near the <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> . 
Fine mapping by in vivo footprinting demonstrated five transcription factor binding sites that are occupied in both resting and <START:ana> activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes <END> ; these are <START:ggp> tandem CRE motifs <END> , a <START:ggp> Sp1 site <END> , an overlapping <START:ggp> Egr-1/Sp1 site <END> , and a novel <START:ggp> palindromic octamer sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> POS <END> ) . 
The tandem <START:ggp> CRE and POS sites <END> are of major functional importance as judged by mutational and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses . 
These data provide evidence that expression of the <START:ggp> human IMPDH type II gene <END> is predominantly regulated by the <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> <START:ggp> ATF-2 <END> and an as yet unidentified <START:ggp> POS-binding protein <END> . 
Additional major protein-DNA interactions do not occur within the promoter region after T lymphocyte activation , indicating a requirement for additional protein-protein interactions and/or post-translational modifications of <START:ggp> pre-bound transcription factors <END> to account for the observed increase in IMPDH type II gene expression . 
Distinct mechanisms for N-acetylcysteine inhibition of <START:ggp> cytokine-induced E-selectin <END> and <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression . 
We have examined the effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a well-characterized , thiol-containing antioxidant , on agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion to <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> EC <END> ) . 
NAC inhibited <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> ) -induced , but not basal , adhesion with 50 % inhibition at approximately 20 mM . 
Monocytic cell adhesion to <START:ana> EC <END> in response to <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , <START:ggp> alpha-thrombin <END> , or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) was similarly inhibited by NAC . 
Unlike published studies with pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate , which specifically inhibited <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) , NAC inhibited <START:ana> IL-1 beta-induced mRNA <END> and cell surface expression of both <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> and <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> . 
NAC had no effect on the half-life of <START:ana> E-selectin or VCAM-1 mRNA <END> . 
Although NAC reduced <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) activation in <START:ana> EC <END> as measured by gel-shift assays using an <START:ggp> oligonucleotide probe <END> corresponding to the consensus <START:ggp> NF-kappa B binding sites <END> of the <START:ggp> VCAM-1 gene <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-NF-kappa B <END> ) , the antioxidant had no appreciable effect when an oligomer corresponding to the <START:ggp> consensus NF-kappa B binding site <END> of the <START:ggp> E-selectin gene <END> ( <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> <START:ggp> -NF-kappa B <END> ) was used . 
Because <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> has been reported to be redox sensitive , we studied the effects of NAC on the <START:ana> EC <END> redox environment . 
NAC caused an expected dramatic increase in the reduced glutathione ( GSH ) levels in <START:ana> EC <END> . 
In vitro studies demonstrated that whereas the binding affinity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> to the <START:ggp> VCAM-NF-kappa B oligomer <END> peaked at a GSH-to-oxidized glutathione ( GSSG ) ratio of approximately 200 and decreased at higher ratios , the binding to the <START:ggp> E-selectin-NF-kappa B oligomer <END> appeared relatively unaffected even at ratios > 400 , i.e. , those achieved in <START:ana> EC <END> treated with 40 mM NAC . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding to its consensus sequences in the <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> E-selectin gene <END> exhibits marked differences in redox sensitivity , allowing for differential gene expression regulated by the same transcription factor . 
Our data also demonstrate that NAC increases the GSH-to-GSSG ratio within the <START:ana> EC <END> suggesting one possible mechanism through which this antioxidant inhibits agonist-induced monocyte adhesion to <START:ana> EC <END> . 
Opposite effects of the <START:ggp> acute promyelocytic leukemia PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> ) and <START:ggp> PLZF-RAR alpha fusion proteins <END> on retinoic acid signalling . 
Fusion proteins involving the retinoic acid <START:ggp> receptor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> ) and the <START:ggp> PML <END> or <START:ggp> PLZF nuclear protein <END> are the genetic markers of acute promyelocytic leukemias ( APLs ) . 
APLs with the <START:ggp> PML-RAR alpha <END> or the <START:ggp> PLZF-RAR alpha fusion protein <END> are phenotypically indistinguishable except that they differ in their sensitivity to retinoic acid ( RA ) -induced differentiation : <START:ggp> PML-RAR alpha <END> blasts are sensitive to RA and patients enter disease remission after RA treatment , while patients with <START:ggp> PLZF-RAR alpha <END> do not . 
We here report that ( i ) like <START:ggp> PML-RAR alpha <END> expression , <START:ggp> PLZF-RAR alpha <END> expression blocks terminal differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cell lines ( <START:ana> U937 <END> and <START:ana> HL-60 <END> ) in response to different stimuli ( vitamin D3 , transforming growth factor beta1 , and dimethyl sulfoxide ) ; ( ii ) <START:ggp> PML-RAR alpha <END> , but not <START:ggp> PLZF-RAR alpha <END> , increases RA sensitivity of <START:ana> hematopoietic precursor cells <END> and restores RA sensitivity of <START:ana> RA-resistant hematopoietic cells <END> ; ( iii ) <START:ggp> PML-RAR alpha <END> and <START:ggp> PLZF-RAR alpha <END> have similar RA binding affinities ; and ( iv ) <START:ggp> PML-RAR alpha <END> enhances the RA response of <START:ggp> RA target genes <END> ( those for <START:ggp> RAR beta <END> , <START:ggp> RAR gamma <END> , and <START:ggp> transglutaminase type II <END> [ <START:ggp> TGase <END> ] ) in vivo , while <START:ggp> PLZF-RAR alpha <END> expression has either no effect ( <START:ggp> RAR beta <END> ) or an inhibitory activity ( <START:ggp> RAR gamma <END> and <START:ggp> type II TGase <END> ) . 
These data demonstrate that <START:ggp> PML-RAR alpha <END> and <START:ggp> PLZF-RAR alpha <END> have similar ( inhibitory ) effects on RA-independent differentiation and opposite ( stimulatory or inhibitory ) effects on RA-dependent differentiation and that they behave in vivo as <START:ggp> RA-dependent enhancers <END> or inhibitors of <START:ggp> RA-responsive genes <END> , respectively . 
Their different activities on the RA signalling pathway might underlie the different responses of <START:ggp> PML-RAR alpha <END> and <START:ggp> PLZF-RAR alpha <END> APLs to RA treatment . 
The <START:ggp> PLZF-RAR alpha fusion protein <END> contains an approximately <START:ggp> 120-amino-acid N-terminal motif <END> ( called the <START:ggp> POZ domain <END> ) , which is also found in a variety of zinc finger proteins and a group of <START:ggp> poxvirus proteins <END> and which mediates protein-protein interactions . 
Deletion of the <START:ggp> PLZF POZ domain <END> partially abrogated the inhibitory effect of <START:ggp> PLZF-RAR alpha <END> on RA-induced differentiation and on RA-mediated <START:ggp> type II TGase <END> up-regulation , suggesting that POZ-mediated protein interactions might be responsible for the inhibitory transcriptional activities of <START:ggp> PLZF-RAR alpha <END> . 
A human homologue of the <START:ggp> Drosophila Toll protein <END> signals activation of adaptive immunity [ see comments ] 
Induction of the adaptive immune response depends on the expression of <START:ggp> co-stimulatory molecules <END> and <START:ggp> cytokines <END> by <START:ana> antigen-presenting cells <END> . 
The mechanisms that control the initial induction of these signals upon infection are poorly understood . 
It has been proposed that their expression is controlled by the non-clonal , or innate , component of immunity that preceded in evolution the development of an adaptive immune system in vertebrates . 
We report here the cloning and characterization of a <START:ggp> human homologue <END> of the <START:ggp> Drosophila toll protein <END> ( <START:ggp> Toll <END> ) which has been shown to induce the innate immune response in adult Drosophila . 
Like Drosophila <START:ggp> Toll <END> , <START:ggp> human Toll <END> is a type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain consisting of a <START:ggp> leucine-rich repeat ( LRR ) domain <END> , and a cytoplasmic domain homologous to the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> of the <START:ggp> human interleukin ( IL ) -1 receptor <END> . 
Both Drosophila <START:ggp> Toll <END> and the IL-1 receptor are known to signal through the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> pathway . 
We show that a constitutively active mutant of <START:ggp> human Toll <END> transfected into human cell lines can induce the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and the expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-controlled genes <END> for the <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , as well as the expression of the <START:ggp> co-stimulatory molecule <END> <START:ggp> B7.1 <END> , which is required for the activation of <START:ana> naive T cells <END> . 
Role of ascorbate in the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> by <START:ggp> tumour necrosis factor-alpha <END> in <START:ana> T-cells <END> . 
The first product of ascorbate oxidation , the ascorbate free radical ( AFR ) , acts in biological systems mainly as an oxidant , and through its role in the plasma membrane redox system exerts different effects on the cell . 
We have investigated the role of ascorbate , AFR and dehydroascorbate ( DHA ) in the activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB transcription factor <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T-cells <END> stimulated by <START:ggp> tumour necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) . 
Here we show , by electrophoretic mobility shift assays , that ascorbate increases the binding of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> to DNA in <START:ana> TNF-alpha-stimulated Jurkat cells <END> . 
The ability of ascorbate to enhance cytoplasmic inhibitory <START:ggp> IkBalpha protein <END> degradation correlates completely with its capacity to induce <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding to DNA and to potentiate <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -mediated transactivation of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter <END> in <START:ana> TNF-alpha-stimulated Jurkat cells <END> but not in cells stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin . 
AFR behaves like ascorbate , while DHA and ascorbate phosphate do not affect <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
These results provide new evidence for a possible relationship between the activation of the electron-transport system at the plasma membrane by ascorbate or its free radical and redox-dependent gene transcription in <START:ana> T-cells <END> . 
Human cytomegalovirus induces <START:ggp> interleukin-8 <END> production by a <START:ana> human monocytic cell line <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 <END> , through acting concurrently on <START:ggp> AP-1- and NF-kappaB-binding sites <END> of the <START:ggp> interleukin-8 gene <END> . 
Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection induced <START:ggp> interleukin-8 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> ) gene transcription in a <START:ana> human monocytic cell line <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> , leading to <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> secretion . 
The functional analysis of the <START:ggp> IL-8 gene <END> revealed that both <START:ggp> AP-1- and NF-kappaB factor-binding elements <END> were involved in conferring the responsiveness to CMV . 
Moreover , electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that CMV induced the formation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 complexes <END> . 
These results suggest that CMV activates these <START:ggp> transcriptional factors <END> , resulting in <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> gene expression . 
Construction and biological characterization of an <START:ggp> interleukin-12 fusion protein <END> ( <START:ggp> Flexi-12 <END> ) : delivery to <START:ana> acute myeloid leukemic blasts <END> using adeno-associated virus . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-12 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> ) is a <START:ggp> cytokine <END> that exhibits pleiotropic effects on <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> and has been shown to have promise for the immunotherapy of cancer . 
The combination of the <START:ggp> immune costimulatory molecule <END> <START:ggp> B7.1 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> has been shown to be synergistic for T cell activation . 
By transfecting tumor cells with both <START:ggp> IL-12 and B7.1 cDNAs <END> , it may be possible to use these modified targets as vaccines . 
A major obstacle in designing a vector to deliver these genes results from the structure of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> . 
Functional <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> is a <START:ggp> heterodimer <END> composed of two distinct subunits that are encoded by separate genes on different chromosomes . 
Production of <START:ggp> functional IL-12 <END> requires the coordinated expression of both genes . 
This presents several problems in vectors , particularly those in which additional genes , either a <START:ggp> co-stimulatory gene <END> or a selectable marker , are inserted . 
Therefore , we have constructed a single <START:ggp> cDNA <END> that encodes a <START:ggp> single-chain protein <END> , called <START:ggp> Flexi-12 <END> , which retains all of the biological characteristics of recombinant <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> ( <START:ggp> rIL-12 <END> ) . 
The monomeric polypeptide <START:ggp> Flexi-12 <END> is able to induce the proliferation of <START:ana> phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) blasts <END> , induce <START:ana> PHA blasts <END> to secrete <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) and additionally , by preincubation , enhance the killing of K562 targets by <START:ana> PBLs <END> . 
These phenomena are in a dose-dependent manner comparable to that seen with <START:ggp> rIL-12 <END> . 
We have also shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> STAT 4 transcription factor <END> , which has been shown to be unique to the <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> signaling pathway , occurs with <START:ggp> Flexi-12 <END> at levels similar to those seen with <START:ggp> rIL-12 <END> . 
We have packaged <START:ggp> Flexi-12 <END> into a recombinant adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) and used this vector to infect <START:ana> acute myeloid leukemic ( AML ) blasts <END> . 
Infected <START:ana> AML blasts <END> produced between 2 and 6 ng of IL-12/10 ( 6 ) cells per ml per 48 hr . 
These studies also confirm that AAV is an efficient delivery vehicle for <START:ggp> cytokines <END> to leukemic cells . 
Direct analysis of these modified cells acting as tumor vaccines is underway . 
Plasma <START:ggp> sialyltransferase <END> levels in psychiatric disorders as a possible indicator of HPA axis function . 
A dysfunction in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , possibly attributed to a change in <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) functionality , has been implicated in depression . 
We have measured both <START:ggp> lymphocyte GR <END> receptor binding parameters and plasma <START:ggp> sialyltransferase <END> activity , as a biochemical marker of <START:ggp> GR <END> function , in two groups of patients suffering from depression or schizophrenia and in a group of age- and sex-matched controls . 
While there was a significant increase in plasma cortisol levels in the depressed group , there were no changes in the lymphocyte <START:ggp> GR <END> binding parameters ( K ( m ) and Bmax ) . 
There was , however , a significant decrease in the <START:ggp> plasma sialyltransferase : <END> cortisol ratio in the depressed group suggesting an inability of the raised cortisol levels to induce enzyme expression and this ratio may provide a useful biochemical marker of cortisol receptor function . 
Although there was an increase in the plasma activity of the <START:ggp> alpha 2 , 6 sialyltransferase isozyme <END> in the schizophrenic group , no other changes were determined . 
Therefore , while the total <START:ggp> plasma sialyltransferase <END> : cortisol ratio reflects HPA axis function , alterations in specific isozyme activity may also be associated with other CNS disease states . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> CD95 ( Fas ) ligand <END> expression by <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated signaling events . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> mature peripheral T cells <END> by <START:ggp> TCR <END> engagement results in activation of signals that drive induction of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> gene expression and clonal expansion . 
However , under some conditions , engagement of the <START:ggp> TCR <END> leads instead to apoptosis . 
Recent studies demonstrate that <START:ggp> TCR <END> -stimulated apoptosis requires expression of <START:ggp> CD95 ligand <END> on <START:ana> activated T cells <END> followed by an interaction between <START:ggp> CD95 ligand <END> and the <START:ggp> CD95 receptor <END> also expressed on this population . 
The experiments reported in this study were designed to address the signaling events triggered by <START:ggp> TCR <END> engagement that are important for regulating <START:ggp> CD95 ligand <END> gene expression . 
To approach this , we generated a <START:ggp> luciferase reporter construct <END> containing elements of the <START:ggp> CD95 ligand <END> promoter . 
Using a previously described mutant of the <START:ana> Jurkat T cell line <END> , we show that proximal signaling events dependent on the presence of the <START:ggp> CD45 tyrosine phosphatase <END> are required for <START:ggp> TCR <END> -stimulated <START:ggp> CD95 ligand <END> expression . 
Transient transfection studies demonstrate further that <START:ggp> TCR <END> -stimulated activation of the <START:ggp> Ras <END> signaling pathway is required for optimal activation of <START:ggp> CD95 ligand <END> . 
Next , in an effort to determine critical <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that regulate <START:ggp> CD95 ligand <END> expression , we demonstrate a <START:ggp> cyclosporin A-sensitive nuclear factor-AT response element <END> in the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> of this gene that is critical for optimal <START:ggp> CD95 ligand <END> reporter activity in <START:ana> stimulated T cells <END> . 
Together , these studies begin a dissection of the biochemical events that lead to expression of <START:ggp> CD95 ligand <END> , a required step for <START:ggp> TCR <END> -induced apoptosis . 
Reactive oxygen species and antioxidants in inflammatory diseases . 
This paper aims to review the role of free radical-induced tissue damage and antioxidant defence mechanisms in inflammatory diseases that involve pathogenic processes similar to the periodontal diseases . 
There is a clearly defined and substantial role for free radicals or reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in periodontitis , but little research has been performed in this area . 
This paper reviews the considerable data available relating ROS activity and antioxidant defence to inflammatory diseases and attempts to draw parallels with periodontitis , in an effort to stimulate more periodontal research in this important area . 
The recent discovery of the <START:ggp> transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) is reviewed and several potential pathways for <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -induced periodontal tissue damage , mediated by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 <END> are discussed . 
Emphasis is placed on <START:ggp> cytokines <END> that have been studied in periodontitis , principally <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> and <START:ggp> beta-interferon <END> . 
The link between cellular production of such important mediators of inflammation and the antioxidant ( AO ) thiols , cysteine and reduced glutathione ( GSH ) , is discussed and it is hypothesised that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> antagonists may offer important therapeutic benefits . 
Mutations in the <START:ggp> TSC2 gene <END> : analysis of the complete coding sequence using the protein truncation test ( PTT ) . 
Mutations in the <START:ggp> TSC2 gene <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 16p13.3 <END> are responsible for approximately 50 % of familial tuberous sclerosis ( TSC ) . 
The gene has <START:ggp> 41 small exons <END> spanning <START:ggp> 45 kb <END> of <START:ggp> genomic DNA <END> and encoding a <START:ana> 5.5 kb mRNA <END> . 
Large germline deletions of <START:ggp> TSC2 <END> occur in < 5 % of cases , and a number of small intragenic mutations have been described . 
We analysed mRNA from 18 unrelated cases of TSC for <START:ggp> TSC2 mutations <END> using the protein truncation test ( PTT ) . 
Three cases were predicted to be <START:ggp> TSC2 mutations <END> on the basis of linkage analysis or because a hamartoma from the patient showed loss of heterozygosity for <START:ggp> 16p13.3 markers <END> . 
Three overlapping <START:ggp> PCR products <END> , covering the complete coding sequence of <START:ana> mRNA <END> , were generated from <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> , translated into <START:ggp> 35S-methionine labelled protein <END> , and analysed by SDS-PAGE . 
<START:ggp> PCR products <END> showing PTT shifts were directly sequenced , and mutations confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion where possible . 
Six PTT shifts were identified . 
Five of these were caused by mutations predicted to produce a <START:ggp> truncated protein <END> : ( i ) a sporadic case showed a <START:ggp> 32 bp deletion <END> in <START:ana> exon 11 <END> , and a <START:ana> mutant mRNA <END> without <START:ana> exon 11 <END> was produced ; the normal exon 10 was also spliced out ; ( ii ) a sporadic case had a <START:ggp> 1 bp deletion <END> in <START:ana> exon 12 <END> ( <START:ana> 1634delT <END> ) ; ( iii ) a <START:ana> TSC2-linked mother and daughter pair <END> had a G -- > T transversion in <START:ana> exon 23 <END> ( <START:ana> G2715T <END> ) introducing a cryptic splice site causing a 29 bp truncation of mRNA from <START:ana> exon 23 <END> ; ( iv ) a sporadic case showed a <START:ggp> 2 bp deletion <END> in <START:ana> exon 36 <END> ; ( v ) a sporadic case showed a <START:ggp> 1 bp insertion <END> disrupting the donor splice site of <START:ana> exon 37 <END> ( <START:ana> 5007+2insA <END> ) , resulting in the use of an <START:ana> upstream exonic cryptic splice site <END> to cause a <START:ana> 29 bp truncation <END> of <START:ana> mRNA <END> from <START:ana> exon 37 <END> . 
In one case , the PTT shift was explained by in-frame splicing out of <START:ana> exon 10 <END> , in the presence of a <START:ggp> normal exon 10 genomic sequence <END> . 
Alternative splicing of <START:ana> exon 10 <END> of the <START:ggp> TSC2 gene <END> may be a normal variant . 
Three 3rd base substitution polymorphisms were also detected during direct sequencing of <START:ggp> PCR products <END> . 
Confirmed mutations were identified in 28 % of the families studied and on the assumption that half of the sporadic cases should have <START:ggp> TSC2 mutations <END> , a crude estimate of the detection rate would be 60 % . 
This compares favourably with other screening methods used for <START:ggp> TSC2 <END> , notably SSCP , and since PTT involves much less work it may be the method of choice . 
alpha-Tocopheryl succinate inhibits monocytic cell adhesion to <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> by suppressing <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> mobilization . 
The adherence of <START:ana> monocytes <END> to activated endothelium is an early event in atherogenesis . 
Because antioxidants have been considered to be of antiatherosclerotic potential , we investigated the effects of alpha-tocopherol ( TCP ) and its acetate and succinate esters on monocyte adhesion to <START:ana> cytokine-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> HUVEC <END> ) . 
<START:ana> Endothelial cells <END> were treated with TCP , alpha-tocopherol acetate ( TCP acetate ) , or alpha-tocopheryl succinate ( TCP succinate ) before stimulation with <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ; 10 U/ml , 6 h ) or <START:ggp> interleukin-1 beta <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> ; 10 U/ml , 6 h ) . 
Cytokine-stimulated cell surface expression of <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> , <START:ggp> CD106 <END> ) and <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> ( <START:ggp> ELAM-1 <END> , <START:ggp> CD62E <END> ) , but not of <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> , <START:ggp> CD54 <END> ) , was time- and dose-dependently inhibited by TCP succinate but not by TCP or TCP acetate . 
TCP succinate ( 200 microM , 24 h ) reduced <START:ggp> TNF-induced VCAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> expression from a specific mean fluorescence intensity of 151 +/- 28 to 12 +/- 4 channels and from 225 +/- 38 to 79 +/- 21 channels , respectively . 
Succinate alone had no effect . 
Decreased <START:ggp> adhesion molecule <END> expression was associated with a reduction of monocytic cell adhesion . 
TCP succinate ( 20 microM , 72 h ) , but not TCP ( 200 microM , 72 h ) , reduced <START:ana> U-937 cell <END> adhesion to <START:ana> TNF-alpha-stimulated ( 10 U/ml , 6 h ) HUVEC <END> by 30 % ( P < 0.025 ) and to <START:ana> IL-1 beta-stimulated HUVEC <END> by 56 % ( P < 0.010 ) . 
Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays of <START:ana> HUVEC <END> <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> revealed a decrease in <START:ggp> TNF-alpha-stimulated nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) activation after pretreatment of <START:ana> HUVEC <END> with TCP succinate but not with TCP , TCP acetate , or succinate alone . 
In conclusion , we demonstrate that the vitamin E derivative TCP succinate prevents monocytic cell adhesion to cytokine-stimulated <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> by inhibiting the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , further emphasizing the antiatherosclerotic potential of lipid soluble antioxidants . 
The product of the <START:ggp> murine homolog <END> of the <START:ggp> Drosophila extra sex combs gene <END> displays <START:ggp> transcriptional repressor <END> activity . 
The <START:ggp> heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K protein <END> represents a novel class of proteins that may act as docking platforms that orchestrate cross-talk among molecules involved in signal transduction and gene expression . 
Using a fragment of <START:ggp> K protein <END> as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen , we isolated a <START:ggp> cDNA <END> that encodes a protein whose primary structure has extensive similarity to the <START:ggp> Drosophila melanogaster extra sex combs ( esc ) gene product <END> , <START:ggp> Esc <END> , a putative silencer of <START:ggp> homeotic genes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> cDNA <END> that we isolated is identical to the <START:ggp> cDNA <END> of the recently positionally cloned <START:ggp> mouse embryonic ectoderm development gene <END> , eed . 
Like <START:ggp> Esc <END> , <START:ggp> Eed <END> contains six <START:ggp> WD-40 repeats <END> in the <START:ggp> C-terminal half <END> of the protein and is thought to repress homeotic gene expression during mouse embryogenesis . 
<START:ggp> Eed <END> binds to <START:ggp> K protein <END> through a domain in its <START:ggp> N terminus <END> , but interestingly , this domain is not found in the Drosophila <START:ggp> Esc <END> . 
<START:ggp> Gal4-Eed fusion protein <END> represses transcription of a reporter gene driven by a promoter that contains <START:ggp> Gal4-binding DNA elements <END> . 
<START:ggp> Eed <END> also represses transcription when recruited to a target promoter by <START:ggp> Gal4-K protein <END> . 
Point mutations within the eed gene that are responsible for severe embryonic development abnormalities abolished the <START:ggp> transcriptional repressor <END> activity of <START:ggp> Eed <END> . 
Results of this study suggest that <START:ggp> Eed <END> -restricted homeotic gene expression during embryogenesis reflects the action of <START:ggp> Eed <END> as a <START:ggp> transcriptional repressor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Eed <END> -mediated transcriptional effects are likely to reflect the interaction of <START:ggp> Eed <END> with multiple molecular partners , including <START:ggp> K protein <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interferons <END> up-regulate <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT2 <END> , and <START:ggp> IRF <END> family transcription factor gene expression in <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
<START:ggp> IFN <END> signaling is mediated by binding of <START:ggp> IFNs <END> to their receptors and subsequent activation of Janus tyrosine kinase ( <START:ggp> JAK <END> ) - <START:ggp> STAT <END> signaling pathway . 
Stimulation of cells with <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> leads to the assembly of <START:ggp> IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 transcription factor complex <END> formed by <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT2 <END> , and <START:ggp> p48 protein <END> . 
<START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> signaling is mediated by <START:ggp> homodimeric STAT1 protein <END> . 
Although these signaling molecules are expressed constitutively , there is also evidence of transcriptional regulation by <START:ggp> IFNs <END> . 
We have characterized the expression of <START:ggp> STAT and IFN regulatory factor ( IRF ) family transcription factors <END> in <START:ana> primary human blood mononuclear cells <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> in response to IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma stimulation . 
We show that <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> rapidly and efficiently enhanced <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT2 <END> , <START:ggp> p48 <END> , and <START:ggp> IRF-1 gene <END> expression . 
<START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induced <START:ggp> IRF-1 gene <END> expression more strongly than <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> . 
Stimulation experiments in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor , cycloheximide , suggested that these genes were activated directly by <START:ggp> IFNs <END> . 
<START:ggp> IRF-2 gene <END> was apparently only weakly responsive to <START:ggp> IFNs <END> in these cells . 
When <START:ana> macrophages <END> were pretreated with low doses of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and then stimulated with <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> , clearly enhanced formation of specific <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> complexes was detected . 
This suggests that higher intracellular levels of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT2 <END> , and <START:ggp> p48 protein <END> may result in enhanced signal transduction for <START:ggp> cytokines <END> utilizing these <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
The role of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> in <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> regulation . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factors <END> are <START:ggp> DNA-binding proteins <END> that regulate gene expression . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) is a critical <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> for maximal expression of many <START:ggp> cytokines <END> that are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases , such as adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and sepsis syndrome . 
Activation and regulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> are tightly controlled by a group of <START:ggp> inhibitory proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> ) that sequester <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in the cytoplasm of <START:ana> immune/inflammatory effector cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation involves signaled phosphorylation , ubiquitination , and proteolysis of <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> . 
Liberated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> migrates to the nucleus , where it binds to <START:ggp> specific promoter sites <END> and activates gene transcription . 
The activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> initiates both extracellular and intracellular regulatory events that result in autoregulation of the inflammatory cascade through modulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
Recently , activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> has been linked to ARDS and has been shown to be a critical proximal step in the initiation of neutrophilic inflammation in animal models . 
Activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> can be inhibited in vivo by treatment with antioxidants , corticosteroids , and the induction of <START:ggp> endotoxin <END> tolerance . 
Identification of more specific and efficacious inhibitors of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation might prove beneficial for the treatment of cytokine-mediated inflammatory diseases . 
<START:ggp> Chimeric oncoprotein <END> <START:ggp> E2a-Pbx1 <END> induces apoptosis of <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> by a <START:ggp> p53 <END> -independent mechanism that is suppressed by <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> chimeric oncoprotein <END> <START:ggp> E2a-Pbx1 <END> results from fusion of the <START:ggp> E2A and PBX1 genes <END> following <START:ggp> t ( 1 ; 19 ) chromosomal translocations <END> in B cell precursor acute leukemias . 
Experimentally <START:ana> B cell progenitors <END> do not tolerate constitutive expression of <START:ggp> E2a-Pbx1 <END> which contrasts with transformation of several other cell types following its stable expression both in vitro and in vivo . 
To further investigate the effects of <START:ggp> E2a-Pbx1 <END> on the <START:ana> B cell progenitors <END> , we conditionally expressed <START:ggp> E2a-Pbx1 <END> under control of a metal response element in <START:ana> hematopoietic precursor cell lines <END> in vitro . 
Inducible expression of <START:ggp> E2a-Pbx1 <END> resulted in cell death with the morphologic and molecular features of apoptosis . 
A structure-function analysis demonstrated that induction of apoptosis was not a dominant-negative effect of the <START:ggp> E2a moiety <END> but , rather , required the <START:ggp> DNA-binding homeodomain <END> of <START:ggp> Pbx1 <END> . 
E2a- <START:ggp> Pbx1 <END> -induced apoptosis proceeded through a <START:ggp> BCL2 <END> -responsive checkpoint eventuating in <START:ggp> PARP <END> inactivation but did require <START:ggp> p53 <END> . 
Constitutive expression of <START:ggp> E2a-Pbx1 <END> did not induce apoptosis or continued cycling of <START:ana> Rat-1 fibroblasts <END> in low serum conditions . 
These studies demonstrate that <START:ggp> E2a-Pbx1 <END> initiates programmed cell death of <START:ana> hematopoietic precursers <END> by a mechanism that requires its chimeric transcriptional properties , but , unlike other <START:ggp> nuclear oncoproteins <END> , is independent of <START:ggp> p53 <END> . 
<START:ggp> CCAAT/enhancer binding protein epsilon <END> is preferentially up-regulated during granulocytic differentiation and its functional versatility is determined by alternative use of <START:ggp> promoters <END> and differential splicing . 
<START:ggp> CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) epsilon <END> is a recently cloned member of the <START:ggp> C/EBP family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> and is expressed exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin . 
The <START:ggp> human C/EBPepsilon gene <END> is transcribed by two alternative <START:ggp> promoters <END> , <START:ggp> Palpha <END> and <START:ggp> Pbeta <END> . 
A combination of differential splicing and alternative use of <START:ggp> promoters <END> generates four <START:ana> mRNA isoforms <END> , of 2.6 kb and 1.3-1.5 kb in size . 
These transcripts can encode three proteins of calculated molecular mass <START:ana> 32.2 kDa <END> , <START:ana> 27.8 kDa <END> , and <START:ana> 14.3 kDa <END> . 
Accordingly , Western blots with <START:ggp> antibodies <END> specific for the DNA-binding domain , that is common to all forms , identify multiple proteins . 
<START:ana> C/EBPepsilon mRNA <END> was greatly induced during in vitro granulocytic differentiation of <START:ana> human primary CD34 ( + ) cells <END> . 
Retinoic acid treatment of <START:ana> HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells <END> for 24 hr induced <START:ana> C/EBPepsilon mRNA <END> levels by 4-fold , while prolonged treatment gradually reduced mRNA expression to pretreatment levels . 
Transient transfection experiments with expression vectors for two of the isoforms demonstrated that the <START:ggp> 32.2-kDa protein <END> is an activator of transcription of <START:ggp> granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter <END> , while the <START:ggp> 14.3-kDa protein <END> is not . 
Thus , <START:ggp> C/EBPepsilon <END> is regulated in a complex fashion and may play a role in the regulation of genes involved in myeloid differentiation . 
Effects of <START:ggp> TPA <END> , <START:ggp> bryostatin 1 <END> , and retinoic acid on <START:ggp> PO-B <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> DNA binding during HL-60 differentiation . 
<START:ggp> PO-B <END> was originally characterized as a <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory factor <END> of the <START:ggp> pro-opiomelanocortin ( POMC ) gene <END> ; however , it has become increasingly clear that this protein may be active in tissues outside the pituitary , since it is present in diverse cell types , including differentiated <START:ana> HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells <END> . 
We previously showed that <START:ggp> PO-B <END> DNA-binding is progressively induced during differentiation of <START:ana> promyelomonocytic leukemic HL-60 cells <END> to the <START:ana> macrophage-like lineage <END> ( with phorbol esters ) . 
We now report that <START:ggp> PO-B <END> DNA-binding in <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> is similarly induced during differentiation to the <START:ana> granulocytic lineage <END> ( with either retinoic acid or dimethylsulfoxide ) . 
Either a genetic or pharmacologic blockade of HL-60 differentiation prohibited these inductive effects . 
These studies have prompted our interest in the dynamics of other <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> changes during HL-60 differentiation . 
Of these , we observed that another <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) is also robustly induced at the DNA-binding level during macrophage-like HL-60 differentiation , but not during granulocytic differentiation . 
Conversely , the DNA-binding of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> was slightly reduced by <START:ggp> TPA <END> -induced HL-60 differentiation but unchanged during granulocyte differentiation . 
From these data , we conclude that the induction of <START:ggp> PO-B <END> DNA binding is a general marker of HL-60 myelomonocytic differentiation , but that qualitative aspects of the induction of additional distinct <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , such as <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , may contribute to lineage-specific determinants of cell fate . 
A novel genetic system to isolate a <START:ggp> dominant negative effector <END> on DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> . 
Recent studies have revealed that interactions between <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> play an important role in regulation of gene expression in <START:ana> eukaryotic cells <END> . 
To isolate cDNA clones that dominantly inhibit the DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , chosen as a representative factor , we have developed a novel screening system . 
This employs an Escherichia coli tester strain carrying a <START:ggp> modified lac operon <END> as a <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> , with the lac operator sequence replaced by an <START:ggp> octamer sequence <END> . 
<START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> expressed in this tester strain represses the expression of the reporter gene and changes the phenotype of the cell from Lac+to Lac- . 
Introduction of a cDNA expression library prepared from a <START:ana> human T-cell line <END> into the <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> -harboring tester strain allowed selection of three Lac+clones out of 1 x 10 ( 5 ) transformants . 
One of them , hT86 , encoding a <START:ggp> putative zinc finger protein <END> was found to derepress <START:ggp> beta-galactosidase <END> activity in the <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> -harboring tester strain at the transcriptional level . 
In gel mobility shift assays , hT86 attenuated the intensity of the retarded band composed of the <START:ggp> octamer probe <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , suggesting a dominant negative effect on the DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> . 
The strategy described here provides a new approach for studying protein-protein interactions that govern the complex regulation of gene expression . 
<START:ggp> Tap <END> : a novel <START:ggp> cellular protein <END> that interacts with tip of herpesvirus saimiri and induces <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> aggregation . 
Tip of herpesvirus saimiri associates with <START:ggp> Lck <END> and down-regulates <START:ggp> Lck <END> -mediated activation . 
We identified a novel cellular <START:ggp> Tip-associated protein <END> ( <START:ggp> Tap <END> ) by a yeast two-hybrid screen . 
<START:ggp> Tap <END> associated with <START:ggp> Tip <END> following transient expression in <START:ana> COS-1 cells <END> and stable expression in <START:ana> human Jurkat-T cells <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> Tip <END> and <START:ggp> Tap <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat-T cells <END> induced dramatic cell aggregation . 
Aggregation was likely caused by the up-regulated surface expression of <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> including <START:ggp> integrin alpha <END> , <START:ggp> L-selectin <END> , <START:ggp> ICAM-3 <END> , and <START:ggp> H-CAM <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB transcriptional factor <END> of aggregated cells had approximately 40-fold higher activity than that of <START:ana> parental cells <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> Tap <END> is likely to be an important cellular mediator of <START:ggp> Tip <END> function in T cell transformation by herpesvirus saimiri . 
<START:ana> Human monocyte <END> binding to <START:ggp> fibronectin <END> enhances <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -induced early signaling events . 
<START:ggp> Leukocyte integrins <END> are fundamentally important in modulating adhesion to extracellular matrix components and to other cells . 
This integrin-mediated adhesion controls leukocyte arrest and extravasation during the onset of inflammatory responses . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> integrin <END> -ligand interactions trigger signaling pathways that may influence leukocyte phenotype and function at sites of inflammation . 
In the current studies , we evaluated the combinatorial effects of monocyte adhesion and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> on intracellular signaling pathways . 
<START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> triggers a well-defined signal transduction pathway , which although not directly stimulated by monocyte adherence to <START:ggp> fibronectin <END> or <START:ggp> arginine-glycine-aspartate ( RGD ) -coated substrata <END> , was enhanced significantly in these <START:ana> matrix-adherent cells <END> . 
Compared with monocytes in suspension or adherent on plastic surfaces , monocytes adherent to <START:ggp> fibronectin <END> or RGD exhibited a greater than threefold increase in steady state levels of <START:ana> IFN-gamma-induced mRNA <END> for the <START:ggp> high affinity Fc gammaRI receptor <END> . 
By electrophoretic mobility shift assays , this increase in <START:ana> mRNA <END> was associated with a 5- to 10-fold increase in the <START:ggp> STAT1-containing DNA-binding complex <END> that binds to <START:ggp> Fc gammaRI promoter elements <END> . 
Furthermore , the tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> and the <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> was enhanced significantly in <START:ana> RGD-adherent monocytes <END> compared with <START:ana> control cells <END> . 
These results suggest a novel mechanism by which <START:ggp> integrin <END> -mediated cell adhesion can modulate the magnitude of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -induced signal transduction pathways , thereby amplifying cellular events leading to monocyte activation and inflammation . 
<START:ggp> Surfactant protein A <END> activates <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in the <START:ana> THP-1 monocytic cell line <END> . 
The expression of many genes for which products are involved in inflammation is controlled by the <START:ggp> transcriptional regulator nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> . 
Because <START:ggp> surfactant protein ( SP ) A <END> is involved in local host defense in the lung and alters immune cell function by modulating the expression of <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> as well as <START:ggp> surface proteins <END> involved in inflammation , we hypothesized that <START:ggp> SP-A <END> exerts its action , at least in part , via activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
We used gel shift assays to determine whether <START:ggp> SP-A <END> activated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in the <START:ana> THP-1 cell line <END> , a <START:ana> human monocytic cell line <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> by <START:ggp> SP-A <END> doses as low as 1 microgram/ml occurred within 30 min of <START:ggp> SP-A <END> treatment , peaked at 60 min , and then declined . 
This activation is inhibited by known inhibitors of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> or by simultaneous treatment of the cells with surfactant lipids . 
Moreover , the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B inhibitors <END> blocked <START:ggp> SP-A <END> -dependent increases in <START:ana> tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA <END> levels . 
These observations suggest a mechanism by which <START:ggp> SP-A <END> plays a role in the pathogenesis of some lung conditions and point to potential therapeutic measures that could be used to prevent <START:ggp> SP-A <END> induced inflammation in the lung . 
<START:ggp> GABP factors <END> bind to a <START:ggp> distal interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) enhancer <END> and contribute to <START:ggp> c-Raf <END> -mediated increase in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induction . 
Triggering of the <START:ggp> T-cell receptor-CD3 complex <END> activates two major signal cascades in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , ( i ) Ca2+-dependent signal cascades and ( ii ) <START:ggp> protein kinase <END> cascades . 
Both signal cascades contribute to the induction of the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene <END> during T-cell activation . 
Prominent <START:ggp> protein kinase <END> cascades are those that activate <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinases <END> . 
We show here that <START:ggp> c-Raf <END> , which is at the helm of the classic MAP- <START:ggp> Erk <END> cascade , contributes to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induction through a <START:ggp> distal enhancer element <END> spanning the nucleotides from positions -502 to -413 in front of the transcriptional start site of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> . 
Induction of this <START:ggp> distal IL-2 enhancer <END> differs from induction of the <START:ggp> proximal IL-2 promoter-enhancer <END> , since it is induced by phorbol esters alone and independent from Ca2+ signals . 
In DNA-protein binding studies , we detected the binding of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> GABP alpha and -beta <END> to a <START:ggp> dyad symmetry element <END> ( <START:ggp> DSE <END> ) of the <START:ggp> distal enhancer <END> , which is formed by <START:ggp> palindromic binding sites <END> of <START:ggp> Ets-like factors <END> . 
Introduction of point mutations suppressing GABP binding to the <START:ggp> DSE <END> interfered with the induction of the <START:ggp> distal enhancer <END> and the entire <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter-enhancer <END> , while overexpression of both <START:ggp> GABP factors <END> enhanced the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter-enhancer <END> induction . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> BXB <END> , a constitutive active version of <START:ggp> c-Raf <END> , and of further members of the <START:ggp> Ras <END> - <START:ggp> Raf <END> - <START:ggp> Erk <END> signal cascade exerted an increase of <START:ggp> GABP <END> -mediated promoter-enhancer induction . 
In conjunction with previously published data on <START:ggp> c-Raf <END> -induced phosphorylation of <START:ggp> GABP factors <END> ( E.Flory , A. Hoffmeyer , U.Smola , U.R.Rapp , and J.T.Bruder , J.Virol.70 : 2260- 2268 , 1996 ) , these results indicate a contribution of <START:ggp> GABP factors <END> to the <START:ggp> Raf <END> -mediated enhancement of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induction during T-cell activation . 
Lipopolysaccharide induction of the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter <END> in <START:ana> human monocytic cells <END> . 
Regulation by <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> , <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Biosynthesis of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) is predominantly by cells of the <START:ana> monocytic lineage <END> . 
This study examined the role of various <START:ggp> cis-acting regulatory elements <END> in the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induction of the <START:ggp> human TNF-alpha promoter <END> in cells of <START:ana> monocytic lineage <END> . 
Functional analysis of <START:ana> monocytic THP-1 cells <END> transfected with <START:ggp> plasmids <END> containing various lengths of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha promoter <END> localized <START:ggp> enhancer elements <END> in a region ( <START:ggp> -182 to -37 base pairs <END> ( bp ) ) that were required for optimal transcription of the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha gene <END> in response to LPS . 
Two regions were identified : <START:ggp> region I <END> ( <START:ggp> -182 to -162 bp <END> ) contained an overlapping <START:ggp> Sp1/Egr-1 site <END> , and <START:ggp> region II <END> ( <START:ggp> -119 to -88 <END> ) contained <START:ggp> CRE <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB ( designated kappaB3 ) sites <END> . 
In unstimulated <START:ana> THP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> CRE-binding protein <END> and , to a lesser extent , <START:ggp> c-Jun complexes <END> were found to bind to the <START:ggp> CRE site <END> . 
LPS stimulation increased the binding of <START:ggp> c-Jun-containing complexes <END> . 
In addition , LPS stimulation induced the binding of cognate <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> to the <START:ggp> Egr-1 and kappaB3 sites <END> , which were identified as <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> and <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> , respectively . 
The <START:ggp> CRE and kappaB3 sites <END> in <START:ggp> region II <END> together conferred strong LPS responsiveness to a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> , whereas individually they failed to provide transcriptional activation . 
Furthermore , increasing the spacing between the <START:ggp> CRE and the kappaB3 sites <END> completely abolished LPS induction , suggesting a cooperative interaction between <START:ggp> c-Jun complexes <END> and <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> . 
These studies indicate that maximal LPS induction of the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha promoter <END> is mediated by concerted participation of at least two separate <START:ggp> cis-acting regulatory elements <END> . 
Rescue by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> of apoptotic cell death induced by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> deprivation of <START:ana> human antigen-specific T cell clones <END> . 
The control of cell survival and cell death is of central importance in tissues with high cell turnover such as the lymphoid system . 
We have examined the effect of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> on <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> deprivation-induced apoptosis of <START:ana> human antigen-specific T helper clones <END> with different <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production profiles . 
We found that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> interferon-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> ) , and <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> inhibited <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> deprivation apoptosis in <START:ana> Th0 , Th1 , and Th2 clones <END> . 
We also found that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> protects <START:ana> T cell clones <END> from <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> deprivation apoptosis accompanying active proliferation and enhanced expression of <START:ggp> P53 <END> , <START:ggp> Rb <END> and <START:ggp> Bcl-xL proteins <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> IFN-alpha/beta <END> rescued <START:ana> T cell clones <END> from apoptosis without active proliferation , and expression of <START:ggp> apoptosis-associated proteins <END> tested so far was unaffected . 
This may be due to the fact that <START:ana> T cells <END> treated with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> contained those located in S + G2/M phases of the cell cycle , whereas the vast majority of <START:ana> T cells <END> treated with <START:ggp> IFN-alpha/beta <END> were located in G0/G1 phase . 
<START:ggp> IFN-alpha/beta <END> specifically induced tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation into nucleus of <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) 2 protein <END> in the <START:ana> T cell clones <END> . 
In addition , over-expression of <START:ggp> STAT2 <END> by transfection of the cDNA prevented apoptosis of the <START:ana> T cell clones <END> . 
Our present study shows that <START:ggp> IFN-alpha and -beta <END> mediate anti-apoptotic effect through other pathways than that of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in growth factor deprivation apoptosis . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-10 <END> inhibits interferon-gamma-induced <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 gene <END> transcription in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-10 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ) is a potent <START:ggp> monocyte regulatory cytokine <END> that inhibits gene expression of <START:ggp> proinflammatory mediators <END> . 
In this study , we investigated the mechanism by which <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> downregulates expression of <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ) on the cell surface of <START:ana> normal human monocytes <END> activated with <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibition of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -induced <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> expression was apparent as early as 3 hours and was blocked by an <START:ggp> anti-IL-10 antibody <END> but not by an <START:ggp> isotype-matched control antibody <END> . 
Northern blot analysis showed that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> reduced the accumulation of <START:ana> ICAM-1 mRNA <END> in <START:ana> IFN-gamma-stimulated monocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibition of <START:ana> ICAM-1 steady-state mRNA <END> was detected at 3 hours and remained at 24 hours . 
Nuclear run-on transcription assays showed that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibited the rate of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -induced transcription of the <START:ggp> ICAM-1 gene <END> , and mRNA stability studies showed that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> did not alter the half-life of <START:ana> IFN-gamma-induced ICAM-1 message <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibits <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -induced <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> expression in <START:ana> monocytes <END> primarily at the level of gene transcription . 
Activation of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma-responsive genes <END> requires tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcriptional factor <START:ggp> STAT-1alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription-1alpha <END> ) . 
However , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> did not affect <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT-1alpha <END> or alter <START:ggp> STAT-1alpha <END> binding to the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma response element <END> ( <START:ggp> IRE <END> ) in the <START:ggp> ICAM-1 promoter <END> . 
Instead , <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> prevented <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -induced binding activity at the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> site of the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) -responsive NF-kappaB/C-EBP composite element <END> in the <START:ggp> ICAM-1 promoter <END> . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> inhibits <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -induced transcription of the <START:ggp> ICAM-1 gene <END> by a regulatory mechanism that may involve <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Specific complex formation between the <START:ggp> type II bare lymphocyte syndrome-associated transactivators <END> <START:ggp> CIITA <END> and <START:ggp> RFX5 <END> . 
Two of the genes defective in the five complementation groups identified in the class II-negative bare lymphocyte syndrome or corresponding laboratory mutants have been cloned . 
One gene encodes a protein , <START:ggp> RFX5 <END> , that is a member of the <START:ggp> RFX family of DNA binding proteins <END> . 
The other , <START:ggp> CIITA <END> , encodes a large protein with a defined <START:ggp> acidic transcriptional activation domain <END> ; this protein does not interact with DNA . 
<START:ggp> Expression plasmids <END> encoding regions of <START:ggp> RFX5 <END> fused to the <START:ggp> GAL4 DNA binding domain <END> activated transcription from a reporter construct containing <START:ggp> GAL4 sites <END> in a cotransfection assay in the <START:ana> Raji human B cell line <END> . 
However , these <START:ggp> plasmids <END> produced transcriptional activity in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> only in conjunction with <START:ggp> interferon gamma <END> stimulation , a condition in which expression of both <START:ggp> CIITA <END> and <START:ggp> class II major histocompatibility complex surface proteins <END> are induced . 
Furthermore , these <START:ggp> plasmids <END> were not active in <START:ana> RJ2.2.5 <END> , an in vitro mutagenized derivative of <START:ana> Raji <END> in which both copies of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> are defective . 
Transcriptional activation by the <START:ggp> RFX5 fusion protein <END> could be restored in <START:ana> RJ2.2.5 <END> by cotransfection with a <START:ggp> CIITA expression plasmid <END> . 
Finally , a direct interaction between <START:ggp> RFX5 <END> and <START:ggp> CIITA <END> was detected with the yeast two-hybrid and far-Western blot assays . 
Thus , <START:ggp> RFX5 <END> can activate transcription only in cooperation with <START:ggp> CIITA <END> . 
<START:ggp> RFX5 <END> and <START:ggp> CIITA <END> associate to form a complex capable of activating transcription from <START:ggp> class II major histocompatibility complex promoters <END> . 
In this complex , promoter specificity is determined by the DNA binding domain of <START:ggp> RFX5 <END> and the general transcription apparatus is recruited by the <START:ggp> acidic activation domain <END> of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> in <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PI3-K <END> ) has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation in many cell types . 
We have previously shown that in <START:ana> T cells <END> the <START:ggp> PI3-K <END> inhibitor , wortmannin , interferes with activation of the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated kinase <END> , <START:ggp> Erk2 <END> , after <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TcR <END> ) stimulation . 
To further explore the involvement of <START:ggp> PI3-K <END> in T cell activation , we created a set of potentially <START:ggp> dominant negative PI3-K constructs <END> comprising individual or <START:ggp> tandem domains <END> of the <START:ggp> regulatory p85 subunit <END> and tested their effect on downstream signaling events like <START:ggp> Erk2 <END> activation and transcription from an <START:ggp> NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) element <END> taken from the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 promoter <END> . 
Following <START:ggp> TcR <END> stimulation , activation of <START:ggp> Erk2 <END> was only inhibited by a previously described <START:ggp> truncated form of p85 <END> that can not bind the <START:ggp> catalytic subunit <END> , but not by other constructs of <START:ggp> p85 <END> . 
In contrast , several mutant <START:ggp> p85 <END> alleles had dramatic effects on <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation . 
Most interestingly , the <START:ggp> N-terminal SH2 domain <END> had an inhibitory effect , whereas a <START:ggp> mutant p85 <END> containing only the <START:ggp> two SH2 domains <END> enhanced basal <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activity in a <START:ggp> Ras <END> -dependent manner . 
Ionomycin induced synergistic activation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> in cells expressing <START:ggp> p85 mutants <END> that contained the <START:ggp> C-terminal SH2 domain <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> phosphotyrosine-containing proteins <END> bound to truncated <START:ggp> p85 constructs <END> revealed cooperative binding of the <START:ggp> two SH2 domains <END> but no apparent differences between the <START:ggp> N- and C- terminal SH2 domains <END> . 
Wortmannin did not interfere with <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation , although it inhibited <START:ggp> PI3-K <END> and <START:ggp> Erk2 <END> activation in the same experiment . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> PI3-K <END> is involved in <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation through a complex adaptor function of its <START:ggp> regulatory subunit <END> and that its <START:ggp> lipid kinase <END> activity is dispensable for this effect . 
Acute leukemia with promyelocytic features in PML/RARalpha transgenic mice . 
Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is associated with reciprocal chromosomal translocations involving the <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RARalpha ) locus <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 17 <END> . 
In the majority of cases , <START:ggp> RARalpha <END> translocates and fuses with the <START:ggp> promyelocytic leukemia ( PML ) gene <END> located on <START:ggp> chromosome 15 <END> . 
The resulting <START:ggp> fusion genes <END> encode the two structurally unique <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha <END> and <START:ggp> RARalpha/PML fusion proteins <END> as well as <START:ggp> aberrant PML gene products <END> , the respective pathogenetic roles of which have not been elucidated . 
We have generated transgenic mice in which the <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha fusion protein <END> is specifically expressed in the <START:ana> myeloid-promyelocytic lineage <END> . 
During their first year of life , all the PML/ <START:ggp> RARalpha <END> transgenic mice have an abnormal hematopoiesis that can best be described as a myeloproliferative disorder . 
Between 12 and 14 months of age , 10 % of them develop a form of acute leukemia with a differentiation block at the promyelocytic stage that closely mimics human APL even in its response to retinoic acid . 
Our results are conclusive in vivo evidence that <START:ggp> PML/RARalpha <END> plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of APL . 
Constitutive and inducible protein/DNA interactions of the <START:ggp> interferon-gamma promoter <END> in vivo in [ corrected ] <START:ana> CD45RA and CD45R0 T helper subsets <END> [ published erratum appears in Eur J Immunol 1997 Jul ; 27 ( 7 ) : 1830 ] 
Interferon-gamma ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) is a key cytokine of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> with major regulatory functions in the immune system . 
To determine and compare protein/DNA interactions at the native <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> locus in <START:ana> T cells <END> , we analyzed the <START:ggp> human IFN-gamma promoter <END> by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction ( LM-PCR ) techniques . 
Accordingly , <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> and <START:ana> primary CD45RA and CD45R0 CD4+ T cell subsets <END> isolated from peripheral blood using immunomagnetic beads were cultured and analyzed by LM-PCR . 
Constitutive and inducible protein/DNA interactions of the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma promoter <END> in vivo were detected in all <START:ana> T cells <END> tested . 
Interestingly , an inducible footprint between <START:ggp> -183 and -196 <END> was consistently observed in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> and <START:ana> CD45RA and CD45R0 T helper subsets <END> upon stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate+ <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> ( PMA+ <START:ggp> PHA <END> ) that was highly sensitive to treatment with corticosteroids . 
This <START:ggp> novel target site <END> , denoted the <START:ggp> C-site <END> , was shown by several criteria , including cell distribution studies , stimulation experiments , supershift assays , and cross-competition electrophoretic mobility shift assays to bind the <START:ggp> transcription factor AP-1 <END> . 
Mutation of the <START:ggp> C-site <END> that prevented <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding to this site was sufficient strikingly to reduce inducible promoter activity in <START:ana> primary CD45R0 T cells <END> . 
In summary , the data demonstrate that <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> gene transcription in <START:ana> primary T cells <END> is regulated in vivo at the level of constitutive and inducible protein/DNA interactions . 
We propose a model where basal transcription is maintained by binding of various <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> to the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma promoter <END> , whereas PMA+ <START:ggp> PHA <END> -inducible <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> transcription in <START:ana> CD45R0 T cells <END> is associated with binding of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> to the <START:ggp> C-site <END> . 
Activation domain requirements for disruption of Epstein-Barr virus latency by <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> . 
Latent infection of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> by Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) can be disrupted by expression of the <START:ggp> EBV ZEBRA protein <END> . 
<START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> , a transcriptional activator , initiates the EBV lytic cascade by activating viral gene expression . 
<START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> is also indispensable for viral replication and binds directly to the EBV lytic origin of replication . 
The studies described herein demonstrate that the activation domain . 
<START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> activation can be replaced by a <START:ggp> heterologous acidic , proline-rich , or glutamine-rich activation domain <END> . 
<START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> activation domain swap constructs retain <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> 's native abilities to activate specific <START:ggp> EBV promoters <END> , to disrupt EBV latency , and to stimulate replication at the <START:ggp> EBV lytic origin <END> . 
Additional work , employing sequential and internal deletions of <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> 's <START:ggp> N-terminal activation domain <END> , indicates that its separate activities are not attributable to specific <START:ggp> subdomains <END> but are spread throughout its <START:ggp> N terminus <END> and therefore can not be inactivated by deleting localized regions . 
<START:ggp> CholecystokininB receptor <END> from <START:ana> human Jurkat lymphoblastic T cells <END> is involved in <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> -responsive gene activation . 
The aim of this study was to analyze the role of <START:ggp> cholecystokinin ( CCK ( B ) ) receptor <END> in <START:ana> human lymphoblastic Jurkat T cells <END> . 
We investigated the trophic effect resulting from activation of such a receptor by using the <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> strategy . 
For this purpose , we transiently transfected <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> with the <START:ggp> reporter plasmid p [ ( TRE ) 3-tk-Luc ] <END> and found that CCK-8 was able to dose-dependently induce <START:ggp> luciferase <END> expression related to <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) activation with a maximal response identical to that obtained with compounds known to activate <START:ggp> AP-1 complex <END> ( quantitatively , the same level of induction was obtained with 1 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , 100 microM diacylglycerol , or 4 nM epidermal growth factor ) . 
The involvement of the <START:ggp> CCK ( B ) receptor <END> in such a stimulation was demonstrated by the inhibiting effect of the selective <START:ggp> CCK ( B ) receptor <END> antagonist PD-135 , 158 . 
This effect was confirmed in COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA of <START:ggp> CCK ( B ) receptor <END> cloned from <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
To better understand the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -dependent <START:ggp> luciferase <END> expression in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> , we tested two specific inhibitors of <START:ggp> serine/threonine phosphatases-1 and -2A <END> : okadaic acid and calyculin A . 
These compounds strongly increased the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate response , whereas we have not observed a contribution of phosphatase inhibitors on a CCK-8-induced <START:ggp> luciferase <END> activity . 
To confirm that <START:ggp> CCK ( B ) receptors <END> are involved in <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> response , we investigated the CCK-8 effect on <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> expression , a natural <START:ggp> endogenous gene <END> regulated by several factors , including <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
In <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> activated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> , CCK-8 induced IL-2 expression . 
This induction was abolished by PD-135 , 158 . 
Our results indicate that CCK-8 exerts a trophic effect in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> through stimulation of <START:ggp> CCK ( B ) receptors <END> by modulation of expression of <START:ggp> AP-1-regulated genes <END> . 
A conserved tissue-specific structure at a <START:ggp> human T-cell receptor beta-chain core promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> T-cell receptor ( TCR ) beta-chain promoters <END> have been characterized as <START:ggp> nonstructured basal promoters <END> that carry a single conserved <START:ggp> ubiquitous cyclic AMP-responsive element <END> . 
Our investigation of the <START:ggp> human TCR beta gene <END> uncovers a surprisingly complex and tissue-specific structure at the <START:ggp> TCR Vbeta 8.1 promoter <END> . 
The core of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> ( <START:ggp> positions -42 to +11 <END> ) is recognized by the <START:ggp> lymphoid cell-specific transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> , <START:ggp> LEF1 <END> , and <START:ggp> AML1 <END> as well as by <START:ggp> CREB/ATF-1 <END> , as is demonstrated in gel shift and footprinting experiments . 
With the exception of <START:ggp> LEF1 <END> , these factors activate transcription in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Binding sites <END> at the core region show little conservation with <START:ggp> consensus sites <END> . 
Nonetheless , <START:ggp> CREB <END> , <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> AML1 <END> bind and activate cooperatively and very efficiently through the <START:ggp> nonconsensus binding sites <END> at the <START:ggp> core promoter region <END> . 
Moderate ubiquitous activation is further induced by <START:ggp> CREB/ATF and Sp1 factors <END> through <START:ggp> proximal upstream elements <END> . 
The <START:ggp> tissue-specific core promoter structure <END> is apparently conserved in other <START:ggp> T-cell-specifically expressed genes <END> such as the <START:ggp> CD4 gene <END> . 
Our observations suggest that both the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> and the <START:ggp> promoter <END> have a complex tissue-specific structure whose functional interplay potentiates T-cell-specific transcription . 
The <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> of <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) receptor alpha subunit <END> is essential for both <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> -mediated growth and differentiation . 
<START:ggp> Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) regulates differentiation , survival , and proliferation of <START:ana> colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells <END> . 
The biologic actions of <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> are mediated by binding to a specific receptor consisting of two chains designated as <START:ggp> alpha and beta subunits <END> . 
We have demonstrated that the <START:ana> murine FDC-P1-derived cell line <END> <START:ana> WT-19 <END> transfected with the <START:ggp> human GM-CSF receptor alpha and beta subunits <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSFRalpha and beta <END> ) can be induced to differentiate by the addition of <START:ggp> human GM-CSF <END> ( <START:ggp> hGM-CSF <END> ) . 
By expressing a series of <START:ggp> GM-CSFRalpha mutants <END> in <START:ana> WT19 cells <END> , we have determined the <START:ggp> amino acid domains <END> of the <START:ggp> GM-CSFRalpha <END> <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> that regulate cell differentiation , proliferation , and survival . 
We found that the <START:ggp> membrane proximal proline-rich domain <END> and <START:ggp> adjacent 16 residues <END> are essential for both <START:ggp> hGM-CSF <END> -dependent cell proliferation and differentiation . 
In contrast , the <START:ggp> C-terminal region <END> of the <START:ggp> GM-CSFRalpha cytoplasmic domain <END> was not necessary for cell differentiation mediated by <START:ggp> hGM-CSF <END> , but the removal of this region severely impaired the ability of <START:ggp> hGM-CSF <END> to support cell survival . 
While the activation of <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> , <START:ggp> Shc <END> , <START:ggp> Erk <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT5 proteins <END> correlated with <START:ggp> hGM-CSF <END> -mediated cell growth , cellular differentiation occurred in the absence of activation of these signal transduction pathways . 
<START:ggp> gamma-Interferon <END> -induced resistance to 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2 D3 in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> : a mechanism for the hypercalcemia of various granulomatoses . 
The hypercalcemia of various granulomatoses is caused by endogenous 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [ 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 ] overproduction by disease-activated <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
The inability of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 to suppress its synthesis in <START:ana> macrophages <END> contrasts with the tight control of its production in macrophage precursors , <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBM <END> ) . 
We examined whether 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 resistance develops as <START:ana> PBM <END> differentiate to <START:ana> macrophages <END> or with macrophage activation . 
Normal <START:ana> human pulmonary alveolar macrophages <END> ( <START:ana> PAM <END> ) are less sensitive to 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 than <START:ana> PBM <END> , despite similar <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> content ; however , both <START:ana> PBM <END> and <START:ana> PAM <END> respond to exogenous 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 by inhibiting 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 synthesis and inducing 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 degradation through enhancement of <START:ggp> 24-hydroxylase <END> mRNA levels and activity . 
The <START:ana> human monocytic cell line <END> <START:ana> THP-1 <END> mimics <START:ana> PAM <END> in 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 synthesis and sensitivity to exogenous 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . 
We utilized <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> to examine the response to 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 with macrophage activation . 
Activation of <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> with <START:ggp> gamma-interferon <END> ( <START:ggp> gamma-IFN <END> ) enhances 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 synthesis 30-fold , blocks 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 suppression of its synthesis , and reduces by 42.2 % 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 induction of its degradation . 
The antagonistic effects of <START:ggp> gamma-IFN <END> are not merely restricted to enzymatic activities . 
In <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> and in normal <START:ana> PBM <END> , <START:ggp> gamma-IFN <END> inhibits 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 induction of <START:ggp> 24-hydroxylase <END> mRNA levels without reducing mRNA stability , suggesting <START:ggp> gamma-IFN <END> inhibition of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 transactivating function . 
These results explain 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 overproduction in granulomatoses and demonstrate potent inhibition by <START:ggp> gamma-IFN <END> of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 action in <START:ana> immune cells <END> . 
Molecular cloning and characterization of a <START:ggp> cDNA <END> , <START:ggp> CHEMR1 <END> , encoding a <START:ggp> chemokine receptor <END> with a homology to the <START:ggp> human C-C chemokine receptor <END> , <START:ggp> CCR-4 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Chemokines <END> refer to a rapidly expanding family of small <START:ggp> cytokines <END> whose primary function is recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory sites . 
These are known to bind to <START:ggp> seven-transmembrane-domain containing receptors <END> . 
A <START:ggp> cDNA clone <END> , <START:ggp> CHEMR1 <END> , resembling the typical <START:ggp> G protein-coupled receptor <END> , was isolated from a <START:ggp> mouse cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) library <END> . 
Northern blot analysis in mouse cell lines suggests that its expression is found in a variety of cells , including <START:ana> T cells <END> , <START:ana> B cells <END> , and <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
The <START:ggp> CHEMR1 gene <END> <START:ggp> Scya3r2 <END> is a <START:ggp> single-copy gene <END> whose open reading frame may be in a single exon and maps to the distal region of <START:ggp> mouse Chr 9 <END> where the <START:ggp> mouse macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha ( MIP-1alpha ) receptor gene <END> <START:ggp> Scya3r <END> and two related <START:ggp> C-C chemokine receptor-like genes <END> reside . 
Amino acid sequence comparison shows that <START:ggp> CHEMR1 <END> is 84 % identical to <START:ggp> human CCR-4 <END> , indicating that <START:ggp> CHEMR1 <END> is likely to be a <START:ggp> mouse CCR-4 <END> . 
Binding assays using <START:ggp> 125I-labeled C-C chemokines <END> in <START:ana> mammalian cells <END> indicated that <START:ggp> CHEMR1 <END> did not bind MIP-1alpha , RANTES , or MIP-1beta , whereas <START:ggp> CCR-1 <END> binds <START:ggp> MIP-1alpha <END> and <START:ggp> RANTES <END> . 
Our result is different from the reported properties of <START:ggp> human CCR-4 <END> . 
This suggests that <START:ggp> CHEMR1 <END> may be a receptor for unidentified <START:ggp> C-C chemokine <END> or a low-affinity receptor for <START:ggp> MIP-1alpha <END> . 
Transactivation by <START:ggp> CIITA <END> , the <START:ggp> type II bare lymphocyte syndrome-associated factor <END> , requires participation of multiple regions of the <START:ggp> TATA box binding protein <END> . 
<START:ggp> CIITA <END> is a positive regulator of <START:ggp> class II major histocompatibility complex gene <END> transcription that has been found to be defective in one of the five complementation groups of <START:ana> class II major histocompatibility complex-negative cell lines <END> . 
Its <START:ggp> N-terminal region <END> is capable of activating transcription from a reporter gene when fused to a <START:ggp> DNA binding domain <END> . 
We have investigated the mechanism of transactivation mediated by the <START:ggp> CIITA activation domain <END> by studying its role in the process of transcription initiation and elongation . 
Specifically the altered specificity TBP ( <START:ggp> TATA box binding protein <END> ) assay has been used to analyze the response of the <START:ggp> CIITA activation domain <END> to mutations in <START:ggp> TBP <END> known to disrupt its interaction with its <START:ggp> associated general factors <END> . 
Transactivation by <START:ggp> CIITA <END> was extremely sensitive to a mutation in <START:ggp> TBP <END> that in yeast is known to abolish <START:ggp> VP16 <END> -mediated transcription but leaves basal transcription unaffected . 
A TBP mutant defective in interaction with <START:ggp> TBP-associated factor <END> <START:ggp> TAFII250 <END> also failed to mediate transactivation through the <START:ggp> CIITA activation domain <END> . 
Certain interactions between <START:ggp> TBP <END> and <START:ggp> general factors <END> that are specifically required for <START:ggp> acidic activation domains <END> were also required for <START:ggp> CIITA <END> -mediated transactivation to reach its full potential . 
Finally , like VP16 , <START:ggp> CIITA <END> was able to stimulate elongation of transcription . 
Overall the mechanism of transactivation by the <START:ggp> human B-cell-specific CIITA <END> is very similar to that mediated by the <START:ggp> herpes virus transactivator <END> <START:ggp> VP16 <END> in the ways that have been tested . 
Relief of <START:ggp> cyclin A <END> gene transcriptional inhibition during activation of <START:ana> human primary T lymphocytes <END> via <START:ggp> CD2 <END> and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> . 
<START:ggp> Cyclin A <END> transcription is cell cycle regulated and induced by cell proliferative signals . 
To understand the mechanisms underlined in this regulation in normal human cells , we have analysed in vivo protein-DNA interactions at the <START:ggp> Cyclin A <END> locus in <START:ana> primary T lymphocytes <END> . 
Stimulation of purified T lymphocytes by a combination of <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> directed at <START:ggp> CD2 <END> and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> gives rise to a long lasting proliferation in the absence of <START:ana> accessory cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Cyclin A <END> was observed after 4 days of costimulation with <START:ggp> anti CD2 <END> + <START:ggp> CD28 <END> whereas stimulation by <START:ggp> anti CD2 <END> or <START:ggp> anti CD28 <END> alone was not effective . 
In vivo genomic DMS footprinting revealed upstream of the major <START:ggp> transcription initiation sites <END> , the presence of at least three <START:ggp> protein binding sites <END> , two of which were constitutively occupied . 
They bind in vitro respectively <START:ggp> ATF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-Y proteins <END> . 
The third site was occupied in quiescent cells or in cells stimulated by <START:ggp> anti CD2 <END> or <START:ggp> anti CD28 <END> alone . 
The mitogenic combination of <START:ggp> anti CD2 <END> + <START:ggp> anti CD28 <END> released the footprint as cells were committed to proliferation . 
Consistent with theses results , nuclear extracts prepared from quiescent cells formed a specific complex with this element , whereas extracts prepared from cells treated with <START:ggp> anti CD2 <END> + <START:ggp> anti CD28 <END> failed to do so after cells entered a proliferative state . 
An <START:ggp> enhancer-blocking element <END> between <START:ggp> alpha and delta gene segments <END> within the <START:ggp> human T cell receptor alpha/delta locus <END> . 
<START:ggp> T cell receptor ( TCR ) alpha <END> and delta gene segments are organized within a single genetic locus but are differentially regulated during T cell development . 
An <START:ggp> enhancer-blocking element <END> ( <START:ggp> BEAD-1 <END> , for blocking <START:ggp> element alpha/delta 1 <END> ) was localized to a <START:ggp> 2.0-kb region <END> 3 ' of <START:ggp> TCR delta gene segments <END> and 5 ' of <START:ggp> TCR alpha joining gene segments <END> within this locus . 
<START:ggp> BEAD-1 <END> blocked the ability of the <START:ggp> TCR delta enhancer <END> ( <START:ggp> Edelta <END> ) to activate a promoter when located between the two in a <START:ggp> chromatin-integrated construct <END> . 
We propose that <START:ggp> BEAD-1 <END> functions as a boundary that separates the <START:ggp> TCR alpha/delta locus <END> into distinct <START:ggp> regulatory domains <END> controlled by <START:ggp> Edelta <END> and the <START:ggp> TCR alpha enhancer <END> , and that it prevents <START:ggp> Edelta <END> from opening the <START:ggp> chromatin <END> of the <START:ggp> TCR alpha <END> joining gene segments for VDJ recombination at an early stage of T cell development . 
Uncoupling of cell cycle arrest from the expression of monocytic differentiation markers in <START:ana> HL60 cell variants <END> . 
Differentiation generally leads to cell cycle arrest . 
<START:ana> Human leukemia HL60 cells <END> respond to the presence of 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 , 25D3 ) by expressing a number of markers of the monocyte/macrophage phenotype and become arrested predominantly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle . 
We have recently reported a series ( A ) of 1 , 25D3-resistant variants of <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> which proliferate in the presence of 1 , 25D3 and do not express differentiation markers ( Exp. Cell Res. 224 , 312 , 1996 ) . 
We now describe another series ( B ) of such variants , which differ from A series cells grown in similar concentrations of 1 , 25D3 in that they express the <START:ggp> CD14 antigen <END> and nonspecific <START:ggp> esterase <END> , characteristic of the monocyte , while continuing to proliferate and they develop hypotetraploid DNA ( 4C ) content at higher concentrations of ambient 1 , 25D3 than the A series cells . 
Cells in the B series with 4C DNA content ( 100B and 200B ) also differed from the <START:ana> A series 4C cells <END> by the absence of DNA binding by the full-length <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
However , B series cells resembled the A series cells in exhibiting faster growth rates than the parental <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> and showed high levels of <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> and <START:ggp> retinoid receptor X proteins <END> . 
These results show that the initial steps in the 1 , 25D3 signaling pathway are intact in B series resistant cells and lead to the appearance of early markers of monocytic differentiation . 
However , the progression to subsequent events which comprise terminal differentiation and cell cycle arrest is halted during the adaptation to the presence of 1 , 25D3 in these cells . 
Thus , the availability of these variant cells should provide a system for studying the link between differentiation and cell cycle arrest . 
Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in vitro by a novel combination of <START:ggp> anti-Tat single-chain intrabodies <END> and NF-kappa B antagonists . 
<START:ggp> Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) Tat <END> , an early <START:ggp> regulatory protein <END> that is critical for viral gene expression and replication , transactivates the <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) via its binding to the <START:ggp> transactivation response element <END> ( <START:ggp> TAR <END> ) and , along with other cellular factors , increases viral transcription initiation and elongation . 
Tat also superactivates the <START:ggp> HIV-1 promoter <END> through a <START:ggp> TAR <END> -independent mechanism , including tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced and protein kinase C ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) -dependent activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , and inhibitors of <START:ggp> Tat <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> cooperatively down-regulate this <START:ggp> Tat <END> -mediated <START:ggp> LTR <END> superactivation . 
In this study , a combined pharmacologic and genetic strategy using two <START:ggp> PKC <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) inhibitors , pentoxifylline ( PTX ) and Go-6976 , and a stably expressed <START:ggp> anti-Tat single-chain intracellular antibody <END> ( <START:ggp> sFv intrabody <END> ) was employed to obtain cooperative inhibition of both HIV-1 <START:ggp> LTR <END> -driven gene expression and HIV-1 replication . 
Treatment of cells with PTX and Go-6976 resulted in cooperative inhibition of both <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> -driven gene expression and HIV-1 replication . 
In addition , the combined use of <START:ggp> anti-Tat sFv intrabodies <END> and the two <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> inhibitors retained the virus in the latent state for as long as 45 days . 
The combined treatment resulted in more durable inhibition of HIV-1 replication than was seen with the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> inhibitors alone or the anti- <START:ggp> Tat sFv intrabodies <END> alone . 
Together , these results suggest that in future clinical gene therapy trials , a combined pharmacologic and genetic strategy like the one reported here may improve the survival of <START:ana> transduced cells <END> and prolong clinical benefit . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factors <END> in immune-mediated disease . 
A large amount of detailed information about the <START:ggp> intracellular proteins <END> regulating <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation and the cellular response to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation has emerged recently . 
Several small molecules , an <START:ggp> antisense oligonucleotide <END> , and gene therapeutic agents that inhibit <START:ggp> NF-kappa b <END> activation have been described . 
Despite this , there are still significant gaps in our understanding of this process and its consequences . 
In contrast , the characterization of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> selectively regulating cytokine production by <START:ana> CD4+ T cell subsets <END> is at a very early stage . 
Three <START:ggp> interacting proteins <END> have recently been shown to contribute to subset-restricted expression of the <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> . 
There are other elements regulating <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> expression , however , and the relative importance of these recently identified proteins has yet to be determined . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> Rel , Fos , and Jun proteins <END> in binding activity to the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter CD28 response element/AP-1 sequence <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD28 <END> is an important <START:ggp> costimulatory molecule <END> in the activation of <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
Costimulation of <START:ana> T cells <END> through both the Ag receptor and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> leads to high level <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production , which is vital to the development of an immune response in vivo . 
Previous reports have suggested the <START:ggp> CD28 <END> stimulation contributes to the activation of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> by up-regulating the activity of several <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , including <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) /Rel family members <END> as well as an <START:ggp> uncharacterized transcription factor <END> called <START:ggp> CD28 <END> response complex . 
While several lines of investigation have suggested that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel family members <END> make up the <START:ggp> CD28 <END> response complex <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , other work has not supported this conclusion . 
Recent studies suggest that the <START:ggp> CD28 response element <END> ( <START:ggp> CD28RE <END> ) does not function independently but works instead in conjunction with the <START:ggp> adjacent promoter proximal AP-1-binding site <END> and this hypothesis is confirmed here . 
Also in the current study , binding activity to the <START:ggp> CD28RE/AP-1 sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> is evaluated . 
Although four specific complexes can be detected binding to this sequence , only one of these complexes is specific for both the <START:ggp> CD28RE <END> and the <START:ggp> adjacent AP-1 site <END> . 
Of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel family members <END> tested , this <START:ggp> CD28RE/AP-1-specific complex <END> contains predominantly <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , despite the fact that both <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> RelA <END> can efficiently bind to the <START:ggp> CD28RE <END> . 
<START:ggp> c-Fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> are also found in this <START:ggp> CD28RE/AP-1-specific complex <END> . 
These data indicate that functional complexes encompassing both the <START:ggp> CD28RE <END> and the <START:ggp> AP-1-binding sites <END> influence <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activity in <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -costimulated <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Inducible expression and phosphorylation of <START:ggp> coactivator BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> [ see comments ] 
<START:ggp> BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> is a <START:ggp> transcriptional coactivator <END> that is constitutively expressed in <START:ana> B cells <END> and interacts with the Oct1 and Oct2 <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Upon activation of <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> and <START:ana> primary murine thymocytes <END> with phorbol esters and ionomycin , <START:ggp> BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> expression and transactivation function were induced . 
<START:ggp> BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> was phosphorylated at Ser184 both in vivo and in vitro , and this modification was required for inducible activation . 
Mutation of Ser184 also diminished transactivation function in <START:ana> B cells <END> , suggesting that the activating phosphorylation that is inducible in <START:ana> T cells <END> is constitutively present in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> is a <START:ggp> transcriptional coactivator <END> that is critically regulated by posttranslational modifications to mediate cell type-specific gene expression . 
Increased expression of <START:ggp> Gs ( alpha ) <END> enhances activation of the <START:ggp> adenylyl cyclase <END> signal transduction cascade . 
Expression of the stimulatory <START:ggp> G protein <END> , <START:ggp> G ( S ) alpha <END> , can vary over a 3-fold range in human tissues and in rodent central nervous system . 
In fact , the offspring of alcoholics have higher levels of <START:ggp> G ( S ) alpha <END> expression in certain tissues compared with the offspring of nonalcoholics . 
The aim of this research was to test the hypothesis that a causal relationship exists between the level of expression of <START:ggp> G ( S ) alpha <END> and induction of the <START:ggp> adenylyl cyclase <END> ( AC ) cascade . 
The methodology employed transient transfection of <START:ana> HEK 293 cells <END> with a cDNA for the 52-kDa form of <START:ggp> G ( S ) alpha <END> under regulation by <START:ggp> inducible metallothionein promoters <END> . 
Transfectants were exposed to varying concentrations ( 0-125 microM ) of zinc sulfate that produced a 3-fold range of membrane <START:ggp> G ( S ) alpha <END> expression . 
The range of <START:ggp> G ( S ) alpha <END> expression produced was found to mimic a physiologically relevant spectrum of <START:ggp> G ( S ) alpha <END> expression in membranes derived from human tissues and rat brain . 
It was observed that induction of <START:ggp> G ( S ) alpha <END> expression increased constitutive as well as stimulated cAMP accumulation . 
Moreover , induction of <START:ggp> G ( S ) alpha <END> expression increased events distal to the accumulation of cAMP including the phosphorylation of the transcription factor , <START:ggp> cAMP response element binding protein <END> and transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> cAMP-dependent reporter genes <END> . 
In summary , these studies show that the amount of <START:ggp> G ( S ) alpha <END> expression has a marked impact on the level of activity of the AC cascade from the membrane through to the nucleus . 
It is hypothesized that individuals who differ in <START:ggp> G ( S ) alpha <END> expression may also differ in the expression of certain <START:ggp> cAMP-dependent genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Thrombin <END> generation by <START:ana> apoptotic vascular smooth muscle cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Thrombin <END> activation requires assembly of a <START:ggp> prothrombinase complex <END> of activated <START:ggp> coagulation factors <END> on an anionic phospholipid surface , classically provided by <START:ana> activated platelets <END> . 
We have previously shown that anionic phosphatidylserine is exposed by <START:ana> rat vascular smooth muscle cells <END> ( <START:ana> VSMCs <END> ) undergoing apoptosis after serum withdrawal . 
In this study , using a chromogenic assay , we have shown <START:ggp> thrombin <END> generation by <START:ana> apoptotic VSMCs <END> expressing <START:ggp> c-myc <END> ( <START:ana> VSMC-myc <END> ) with an area under the <START:ggp> thrombin <END> -generation curve ( AUC ) of 305 +/- 17 nmol x min/L and a peak <START:ggp> thrombin <END> ( PT ) of 154 +/- 9 nmol/L . 
The <START:ggp> thrombin <END> -generating potential of the <START:ana> apoptotic VSMC-myc cells <END> was greater than that of <START:ana> unactivated platelets <END> ( P = .003 for AUC ; P = .0002 for PT ) and similar to calcium-ionophore <START:ana> activated platelets <END> ( AUC of 332 +/- 15 nmol x min/L , P = .3 ; PT of 172 +/- 8 nmol/L , P = .2 ) . 
<START:ggp> Thrombin <END> activation was also seen with <START:ana> apoptotic human VSMCs <END> ( AUC of 211 +/- 8 nmol x min/L ; PT of 103 +/- 4 nmol/L ) and was inhibited by annexin V ( P < .0001 for AUC and PT ) . 
<START:ana> VSMC-myc cells <END> maintained in serum generated less <START:ggp> thrombin <END> than after serum withdrawal ( P = .0002 for AUC and PT ) . 
<START:ana> VSMCs <END> derived from human coronary atherosclerotic plaques that apoptose even in serum also generated <START:ggp> thrombin <END> ( AUC of 260 +/- 2 nmol x min/L ; PT of 128 +/- 4 nmol/L ) . 
We conclude that <START:ana> apoptotic VSMCs <END> possess a significant <START:ggp> thrombin <END> -generating capacity secondary to phosphatidylserine exposure . 
Apoptotic cells within atherosclerotic plaques may allow local <START:ggp> thrombin <END> activation , thereby contributing to disease progression . 
An isotype-specific activator of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes <END> that is independent of <START:ggp> class II transactivator <END> . 
Patients with one type of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex class II <END> combined immunodeficiency have mutations in a gene termed <START:ggp> class II transactivator <END> ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) , which coordinately controls the transcription of the three major <START:ggp> human class II genes <END> , <START:ggp> HLA-DR , -DQ , and -DP <END> . 
However , the experimentally derived <START:ana> B-lymphoblastoid cell line <END> , <START:ana> clone 13 <END> , expresses high levels of <START:ggp> HLADQ <END> in the absence of <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> and <START:ggp> HLA-DP <END> , despite its mapping by complementation analysis to this group . 
It was possible that one of the <START:ggp> clone 13 CIITA alleles <END> bore a mutation that allowed <START:ggp> HLA-DQ <END> , but not HLA-DR or -DP transcription . 
Alternatively , another factor , distinct from <START:ggp> CIITA <END> , might control <START:ggp> HLA-DQ <END> expression . 
We report here that ectopic expression of <START:ggp> CIITA cDNAs <END> derived by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from <START:ana> clone 13 <END> do not restore expression of <START:ggp> HLA-DQ <END> in another <START:ana> CIITA-deficient cell line <END> , <START:ana> RJ2.2.5 <END> . 
In addition , no <START:ggp> CIITA <END> protein is detectable in <START:ana> clone 13 <END> nuclear extracts . 
In contrast , somatic cell fusion between <START:ana> clone 13 <END> and <START:ana> RJ2.2.5 <END> restored expression of the <START:ggp> HLA-DQ <END> haplotype encoded by the <START:ggp> RJ2.2.5 DQB gene <END> . 
Taken together , these data demonstrate the existence of an <START:ggp> HLA-DQ isotype-specific trans-acting factor <END> , which functions independently of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> . 
Homodimerization of the <START:ggp> human interleukin 4 receptor alpha chain <END> induces <START:ana> Cepsilon germline transcripts <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> in the absence of the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain <END> . 
The <START:ggp> cytokines <END> <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> play a critical role in inducing <START:ana> Cepsilon germline transcripts <END> and <START:ggp> IgE isotype <END> switching in <START:ana> human B cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> IL-4 receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4R <END> ) in <START:ana> B cells <END> is composed of two chains , the <START:ggp> IL-4-binding IL-4Ralpha chain <END> , which is shared with the <START:ggp> IL-13R <END> , and the <START:ggp> IL-2Rgamma ( gammac ) chain <END> , which is shared with <START:ggp> IL-7R <END> , <START:ggp> IL-9R <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-15R <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> induces <START:ana> Cepsilon germline transcripts <END> and <START:ggp> IgE isotype <END> switching in <START:ana> B cells <END> from patients with <START:ggp> gammac chain <END> deficiency . 
Induction of <START:ana> Cepsilon germline transcripts <END> by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> that lack the <START:ggp> gammac chain <END> may involve signaling via the <START:ggp> IL-13R <END> . 
Alternatively , the <START:ggp> IL-4Ralpha chain <END> may transduce intracellular signals that lead to <START:ggp> Cepsilon gene <END> transcription independently of its association with other chains . 
We show that ligand-induced homodimerization of <START:ggp> chimeric surface receptors <END> consisting of the <START:ggp> extracellular and transmembrane domains <END> of the <START:ggp> erythropoietin receptor <END> and of the <START:ggp> intracellular domain <END> of <START:ggp> IL-4Ralpha <END> induces <START:ggp> Janus kinase 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> ) activation , <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> activation , and <START:ana> Cepsilon germline transcripts <END> in <START:ana> human B cell line BJAB <END> . 
Disruption of the <START:ggp> Jak1-binding proline-rich Box1 region <END> of <START:ggp> IL-4Ralpha <END> abolished signaling by this <START:ggp> chimeric receptor <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ana> B cells <END> transfected with a <START:ggp> chimeric CD8alpha/IL-4Ralpha receptor <END> , which is expressed on the cell surface as a <START:ggp> homodimer <END> , constitutively expressed <START:ana> Cepsilon germline transcripts <END> . 
These results suggest that homodimerization of the <START:ggp> IL-4Ralpha chain <END> is sufficient to transduce <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> -dependent intracellular signals that lead to <START:ggp> IgE isotype <END> switching . 
Transcriptional activity and constitutive nuclear localization of the <START:ggp> ETS protein <END> <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> is a <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific transcription factor <END> that belongs to the <START:ggp> ETS protein family <END> . 
It can bind to DNA target sequences within a variety of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> . 
We demonstrate that <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> is constitutively localized in the nucleus which is dependent on the presence of <START:ggp> amino acids 86-265 <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> Gal4-Elf-1 fusion proteins <END> revealed that the N-terminal 86 amino acids of <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> contain a <START:ggp> transcriptional activation domain <END> , the activity of which is attenuated by an <START:ggp> internal repression domain <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> interacts specifically with the <START:ggp> E74 target sequence <END> and can stimulate transcription driven by the <START:ggp> E74 site <END> independent of mitogenic signaling . 
Thus , <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> is able to stimulate gene transcription which may be required for the development and activity of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
Characterization of <START:ana> peripheral blood T-lymphocytes <END> transduced with <START:ggp> HTLV-I Tax mutants <END> with different trans-activating phenotypes . 
<START:ggp> Tax1 <END> , a <START:ggp> transcriptional trans-activator <END> of the Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) , induces the expression of many cellular genes through interaction with at least three distinct <START:ggp> cellular transcription factors <END> ; <START:ggp> CREB/ATF <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , and <START:ggp> SRF <END> . 
This <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> cellular genes <END> is considered to be a critical event in T-cell transformation by HTLV-I . 
To elucidate the role of each <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> -inducible transcriptional pathway in T-cell transformation , we introduced <START:ggp> Tax1 mutants <END> with different trans-activating phenotypes into <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBL <END> ) by retroviral vectors . 
Analysis of these <START:ana> PBLs <END> revealed that activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> pathway is sufficient to promote the growth response to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
However , for the clonal expansion of <START:ana> CD4+ T-cells <END> , which is a characteristic result of HTLV-I infection , activation of the CREB/ATF and SRF pathways is also required . 
Epstein-Barr virus binding to <START:ggp> CD21 <END> activates the initial <START:ggp> viral promoter <END> via <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> induction . 
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , an oncogenic human herpesvirus , binds to and infects <START:ana> normal human B lymphocytes <END> via <START:ggp> CD21 <END> , the <START:ggp> CR2 complement receptor <END> . 
Studies of the mechanisms that enable EBV to infect nonactivated , <START:ana> noncycling B cells <END> provide compelling evidence for a sequence of events in which EBV binding to <START:ggp> CD21 <END> on purified <START:ana> resting human B cells <END> rapidly activates the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , which , in turn , binds to and mediates transcriptional activation of Wp , the initial <START:ggp> viral latent gene promoter <END> . 
Thus , EBV binding to its cellular receptor on resting B cells triggers an <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent intracellular signaling pathway which is required for infection . 
Synthetic glucocorticoids that dissociate transactivation and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> transrepression exhibit antiinflammatory activity in vivo . 
Some of the most potent antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive agents are synthetic glucocorticoids . 
However , major side effects severely limit their therapeutic use . 
The development of improved glucocorticoid-based drugs will require the separation of beneficial from deleterious effects . 
One possibility toward this goal is to try to dissociate two main activities of glucocorticoids , i.e. transactivation and transrepression . 
Screening of a library of compounds using transactivation and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> transrepression models in transiently transfected cells identified dissociated glucocorticoids , which exert strong <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> inhibition but little or no transactivation . 
Importantly , despite high ligand binding affinity , the prototypic dissociated compound , RU24858 , acted as a weak agonist and did not efficiently antagonize dexamethasone-induced transcription in <START:ana> transfected cells <END> . 
Similar results were obtained in <START:ana> hepatic HTC cells <END> for the transactivation of the <START:ggp> endogenous tyrosine amino transferase gene <END> ( <START:ggp> TAT <END> ) , which encodes one of the enzymes involved in the glucocorticoid-dependent stimulation of neoglucogenesis . 
To investigate whether dissociated glucocorticoids retained the antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive potential of classic glucocorticoids , several in vitro and in vivo models were used . 
Indeed , secretion of the <START:ggp> proinflammatory lymphokine interleukin-1beta <END> was severely inhibited by dissociated glucocorticoids in <START:ana> human monocytic THP 1 cells <END> . 
Moreover , in two in vivo models , these compounds exerted an antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive activity as potent as that of the classic glucocorticoid prednisolone . 
These results may lead to an improvement of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies and provide a novel concept for drug discovery . 
In vivo footprinting and mutational analysis of the <START:ggp> proximal CD19 promoter <END> reveal important roles for an <START:ggp> SP1/Egr-1 binding site <END> and a novel site termed the <START:ggp> PyG box <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD19 <END> expression begins at the pro-B cell stage of B cell development . 
As such it serves as a good prototype for <START:ggp> B cell-specific genes <END> whose expression begins shortly after lineage commitment . 
To understand the molecular mechanisms controlling <START:ggp> CD19 <END> gene expression , we isolated and functionally characterized the <START:ggp> CD19 promoter <END> using in vivo footprinting , gel shift assays , and transfection studies . 
Reporter constructs spanning portions of the promoter identified a <START:ggp> region between -85 and -200 <END> that produced high levels of reporter gene activity in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
In vivo footprinting identified protected regions over the known high affinity <START:ggp> B cell lineage-specific activator protein ( BSAP ) site <END> , the <START:ggp> low affinity BSAP site <END> , a <START:ggp> SP1/Egr-1 site <END> termed the <START:ggp> CD19 GC box <END> , and two novel sites named the <START:ggp> AT box <END> and <START:ggp> PyG box <END> . 
Phorbol ester treatment of a <START:ana> pre-B cell line <END> up-regulated <START:ggp> CD19 <END> expression , induced <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> , and enhanced the footprint over the GC box . 
Gel shift assays demonstrated SP1 and <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> binding to the <START:ggp> CD19 GC box <END> , while unknown nuclear proteins bound the <START:ggp> PyG and AT boxes <END> . 
Mutations in the <START:ggp> AT box <END> or in the <START:ggp> BSAP sites <END> did not affect <START:ggp> CD19 <END> <START:ggp> reporter construct <END> activity , while a mutation of the <START:ggp> GC box <END> reduced it modestly , and a <START:ggp> PyG box <END> mutation reduced it dramatically . 
<START:ggp> BSAP <END> failed to trans-activate <START:ggp> CD19 promoter constructs <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> or <START:ana> non-B cells <END> , suggesting that cis elements such as the <START:ggp> PyG and GC boxes <END> are also necessary for high level <START:ggp> CD19 promoter <END> expression . 
<START:ggp> EBF <END> and <START:ggp> E47 <END> collaborate to induce expression of the <START:ggp> endogenous immunoglobulin surrogate light chain genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Early B cell factor <END> ( <START:ggp> EBF <END> ) and <START:ggp> E47 <END> participate in the transcriptional control of early B lymphocyte differentiation . 
With the aim of identifying genetic targets for these transcription factors , we stably <START:ggp> transfected cDNAs <END> encoding <START:ggp> EBF <END> or a covalent homodimer of <START:ggp> E47 <END> , individually or together , into <START:ana> immature hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells <END> , which lack both factors . 
In combination , <START:ggp> EBF <END> and <START:ggp> E47 <END> induce efficient expression of the <START:ggp> endogenous immunoglobulin surrogate light chain genes <END> , <START:ggp> lambda5 <END> and <START:ggp> VpreB <END> , whereas other <START:ggp> pre-B cell-specific genes <END> remain silent . 
Multiple functionally important <START:ggp> EBF and E47 binding sites <END> were identified in the <START:ggp> lambda5 promoter/enhancer region <END> , indicating that <START:ggp> lambda5 <END> is a direct genetic target for these <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Taken together , these data suggest that <START:ggp> EBF <END> and <START:ggp> E47 <END> synergize to activate expression of a subset of genes that define an early stage of the <START:ana> B cell lineage <END> . 
<START:ggp> Cytokines <END> : shared <START:ggp> receptors <END> , distinct functions . 
That the signal transduction pathways used by the <START:ggp> cytokines <END> <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> are identical would suggest that these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> have redundant roles in lymphoid development ; instead , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> is the guardian of thymus-derived T-cell homeostasis , while <START:ggp> interleukin-15 <END> promotes extrathymic development of <START:ana> T and NK cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> IL-4 receptor alpha-chain cytoplasmic domain <END> is sufficient for activation of <START:ggp> JAK-1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> and the induction of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -specific gene expression . 
The <START:ggp> common gamma-chain <END> ( <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> ) is a functional component of the <START:ggp> IL-4R <END> , yet cells lacking <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> are able to respond to <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> . 
This has led to the suggestion that a <START:ggp> surrogate gamma'-chain <END> , which can interact with the <START:ggp> IL-4R alpha chain <END> to mediate signaling , is expressed on cells lacking <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> . 
An alternative possibility is that in the absence of <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> , the <START:ggp> IL-4R alpha chain <END> is able to transduce signals by homodimerization . 
To test this latter possibility , a <START:ggp> chimeric receptor <END> containing the <START:ggp> extracellular domain <END> of <START:ggp> c-kit <END> ( the <START:ggp> stem cell factor ( SCF ) receptor <END> ) and the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-4R alpha chain <END> was generated . 
Treatment of cells expressing the <START:ggp> chimeric receptor <END> <START:ggp> kit/IL-4R alpha <END> with <START:ggp> SCF <END> induces activation of the <START:ggp> IL-4R alpha-associated kinase <END> <START:ggp> JAK-1 <END> and the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> . 
However , tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> JAK-3 <END> , which associates with <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> , is not induced by <START:ggp> SCF <END> in these cells . 
<START:ggp> SCF <END> -mediated ligation of <START:ggp> kit/IL-4R alpha <END> is sufficient to elicit <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -specific gene expression , including up-regulation of <START:ggp> CD23 <END> and synthesis of <START:ana> germ-line epsilon transcripts <END> . 
In the <START:ana> T cell line CTLL2 <END> , ligation of <START:ggp> kit/IL-4R alpha <END> induces cellular proliferation . 
Finally , in <START:ana> JAK-1-deficient HeLa cells <END> , <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> activation by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> is completely abolished . 
Together , these data demonstrate that the <START:ggp> IL-4R alpha cytoplasmic domain <END> is sufficient to activate <START:ggp> JAK-1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> and to induce expression of <START:ggp> IL-4 target genes <END> , thus identifying a mechanism by which <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> signaling can proceed in the absence of <START:ggp> JAK-3 <END> and <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> . 
Histamine modulates the expression of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> through cyclic AMP production via the <START:ggp> H2 receptor <END> in the <START:ana> human promonocytic cell line U937 <END> . 
We examined the effects of histamine and its agonists on the expression of the <START:ggp> c-fos and c-myc proto-oncogenes <END> at the transcriptional and translational levels in the <START:ana> human promonocytic U937 cell line <END> . 
Histamine transiently increased cAMP and <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression through <START:ggp> H2 receptors <END> . 
Dibutyryl cAMP also increased <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> and <START:ggp> protein <END> , and levels remained elevated even after 12 hr of treatment . 
Dose-dependence studies using histamine and dimaprit showed that the EC50 values for cAMP production and <START:ggp> c-fos <END> increase were similar , suggesting that cAMP might be involved in <START:ggp> c-fos <END> induction via <START:ggp> H2 receptors <END> . 
Furthermore , studies carried out using <START:ggp> H7 <END> , a <START:ggp> protein kinase A/protein kinase C inhibitor <END> , blocked <START:ggp> c-fos <END> induction , whereas no effect was observed with bisindolylmaleimide , a specific <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> inhibitor . 
No modification of <START:ggp> c-myc <END> expression could be detected on treatment with histamine or its analogues . 
Nevertheless , dibutyryl cAMP induced a down-regulation of the levels of this <START:ggp> proto-oncogene <END> . 
In addition , dibutyryl cAMP inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner , whereas histamine failed to affect proliferation and differentiation of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
Cells pretreated with dimaprit showed a decrease in the cAMP response to subsequent addition of H2 agonists , whereas the cAMP response to prostaglandin E2 remained unaltered . 
This homologous mechanism of <START:ggp> H2 receptor <END> desensitization was time dependent . 
These results indicate that histamine activates several mechanisms involved in the induction of differentiation , such as cAMP and <START:ggp> c-fos <END> production , but fails to promote differentiation of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> , apparently due to the rapid desensitization of <START:ggp> H2 receptors <END> . 
Induction of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression in <START:ana> leukocytes <END> by binding of <START:ana> thrombin-stimulated platelets <END> . 
BACKGROUND : <START:ana> Activated platelets <END> tether and activate <START:ana> myeloid leukocytes <END> . 
To investigate the potential relevance of this mechanism in acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) , we examined <START:ggp> cytokine <END> induction by leukocyte-platelet adhesion and the occurrence of leukocyte-platelet conjugates in patients with AMI . 
METHODS AND RESULTS : We obtained peripheral venous blood samples in 20 patients with AMI before and daily for 5 days after direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) and in 20 patients undergoing elective PTCA . 
Throughout the study period , CD41 immunofluorescence of <START:ana> leukocytes <END> ( flow cytometry ) revealed increased leukocyte-platelet adhesion in patients with AMI compared with control patients ( mean +/- SE of fluorescence [ channels ] before PTCA : 77 +/- 16 versus 35 +/- 9 ; P = .003 ) . 
In vitro , <START:ana> thrombin-stimulated fixed platelets <END> bound to <START:ana> neutrophils <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Within 2 hours , this resulted in increased mRNA for <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) , 1 beta <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , and <START:ggp> monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP ) -1 <END> in unfractionated <START:ana> leukocytes <END> . 
After 4 hours , <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> and <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> concentration of the cell-free supernatant had increased by 268 +/- 36 % and 210 +/- 7 % , respectively , and cellular <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> content had increased by 170 +/- 8 % . 
Addition of <START:ana> activated platelets <END> to adherent <START:ana> monocytes <END> had a similar effect and was associated with <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> activation . 
Inhibition of binding by <START:ggp> anti-P selectin antibodies <END> reduced the effect of <START:ana> activated platelets <END> on <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production . 
CONCLUSIONS : In patients with AMI , leukocyte-platelet adhesion is increased . 
Binding of <START:ana> activated platelets <END> induces <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , and <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> in <START:ana> leukocytes <END> . 
Our findings suggest that leukocyte-platelet adhesion contributes to the regulation of inflammatory responses in AMI . 
Immediate early and <START:ggp> early lytic cycle proteins <END> are frequent targets of the Epstein-Barr virus-induced cytotoxic T cell response . 
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , a human gamma-herpesvirus , can establish both nonproductive ( latent ) and productive ( lytic ) infections . 
Although the CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) response to <START:ana> latently infected cells <END> is well characterized , very little is known about T cell controls over lytic infection ; this imbalance in our understanding belies the importance of virus-replicative lesions in several aspects of EBV disease pathogenesis . 
The present work shows that the primary CD8+ CTL response to EBV in infectious mononucleosis patients contains multiple lytic antigen-specific reactivities at levels at least as high as those seen against <START:ggp> latent antigens <END> ; similar reactivities are also detectable in CTL memory . 
Clonal analysis revealed individual responses to the two <START:ggp> immediate early proteins <END> <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> and <START:ggp> BRLF1 <END> , and to three ( <START:ggp> BMLF1 <END> , <START:ggp> BMRF1 <END> , and <START:ggp> BALF2 <END> ) of the six <START:ggp> early proteins <END> tested . 
In several cases , the peptide epitope and HLA-restricting determinant recognized by these <START:ana> CTLs <END> has been defined , one unusual feature being the number of responses restricted through <START:ggp> HLA-C alleles <END> . 
The work strongly suggests that EBV-replicative lesions are subject to direct CTL control in vivo and that <START:ggp> immediate early and early proteins <END> are frequently the immunodominant targets . 
This contrasts with findings in alpha- and beta- herpesvirus systems ( herpes simplex , cytomegalovirus ) where viral interference with the antigen-processing pathway during lytic infection renders <START:ggp> immediate early and early proteins <END> much less immunogenic . 
The unique capacity of gamma-herpesvirus to amplify the viral load in vivo through a latent growth-transforming infection may have rendered these agents less dependent upon viral replication as a means of successfully colonizing their hosts . 
Triggering of <START:ggp> HLA-DR antigens <END> differentially modulates <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> release by <START:ana> B cells <END> at distinct stage of maturation . 
Triggering of <START:ggp> HLA class II antigens <END> by the <START:ggp> anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) L243 <END> significantly ( P < 0.05 ) and differentially enhanced the release of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) by the <START:ana> non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma cells <END> <START:ana> Ri-I <END> , <START:ana> Ci-I <END> , and <START:ana> Sc-I <END> , which are at a distinct stage of B-cell differentiation , and by the more mature <START:ana> Burkitt lymphoma cell Raji <END> ; in contrast , it did not induce <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release by the <START:ana> pre-B leukemia cells <END> <START:ana> Nalm-6 <END> and <START:ana> BV173 <END> . 
<START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release peaked at 24 h and decreased thereafter , and it was dose dependent and preceded by an increase of <START:ana> TNF-alpha mRNA <END> detectable after 3 h of stimulation with <START:ggp> mAb L243 <END> . 
Secreted <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> mediated the enhancement of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) and activator protein-1 ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) binding activity ; in fact , the triggering of <START:ggp> HLA-DR antigens <END> in the presence of <START:ggp> antihuman TNF-alpha-neutralizing antibodies <END> did not upregulate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
In contrast , released <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> was not responsible for the homotypic aggregation of <START:ana> Ri-I <END> , <START:ana> Ci-I <END> , <START:ana> Sc-I <END> , and <START:ana> Raji cells <END> induced by <START:ggp> mAb L243 <END> , and it did not affect the proliferation of <START:ana> B cells <END> investigated . 
Altogether , our data demonstrate that : ( a ) the ability of <START:ana> B cells <END> to release <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> after triggering of <START:ggp> HLA-DR antigens <END> depends on their stage of differentiation ; ( b ) levels of released <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> seem to correlate with the stage of B-cell maturation but do not correlate with the amounts of <START:ggp> cell surface HLA-DR antigens <END> ; ( c ) secreted <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> regulates the levels of expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> by an autocrine loop ; and ( d ) intracellular signals mediating <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release by <START:ana> B cells <END> are distinct from those regulating homotypic aggregation and proliferation . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor GATA-3 <END> is differentially expressed in <START:ana> murine Th1 and Th2 cells <END> and controls Th2-specific expression of the <START:ggp> interleukin-5 gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-5 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> ) , which is produced by <START:ana> CD4 ( + ) T helper 2 ( Th2 ) cells <END> , but not by <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> , plays a key role in the development of eosinophilia in asthma . 
Despite increasing evidence that the outcome of many diseases is determined by the ratio of the two subsets of <START:ana> CD4 ( + ) T helper cells <END> , <START:ana> Th1 <END> and <START:ana> Th2 <END> , the molecular basis for Th1- and Th2- specific gene expression remains to be elucidated . 
We previously established a critical role for the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> in <START:ggp> IL-5 promoter <END> activation in <START:ana> EL-4 cells <END> , which express both <START:ggp> Th1- and Th2-type cytokines <END> . 
Our studies reported here demonstrate that <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> is critical for expression of the <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> gene in <START:ana> bona fide Th2 cells <END> . 
Whereas mutations in the <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> site abolished antigen- or cAMP- stimulated IL-5 promoter activation in Th2 cells , ectopic expression of <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> in <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> or in a <START:ana> non-lymphoid , non-IL-5-producing cell line <END> activated the <START:ggp> IL-5 promoter <END> . 
During the differentiation of <START:ana> naive CD4 ( + ) T cells <END> isolated from T cell receptor transgenic mice , <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> gene expression was up-regulated in developing <START:ana> Th2 cells <END> , but was down-regulated in <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> , and <START:ana> antigen- or cAMP-activated Th2 cells <END> ( but not <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> ) expressed the <START:ggp> GATA-3 protein <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> may play an important role in the balance between <START:ana> Th1 <END> and <START:ana> Th2 subsets <END> in immune responses . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> activity has therapeutic potential in the treatment of asthma and other hypereosinophilic diseases . 
A shortened life span of <START:ana> EKLF-/- adult erythrocytes <END> , due to a deficiency of <START:ggp> beta-globin chains <END> , is ameliorated by <START:ggp> human gamma-globin chains <END> . 
Using homologous recombination , both <START:ggp> EKLF alleles <END> in <START:ana> murine embryonic stem ( ES ) cells <END> were inactivated . 
These <START:ana> EKLF-/- ES cells <END> were capable of undergoing in vitro differentiation to form definitive erythroid colonies that were similar in size and number to those formed by <START:ana> wild-type ES cells <END> . 
However , the <START:ana> EKLF-/- colonies <END> were poorly hemoglobinized and <START:ana> enucleated erythrocytes <END> in these colonies contained numerous Heinz bodies . 
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analyses revealed that adult and <START:ggp> embryonic globin genes <END> were appropriately regulated , with the exception of <START:ggp> beta h1-globin <END> , which continued to be expressed at a very low level . 
The ratio of <START:ana> adult beta-globin/alpha-globin mRNA <END> in the <START:ana> mutant ES cells <END> was 1/15 of that in <START:ana> wild-type ES cells <END> . 
When the <START:ana> EKLF-/- cells <END> were injected into blastocysts , they did not contribute at a detectable level to the mature erythrocyte compartment of the chimeric animals , based on analysis of <START:ggp> glucose phosphate isomerase-1 ( GPI-1 ) isozymes <END> and hemoglobins that distinguish <START:ana> ES cell-derived erythrocytes <END> from host <START:ana> blastocyst-derived erythrocytes <END> . 
In contrast , semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA from <START:ana> reticulocytes <END> of the same chimeric animals suggested that the <START:ana> ES cell-derived reticulocytes <END> were present at a level of 6 % to 8 % . 
This indicated that the <START:ana> EKLF-/- erythrocytes <END> in adult animals must be short-lived , apparently due to the imbalance of <START:ggp> beta- versus alpha-globin chains <END> , leading to the precipitation of excess <START:ggp> alpha-globin chains <END> to form Heinz bodies . 
Consistent with this hypothesis , the short life span was ameliorated by introduction into the <START:ana> EKLF-/- ES cells <END> of a <START:ggp> human LCR/gamma-globin gene <END> , as evidenced by the presence of <START:ana> ES cell-derived reticulocytes <END> as well as <START:ana> mature erythrocytes <END> in the blood of the chimeric animals . 
<START:ggp> RP1 <END> , a new member of the <START:ggp> adenomatous polyposis coli-binding EB1-like gene family <END> , is differentially expressed in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
Cross-linking of the <START:ggp> CD3 and CD28 molecules <END> on <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> represents one of the most effective signals for <START:ana> T lymphocyte <END> activation and triggering of their cytotoxic effector function . 
To identify genes that are expressed in <START:ana> T cells <END> after stimulation , mRNA from <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> that had been activated by the simultaneous stimulation of the <START:ggp> CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> trigger molecules was transcribed for a differential mRNA display analysis into cDNA and was compared with cDNA from <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -or <START:ggp> CD3 <END> -activated or resting <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
Differential expression was confirmed subsequently by Northern blot analysis . 
One of the <START:ggp> cDNA fragments <END> expressed specifically in <START:ggp> CD3 <END> -and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> <START:ana> -activated T cells <END> was designated <START:ggp> RP1 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> predictive protein-coding region <END> of <START:ggp> RP1 <END> had a significant homology to members of the recently found <START:ggp> adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) protein-binding EB1 gene family <END> , which codes for yet unknown protein ( s ) . 
Bacterially expressed <START:ggp> RP1 protein <END> revealed specific binding to <START:ggp> wild-type <END> but not to <START:ggp> mutated APC protein <END> . 
The rapid up-regulation of <START:ana> RP1 mRNA <END> in properly <START:ana> activated T cells <END> suggests that this gene might belong to the <START:ggp> immediate/early gene family <END> , which controls the signal transduction cascade downstream of the <START:ggp> TCR <END> . 
As the expression level of the <START:ggp> RP1 gene <END> in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> and a spectrum of <START:ana> tumor-derived cell lines <END> correlates with the proliferative status of the cells , members of the <START:ggp> EB1-like gene family <END> may not only be involved in the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancers but may also play a role in the proliferative control of <START:ana> normal cells <END> . 
Cyclosporin A interferes with the inducible degradation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> inhibitors , but not with the processing of p105/ <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> controls the induction of numerous <START:ggp> cytokine promoters <END> during the activation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Inhibition of T cell activation by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 exerts a suppressive effect on the induction of these <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-controlled cytokine promoters <END> . 
We show for <START:ana> human Jurkat T leukemia cells <END> , as well as <START:ana> human and mouse primary T lymphocytes <END> , that this inhibitory effect is accompanied by an impaired nuclear translocation of the <START:ggp> Rel proteins <END> <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , <START:ggp> RelA/p65 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1/p50 <END> , whereas the nuclear appearance of <START:ggp> RelB <END> remains unaffected . 
CsA does not interfere with the synthesis of <START:ggp> Rel proteins <END> , but prevents the inducible degradation of <START:ggp> cytosolic NF-kappa B inhibitors <END> <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> upon T cell activation . 
CsA neither inhibits the processing of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 precursor <END> <START:ggp> p105 <END> to <START:ggp> p50 <END> , nor does it `` stabilize '' the C-terminal portion of <START:ggp> p105 <END> , <START:ggp> I kappa B gamma <END> , which is degraded during <START:ggp> p105 <END> processing to <START:ggp> mature p50 <END> . 
These results indicate that CsA interferes with a specific event in the signal-induced degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> , but does not affect the processing of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1/p105 <END> to <START:ggp> p50 <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> by beta-amyloid peptides and <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> in murine microglia . 
An increasing body of evidence suggests that amyloid-beta ( A beta ) peptides and <START:ana> microglia <END> are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease . 
In an effort to further elucidate the biological effects of A beta towards <START:ana> microglia <END> , we investigated the ability of A beta peptides to activate <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> in the <START:ana> N9 murine microglial cell line <END> . 
Co-stimulation of <START:ana> microglia <END> with suboptimal concentrations of A beta ( 25-35 ) and 100 U/ml <START:ggp> IFN gamma <END> resulted in the detection of a specific <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts , as determined in gel mobility shift assays . 
This response required at least 120 min to be evident and supershift experiments revealed that the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> contains both <START:ggp> RelA <END> and <START:ggp> p50 <END> . 
Accordingly , immunoblot experiments showed that amongst <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> /Rel proteins <END> , <START:ggp> RelA <END> and <START:ggp> p50 <END> are mobilized to the nucleus following microglial cell stimulation with A beta ( 25-35 ) plus <START:ggp> IFN gamma <END> . 
Higher concentrations of A beta ( 25-35 ) were effective by themselves in inducing <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation , both in the <START:ana> N9 microglial cell line <END> and in <START:ana> rat primary microglia <END> , as well as in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
For purposes of comparison , <START:ana> microglia <END> were also stimulated with bacterial LPS , a known <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> inducer . 
As expected , LPS strongly induced the formation of two <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA-binding activities , one of which was identified as <START:ggp> RelA/p50 <END> . 
The LPS response was also more rapid , as it was already evident by 40 min and remained sustained for up to 3 h . 
Collectively , these findings indicate that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation might constitute one of the mechanisms underlying the inducible expression of <START:ggp> kappa B-dependent genes <END> in <START:ana> microglia <END> stimulated by A beta peptides and <START:ggp> IFN gamma <END> , or by LPS . 
Glucocorticoid-mediated repression of <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> transcription in human <START:ggp> arteritis-SCID chimeras <END> . 
Giant cell arteritis ( GCA ) is a vasculitic syndrome that preferentially affects medium and large-sized arteries . 
Glucocorticoid therapy resolves clinical symptoms within hours to days , but therapy has to be continued over several years to prevent disease relapses . 
It is not known whether and how glucocorticoids affect the function of the inflammatory infiltrate or why the disease persists subclinically despite chronic treatment . 
GCA is self-sustained in temporal arteries engrafted into SCID mice , providing a model in which the mechanisms of action and limitations of glucocorticoid therapy can be examined in vivo . 
Administration of dexamethasone to <START:ana> temporal artery-SCID chimeras <END> for 1 wk induced a partial suppression of T cell and macrophage function as indicated by the reduced tissue concentrations of <START:ana> IL-2 , IL-1beta , and IL-6 mRNA <END> , and by the diminished expression of inducible <START:ggp> NO synthase <END> . 
In contrast , synthesis of <START:ana> IFN-gamma mRNA <END> was only slightly decreased , and expression of <START:ggp> TGF-beta1 <END> was unaffected . 
These findings correlated with activation of the <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha gene <END> and blockade of the nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> in the xenotransplanted tissue . 
Dose-response experiments suggested that steroid doses currently used in clinical medicine are suboptimal in repressing <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> -mediated <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production in the inflammatory lesions . 
Chronic steroid therapy was able to deplete the <START:ggp> T cell products <END> <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> , whereas the activation of <START:ana> tissue-infiltrating macrophages <END> was only partially affected . 
<START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> transcription was abrogated ; in contrast , <START:ana> TGF-beta1 mRNA <END> synthesis was steroid resistant . 
The persistence of <START:ana> TGF-beta1-transcribing macrophages <END> , despite paralysis of T cell function , may provide an explanation for the chronicity of the disease , and may identify a novel therapeutic target in this inflammatory vasculopathy . 
Defective survival and activation of <START:ana> thymocytes <END> in transgenic mice expressing a <START:ggp> catalytically inactive form <END> of <START:ggp> Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV <END> . 
We have generated transgenic mice that express a <START:ggp> catalytically inactive form <END> of <START:ggp> Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV <END> ( <START:ggp> CaMKIV <END> ) specifically in <START:ana> thymic T cells <END> . 
The presence of this protein results in a markedly reduced thymic cellularity , although the distribution of the remaining cells is normal based on evaluation of the <START:ggp> CD4 <END> and <START:ggp> CD8 <END> <START:ggp> cell surface antigens <END> that are used to gauge T cell development . 
Isolated <START:ana> thymic T cells <END> from the transgenic mice also show a dramatically decreased survival rate when evaluated in culture under conditions that do not favor activation . 
When challenged with an activating stimulus such as <START:ggp> alpha-CD3 <END> or a combination of phorbol ester plus ionophore , the cells are severely compromised in their ability to produce the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) . 
Reduction of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production is secondary to the inability to phosphorylate the <START:ggp> cAMP response element binding protein <END> , <START:ggp> CREB <END> , and induce expression of the <START:ggp> immediate early genes <END> such as <START:ggp> Fos B <END> that are required to transactivate the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> . 
Because transgene expression was regulated by the <START:ggp> proximal promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> murine lck gene <END> and this promoter is inactivated in <START:ana> T cells <END> that exit the thymus , the <START:ggp> mutant hCaMKIV <END> is not present in <START:ana> peripheral T cells <END> . 
Consequently , <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> present in the spleen can be activated normally in response to either stimulus mentioned above , demonstrating that the effects of the <START:ggp> inactive CaMKIV <END> on activation are reversible . 
Our results suggest that <START:ggp> CaMKIV <END> may represent a physiologically relevant <START:ggp> CREB kinase <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> and that the enzyme is also required to ensure normal expansion of <START:ana> T cells <END> in the thymus . 
Whereas the pathway responsible for this latter role is yet to be elucidated , it is unlikely to include <START:ggp> CREB <END> phosphorylation . 
A new <START:ggp> mouse gene <END> , <START:ggp> SRG3 <END> , related to the <START:ggp> SWI3 <END> of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , is required for apoptosis induced by glucocorticoids in a <START:ana> thymoma cell line <END> . 
We isolated a new <START:ggp> mouse gene <END> that is highly expressed in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> , testis , and brain . 
This gene , <START:ggp> SRG3 <END> , showed a significant sequence homology to <START:ggp> SWI3 <END> , a <START:ggp> yeast transcriptional activator <END> , and its <START:ggp> human homolog BAF155 <END> . 
<START:ggp> SRG3 <END> encodes 1 , 100 amino acids and has 33-47 % identity with <START:ggp> SWI3 protein <END> over three regions . 
The <START:ggp> SRG3 protein <END> contains an <START:ggp> acidic NH2 terminus <END> , a <START:ggp> myb-like DNA binding domain <END> , a <START:ggp> leucine-zipper motif <END> , and a <START:ggp> proline- and glutamine-rich region <END> at its <START:ggp> COOH terminus <END> . 
Rabbit antiserum raised against a COOH-terminal polypeptide of the <START:ggp> SRG3 <END> recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 155 kD . 
The serum also detected a <START:ggp> 170-kD protein <END> that seems to be a mouse homologue of <START:ggp> human BAF170 <END> . 
Immunoprecipitation of cell extract with the antiserum against the <START:ggp> mouse SRG3 <END> also brought down a <START:ggp> 195-kD protein <END> that could be recognized by an antiserum raised against <START:ggp> human SWI2 protein <END> . 
The results suggest that the <START:ggp> SRG3 protein <END> associates with a <START:ggp> mouse SWI2 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> SRG3 protein <END> is expressed about three times higher in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> than in <START:ana> peripheral lymphocytes <END> . 
The expression of <START:ggp> anti-sense RNA <END> to <START:ana> SRG3 mRNA <END> in a <START:ana> thymoma cell line <END> , <START:ana> S49.1 <END> , reduced the expression level of the <START:ggp> SRG3 protein <END> , and decreased the apoptotic cell death induced by glucocorticoids . 
These results suggest that the <START:ggp> SRG3 protein <END> is involved in the glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in the <START:ana> thymoma cell line <END> . 
This implicates that the <START:ggp> SRG3 <END> may play an important regulatory role during T cell development in thymus . 
Transcriptional induction of <START:ggp> collagenase-1 <END> in <START:ana> differentiated monocyte-like ( U937 ) cells <END> is regulated by <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and an <START:ggp> upstream C/EBP-beta site <END> . 
In this report , we demonstrate that the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> site and a <START:ggp> distal promoter element <END> regulate transcriptional induction of <START:ggp> collagenase-1 <END> during monocytic differentiation . 
<START:ggp> Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression constructs <END> containing regions of the <START:ggp> human collagenase-1 promoter <END> were stably or transiently transfected into <START:ana> U937 cells <END> , and reporter activity was assessed at various times after the onset of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -mediated differentiation . 
Rapid and strong induction of promoter activity was lost in constructs with a <START:ggp> mutant AP-1 element <END> ; however , at 16-96 h post-PMA , the <START:ggp> mutant collagenase-1 promoter <END> displayed <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> independent PMA-mediated transactivation . 
The <START:ggp> AP-1 mutant constructs <END> also showed delayed transcriptional activation in <START:ana> PMA-treated fibroblasts <END> . 
Western and supershift analyses indicated that <START:ggp> functional Jun and Fos proteins <END> were present in nuclear extracts of <START:ana> PMA-differentiated U937 cells <END> . 
Promoter deletion constructs demonstrated the potential role of <START:ggp> distal promoter sequences <END> in regulating <START:ggp> collagenase-1 <END> transcription . 
In particular , Western , supershift , and promoter deletion analyses suggested a role for <START:ggp> CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-beta ( C/EBP-beta ) binding site <END> between <START:ggp> -2010 and -1954 <END> in regulating transcription of <START:ggp> collagenase-1 <END> in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
Our findings suggest that distinct <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> , acting somewhat independently of each other , control expression of <START:ggp> collagenase-1 <END> . 
In addition , our data suggests that the rapid PMA-mediated induction of <START:ggp> collagenase-1 <END> transcription is controlled by a mechanism distinct from that regulating the sustained expression of this <START:ggp> proteinase <END> in <START:ana> activated macrophages <END> . 
Quantification of <START:ana> vitamin D receptor mRNA <END> by competitive polymerase chain reaction in <START:ana> PBMC <END> : lack of correspondence with <START:ggp> common allelic variants <END> . 
It has been recently claimed that polymorphism for the <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) influences several aspects of calcium and bone metabolism . 
To evaluate the physiologic plausibility of these claims , we compared the abundance of the <START:ana> VDR mRNA <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMCs <END> ) between different <START:ggp> VDR genotypes <END> using a quantitative reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction-based method . 
The method is based on the coamplification of <START:ggp> VDR cDNA <END> and an internal standard consisting of known concentrations of a <START:ggp> human VDR CDNA <END> mutated at a <START:ggp> BglII restriction site <END> ; the interassay coefficient of variation is 11 % . 
To validate the method , we made use of earlier receptor binding studies indicating that <START:ana> normal human monocytes <END> and activated , but not resting , <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> expressed the <START:ggp> VDR <END> . 
The concentration of the <START:ana> VDR mRNA <END> was 10 ( -8 ) to 10 ( -7 ) g/g of total RNA in <START:ana> cell-sorted monocytes <END> and in <START:ana> in vitro activated lymphocytes <END> , but only 10 ( -12 ) g/g of total mRNA in resting <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , establishing that the <START:ana> VDR mRNA <END> determined by our method in <START:ana> PBMCs <END> is due to constitutive expression in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Following an initial genotype screening of 85 normal volunteers by polymerase chain reaction or <START:ggp> restriction fragment length polymorphism <END> analysis , 14 individuals with the Bb genotype , 12 with the bb genotype , and 12 with the BB genotype were selected . 
The concentration of the <START:ana> VDR mRNA <END> , corrected for the number of <START:ana> monocytes <END> , was similar among the three genotype groups , as were the other variables examined : <START:ggp> serum calcitriol <END> , <START:ggp> serum osteocalcin <END> , and vertebral and hip bone density . 
We conclude that <START:ggp> VDR <END> polymorphism does not affect the abundance of the <START:ana> VDR mRNA <END> . 
Oncogenic forms of <START:ggp> NOTCH1 <END> lacking either the <START:ggp> primary binding site <END> for <START:ggp> RBP-Jkappa <END> or <START:ggp> nuclear localization sequences <END> retain the ability to associate with <START:ggp> RBP-Jkappa <END> and activate transcription . 
Truncated forms of the <START:ggp> NOTCH1 transmembrane receptor <END> engineered to resemble mutant forms of <START:ggp> NOTCH1 <END> found in certain cases of human T cell leukemia/lymphoma ( T-ALL ) efficiently induce T-ALL when expressed in the bone marrow of mice . 
Unlike full-sized <START:ggp> NOTCH1 <END> , two such truncated forms of the protein either lacking a major portion of the <START:ggp> extracellular domain <END> ( <START:ggp> DeltaE <END> ) or consisting only of the <START:ggp> intracellular domain <END> ( <START:ggp> ICN <END> ) were found to activate transcription in cultured cells , presumably through <START:ggp> RBP-Jkappa <END> response elements within DNA . 
Both truncated forms also bound to the <START:ggp> transcription factor RBP-Jkappa <END> in extracts prepared from <START:ana> human and murine T-ALL cell lines <END> . 
Transcriptional activation required the presence of a weak <START:ggp> RBP-Jkappa-binding site <END> within the <START:ggp> NOTCH1 ankyrin repeat region <END> of the <START:ggp> intracellular domain <END> . 
Unexpectedly , a second , stronger <START:ggp> RBP-Jkappa-binding site <END> , which lies within the <START:ggp> intracellular domain <END> close to the transmembrane region and significantly augments association with <START:ggp> RBP-Jkappa <END> , was not needed for oncogenesis or for transcriptional activation . 
While <START:ggp> ICN <END> appeared primarily in the nucleus , <START:ggp> DeltaE <END> localized to cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes , suggesting that intranuclear localization is not essential for oncogenesis or transcriptional activation . 
In support of this interpretation , mutation of putative <START:ggp> nuclear localization sequences <END> decreased nuclear localization and increased transcriptional activation by <START:ggp> membrane-bound DeltaE <END> . 
Transcriptional activation by this mutant form of <START:ggp> membrane-bound DeltaE <END> was approximately equivalent to that produced by <START:ggp> intranuclear ICN <END> . 
These data are most consistent with <START:ggp> NOTCH1 <END> oncogenesis and transcriptional activation being independent of association with <START:ggp> RBP-Jkappa <END> at <START:ggp> promoter sites <END> . 
<START:ggp> Sp family members <END> preferentially interact with the <START:ggp> promoter proximal repeat <END> within the <START:ggp> HTLV-I enhancer <END> . 
Human T cell lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) encodes the <START:ggp> transactivator protein <END> , <START:ggp> Tax <END> , which facilitates viral transcription from three <START:ggp> 21 bp repeated elements <END> within the <START:ggp> U3 region <END> of the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) . 
Examination of the <START:ggp> basal factors <END> interacting with the <START:ggp> 21 bp repeat elements <END> through electrophoretic mobility shift ( EMS ) analyses has demonstrated the formation of <START:ggp> DNA-protein complexes <END> common to each of the <START:ggp> 21 bp repeats <END> ( <START:ggp> C1-C3 <END> ) as well as three <START:ggp> DNA-protein complexes <END> specific to the <START:ggp> promoter proximal ( pp ) repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> U1 <END> ( <START:ggp> U1A/U1B <END> ) and <START:ggp> U2 <END> ; 1-4 ) . 
These studies have indicated that the individual repeats are not identical with respect to the <START:ggp> cellular factors <END> with which they interact . 
EMS analyses utilizing a series of <START:ggp> mutated pp repeat elements <END> demonstrate that the nucleotide sequence requirements for <START:ggp> U1 <END> ( <START:ggp> U1A/U1B <END> ) and <START:ggp> U2 <END> formation are separable from those required for <START:ggp> C1-C3 <END> formation . 
Competition EMS analyses utilizing Sp1 and CREB binding site oligonucleotides demonstrate that <START:ggp> Sp family members <END> are critical components of <START:ggp> U1 <END> ( <START:ggp> U1A/U1B <END> ) and <START:ggp> U2 <END> and that <START:ggp> ATF/CREB family members <END> are critical components of <START:ggp> C1-C3 <END> . 
EMS supershift analyses have demonstrated that <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> is involved in U1A formation while <START:ggp> Sp3 <END> is involved in U1B and U2 formation . 
EMS analyses performed with nuclear extracts from <START:ana> Tax-expressing Jurkat cells <END> and <START:ana> HTLV-I-transformed peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> demonstrate that <START:ggp> Tax <END> prevents the formation of <START:ggp> U1 <END> ( <START:ggp> U1A/U1B <END> ) and <START:ggp> U2 <END> <START:ggp> DNA-protein complexes <END> . 
Therefore , <START:ggp> Tax <END> appears to inhibit the interaction of <START:ggp> Sp family members <END> with the <START:ggp> pp repeat <END> . 
Based on these observations , it is possible that the interaction of <START:ggp> Sp <END> and <START:ggp> ATF/CREB family members <END> with the <START:ggp> pp repeat <END> during basal and <START:ggp> Tax <END> -mediated transcription may play a critical role in viral gene expression during the initial stages of virus infection or during activation of a latent infection . 
Lineage- and stage-specific expression of <START:ggp> runt box polypeptides <END> in primitive and definitive hematopoiesis . 
Translocations involving the <START:ggp> human CBFA2 locus <END> have been associated with leukemia . 
This gene , originally named <START:ggp> AML1 <END> , is a human homologue of the <START:ggp> Drosophila gene runt <END> that controls early events in fly embryogenesis . 
To clarify the role of <START:ggp> mammalian runt products <END> in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis , we have studied their pattern of expression in mouse hematopoietic tissues in the adult and during ontogeny using an anti-runt box antiserum . 
In the adult bone marrow , we found expression of runt polypeptides in <START:ana> differentiating myeloid cells <END> and in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
Within the <START:ana> erythroid lineage <END> , runt expression is biphasic , clearly present in the <START:ana> erythroblasts <END> of early blood islands and of the fetal liver , but absent in the adult . 
Biochemical analysis by Western blotting of <START:ana> fetal and adult hematopoietic populations <END> shows several <START:ggp> runt isoforms <END> . 
At least one of them appears to be myeloid specific . 
<START:ggp> Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 <END> ( <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> ) is constitutively activated in normal , <START:ana> self-renewing B-1 cells <END> but only inducibly expressed in conventional <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> [ see comments ] 
<START:ggp> Cytokine <END> and <START:ggp> growth factor receptor <END> engagement leads to the rapid phosphorylation and activation of latent , <START:ggp> cytosolic signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) proteins <END> , which then translocate to the nucleus where they regulate transcriptional events from <START:ggp> specific promoter sequences <END> . 
<START:ggp> STAT3 <END> expression in particular has been associated with <START:ggp> Abl <END> , <START:ggp> Src <END> , and HTLV-1 transformation of <START:ana> normal cells <END> . 
<START:ana> B-1 lymphocytes <END> are self-renewing , <START:ana> CD5+ B cells <END> that display a propensity for malignant transformation and are the normal counterpart to human chronic lymphocytic leukemias . 
Further , <START:ana> B-1 cells <END> are characterized by aberrant intracellular signaling , including hyperresponsiveness to phorbol ester PKC agonists . 
Here we demonstrate that <START:ana> B-1 lymphocytes <END> constitutively express <START:ggp> nuclear activated STAT3 <END> , which is not expressed by <START:ana> unmanipulated conventional ( B-2 ) lymphocytes <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> activation is induced in <START:ana> B-2 cells <END> after antigen receptor engagement in a delayed fashion ( after 3 h ) . 
Induction of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> is inhibited by both the serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor H-7 and the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin and requires de novo protein synthesis , demonstrating novel coupling between <START:ggp> sIg <END> and <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> that differs from the classical paradigm for <START:ggp> STAT <END> induction by <START:ggp> cytokine receptors <END> . 
The inability of prolonged stimulation of conventional <START:ana> B-2 cells <END> with <START:ggp> anti-Ig <END> , a treatment sufficient to induce <START:ggp> CD5 <END> expression , to result in sustained <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> activation suggests that <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> is a specific nuclear marker for <START:ana> B-1 cells <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> may play a role in B cell antigen-specific signaling responses , and its constitutive activation is associated with a normal cell population exhibiting intrinsic proliferative behavior . 
Significance of quantitative analysis of <START:ana> AML1/ETO transcripts <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood stem cells <END> from t ( 8 ; 21 ) acute myelogenous leukemia . 
Autologous <START:ana> peripheral blood stem cell <END> transplantation ( PBSCT ) is replacing autologous bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) in the treatment of leukemia . 
One of the potential advantages of autologous PBSCT is the possibility that <START:ana> peripheral blood stem cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBSC <END> ) are less likely to be contaminated by <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> than bone marrow grafts . 
However , the major problem still remains the high incidence of leukemic relapse following autologous PBSCT , which may be caused by the reinfusion of <START:ana> PBSC <END> contaminated by <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> . 
Recently , we have developed a quantitative assay using competitive <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase polymerase <END> chain reaction that estimates the number of <START:ana> AML1/ETO transcripts <END> in t ( 8 ; 21 ) acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) , in order to determine the degree of leukemic cell contamination in <START:ana> PBSC <END> harvests , and to monitor minimal residual disease ( MRD ) quantitatively in patients with t ( 8 ; 21 ) AML . 
Our data indicate that although <START:ana> PBSC <END> harvests collected after consolidation chemotherapy are contaminated by <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> , the degree of leukemic cell contamination decreases with repeated cycles of chemotherapy . 
Furthermore , the MRD in <START:ana> PBSC <END> harvests is less than in the corresponding bone marrow obtained on the day of the <START:ana> PBSC <END> collection . 
There appears to be no relationship between the number of <START:ana> AML1/ETO transcripts <END> found in the infused <START:ana> PBSC <END> harvests and the incidence of leukemic relapse following autologous PBSCT in our study . 
However , a substantial decrease of <START:ana> AML1/ETO transcripts <END> was seen following autologous PBSCT . 
Thus , the quantitative analysis of <START:ana> AML1/ETO transcripts <END> may be clinically useful in patients with t ( 8 ; 21 ) AML . 
Upregulation of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> in <START:ana> activated T lymphoid and monocytic cells <END> by <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat protein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> regulatory Tat protein <END> of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) is essential for viral replication and also shows pleiotropic activities on various cell functions . 
To get further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activity of <START:ggp> Tat <END> , we investigated the effect of endogenous and exogenous <START:ggp> Tat protein <END> on c-fos gene expression in <START:ana> T lymphoblastoid ( Jurkat ) and monocytic ( U937 ) cell lines <END> , as well as in <START:ana> primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) . 
Transient cotransfection of <START:ggp> tat cDNA <END> in sense orientation ( <START:ggp> tat/S <END> ) , together with a <START:ggp> plasmid <END> containing the <START:ggp> c-fos promoter <END> ( <START:ggp> FC3 <END> , from- <START:ggp> 711 to +42 <END> ) in front of the <START:ggp> bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene <END> significantly enhanced <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> activated by the addition of 15 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) or 5 micrograms/mL <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> plus 10 ( -7 ) mol/L phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) and <START:ana> U937 cells <END> activated by 15 % FCS or 10 ( -7 ) mol/L PMA . 
This effect was specifically due to <START:ggp> Tat <END> , since <START:ana> Jurkat <END> and <START:ana> U937 cells <END> cotransfected either with <START:ggp> tat cDNA <END> in antisense orientation ( <START:ggp> tat/AS <END> ) , <START:ggp> tat <END> carrying a mutation in the <START:ggp> aminoacid cys22-gly22 <END> ( <START:ggp> tat 22/S <END> ) or with the <START:ggp> backbone vector alone <END> ( <START:ggp> pRPneo-SL3 <END> ) did not show any significant difference in <START:ggp> c-fos promoter <END> activity as compared to cells transfected with <START:ggp> FC3 plasmid <END> alone . 
By using deletion mutants of the <START:ggp> c-fos promoter <END> , we found that the <START:ggp> minimal DNA sequence <END> required for <START:ggp> Tat <END> activity was located between <START:ggp> nucleotides -404/-220 <END> and that the <START:ggp> serum responsive element <END> ( <START:ggp> SRE <END> , <START:ggp> -317/-288 <END> ) , present within this region , was still responsive to <START:ggp> Tat <END> . 
A <START:ggp> single point mutation <END> in the <START:ggp> SRE <END> completely abrogated the responsiveness to <START:ggp> tat/S <END> . 
Exogenous <START:ggp> recombinant Tat protein <END> was also able to upregulate <START:ggp> c-fos promoter <END> activity in serum-activated Jurkat and <START:ana> U937 cells <END> , as well as endogenous <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> expression and <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> protein synthesis in both <START:ana> serum-activated cell lines <END> and <START:ana> primary PBMC <END> . 
<START:ggp> c-Fos <END> protein was shown essential for an optimal transactivation of the HIV-1 <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) by <START:ggp> Tat <END> : incubation of <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> with antisense , but not sense , c-fos oligonucleotides significantly reduced either the <START:ggp> Tat <END> -enhanced expression of an <START:ggp> LTR-CAT reporter construct <END> or the levels of <START:ggp> gag p24 <END> in the culture supernatants of <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> and <START:ana> PBMC <END> acutely infected with HIV-1 . 
Our data suggest that the <START:ggp> c-fos <END> upregulation mediated by <START:ggp> Tat <END> might play a significant role in the control of viral gene transactivation . 
<START:ggp> Cytokine signal networks <END> and a new era in biomedical research . 
Elucidation of the biochemical nature of the signal transduction pathway that regulate transcription and replication is the focus of attention in molecular biology . 
This research may make feasible manipulation of growth and differentiation of <START:ana> mammalian cells <END> , which in turn would have profound implication in biomedical research on cell and gene therapy , and development of pharmaceutical products . 
<START:ggp> Cytokines <END> control growth , differentiation , death , and function of cells of <START:ana> lymphocytic , hemopoietic systems <END> , and together with <START:ana> nerve cells <END> provide a pertinent model to study intercellular communications and intercellular signal networks . 
This review outlines general features of signal transduction and several aspects of <START:ggp> cytokine networks <END> are discussed with emphasis on : transcriptional regulation of Th1 and Th2-specific <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> , the roles of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and their receptors in growth and differentiation of <START:ana> hemopoietic cells <END> , and the manipulation of <START:ggp> cytokine networks <END> . 
Regulation of the <START:ggp> tissue factor gene <END> in <START:ana> human monocytic cells <END> . 
Role of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> , and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> proteins in uninduced and lipopolysaccharide-induced expression . 
<START:ggp> Tissue factor <END> ( TF ) expression by <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> during sepsis initiates intravascular thrombosis . 
Bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) rapidly induces <START:ggp> TF gene <END> transcription in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human TF promoter <END> contains binding sites for the transcription factors <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> c-Rel/p65 <END> , <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel proteins <END> have been shown to physically interact with both <START:ggp> AP-1 and Sp1 proteins <END> . 
In this study , we investigated the role of these <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in uninduced and LPS-induced <START:ggp> TF gene <END> expression in <START:ana> human monocytic THP-1 cells <END> . 
Deletional analysis indicated that five <START:ggp> Sp1 sites <END> mediated basal expression in <START:ana> uninduced cells <END> . 
The two <START:ggp> AP-1 sites <END> bound <START:ggp> c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers <END> in both <START:ana> unstimulated and LPS-stimulated cells <END> . 
Maximal LPS induction of the <START:ggp> TF promoter <END> required the two <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> sites and the <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> within the <START:ggp> LPS response element <END> . 
Disruption of the conserved spacing between the <START:ggp> proximal AP-1 site <END> and the <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> abolished LPS induction . 
Replacement of the two <START:ggp> AP-1 sites <END> with intrinsically bent DNA partially restored LPS induction , suggesting an additional structural role for the <START:ggp> AP-1 sites <END> . 
Synergistic transactivation of the <START:ggp> LPS response element <END> in <START:ana> Drosophila Schneider cells <END> by coexpression of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> , <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , and <START:ggp> p65 <END> or <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> p65 <END> required the <START:ggp> transactivation domains <END> of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> p65 <END> . 
These data indicated that <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> <START:ggp> /c-Jun <END> , <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> <START:ggp> /p65 <END> , and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> regulate <START:ggp> TF gene <END> expression in <START:ana> human monocytic cells <END> . 
Inhibitory effect of growth hormone on <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> secretion and <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> translocation in <START:ana> lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytes <END> . 
Several studies have pointed to a link between immune and endocrine systems , including a regulatory function of GH on monocyte activation . 
The present study demonstrates that human <START:ana> THP-1 promonocytic cells <END> , engineered by gene transfer to constitutively produce human growth hormone ( hGH ) , secreted depressed amounts of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> in response to challenge by LPS . 
The effect of GH appears to occur in an autocrine fashion , since the inhibitory effect on <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> secretion by constitutive GH production could be abolished in the presence of <START:ggp> anti-hGH mAb <END> . 
The GH-induced inhibitory effect was also observed using <START:ana> normal human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> monocyte-derived macrophages <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> production by <START:ana> THP-1-hGH-transfected cells <END> cultured in the presence of LPS is dependent on a selective pathway , since no inhibition of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> production was observed when cells were cultured in the presence of PMA . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> secretion by <START:ana> LPS-stimulated THP-1-hGH cells <END> was associated with a decrease in nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> . 
The capacity of GH to inhibit LPS-induced <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> production by <START:ana> monocytes <END> without altering other pathways leading to <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> production may be of potential relevance in septic shock , since GH is available for clinical use . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor-kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> stimulated with lipopolysaccharide is inhibited by fibroblast conditioned medium and exogenous PGE2 . 
The <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) is thought to be crucially involved in the gene activation of several <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , including <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) . 
Previously , we showed that fibroblast conditioned medium ( FCM ) is able to inhibit both <START:ana> TNF mRNA <END> accumulation and protein release in <START:ana> peripheral blood-derived human monocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBM <END> ) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . 
In this study we have investigated the effect of FCM on the LPS-induced DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , by means of electrophoretic shift assay ( EMSA ) . 
We provide evidence that FCM strongly inhibits the LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> PBM <END> . 
Furthermore , we show that exogenous PGE2 mimics the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> inhibitory effect of FCM . 
On the other hand , FCM produced in the presence of indomethacin does not inhibit <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation by LPS . 
Our results lend further support to the hypothesis that inflammatory and immune responses of <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> may be modulated at the molecular level by signals originating from <START:ana> tissue structural cells <END> such as <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
<START:ggp> Human neutrophil elastase <END> proteolytically activates the <START:ggp> platelet integrin <END> <START:ggp> alphaIIbbeta3 <END> through cleavage of the <START:ggp> carboxyl terminus <END> of the <START:ggp> alphaIIb subunit heavy chain <END> . 
Involvement in the potentiation of platelet aggregation . 
<START:ggp> Neutrophil elastase <END> ( <START:ggp> NE <END> ) and <START:ggp> cathepsin G <END> are two <START:ggp> serine proteinases <END> released concomitantly by stimulated <START:ana> polymorphonuclear neutrophils <END> . 
We previously demonstrated that while <START:ggp> NE <END> by itself does not activate <START:ana> human platelets <END> , it strongly enhances the weak aggregation induced by a threshold concentration of <START:ggp> cathepsin G <END> ( threshold of <START:ggp> cathepsin G <END> ) ( Renesto , P. , and Chignard , M. ( 1993 ) Blood 82 , 139-144 ) . 
The aim of this study was to delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in this potentiation process . 
Two main pieces of data prompted us to focus on the activation of the <START:ggp> platelet fibrinogen receptor <END> , the <START:ggp> alphaIIbbeta3 integrin <END> . 
First , previous studies have shown this <START:ggp> integrin <END> to be particularly prone to proteolytic regulation of its function . 
Second , we found that the potentiating activity of <START:ggp> NE <END> on the threshold of <START:ggp> cathepsin G <END> -induced platelet aggregation was strictly dependent on the presence of <START:ggp> exogenous fibrinogen <END> . 
Using flow cytometry analysis , <START:ggp> NE <END> was shown to trigger a time-dependent binding of <START:ggp> PAC-1 <END> and <START:ggp> AP-5 <END> , two <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> specific for the activated and ligand-occupied conformers of <START:ggp> alphaIIbbeta3 <END> . 
Furthermore , the potentiated aggregation was shown to result from an increased capacity of platelets to bind fibrinogen . 
Indeed , the combination of <START:ggp> NE <END> and threshold of <START:ggp> cathepsin G <END> increased the binding of <START:ggp> PAC-1 <END> approximately 5.5-fold over basal values measured on <START:ana> nontreated platelets <END> , whereas this binding raised only by approximately 3-fold in threshold of <START:ana> cathepsin G-stimulated platelets <END> ( p < 0.05 ) . 
By contrast , phosphatidic acid accumulation , pleckstrin phosphorylation , and calcium mobilization produced by the combination of <START:ggp> NE <END> and threshold of <START:ggp> cathepsin G <END> were not significantly different from those measured with threshold of <START:ggp> cathepsin G <END> alone ( p > 0.05 ) , indicating that the <START:ggp> phospholipase C <END> <START:ggp> /protein kinase C <END> pathway is not involved in the potentiation of aggregation . 
The foregoing data , as well as the requirement of catalytically active <START:ggp> NE <END> to trigger <START:ggp> alphaIIbbeta3 <END> activation and potentiate threshold of <START:ggp> cathepsin G <END> -initiated platelet aggregation , led us to examine whether the structure of this <START:ggp> integrin <END> was affected by <START:ggp> NE <END> . 
Immunoblot and flow cytometry analysis revealed a limited proteolysis of the <START:ggp> carboxyl terminus <END> of the <START:ggp> alphaIIb subunit heavy chain <END> ( <START:ggp> alphaIIbH <END> ) , as judged by the disappearance of the epitope for the <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody PMI-1 <END> . 
Mass spectrometry studies performed on a synthetic peptide mapping over the <START:ggp> cleavage domain <END> of <START:ggp> alphaIIbH <END> predicted the site of proteolysis as located between Val837 and Asp838 . 
Treatment by <START:ggp> NE <END> of <START:ana> ATP-depleted platelets <END> or <START:ana> Chinese hamster ovary cells <END> expressing <START:ggp> human recombinant alphaIIbbeta3 <END> clearly established that activation of the <START:ggp> integrin <END> was independent of signal transduction events and was concomitant with the proteolysis of <START:ggp> alphaIIbH <END> . 
<START:ggp> AP-1 <END> derived from <START:ana> mature monocytes <END> and <START:ana> astrocytes <END> preferentially interacts with the <START:ggp> HTLV-I promoter <END> central <START:ggp> 21 bp repeat <END> . 
Characterization of the cellular <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> interacting with the <START:ggp> human T cell lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) is essential to dissecting the mechanisms involved in viral transcription that may be pertinent to the oncogenic and neuropathogenic processes associated with HTLV-I infection in both the immune and nervous systems . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift ( EMS ) analyses utilizing oligonucleotides homologous to each of the <START:ggp> 21 bp repeat elements <END> reacted with nuclear extracts derived from <START:ana> cell lines <END> of <START:ana> lymphocytic , monocytic , neuronal , and glial cell origin <END> have demonstrated differential binding of <START:ggp> cellular factors <END> to the three <START:ggp> 21 bp repeats <END> ( 1-4 ) . 
<START:ggp> ATF/CREB <END> and <START:ggp> Sp family members <END> interacted with the <START:ggp> 21 bp repeats <END> to form <START:ggp> DNA-protein complexes <END> common to all cell types examined . 
However , a unique <START:ggp> DNA-protein complex <END> was detected when the promoter central <START:ggp> 21 bp repeat <END> was reacted with nuclear extracts derived from either the <START:ana> U-373 MG glioblastoma cell line <END> or the <START:ana> THP-1 mature monocytic cell line <END> . 
Based on nucleotide sequence requirements and immunoreactivity , we demonstrate that this <START:ggp> DNA-protein complex <END> is comprised of the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> components , <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> . 
HIV does not replicate in <START:ana> naive CD4 T cells <END> stimulated with <START:ggp> CD3/CD28 <END> . 
In this report , we demonstrate that the T cell tropic strain of HIV , LAI , does not replicate in <START:ana> naive CD4 T cells <END> stimulated by cross-linking <START:ggp> CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> . 
In contrast , LAI replicates well in <START:ana> memory CD4 T cells <END> stimulated in the same way . 
Unlike this physiologically relevant stimulation , <START:ggp> PHA <END> stimulates productive LAI replication in both <START:ana> naive and memory T cells <END> . 
These studies were conducted with highly purified ( FACS-isolated ) subsets of <START:ana> CD4 T cells <END> identified by expression of both <START:ggp> CD45RA <END> and <START:ggp> CD62L <END> . 
Remixing of <START:ana> purified T cells <END> showed that <START:ana> naive T cells <END> do not suppress LAI replication in <START:ana> memory T cells <END> and that <START:ana> memory T cells <END> do not restore LAI expression in <START:ana> naive T cells <END> . 
The suppression of productive LAI replication in <START:ana> naive T cells <END> is not due to differential expression of <START:ggp> viral coreceptors <END> , nor is it due to inhibition of activation of the important HIV <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> . 
The inherent resistance of <START:ana> naive T cells <END> to productive HIV infection , coupled with their proliferative advantage as demonstrated here , provides a sound basis for proposed clinical therapies using ex vivo expansion and reinfusion of <START:ana> CD4 T cells <END> from HIV-infected adults . 
A <START:ggp> PMLRARalpha transgene <END> initiates murine acute promyelocytic leukemia . 
The <START:ana> malignant cells <END> of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) contain a reciprocal chromosomal translocation that fuses the <START:ggp> promyelocytic leukemia gene <END> ( PML ) with the <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor alpha gene <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR alpha <END> ) . 
To test the hypothesis that the <START:ggp> chimera PMLRAR alpha <END> plays a role in leukemogenesis , we expressed a <START:ggp> PMLRAR alpha cDNA <END> in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> of transgenic mice . 
PMLRAR alpha transgenic mice exhibited impaired neutrophil maturation early in life , which progressed at a low frequency over the course of several months to overt APL . 
Both the preleukemic state and the leukemia could be transplanted to nontransgenic mice , and the transplanted preleukemia could progress to APL . 
The APL recapitulated features of the human disease , including a response to retinoic acid . 
Retinoic acid caused the <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> to differentiate in vitro and in vivo , eliciting remissions of both the preleukemic state and APL in mice . 
Our results demonstrate that <START:ggp> PMLRAR alpha <END> impairs neutrophil differentiation and initiates the development of APL . 
The transgenic mice described here provide an apparently accurate model for human APL that includes clear evidence of tumor progression . 
The model should be useful for exploring the molecular pathogenesis of APL and the mechanisms of the therapeutic response to retinoic acid , as well as for preclinical studies of therapeutic regimens . 
DNA methylation changes in hematologic malignancies : biologic and clinical implications . 
DNA methylation changes are among the most common detectable abnormalities in human neoplasia . 
Hypermethylation within the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of selected genes appears to be especially common in all types of <START:ana> human hematopoietic neoplasms <END> , and is usually associated with inactivation of the involved gene ( s ) . 
Such hypermethylation-associated silencing of gene expression has been shown for several genes regulating the growth and differentiation of <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> , including the <START:ggp> estrogen receptor ( ER ) gene <END> , P15 , P16 and others . 
Hypermethylation within the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of some genes appear to be an early event in the pathogenesis of neoplasia ( <START:ggp> ER <END> , <START:ggp> P15 <END> ) , while other genes seem to become methylated during the progression of leukemias ( HIC1 , c-abl ) . 
The high prevalence of promoter methylation suggests that this molecular abnormality can be used to monitor disease activity during therapy . 
In addition , new technology allows the sensitive identification of gene hypermethylation in a background of <START:ana> normal cells <END> , suggesting possible new strategies for the detection of minimal residual disease . 
Finally , reactivation of tumor-suppressor gene expression through pharmacologic inhibition of <START:ggp> DNA methyltransferase <END> and resultant DNA demethylation appears to be a promising new avenue of therapy in acute leukemia . 
Redox regulation of the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> pathway during lymphocyte activation . 
We have previously demonstrated an obligatory requirement for intracellular reactive oxygen species generation during T lymphocyte activation , and have proposed that intracellular reactive oxygen species may act as signalling agents in the regulation of certain cellular processes , for example , during cell cycle entry . 
To test this hypothesis , we have been interested to determine which , if any , cell cycle entry events are affected by oxidative signalling . 
In earlier studies , we have identified the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> as molecular targets for oxidative signalling processes during cell cycle entry , and have shown that oxidative signalling is involved in the regulation of early changes in gene expression during the G0 to G1 phase transition . 
To extend these initial observations , we have examined the effect of antioxidant treatment on the activity of the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinases <END> <START:ggp> erk1 <END> and <START:ggp> erk2 <END> , as members of a signal transduction pathway known to directly regulate transcription factor function . 
Using as a probe cysteamine , an aminothiol compound with both antioxidant and antiproliferative activity , we have identified <START:ggp> erk2 <END> , a key element of the MAP kinase pathway , as being responsive to oxidative signalling during lymphocyte activation . 
These observations provide further evidence to suggest a role for intracellular oxidant generation as a regulatory mechanism during cell cycle entry , and establish a link between oxidative signalling and other aspects of the intracellular signalling network that is activated in response to mitogenic stimulation . 
Physical and functional interaction between the <START:ggp> human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax1 protein <END> and the <START:ggp> CCAAT binding protein <END> <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tax1 <END> , a potent activator of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) transcription , has been shown to modulate expression of many <START:ggp> cellular genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tax1 <END> does not bind DNA directly but regulates transcription through protein-protein interactions with <START:ggp> sequence-specific transcription factors <END> . 
Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins which interact with <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> , we isolated the <START:ggp> B subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> CCAAT binding protein <END> <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> from a <START:ggp> HeLa cDNA library <END> . 
The interaction of <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> with <START:ggp> NF-YB <END> was specific in that <START:ggp> NF-YB <END> did not interact with a variety of other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , including <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus Tat <END> , <START:ggp> human papillomavirus E6 <END> , and <START:ggp> Bicoid <END> , or with the <START:ggp> M7 ( amino acids 29CP-AS ) Tax1 mutant <END> . 
However , <START:ggp> NF-YB <END> did interact with the <START:ggp> C-terminal Tax1 mutants <END> <START:ggp> M22 <END> ( <START:ggp> 130TL-AS <END> ) and <START:ggp> M47 <END> ( <START:ggp> 319LL-RS <END> ) . 
We also show that in vitro-translated <START:ggp> NF-YB <END> specifically bound to a <START:ggp> glutathione S-transferase-Tax1 fusion protein <END> . 
Further , <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> coimmunoprecipitated with <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> from nuclear extracts of <START:ana> HTLV-1-transformed cells <END> , providing evidence for in vivo interaction of <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-YB <END> . 
We further demonstrate that <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> specifically activated the <START:ggp> NF-Y-responsive DQbeta promoter <END> , as well as a <START:ggp> minimal promoter <END> which contains only the <START:ggp> Y-box element <END> . 
In addition , mutation of the <START:ggp> Y-box element <END> alone abrogated <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> -mediated activation . 
Taken together , these data indicate that <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> interacts with <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> through the <START:ggp> B subunit <END> and that this interaction results in activation of the <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex class II promoter <END> . 
Through activation of this and other <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> driven <START:ggp> promoters <END> , the <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> <START:ggp> -NF-Y <END> interaction may play a critical role in causing cellular transformation and HTLV-1 pathogenesis . 
High levels of the DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> E2F <END> in adult T-cell leukemia and <START:ana> human T-cell leukemia virus type I-infected cells <END> : possible enhancement of DNA-binding of <START:ggp> E2F <END> by the <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus I transactivating protein <END> , <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> E2F <END> binds to <START:ggp> cellular promoters <END> of certain <START:ggp> growth- and cell cycle-controlling genes <END> and forms distinct <START:ggp> heteromeric complexes <END> with other <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> . 
It has therefore been proposed that <START:ggp> E2F <END> is involved in cellular proliferation control . 
Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is an etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) . 
We show here by mobility-shift assay that <START:ggp> E2F-containing DNA-binding complexes <END> were detected in <START:ana> HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines <END> and <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> obtained from ATL patients but not in an <START:ana> uninfected T-cell line <END> , <START:ana> Jurkat <END> , and <START:ana> normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Tax protein <END> , encoded by HTLV-I , is a potent transcription activator of viral and several <START:ggp> cellular genes <END> . 
We demonstrate that expression of <START:ggp> Tax <END> can induce the <START:ggp> E2F-containing DNA-binding complexes <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> Tax <END> , through enhancement of the DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> E2F <END> , may be capable of regulating cellular gene expression implicated in the proliferation and transformation of <START:ana> T cells <END> in ATL . 
This activity may be relevant to the mechanisms whereby HTLV-I which does not contain <START:ggp> oncogenes <END> induces neoplasia . 
Dissociation of the <START:ggp> Jak kinase <END> pathway from <START:ggp> G-CSF receptor <END> signaling in neutrophils . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> G-CSFR <END> ) induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple <START:ggp> intracellular substrates <END> in <START:ana> proliferating cells <END> and <START:ana> nonproliferating , terminally differentiated neutrophils <END> . 
The kinases that couple ligand binding to tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> cellular substrates <END> by the G-CSFR with activation of specific functional programs are largely unknown . 
In this study , we examined early signaling events in <START:ana> proliferating <END> and <START:ana> terminally differentiated cells <END> following <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> stimulation to determine whether identical signaling cascades are activated . 
In <START:ana> murine Ba/F3 cells <END> transfected with the <START:ggp> human G-CSFR <END> and <START:ana> NFS-60 cells <END> constitutively expressing the <START:ggp> murine G-CSFR <END> , <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> , <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> , and <START:ggp> Tyk2 <END> . 
Tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> and , to a lesser extent , <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> was also detected following <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> stimulation . 
Using a <START:ggp> mitogenically incompetent human G-CSFR mutant <END> in which Pro639 and Pro641 were substituted by alanine , the <START:ggp> box 1 PDP motif <END> was found to be required for activation of <START:ggp> Jak kinases <END> , tyrosine phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> G-CSFR <END> , and recruitment of <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> . 
Notably , no activation of <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> , <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> , <START:ggp> Tyk2 <END> , <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> , or <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> was observed in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> following <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> stimulation . 
In addition , there was no detectable activation in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> of the recently cloned <START:ggp> Jak3 kinase <END> , which has been reported to be expressed at high levels as <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> undergo terminal neutrophilic maturation . 
These results indicate a lack of involvement of <START:ggp> Jak kinases <END> in signaling by the <START:ggp> G-CSFR <END> in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> , and suggest utilization of alternative signal transduction pathways distinct from those in <START:ana> proliferating cells <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> Jak <END> <START:ggp> -Stat <END> pathway correlates with proliferative signaling by the <START:ggp> G-CSFR <END> and requires the <START:ggp> membrane-proximal box 1 PXP motif <END> , which is conserved in members of the <START:ggp> cytokine receptor superfamily <END> . 
Impaired induction of <START:ggp> c-fos/c-jun genes <END> and of <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory proteins <END> binding distinct <START:ggp> c-fos/c-jun promoter elements <END> in <START:ana> activated human T cells <END> during aging . 
The activation of <START:ggp> transcriptional factor <END> c-Fos/c-Jun <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> is essential for normal <START:ana> T cell <END> responsiveness and is often impaired in <START:ana> T cells <END> during aging . 
In the present study , we investigated whether aberrancies in the regulation of <START:ggp> c-fos/c-jun <END> at the mRNA or protein level might underlie the age-associated impairments of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
Whereas <START:ana> T cells <END> from young subjects stimulated with <START:ggp> cross-linked anti-CD3epsilon mAb <END> <START:ggp> OKT3 <END> plus PMA or with the <START:ggp> lectin <END> <START:ggp> PHA <END> plus PMA demonstrated considerable increases in <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> protein expression , the expression of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> but not <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> was markedly reduced in stimulated <START:ana> T cells <END> from certain elderly subjects . 
In addition , <START:ggp> RNase <END> protection assays revealed that anti-CD3/ <START:ana> PMA-stimulated T cells <END> from a substantial proportion of elderly subjects exhibited decreased levels of <START:ana> c-fos and/or c-jun mRNA <END> compared to <START:ana> T cells <END> from young subjects . 
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , the levels of <START:ggp> nuclear regulatory proteins <END> recognizing the <START:ggp> AP-1 consensus TRE motif <END> , the <START:ggp> proximal c-jun TRE-like promoter element <END> , and the <START:ggp> c-fos serum response element <END> ( <START:ggp> SRE <END> ) were determined in <START:ana> resting and stimulated T cells <END> . 
Although the stimulation of <START:ana> T cells <END> from young subjects resulted in coordinated increases of <START:ggp> nuclear protein complexes <END> binding the <START:ggp> AP-1 TRE <END> , <START:ggp> c-jun TRE <END> , and <START:ggp> c-fos SRE DNA sequence motifs <END> , age-related reductions in the activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> were accompanied by decreased levels of <START:ggp> c-jun TRE and c-fos SRE binding complexes <END> . 
Furthermore , the <START:ggp> nuclear protein complexes <END> binding the <START:ggp> SRE motif <END> induced in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> of young and elderly subjects contained <START:ggp> serum response factor <END> and <START:ggp> Elk-1 <END> pointing toward age-related defects in the activation of <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory proteins <END> distinct from <START:ggp> c-jun/AP-1 <END> . 
These results suggest that underlying aberrancies in the induction of <START:ggp> c-fos/c-jun <END> as well as their <START:ggp> nuclear regulatory proteins <END> may contribute to the age-related impairments of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activation in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
Retinoic acid-induced modulation of <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> production and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> receptor expression on <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
BACKGROUND : Retinoic acid ( RA ) has important immune-modulating effects on both T and B cell function . 
Our laboratory has shown that RA can enhance in vitro polyclonal B cell <START:ggp> immunoglobulin <END> ( Ig ) response . 
Investigating <START:ggp> cytokines <END> known to affect B cell differentiation , we have recently shown that <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> production is augmented by RA . 
In the present study we have examined the immune modulating effects of RA on <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> , another important <START:ggp> cytokine <END> for B cell <START:ggp> immunoglobulin <END> production , the expression of <START:ggp> IL-2 receptors <END> on <START:ana> T cells <END> , and the <START:ggp> RA nuclear receptors <END> . 
METHODS : Purified <START:ana> T cells <END> were obtained from adenoidal tissues , and incubated with RA ( 10 ( -7 ) M ) or DMSO solvent/media control for 0 , 6-8 , and 24 h . 
Total <START:ana> mRNA <END> was extracted from <START:ana> T cells <END> , and using RT-PCR , changes in the production of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> RA receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR <END> ) - <START:ana> alpha <END> , <START:ana> beta <END> , <START:ana> gamma mRNA <END> were determined . 
The effects of RA on IL-2-alpha receptor expression was determined by flow cytometry on <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
CONCLUSION : These studies suggest that RA can augment <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> production by <START:ana> T cells <END> with a possible paracrine effect on <START:ggp> IL-2R-alpha <END> expression . 
These changes appear to be mediated by <START:ggp> RAR-alpha <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> may be another important <START:ggp> cytokine <END> modulated by RA in the immune response . 
Involvement of an <START:ggp> SAF-like transcription factor <END> in the activation of <START:ggp> serum amyloid A gene <END> in <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage cells <END> by lipopolysaccharide . 
<START:ggp> Serum amyloid A <END> ( <START:ggp> SAA <END> ) has been linked to atherosclerosis because of its ability to remodel high-density lipoprotein by the depletion of apolipoprotein A1 , its ability to bind cholesterol , and its presence in the atherosclerotic plaques of coronary and carotid arteries . 
In the present study , we investigated the induction mechanism of <START:ggp> SAA gene <END> in <START:ana> THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cells <END> which play a critical role in the development of atherosclerotic fatty streak and plaque formation . 
We and others have shown that <START:ggp> SAA <END> gene is induced in <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage cells <END> by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . 
By promoter function analysis , we show that the <START:ggp> SAA promoter sequence <END> between -280 and -226 can confer LPS responsiveness . 
Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay detected an induced DNA-binding activity in these cells in response to LPS . 
Characterization of the <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> by UV cross-linking , Southwestern blot , and antibody ablation/supershift assays revealed that it is similar to a recently reported <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> designated <START:ggp> SAF <END> . 
These results demonstrated that LPS-mediated <START:ggp> SAA <END> gene induction in <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage cells <END> is primarily due to the induction of <START:ggp> SAF <END> activity . 
<START:ggp> Cytomegalovirus immediate early genes <END> upregulate <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> gene expression . 
BACKGROUND : The <START:ggp> immediate early genes <END> ( <START:ggp> IE <END> ) of human cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) can be expressed in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> and are known to regulate <START:ggp> viral and cellular genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-6 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ) plays a central role in numerous inflammatory and immune processes . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-6 <END> levels are increased in lung transplant patients clinically diagnosed with CMV pneumonitis . 
The regulation of <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> is dependent on various stimuli that include lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , viruses , and other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
These studies examined the ability of CMV IE gene products to modulate <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> production . 
METHODS : <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> , a <START:ana> monocytic cell line <END> , were transfected with the <START:ggp> CMV IE genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-6 <END> protein and <START:ana> IL-6 mRNA <END> were measured in control and <START:ana> CMV immediate early transfected cells <END> . 
Cotransfection of <START:ggp> CMV IE genes <END> and <START:ggp> IL-6 chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) or IL-6 luciferase constructs <END> were used to study <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> promoter activity . 
RESULTS : <START:ggp> Interleukin-6 protein <END> and mRNA production were significantly increased in cells transfected with the <START:ggp> CMV IE genes <END> and stimulated with LPS compared to <START:ana> LPS-stimulated control cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Cytomegalovirus IE gene products <END> significantly enhanced LPS stimulation of <START:ggp> IL-6 promoter <END> activity in both <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> CAT and IL-6 luciferase assays . 
A deletion construct that contains a <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> but is missing the multiple response region demonstrated a continued increase in <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> <START:ggp> luciferase <END> activity in <START:ana> LPS-stimulated CMV transfected cells <END> . 
CONCLUSION : <START:ggp> Cytomegalovirus immediate early gene products <END> significantly enhanced expression of <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> in LPS-stimulated cells . 
The increase in <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> <START:ggp> luciferase <END> activity occurs in the absence of the multiple response region , the area of the <START:ggp> IL-6 promoter <END> responsive to <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> , <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> , cyclic amp , and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate . 
The ability of <START:ggp> CMV IE gene products <END> to enhance <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> production may play an important role in immune inflammatory states associated with CMV infection . 
Induction of <START:ggp> relA ( p65 ) <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha subunit <END> expression during differentiation of <START:ana> human peripheral blood monocytes <END> to <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
We evaluated the expression and DNA binding activity of <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B subunits <END> in <START:ana> human peripheral blood monocytes <END> and in <START:ana> monocyte-derived macrophages <END> ( <START:ana> MDMs <END> ) . 
Constitutive DNA binding activity consisting of <START:ggp> p50 homodimers <END> was detected in nuclear extracts from both cell types . 
An additional complex composed of <START:ggp> p50/RelA ( p65 ) heterodimers <END> appeared only in nuclear extracts from 7-day <START:ana> MDMs <END> . 
Immunoblot analysis showed that the p50 subunit was constitutively expressed in <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> MDMs <END> . 
In contrast , the <START:ggp> RelA ( p65 ) subunit <END> was barely detectable in <START:ana> monocytes <END> , but its level increased markedly in <START:ana> MDMs <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ana> RelA ( p65 ) mRNA <END> revealed that the stability of <START:ana> RelA ( p65 ) mRNA <END> was significantly higher in <START:ana> MDMs <END> , compared with <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
In <START:ana> MDMs <END> , an upregulation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> synthesis as well as the appearance of a novel M ( r ) 40 , 000 form of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> were also observed . 
These results suggest that macrophage differentiation results in the expression of active <START:ggp> p50/RelA ( p65 ) heterodimers <END> with the capacity to activate target gene expression . 
The parallel induction of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> synthesis may allow for the continuous presence of a cytoplasmic reservoir of <START:ggp> p50/RelA ( p65 ) complexes <END> that are readily available for inducer-mediated stimulation . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear Rel-A and c-Rel protein complexes <END> are differentially distributed within <START:ana> human thymocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) /Rel proteins <END> are inducible <START:ggp> transcriptional regulators <END> of numerous <START:ggp> cellular genes <END> . 
They are particularly abundant in lymphoid tissues and are thought to be critical for the transcription of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses . 
We have reported previously that a nuclear <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity was present in freshly extracted <START:ana> human thymocytes <END> in the absence of in vitro treatment of these cells . 
In the present report , we identified <START:ggp> NF-kappa B proteins <END> extracted from human thymocyte nuclei as being <START:ggp> p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel complexes <END> . 
Immunochemical and immunofluorescent staining of thymus sections using <START:ggp> specific Abs <END> allowed visualization of <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kappa B proteins <END> in both <START:ana> thymocytes <END> and <START:ana> nonthymocyte cells <END> . 
This detection suggested a preferential activation of <START:ggp> p50/c-Rel <END> in <START:ana> medullary thymocytes <END> , whereas <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> was present in both cortical and medullary regions of human thymus lobules . 
However , the intensity of <START:ggp> p65 <END> labeling was much higher in several <START:ana> thymocytes <END> from the medulla . 
p65 , p50 , and c-Rel activities were found in both <START:ana> CD4- and CD8-positive thymocytes <END> . 
These observations suggest that <START:ggp> p65 and c-Rel complexes <END> play distinct roles in gene expression and that both forms of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> play critical roles during late stages of the intrathymic maturation of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> ALY <END> , a <START:ggp> context-dependent coactivator <END> of <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> AML-1 <END> , is required for <START:ggp> TCRalpha enhancer <END> function . 
<START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> is a transcription factor that participates in the regulation of the <START:ggp> T-cell receptor alpha ( TCR alpha ) enhancer <END> by facilitating the assembly of <START:ggp> multiple proteins <END> into a higher order <START:ggp> nucleoprotein complex <END> . 
The function of <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> is dependent , in part , on the <START:ggp> HMG domain <END> that induces a sharp bend in the DNA helix , and on an <START:ggp> activation domain <END> that stimulates transcription only in a specific context of other <START:ggp> enhancer-binding proteins <END> . 
With the aim of gaining insight into the function of <START:ggp> context-dependent activation domains <END> , we cloned <START:ggp> ALY <END> , a novel <START:ggp> LEF-1-interacting protein <END> . 
<START:ggp> ALY <END> is a ubiquitously expressed , nuclear protein that specifically associates with the <START:ggp> activation domains <END> of <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> AML-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> CBF alpha2 <END> , <START:ggp> PEBP2 alpha <END> ( B ) , which is another protein component of the <START:ggp> TCR alpha enhancer complex <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> ALY <END> can increase DNA binding by both <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> AML proteins <END> . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> ALY <END> stimulates the activity of the <START:ggp> TCR alpha enhancer complex <END> reconstituted in <START:ana> transfected nonlymphoid HeLa cells <END> , whereas down-regulation of <START:ggp> ALY <END> by anti-sense oligonucleotides virtually eliminates <START:ggp> TCR alpha enhancer <END> activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Similar to <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> , <START:ggp> ALY <END> can stimulate transcription in the context of the <START:ggp> TCR alpha enhancer <END> but apparently not when tethered to DNA through an <START:ggp> heterologous DNA-binding domain <END> . 
We propose that <START:ggp> ALY <END> mediates context-dependent transcriptional activation by facilitating the functional collaboration of <START:ggp> multiple proteins <END> in the <START:ggp> TCR alpha enhancer complex <END> . 
<START:ggp> AML1a <END> but not <START:ggp> AML1b <END> inhibits erythroid differentiation induced by sodium butyrate and enhances the megakaryocytic differentiation of <START:ana> K562 leukemia cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> AML1 <END> may play a role in growth and differentiation of cells along <START:ana> erythroid and/or megakaryocytic lineages <END> , because a significant level of the <START:ggp> AML1 <END> gene is expressed in these cells . 
We overexpressed <START:ggp> AML1a <END> ( without the <START:ggp> transcription-activating domain <END> ) and <START:ggp> AML1b <END> ( with the domain ) proteins in <START:ana> K562 leukemia cells <END> , which can be induced to differentiate into <START:ana> hemoglobin-producing cells <END> and <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> . 
The <START:ana> AML1a-transfected K562 cells <END> had a reduced capacity to differentiate in the presence of sodium n-butyrate but not in the presence of other inducers , such as hemin , 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine , and herbimycin A . 
The <START:ggp> AML1 <END> antisense oligodeoxynucleotide but not the sense oligomer recovered its differentiation-inducing capacity in the presence of butyrate . 
On the other hand , <START:ggp> AML1b <END> conferred a similar differentiation-inducing capacity upon <START:ana> K562 cells <END> transfected with vector alone . 
<START:ggp> AML1a <END> expression was associated with enhanced sensitivity to megakaryocytic differentiation induced by phorbol ester . 
These results provide evidence that <START:ggp> AML1 <END> proteins play a role in erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation . 
Identification of sequence alterations in the <START:ggp> upstream regulatory region <END> of the <START:ggp> estrogen receptor gene <END> in an <START:ana> ER-negative breast cancer cell line <END> . 
Given the important role of the <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) in the development and physiology of the breast , it is essential to delineate the mechanisms responsible for its failed expression in some breast tumors . 
We have cloned and sequenced a portion of the <START:ggp> ER <END> <START:ggp> upstream regulatory region <END> from the <START:ana> ER-positive MCF-7 <END> and the <START:ana> ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines <END> to determine if sequence alterations in this region account for the <START:ggp> ER <END> -negative phenotype of some tumors . 
From this , we identified a number of variations between the sequences , two of which were determined to be associated with a 50 % decrease in <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity . 
Suppression by azelastine hydrochloride of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation involved in generation of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and nitric oxide . 
The influence of the anti-allergy agent azelastine hydrochloride ( Azeptin ) on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation associated with the generation of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and nitric oxide ( NO ) was investigated in various kinds of <START:ana> human and mouse cells <END> . 
Azeptin dose-dependently suppressed both DNA and protein synthesis in <START:ana> human gingival fibroblasts <END> ( <START:ana> HF <END> ) and also suppressed blastogenesis of <START:ana> human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBL <END> ) . Generation of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin 1-beta <END> , <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> from 10 ( -5 ) M Azeptin-treated <START:ana> PBL <END> and <START:ana> human monocytes <END> ( <START:ana> HM <END> ) was decreased to approximately 1/3 to 2/3 of the control levels . 
In parallel with the decreased <START:ggp> cytokine <END> generation , each <START:ana> cytokine mRNA <END> was less expressed in the presence of 10 ( -5 ) M Azeptin . 
In addition , both inducible <START:ggp> nitric oxide synthase <END> -mRNA level and NO generation in <START:ana> mouse peritoneal macrophages <END> were suppressed by 10 ( -5 ) M Azeptin . 
Being compatible with those results , Azeptin ( 10 ( -5 ) M ) suppressed activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> PBL <END> , HM and <START:ana> HF <END> . 
These results appear to indicate that suppression of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> and NO generation by Azeptin results at least partially from the inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
Differential interaction of nuclear factors with the <START:ggp> PRE-I enhancer element <END> of the <START:ggp> human IL-4 promoter <END> in different <START:ana> T cell subsets <END> . 
The immunomodulatory <START:ggp> cytokine <END> <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> affects cells of most <START:ana> hemopoietic lineages <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> is secreted by activated <START:ana> Th2 <END> but not <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> and plays a major role in the immune response by modulating the differentiation of <START:ana> naive Th cells <END> toward the <START:ana> Th2 phenotype <END> . 
We have previously identified an <START:ggp> enhancer element <END> , <START:ggp> PRE-I <END> , that is essential for the function of the <START:ggp> human IL-4 promoter <END> . 
To investigate the mechanisms responsible for tissue-specific expression of the <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> gene , we analyzed <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> binding to the <START:ggp> PRE-I site <END> and compared the binding activities of these factors to the <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> promoter of <START:ana> Th1 and Th2 cells <END> . 
We show that <START:ggp> PRE-I <END> interacts with PMA -and PMA/ionomycin-inducible , cyclosporin A-sensitive <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> . 
Using <START:ggp> anti-C/EBPbeta <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> ) , <START:ggp> anti-C/EBPdelta <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-IL6beta <END> ) , <START:ggp> anti-NF-ATc <END> , <START:ggp> anti-NF-ATp <END> , <START:ggp> anti-Fos <END> , and <START:ggp> anti-Jun Abs <END> we demonstrate that the previously identified <START:ggp> PRE-I binding factor <END> <START:ggp> POS-1 <END> is composed of different <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in different Th cell subsets . 
In the <START:ana> IL-4-producing Th0-like human Jurkat <END> and <START:ana> mouse EL-4 cells <END> , <START:ggp> POS-1 <END> ( designated <START:ggp> POS-1a <END> ) contains <START:ggp> NF-IL6beta <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> . 
In the <START:ana> mouse Th2 D10 cells <END> and in the <START:ana> human Th2 clones <END> , <START:ggp> POS-1 <END> ( designated <START:ggp> POS-1b <END> ) contains <START:ggp> NF-IL6beta <END> , <START:ggp> Jun <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-ATc/p <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> POS-1 <END> was not found in nuclear extracts of <START:ana> human Th1 clones <END> . 
These findings suggest that <START:ggp> PRE-I <END> may play a role in the differential regulation of <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> expression levels . 
Regulation of human epsilon <START:ggp> germline <END> transcription : role of <START:ggp> B-cell-specific activator protein <END> . 
<START:ggp> Germline transcripts <END> initiate from <START:ggp> promoters <END> upstream of the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin switch region <END> , and are necessary to target the appropriate switch region for recombination and switching . 
Different <START:ggp> cytokines <END> activate transcription at the appropriate <START:ggp> germline promoter <END> . 
Because <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> B-cell-specific activator protein <END> ( <START:ggp> BSAP <END> ) are located upstream of several switch regions in the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy chain gene cluster <END> , <START:ggp> BSAP <END> might play a role in the regulation of <START:ggp> germline <END> transcription and isotype switching . 
We investigated whether <START:ggp> BSAP <END> plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of the epsilon <START:ggp> germline promoter <END> in <START:ana> human B cells <END> . 
Our results showed that <START:ggp> BSAP <END> plays a role in both <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -dependent induction and <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -mediated upregulation of human epsilon <START:ggp> germline <END> transcription . 
<START:ggp> BSAP <END> is unique among the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that regulate epsilon <START:ggp> germline <END> expression , because it is B cell specific , and is at the merging point of two signalling pathways that are critical for <START:ggp> IgE <END> switching . 
Experimental expression in mice and spontaneous expression in human SLE of <START:ggp> polyomavirus T-antigen <END> . 
A molecular basis for induction of <START:ggp> antibodies <END> to DNA and <START:ggp> eukaryotic transcription factors <END> . 
We have previously demonstrated that experimental expression of the <START:ggp> polyomavirus transcription factor T-antigen <END> has the potential to induce <START:ggp> anti-DNA antibodies <END> in mice . 
Two sets of independent evidences are presented here that demonstrate a biological relevance for this model . 
First , we describe results demonstrating that mice inoculated with <START:ggp> T-antigen-expressing plasmids <END> produced <START:ggp> antibodies <END> , not only to <START:ggp> T-antigen <END> and DNA , but also to the <START:ggp> DNA-binding eukaryotic transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> TATA-binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> TBP <END> ) , and to the <START:ggp> cAMP-response-element-binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> CREB <END> ) . 
Secondly , we investigated whether polyomavirus reactivation occurs in SLE patients , and whether <START:ggp> antibodies <END> to <START:ggp> T-antigen <END> , DNA , and to <START:ggp> TBP <END> and <START:ggp> CREB <END> are linked to such events . 
Both within and among these SLE patients , frequent polyomavirus reactivations were observed that could not be explained by certain rearrangements of the noncoding control regions , nor by corticosteroid treatment . 
Linked to these events , <START:ggp> antibodies <END> to <START:ggp> T-antigen <END> , DNA , <START:ggp> TBP <END> , and <START:ggp> CREB <END> were detected , identical to what we observed in mice . 
Antibodies recognizing double-stranded DNA were confined to patients with frequent polyomavirus reactivations . 
The results described here indicate that cognate interaction of B cells recognizing DNA or <START:ggp> DNA-associated proteins <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> recognizing <START:ggp> T antigen <END> had taken place as a consequence of complex formation between <START:ggp> T ag <END> and DNA in vivo in the context of polyomavirus reactivations . 
<START:ggp> Jak3 <END> is associated with <START:ggp> CD40 <END> and is critical for <START:ggp> CD40 <END> induction of gene expression in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> is a receptor that is critical for the survival , growth , differentiation , and isotype switching of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> CD40 <END> lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , its ligation induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation , which is necessary for several <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -mediated events . 
We show that engagement of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> as well as of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Jak3 <END> is constitutively associated with <START:ggp> CD40 <END> , and this interaction requires a <START:ggp> proline-rich sequence <END> in the <START:ggp> membrane-proximal region <END> of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> . 
Deletion of this sequence abolishes the capacity of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> to induce expression of <START:ggp> CD23 <END> , <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> lymphotoxin-alpha genes <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
These results indicate that signaling through <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> is activated by <START:ggp> CD40 <END> and plays an important role in <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -mediated functions . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factors <END> required for lymphoid lineage commitment . 
Intimate interactions between multipotential <START:ana> hemopoietic stem cells <END> and their microenvironment work towards redefining the identity and the differentiative fate of these <START:ana> primitive cells <END> . 
Molecular cues delivered by the microenvironment frequently act in an instructive fashion by initiating intracellular signaling pathways that ultimately target a select group of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
These transcriptional regulators in turn trigger a cascade of genetic changes that ultimately determine the course of the cells during differentiation . 
Gene inactivation studies on the <START:ggp> PU.1 , Ikaros and GATA-3 genes <END> have revealed that their encoded factors are essential for the earliest commitment step into the <START:ana> B and T lymphoid lineages <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-4 <END> signaling in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> from patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) is an important cytokine for B and T lymphocyte function and mediates its effects via a receptor that contains <START:ggp> gammac <END> . 
<START:ana> B cells <END> derived from patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( X-SCID ) are deficient in gammac and provide a useful model in which to dissect the role of this subunit in <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -mediated signaling . 
We found that although <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> stimulation of <START:ana> X-SCID B cells <END> did not result in <START:ggp> Janus tyrosine kinase-3 <END> ( <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> ) phosphorylation , other <START:ggp> IL-4 substrates <END> including <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> IRS-1 <END> were phosphorylated . 
Additionally , we detected <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 <END> ( <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> ) tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity in <START:ana> X-SCID B cells <END> with a wide range of <START:ggp> gammac <END> mutations . 
However , reconstitution of these <START:ana> X-SCID B cells <END> with <START:ggp> gammac <END> enhanced <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -mediated responses including <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> phosphorylation and DNA binding activity and resulted in increased <START:ggp> CD23 <END> expression . 
Thus , <START:ggp> gammac <END> is not necessary to trigger <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -mediated responses in <START:ana> B cells <END> , but its presence is important for optimal <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -signaling . 
These results suggest that two distinct <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> signaling pathways exist . 
Cell-to-cell contact activates the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> of human immunodeficiency virus 1 through its <START:ggp> kappaB motif <END> . 
Cell-to-cell contact between <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> transfected human colonic carcinoma cell line HT29 <END> activates transcription of the <START:ggp> long terminal repeats <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) of human immunodeficiency virus . 
<START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> transcription is controlled by a complex array of <START:ggp> virus-encoded and cellular proteins <END> . 
Using various constructs expressing a <START:ggp> lacZ reporter gene <END> under the control of the intact or three deleted forms of <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> , we obtained evidence that the <START:ggp> kappaB regulatory elements <END> located in the <START:ggp> U3 region <END> are involved in cell-to-cell activation of <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> . 
Cell-to-cell contact activates in vitro binding of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) p50/p65 heterodimer <END> to an HIV-1 kappaB oligonucleotide . 
Cell-to-cell contact activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> was only partially inhibited by 100 microM pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and was not correlated with a significant decrease of <START:ggp> cellular inhibitor kappaB alpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> nuclear activation was not detectable before 1 h after cell contact and was dependent on protein synthesis . 
Identification of <START:ggp> nucleotide sequences <END> that regulate transcription of the MCF13 murine leukemia virus <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> in activated <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The region downstream of the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> ( <START:ggp> DEN <END> ) of the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> of the mink cell focus-forming murine leukemia virus is important for viral pathogenicity . 
Another important activity of <START:ggp> DEN <END> is its control of transcription in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> , and we have determined that an <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> site is critical for this activity . 
Possible role of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> activity in <START:ggp> germline <END> C epsilon transcription in a <START:ana> human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) plays a broad role in gene regulation , but it is not evident whether <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> acts as a messenger system for <START:ggp> germline <END> C epsilon transcription . 
We report here that the signaling cascade triggered by <START:ggp> interleukin-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) or <START:ggp> anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody <END> ( <START:ggp> mAb <END> ) participates in <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation responsible for <START:ggp> germline <END> C epsilon transcription in a <START:ana> human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line <END> , <START:ana> DND39 <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and anti- <START:ggp> CD40 mAb <END> induced activation of <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PI3-kinase <END> ) , translocation of a zeta isoform of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> , and nuclear expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
All such events were abrogated by treatment with LY294002 , a specific inhibitor of <START:ggp> PI3-kinase <END> . 
In addition , N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a potent antioxidant , decreased <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation caused by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> anti-CD40 mAb <END> , or their combination . 
NAC was also effective in diminishing <START:ggp> germline <END> C epsilon transcription , and its potency was higher in cultures costimulated with <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> anti-CD40 mAb <END> than in those stimulated with <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> alone . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and ligation of <START:ggp> CD40 <END> induce <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> expression via at least a mechanism dependent on the <START:ggp> PI3-kinase <END> pathway and suggest that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> sensitive to NAC may play a role in regulating <START:ggp> germline <END> C epsilon transcription . 
Differentiation of <START:ana> U-937 promonocytic cells <END> by etoposide and ICRF-193 , two antitumour <START:ggp> DNA topoisomerase II <END> inhibitors with different mechanisms of action . 
We have compared the action on <START:ana> U-937 human promonocytic leukemia cells <END> of two <START:ggp> DNA topoisomerase II <END> inhibitors , namely the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide and the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-193 . 
One hour pulse-treatment with 3 microM etoposide caused <START:ggp> topoisomerase <END> associated , primary DNA breakage , which was rapidly followed by apoptosis . 
By contrast , these effects were not observed upon pulse-treatment with 6 microM ICRF-193 . 
However , continuous treatments with subcytotoxic concentrations of etoposide ( 0.15 microM ) and ICRF-193 ( 0.3 microM ) produced several similar effects , namely decreased cell proliferation , accumulation of cells at G2 , increase in cell mass , and induction of differentiation . 
Under these conditions , etoposide produced a biphasic activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> , which consisted in an early transient activation ( from hours 1 to 6 ) of the <START:ggp> membrane-bound enzyme <END> followed by a later activation ( hour 48 ) of the total , <START:ggp> membrane-bound and cytosolic enzyme <END> . 
By contrast , ICRF-193 only provoked a late activation ( from hours 72 to 96 ) of the total enzyme . 
When used at differentiation-inducing concentrations , both <START:ggp> topoisomerase <END> inhibitors caused a great stimulation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding activity , with maximum value at hour 12 in etoposide-treated cells and at hour 48 in <START:ana> ICRF-193-treated cells <END> . 
By contrast , the binding activity of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa ( B ) <END> and <START:ggp> EGR-1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> was little affected . 
It is concluded that topoisomerase II inhibitors may induce the differentiation of promonocytic cells , independently of their capacity to cause DNA strand breaks . 
However , there are other effects , such as the early activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> , which are probably derived from the production of primary DNA breakage by some anti- <START:ggp> topoisomerase <END> drugs . 
<START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> DNA binding activity is down-regulated in late S phase in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> . 
We have set out to test a model for tissue-specific gene expression that relies on the early replication of expressed genes to sequester limiting activating <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Using an <START:ana> erythroid cell line <END> , we have tested the changes in the DNA binding activity of the <START:ggp> lineage-restricted transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> through the cell cycle . 
We find that <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> activity is low in G1 , peaks in mid-S phase , and then decreases in G2/M . 
In contrast , the binding activities of two ubiquitous <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> Oct1 <END> and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , remain high in G2/M . 
<START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> protein and <START:ana> mRNA <END> vary in a similar manner through the cell cycle , suggesting that the expression of the gene or the stability of its message is regulated . 
Although a number of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> involved in the control of the cell cycle or DNA replication have been shown to peak in S phase , this is the first example of a <START:ggp> lineage-restricted transcription factor <END> displaying S phase-specific DNA binding activity . 
One interpretation of these data leads to a model in which the peak in <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> DNA binding amplifies the effect of early replication on the activation of <START:ggp> erythroid-specific genes <END> at the same time as preventing activation of <START:ggp> non-erythroid genes <END> containing <START:ggp> GATA-responsive elements <END> . 
These results may also relate to recent data implicating <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> function in apoptosis and cell cycle progression 
Activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> pathway by inflammatory stimuli in <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> . 
<START:ana> Activated neutrophils <END> have the ability to upregulate the expression of many genes , in particular those encoding <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> chemokines <END> , and to subsequently release the corresponding proteins . 
Although little is known to date concerning the regulation of gene transcription in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> , it is noteworthy that many of these genes depend on the activation of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , such as <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , for inducible expression . 
We therefore investigated whether <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel proteins <END> are expressed in <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> , as well as their fate on cell activation . 
We now report that dimers consisting of <START:ggp> p50 NFkappaB1 <END> , <START:ggp> p65 RelA <END> , and/or <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> are present in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> and that the greater part of these <START:ggp> protein complexes <END> is physically associated with <START:ggp> cytoplasmic IkappaB-alpha <END> in resting cells . 
Following neutrophil stimulation with proinflammatory agonists ( such as lipopolysaccharide [ LPS ] , <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> [ <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ] , and fMet-Leu-Phe ) that induce the production of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> chemokines <END> in these cells , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel proteins <END> translocated to nuclear fractions , resulting in a transient induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA binding activity , as determined in gel mobility shift assays . 
The onset of both processes was found to be closely paralleled by , and dependent on , <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> degradation . 
<START:ana> Proinflammatory neutrophil <END> stimuli also promoted the accumulation of <START:ana> IkappaB-alpha mRNA transcripts <END> , resulting in the reexpression of the <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha protein <END> . 
To our knowledge , this constitutes the first indication that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation may underlie the action of proinflammatory stimuli towards human neutrophil gene expression and , as such , adds a new facet to our understanding of <START:ana> neutrophil biology <END> . 
Two distinct pathways of <START:ggp> interleukin-5 <END> synthesis in <START:ana> allergen-specific human T-cell clones <END> are suppressed by glucocorticoids . 
Glucocorticoids ( GC ) have long been used as the most effective agents for the treatment of allergic diseases accompanied by eosinophilia such as chronic asthma and atopic dermatitis . 
The development of chronic eosinophilic inflammation is dependent on <START:ggp> interleukin-5 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> ) , a <START:ggp> selective eosinophil-activating factor <END> , produced by <START:ana> helper T cells <END> . 
To delineate the regulatory mechanisms of human <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> synthesis , we established <START:ana> allergen-specific CD4+ T-cell clones <END> from asthmatic patients . 
GC efficiently suppressed <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> synthesis of T-cell clones activated via either <START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) or <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> ) . 
Induction of <START:ana> IL-5 mRNA <END> upon <START:ggp> TCR <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> stimulation was totally inhibited by dexamethasone . 
Human <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> promoter/enhancer-luciferase gene construct transfected to <START:ana> T-cell clones <END> was transcribed on either <START:ggp> TCR <END> or <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> stimulation and was clearly downregulated by dexamethasone , indicating that the approximately <START:ggp> 500-bp human IL-5 gene segment <END> located <START:ggp> 5 ' upstream <END> of the coding region contains <START:ggp> activation-inducible enhancer elements <END> responsible for the regulation by GC . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis suggested that <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> are among the possible targets of GC actions on <START:ana> TCR-stimulated T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-AT <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> were not significantly induced by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> stimulation . 
Our results showing that GC suppressed <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> production by <START:ana> human CD4+ T cells <END> activated by two distinct stimuli , <START:ggp> TCR <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> stimulation , underscore the efficacy of GC in the treatment of allergic diseases via suppression of T-cell <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> synthesis . 
<START:ggp> Itk <END> , a <START:ggp> T cell-specific tyrosine kinase <END> , is required for <START:ggp> CD2-mediated interleukin-2 promoter <END> activation in the <START:ana> human T cell line Jurkat <END> . 
We investigated the functional role of <START:ggp> Itk <END> , a member of the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Tec family <END> , in T cell activation . 
Stimulation of either <START:ggp> CD2 <END> or T cell receptor ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) /CD3 on Tcells by monoclonal antibody-mediated cross-linking induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Itk <END> , which was maximal as early as 1 min after stimulation . 
The tyrosine kinase activity in the anti- <START:ggp> Itk <END> immunoprecipitate was significantly activated upon these stimulations . 
Interleukin-2 ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) promoter activity stimulated by cross-linking of <START:ggp> CD2 <END> , <START:ggp> TCR <END> /CD3 , and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> with <START:ggp> antibodies <END> was significantly reduced by transient expression of an <START:ggp> Itk mutant <END> lacking the kinase activity . 
The reduction paralleled a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> endogenous wild-type Itk <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ggp> CD2 <END> or <START:ggp> TCR/CD3 <END> induced activation of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) , the <START:ggp> binding site <END> of which is included in the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene promoter <END> . 
The activation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> was also impaired by expression of the <START:ggp> Itk mutant <END> . 
These results demonstrate that <START:ggp> Itk <END> plays a role in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production , indicating a critical involvement of <START:ggp> Itk <END> in the initial stage of T cell activation by mediating signals from the <START:ggp> TCR/CD3 complex <END> , <START:ggp> CD2 <END> , and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> LAZ3/BCL6 <END> in follicular center ( FC ) B cells of reactive lymph nodes and FC-derived non-Hodgkin lymphomas . 
Chromosomal translocation resulting in abnormal expression of the <START:ggp> LAZ3/BCL6 gene <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> has been implicated in the tumorigenesis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . 
Therefore we studied the expression pattern of <START:ggp> LAZ3/BCL6 <END> by in situ hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotide probes in frozen tissue sections from five reactive lymph nodes and 38 B cell and non-B NHL . 
In addition , we investigated the expression of <START:ggp> LAZ3/BCL6 <END> by Northern blot analysis on multiple human tissues . 
The <START:ana> LAZ3/BCL6 transcript <END> was found in a variety of tissues , including skeletal muscle , <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocytes <END> , and weakly in normal lymph nodes . 
In the tumor samples , expression of <START:ggp> LAZ3/BCL6 <END> was observed in 68 % of all B cell NHL and none of the non-B lymphomas . 
All cases of follicular , mixed small and large cell lymphomas showed <START:ggp> LAZ3/BCL6 <END> expression confined to the neoplastic follicles . 
A follicular expression pattern was also found in all non-malignant reactive lymph nodes . 
Hence , the expression of <START:ggp> LAZ3/BCL6 <END> does not correlate to malignancy , but reflects the origin of <START:ana> B cells <END> from the germinal centers . 
<START:ggp> Jak1 <END> expression is required for mediating interleukin-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate and <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> <START:ggp> signaling molecules <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Jak1 , Jak2 , Jak3 , and Fes tyrosine kinases <END> have been demonstrated to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -4 <END> stimulation in different cell systems . 
However , it is not clear which , if any , of these kinases are responsible for initiating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> intracellular substrates <END> in vivo . 
In the present study , we have utilized a <START:ana> mutant Jak1-deficient HeLa cell line <END> , <START:ana> E1C3 <END> , and its <START:ana> parental Jak1-expressing counterpart <END> , <START:ana> 1D4 <END> , to analyze the role of <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> in mediating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events . 
IL-4 treatment rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> insulin receptor substrate ( IRS ) -1 <END> and <START:ggp> IRS-2 <END> in <START:ana> 1D4 <END> but not in <START:ana> E1C3 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> was pronounced in <START:ana> 1D4 cells <END> , while no <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -induced <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> phosphorylation was detected in <START:ana> E1C3 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> also induced <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> DNA binding activity from lysates of <START:ana> 1D4 <END> but not <START:ana> E1C3 cells <END> utilizing a <START:ggp> radiolabeled immunoglobulin heavy chain germline epsilon promotor sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> Iepsilon <END> ) in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay . 
Reconstitution of <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> expression in <START:ana> E1C3 cells <END> restored the ability of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> to induce <START:ggp> IRS <END> and <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> tyrosine phosphorylation . 
These results provide evidence that <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> expression is required for mediating tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of crucial molecules involved in <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> signal transduction . 
Oxidant-regulation of gene expression in the chronically inflamed intestine . 
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the chronic gut inflammation observed in the idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases ( e.g. ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease ) is associated with enhanced production of leukocyte-derived oxidants . 
Oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide are known to activate certain <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> such as <START:ggp> nuclear transcription factor kappa beta <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear transcription factor kB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) is a <START:ggp> ubiquitous transcription factor <END> and <START:ggp> pleiotropic regulator <END> of numerous genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses . 
This <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> is activated via the selective phosphorylation , ubiquination and degradation of its <START:ggp> inhibitor protein I-kB <END> thereby allowing translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> into the nucleus where it upregulates the transcription of a variety of <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> ( e.g . <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> , <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) , <START:ggp> cytokines <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ) and <START:ggp> enzymes <END> ( <START:ggp> iNOS <END> ) . 
The proteolytic degradation of the post-translationally modified <START:ggp> I-kappa B <END> is known to be mediated by the <START:ggp> 26S proteasome complex <END> . 
Based upon work from our laboratory , we propose that inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation produces significant anti inflammatory activity which may be mediated by the inhibition of transcription of certain <START:ggp> pro-inflammatory mediators <END> and <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> . 
Generation of <START:ana> cytotoxic T lymphocytes <END> against <START:ggp> immunorecessive epitopes <END> after multiple immunizations with adenovirus vectors is dependent on haplotype . 
Currently , adenovirus ( Ad ) is being considered as a vector for the treatment of cystic fibrosis as well as other diseases . 
However , the <START:ana> cytotoxic T lymphocyte <END> ( <START:ana> CTL <END> ) response to Ad could limit the effectiveness of such approaches . 
Since the <START:ana> CTL <END> response to virus infection is often focused on one or a few <START:ggp> immunodominant epitopes <END> , one approach to circumvent this response is to create vectors that lack these <START:ggp> immunodominant epitopes <END> . 
The effectiveness of this approach was tested by immunizing mice with human group C adenoviruses . 
Three mouse strains ( C57BL/10SnJ [ H-2b ] , C3HeB/FeJ [ H-2k ] , and BALB/cByJ [ H-2d ] ) were immunized with wild-type Ad or Ad vectors lacking the <START:ggp> immunodominant antigen <END> ( s ) , and the <START:ana> CTL <END> responses were measured . 
In C57BL/10 ( B10 ) mice , a single inoculation intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) led to the recognition of an <START:ggp> immunodominant antigen <END> in <START:ggp> E1A <END> . 
When B10 mice were inoculated multiple times either i.p . 
or intranasally with wild-type Ad or an Ad vector lacking most of the <START:ggp> E1 region <END> , subdominant epitopes outside this region were recognized . 
In contrast , C3H mice inoculated with wild-type Ad recognized an epitope mapping within <START:ggp> E1B <END> . When inoculated twice with Ad vectors lacking both <START:ggp> E1A <END> and <START:ggp> E1B <END> , no <START:ggp> immunorecessive epitopes <END> were recognized . 
The immune response to Ad in BALB/c mice was more complex . 
<START:ana> CTLs <END> from BALB/c mice inoculated i.p. with wild-type Ad recognized <START:ggp> E1B <END> in the context of the <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I Dd allele <END> and a region outside <START:ggp> E1 <END> associated with the <START:ggp> Kd allele <END> . 
When BALB/c mice were inoculated with <START:ggp> E1 <END> -deleted Ad vectors , only the <START:ggp> immunodominant Kd-restricted epitope <END> was recognized , and Dd-restricted <START:ana> CTLs <END> did not develop . 
This report indicates that the emergence of <START:ana> CTLs <END> against <START:ggp> immunorecessive epitopes <END> following multiple administrations of Ad vectors lacking immunodominant antigens is dependent on haplotype and could present an obstacle to gene therapy in an <START:ggp> MHC <END> -diverse human population . 
Characterization of the <START:ggp> human platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 promoter <END> : identification of a <START:ggp> GATA-2 binding element <END> required for optimal transcriptional activity . 
<START:ggp> Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> PECAM-1 <END> ) is a <START:ggp> 130-kD member <END> of the <START:ggp> Ig gene superfamily <END> that is expressed on <START:ana> platelets <END> , <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> , and certain <START:ana> leukocyte subsets <END> . 
To examine the factors controlling vascular-specific expression of <START:ggp> PECAM-1 <END> , we cloned the <START:ggp> 5'-flanking region <END> of the <START:ggp> PECAM-1 gene <END> and analyzed its transcriptional activity . 
5'-Rapid amplification of <START:ggp> cDNA ends <END> ( <START:ggp> 5'-RACE <END> ) analysis showed that transcription initiation occurred at several closely spaced nearby sites originating approximately <START:ggp> 204 bp upstream <END> from the <START:ggp> translation start site <END> . 
Analysis of the sequence immediately upstream from the <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> ( <START:ggp> TIS <END> ) showed no canonical <START:ggp> TATA <END> or <START:ggp> CAAT elements <END> , however an initiator element commonly found in <START:ggp> TATA-less promoters <END> encompassed the <START:ggp> TIS <END> . 
<START:ggp> 5'-serially truncated PECAM-1 promoter segments <END> cloned in front of a <START:ggp> luciferase reporter <END> drove transcription in both a lineage- and orientation-specific manner . 
Putative <START:ggp> cis-acting control elements <END> present within a <START:ggp> 300-bp core promoter <END> included two <START:ggp> ets sites <END> , an <START:ggp> Sp1 site <END> , tandem <START:ggp> E-box domains <END> , two <START:ggp> GATA-associated sites <END> ( CACCC ) , an <START:ggp> AP-2 binding site <END> , and a <START:ggp> GATA element <END> at <START:ggp> -24 <END> . 
Mutational analysis showed that optimal transcriptional activity required the <START:ggp> GATA sequence <END> at position <START:ggp> -24 <END> , and gel-shift assays further showed that the <START:ggp> GATA-2 transcription factor <END> , but not <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , bound to this region of the <START:ggp> PECAM-1 promoter <END> . 
Understanding the <START:ggp> cis- and transacting factors <END> that regulate the tissue-specific expression of <START:ggp> PECAM-1 <END> should increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which vascular-specific gene expression is achieved . 
A negative regulatory region containing a <START:ggp> glucocorticosteroid response element <END> ( <START:ggp> nGRE <END> ) in the <START:ggp> human interleukin-1beta gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-1 beta <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> ) is one of the most important <START:ggp> inflammatory mediators <END> in human inflammatory and immunological diseases . 
The regulation of <START:ggp> human IL-1beta <END> gene expression has been studied for several years , and a few <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> have been discovered in the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> . 
However , little is known about negative regulation of <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> expression at the transcriptional level , which may play an important role in anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects . 
We have identified a <START:ggp> negative regulatory element <END> located in the region between <START:ggp> -685 and -395 <END> . 
Within this region , a <START:ggp> 19-bp nuclear factor binding site <END> ( <START:ggp> -570 to -552 <END> ) was characterized by <START:ggp> DNase I <END> footprinting and electromobility shift assay . 
A <START:ggp> consensus sequence <END> for a <START:ggp> negative glucocorticoid response element <END> ( <START:ggp> nGRE <END> ) and a <START:ggp> transcription activator protein-2 binding site <END> were noted within this footprint . 
Functional studies showed a 2.5-fold increase in promoter activity when this <START:ggp> 19-bp binding site <END> was deleted in the <START:ggp> reporter constructs <END> <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> <START:ggp> /CAT <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> <START:ggp> /SV40 promoter <END> <START:ggp> /CAT <END> . 
Dexamethasone ( 10 ( -8 ) M ) repressed <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase <END> ( <START:ggp> CAT <END> ) production by 75 % in the <START:ggp> wild-type fragment <END> but not in a <START:ggp> deletion mutant <END> lacking the <START:ggp> 19-bp site <END> . 
A protein of about <START:ggp> 150 kD <END> that bound to this <START:ggp> negative regulatory sequence <END> was identified by UV cross-linking . 
This is the first description of a <START:ggp> negative regulatory region <END> responsive to glucocorticoids in a <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> . 
Interaction of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> RFX1 <END> and <START:ggp> MIBP1 <END> with the <START:ggp> gamma motif <END> of the <START:ggp> negative regulatory element <END> of the <START:ggp> hepatitis B virus core promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> negative regulatory element <END> ( <START:ggp> NRE <END> ) of the <START:ggp> hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) core promoter <END> contains three subregions which act synergistically to suppress core promoter activity . 
One of these subregions , <START:ggp> NRE gamma <END> , is active in both <START:ana> HeLa cervical carcinoma cells <END> and <START:ana> Huh7 hepatoma cells <END> and was found to be bound by a protein factor present in both cell types . 
Here we show that the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> RFX1 <END> can bind to <START:ggp> NRE gamma <END> and transactivate the <START:ggp> core promoter <END> through this site . 
Mutations which abrogated the gene-suppressive activity of <START:ggp> NRE gamma <END> prevented <START:ggp> RFX1 <END> from binding to <START:ggp> NRE gamma <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> RFX1 <END> can bind simultaneously , most likely as a <START:ggp> heterodimer <END> , with the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> MIBP1 <END> to <START:ggp> NRE gamma <END> . 
In the absence of a cloned <START:ggp> MIBP1 gene <END> for further studies , we hypothesize that <START:ggp> RFX1 <END> acts with <START:ggp> MIBP1 <END> to negatively regulate the core promoter activity through the <START:ggp> NRE gamma site <END> . 
The ability of <START:ggp> RFX1 <END> to transactivate the <START:ggp> core promoter <END> raises the possibility that <START:ggp> RFX1 <END> may play a dual role in regulating HBV gene expression 
Use of arsenic trioxide ( As2O3 ) in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) : II . 
Clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetics in relapsed patients . 
The therapeutic effect of arsenic trioxide ( As2O3 ) in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) was evaluated among 15 APL patients at relapse after all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) induced and chemotherapy maintained complete remission ( CR ) . 
As2O3 was administered intravenously at the dose of 10 mg/d . 
Clinical CR was achieved in nine of 10 ( 90 % ) patients treated with As2O3 alone and in the remaining five patients treated by the combination of As2O3 and low-dose chemotherapeutic drugs or ATRA . 
During the treatment with As2O3 , there was no bone marrow depression and only limited side effects were encountered . 
Pharmacokinetic studies , which were performed in eight patients , showed that after a peak level of 5.54 micromol/L to 7.30 micromol/L , plasma arsenic was rapidly eliminated , and the continuous administration of As2O3 did not alter its pharmacokinetic behaviors . 
In addition , increased amounts of arsenic appeared in the urine , with a daily excretion accounting for approximately 1 % to 8 % of the total daily dose administered . 
Arsenic contents in hair and nail were increased , and the peak content of arsenic could reach 2.5 to 2.7 microg/g tissue at CR . 
On the other hand , a decline of the arsenic content in hair and nail was observed after withdrawal of the drug . 
We conclude that As2O3 treatment is an effective and relatively safe drug in APL patients refractory to ATRA and conventional chemotherapy . 
<START:ggp> Nucleolin <END> is one component of the <START:ggp> B cell-specific transcription factor <END> and <START:ggp> switch region binding protein <END> , <START:ggp> LR1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> LR1 <END> is a B cell-specific , sequence-specific DNA binding activity that regulates transcription in <START:ana> activated B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> LR1 <END> also binds <START:ggp> Ig heavy chain <END> switch region sequences and may function in class switch recombination . 
<START:ggp> LR1 <END> contains two polypeptides , of 106 kDa and 45 kDa , and here we report that the <START:ggp> 106-kDa component <END> of <START:ggp> LR1 <END> is <START:ggp> nucleolin <END> . 
This identification , initially made by microsequence analysis , was verified by showing that ( i ) <START:ggp> LR1 <END> -DNA binding activity increased in <START:ana> B cells <END> transfected with a <START:ggp> nucleolin cDNA expression construct <END> ; ( ii ) <START:ggp> LR1 <END> -DNA binding activity was recognized by antibodies raised against <START:ggp> recombinant human nucleolin <END> ; and ( iii ) in <START:ana> B cells <END> transfected with <START:ggp> epitope-tagged nucleolin expression constructs <END> , the <START:ggp> LR1-DNA complex <END> was recognized by the <START:ggp> anti-tag antibody <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nucleolin <END> is an <START:ggp> abundant nucleolar protein <END> which is believed to play a role in <START:ggp> rDNA <END> transcription or organization , or <START:ana> rRNA <END> processing . 
Homology between <START:ggp> nucleolin <END> and <START:ggp> histone H1 <END> suggests that <START:ggp> nucleolin <END> may alter DNA organization in response to cell cycle controls , and the <START:ggp> nucleolin <END> component of <START:ggp> LR1 <END> may therefore function to organize <START:ggp> switch regions <END> before , during , or after switch recombination . 
The demonstration that <START:ggp> nucleolin <END> is a component of a <START:ggp> B cell-specific complex <END> that binds switch region sequences suggests that the <START:ggp> G-rich switch regions <END> may have evolved from <START:ggp> rDNA <END> . 
Glucocorticoid-resistance in <START:ana> peripheral-blood lymphocytes <END> does not correlate with number of affinity of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid-receptors <END> in chronic renal failure patients . 
Glucocorticoid ( GC ) resistance in patients with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) seriously impairs successive GC therapy after renal transplantation . 
We examined the relationship between GC-receptor ( GC-R ) parameters in <START:ana> peripheral-blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) and <START:ana> PBMC <END> resistance to GC in 21 CRF patients and 18 healthy subjects . 
Each subject group was divided into two subgroups according to <START:ana> PBMC <END> sensitivity to prednisolone in a mitogen assay procedure ; i.e. , sensitive ( IC50 < 381 ng/mL ) and resistant ( IC50 > 381 ng/mL ) groups . 
In healthy subjects , the mean <START:ggp> GC-R <END> Bmax and Kd in quiescent <START:ana> PBMC <END> of the GC-sensitive group were 2.89 +/- 1.23 fmol/10 ( 6 ) cells and 4.00 +/- 2.24 nM , respectively . 
The Bmax in these subjects significantly increased to 6.61 +/- 2.02 ( 257.7 +/- 107.8 % ) after 24 h stimulation with concanavalin A ( p < 0.01 ) , while the Kd change was not significant . 
The <START:ggp> GC-R <END> Bmax and Kd in quiescent <START:ana> PBMC <END> of the GC-resistant group were 5.33 +/- 1.37 fmol/10 ( 6 ) cells and 3.20 +/- 1.39 nM , respectively . 
Both of these parameters , however , did not change significantly after <START:ggp> mitogen <END> stimulation . 
There was a significant negative correlation between IC50S of prednisolone and increase-ratios ( post/pre ratio ) of Bmax after <START:ggp> mitogen <END> stimulation ( p < 0.05 ) . 
In CRF patients , Bmax and Kd in quiescent <START:ana> PBMC <END> of the GC-sensitive group were 6.04 +/- 2.35 fmol/10 ( 6 ) cells and 3.49 +/- 1.72 nM , respectively , while those in <START:ana> PBMC <END> of the GC-resistant group were 5.13 +/- 2.31 fmol/10 ( 6 ) cells and 4.04 +/- 1.62 nM , respectively . 
The Bmax and Kd were not significantly changed after <START:ggp> mitogen <END> stimulation in both subgroups of CRF . 
Moreover , in contrast to healthy subjects , there was no correlation between IC50 and <START:ggp> GC-R <END> parameters in CRF . 
We concluded that , in healthy subjects , decreased <START:ana> PBMC <END> capacity to amplify <START:ggp> GC-R <END> numbers in response to <START:ggp> mitogen <END> is correlated with GC resistance , whereas in CRF patients the resistant mechanism is not correlated with <START:ggp> GC-R <END> parameters . 
An unknown event might be involved in GC-resistance of CRF . 
Alteration of a single serine in the <START:ggp> basic domain <END> of the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ZEBRA protein <END> separates its functions of transcriptional activation and disruption of latency . 
The <START:ggp> ZEBRA protein <END> from Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) activates a switch from the latent to the lytic expression program of the virus . 
<START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> , a member of the <START:ggp> bZIP family <END> of <START:ggp> DNA-binding proteins <END> , is a transcriptional activator capable of inducing expression from <START:ggp> viral lytic cycle promoters <END> . 
It had previously been thought that <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> 's capacity to disrupt EBV latency resided primarily in its ability to activate transcription of genes that encode products required for lytic replication . 
We generated a point mutant of <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> , <START:ggp> Z ( S186A ) <END> , that was not impaired in its ability to activate transcription ; however , this mutation abolished its ability to initiate the viral lytic cascade . 
The mutant , containing a serine-to-alanine substitution in the <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> of the protein , bound to several known <START:ggp> ZEBRA-binding sites <END> and activated transcription from reporters bearing known <START:ggp> ZEBRA-responsive promoters <END> but did not disrupt latency in <START:ana> EBV-infected cell lines <END> . 
Therefore , initiation of the EBV lytic cycle by the <START:ggp> ZEBRA protein <END> requires a function in addition to transcriptional activation ; a change of serine 186 to alanine in the <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> of <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> abolished this additional function and uncovered a new role for the <START:ggp> ZEBRA protein <END> in disruption of EBV latency . 
The additional function that is required for initiation of the lytic viral life cycle is likely to require phosphorylation of serine 186 of the <START:ggp> ZEBRA protein <END> , which may influence either DNA recognition or transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> lytic viral promoters <END> in a <START:ggp> chromatinized viral episome <END> . 
Immune hyperactivation of <START:ana> HIV-1-infected T cells <END> mediated by <START:ggp> Tat <END> and the <START:ggp> CD28 <END> pathway . 
Human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection is characterized by a chronic state of immune hyperactivation in patients . 
Infection of <START:ana> human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> with HIV-1 in vitro resulted in increased interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) secretion in response to T cell activation via the <START:ggp> CD3 and CD28 receptors <END> . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 transactivator <END> <START:ggp> Tat <END> recapitulated this phenotype and was associated with increased <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion in response to costimulation with <START:ggp> CD3 <END> plus <START:ggp> CD28 <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> superinduction by <START:ggp> Tat <END> occurred at the transcriptional level , was mediated by the <START:ggp> CD28-responsive element <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> , and was exclusively dependent on the <START:ggp> 29 amino acids <END> encoded by the <START:ggp> second exon of Tat <END> . 
Response to intranasal fluticasone propionate in perennial allergic rhinitis not associated with <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> characteristics . 
BACKGROUND : The reduction of symptoms due to treatment with corticosteroids varies among patients with perennial rhinitis . 
Most patients will respond but a few patients respond less to these drugs . 
OBJECTIVE : To investigate the association in reduction of symptoms due to glucocorticoids and <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> characteristics in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis , in vitro <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> binding studies were performed with <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> using dexamethasone and in vitro production of <START:ggp> mediators <END> were measured . 
METHODS : During a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study , 200 micrograms fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray ( in the active treatment period ) and placebo ( in the placebo treatment period ) were administered twice daily for 2 weeks to 22 patients allergic to house dust mite . 
At the end of both treatment periods symptoms were scored after allergen provocation ( 100 , 1000 , 10000 BU/mL ) and during the 9.5 hours after this challenge . 
Receptor binding studies with dexamethasone were performed with <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
Leukotriene B4 produced by <START:ana> monocytes <END> in vitro and soluble <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor <END> released by <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> in vitro and cortisol levels in plasma were determined . 
RESULTS : No significant partial correlations of the number of the <START:ggp> peripheral blood mononuclear cell glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( 6821 +/- 5669 binding sites per cell ) and the affinity ( Kd : 16.5 +/- 13.51 nmol/L ) for the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> with the symptom score ( placebo : 4.3 +/- 2.45 pts ; fluticasone : 2.4 +/- 1.55 pts ) after active treatment were found . 
Also no significant partial correlations of the levels of leukotriene B4 ( 45.6 +/- 105.3 ng/10 ( 6 ) cells ) produced by <START:ana> monocytes <END> in vitro , soluble <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor <END> ( 734 +/- 237 ng/10 ( 6 ) cells ) released by <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> in vitro and cortisol levels ( 571 +/- 236 ng/mL ) in plasma with the symptom score after active treatment were found . 
CONCLUSIONS : The reduction of symptoms due to topical fluticasone propionate in patients with rhinitis and allergy to house dust mite is not correlated with the characteristics of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
Constitutive expression of <START:ggp> p50 homodimer <END> in <START:ana> freshly isolated human monocytes <END> decreases with in vitro and in vivo differentiation : a possible mechanism influencing human immunodeficiency virus replication in <START:ana> monocytes <END> and mature macrophages . 
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replicates more efficiently in vitro in <START:ana> differentiated macrophages <END> than in <START:ana> freshly isolated monocytes <END> . 
We investigated whether this may be partly explained by changes in expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> with monocyte differentiation . 
We demonstrated that constitutive expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> primary human monocytes <END> changed significantly with differentiation in vitro to <START:ana> monocyte-derived macrophages <END> ( <START:ana> MDMs <END> ) and differentiation in vivo to <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> ( <START:ana> AMs <END> ) . 
Freshly isolated monocytes constitutively expressed high levels of <START:ggp> transcriptionally inactive p50 homodimer <END> which decreased with time in culture in favor of the transcriptionally active <START:ggp> p50/p65 and p50/RelB heterodimers <END> . 
As in <START:ana> MDMs <END> , <START:ana> AMs <END> constitutively expressed <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> and <START:ggp> p50/RelB <END> although at lower levels . 
HIV infection of fresh <START:ana> monocytes <END> failed to induce <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> as seen in <START:ana> MDMs <END> . 
The replacement of <START:ggp> p50 homodimers <END> with transcriptionally active heterodimers following time in culture may partially explain the progressive increase in susceptibility of <START:ana> monocytes <END> to HIV infection during in vitro culture . 
The change in <START:ggp> NF-kappaB components <END> with monocyte differentiation in vivo may also explain the different transcriptional activities of these cell populations in HIV-infected individuals . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -independent suppression of HIV expression by ascorbic acid . 
Ascorbic acid ( ascorbate or vitamin C ) has been shown to suppress the induction of HIV in <START:ana> latently infected T lymphocytic cells <END> following stimulation with a tumor promoter ( PMA ) and <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokine <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) . 
To assess whether this inhibition was mediated via modulation of the <START:ggp> cellular transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , we carried out gel shift analysis on nuclear extracts prepared under different conditions of cell stimulation in the presence or absence of ascorbate , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , or zidovudine ( AZT ) . 
Pretreatment of <START:ana> ACH-2 T cells <END> by NAC followed by stimulation with PMA , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , or hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) resulted in strong suppression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
In contrast , neither ascorbate nor AZT affected <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity under all three induction conditions in the <START:ana> ACH-2 cell line <END> . 
Ascorbate and AZT also had no effect on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation following TNF-alpha- or PMA-induced stimulation of U1 promonocytic cells . 
These results suggest that the molecular mechanism of HIV inhibition by ascorbate is not mediated via <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> inhibition , unlike that seen with other antioxidants . 
A <START:ggp> T cell-specific enhancer <END> in the <START:ggp> interleukin-3 locus <END> is activated cooperatively by <START:ggp> Oct and NFAT elements <END> within a <START:ggp> DNase I-hypersensitive site <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-3 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> ) is a <START:ggp> cytokine <END> that is expressed primarily in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
Here we identified an inducible <START:ggp> T cell-specific enhancer <END> 14 kb upstream of the <START:ggp> IL-3 gene <END> that responded to activation of <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> signaling pathways . 
The <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> enhancer spanned an inducible <START:ggp> cyclosporin A-sensitive DNase I-hypersensitive site <END> found only in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Four <START:ggp> NFAT-like elements <END> exist within the enhancer . 
The two most active <START:ggp> NFAT-like elements <END> were located at the center of the <START:ggp> DNase I-hypersensitive site <END> . 
One of these <START:ggp> NFAT-like elements <END> encompassed overlapping <START:ggp> Oct- and NFATp/c-binding sites <END> , which functioned in a highly synergistic manner . 
We suggest that the T cell-specific expression of the <START:ggp> IL-3 gene <END> is partly controlled through the enhancer by cooperation between <START:ggp> Oct and NFAT family proteins <END> . 
<START:ggp> Adenovirus E1B 19K protein <END> is required for efficient DNA replication in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> adenovirus E1B 19K gene <END> plays an essential role in transformation of <START:ana> primary rodent cells <END> in cooperation with <START:ggp> E1A <END> and in the inhibition of apoptosis during lytic infection . 
It has been shown that this <START:ggp> E1B 19K protein <END> is not necessary for viral DNA replication in <START:ana> human cell lines <END> , such as <START:ana> HeLa <END> and <START:ana> KB <END> . 
We reported here that the <START:ggp> E1B 19K <END> mutant viruses were unable to replicate efficiently in a <START:ana> monocyte cell line <END> , <START:ana> U937 <END> . 
Viral DNA synthesis and late gene expression were found to be defective in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> infected with <START:ggp> E1B 19K <END> mutants compared with wild-type virus . 
Early viral RNA splicing patterns also differ between <START:ana> wild-type and dl337-infected cells <END> . 
Furthermore , the defect in viral replication could be complemented by dl312 virus defective in <START:ggp> E1A <END> expression 4 days after infection with E1B mutants , suggesting persistence of the <START:ggp> E1B mutant genome <END> in the infected cells despite defective onset of the late phase of replication . 
These results imply that <START:ggp> E1B 19K <END> is required for efficient viral DNA replication in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
Inefficient DNA replication is also found in another <START:ana> monocyte cell line <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 <END> 
Activation of Ras and <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> pathway by <START:ggp> terminal complement complexes <END> is <START:ggp> G protein <END> dependent . 
Assembly of <START:ggp> terminal complement complexes <END> ( <START:ggp> TCC <END> ) <START:ggp> C5b-7 <END> , <START:ggp> C5b-8 <END> , and <START:ggp> C5b-9 <END> on target cells during acute and chronic inflammation induces hydrolysis of plasma membrane phospholipids and heterotrimeric <START:ggp> G protein <END> activation . 
<START:ggp> TCC <END> also stimulate a variety of cellular activities , which include <START:ggp> cytokine <END> synthesis , <START:ggp> proto-oncogene <END> activation , and mitotic signaling . 
Now we report that sublytic <START:ggp> TCC <END> induced <START:ggp> Ras <END> , <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) 1 <END> activation in JY25 B cell line . 
When cells were exposed to <START:ggp> C5b-9 <END> , <START:ggp> GTP-bound Ras <END> in <START:ggp> anti-C5b-9 immunoprecipitates <END> was increased 3.2-fold at 2 min , while <START:ggp> GTP-bound Ras <END> in <START:ggp> anti-Ras immunoprecipitates <END> was increased 2-fold at 10 min . 
Both <START:ggp> C5b-9 <END> and <START:ggp> C5b-7 <END> , but not <START:ggp> C5b6 <END> , increased <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> kinase activity maximum 3.3-fold at 2 min and 2.8-fold at 5 min , respectively . 
<START:ggp> ERK1 <END> activity was 2-fold increased by <START:ggp> C5b-9 <END> at 2 min and by <START:ggp> C5b-7 <END> at 10 min , over the <START:ggp> C5b6 <END> level . 
The role of <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MAPK <END> ) pathway on <START:ggp> TCC <END> -inducible mitotic signaling was evaluated by assessing DNA synthesis and <START:ggp> activator protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) DNA-binding activity . 
The MAPK/ERK-specific inhibitor PD 098 , 059 abolished the <START:ggp> C5b-9 <END> -induced DNA synthesis . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> G protein <END> in the activation of <START:ggp> MAPK <END> pathway by <START:ggp> TCC <END> was indicated by inhibition of <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> and <START:ggp> ERK1 <END> kinase activity , as well as the DNA synthesis by pretreatment of cells with <START:ggp> pertussis toxin <END> . 
Overexpression of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 carboxyl-terminal peptide in <START:ana> JY25 cells <END> also inhibited <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> and <START:ggp> ERK1 <END> activity , indicating a direct involvement of G betagamma subunits in the signal transduction generated through activation of <START:ggp> MAPK <END> pathway by <START:ggp> TCC <END> assembly in the plasma membrane . 
Spontaneous occurrence of early region 1A reiteration mutants of type 5 adenovirus in <START:ana> persistently infected human T-lymphocytes <END> . 
Mutants of type 5 adenovirus ( Ad5 ) with <START:ggp> reiterated DNA sequences <END> in the <START:ggp> E1a region <END> appeared in a <START:ana> human T-lymphocyte cell line <END> , <START:ana> Molt-4 <END> , persistently infected with H5sub304 , a deletion/substitution mutant that has a wild-type phenotype in viral replication . 
<START:ggp> Endonuclease <END> analyses and DNA sequencing revealed DNA reiteration in each mutant . 
In the four representative mutants investigated , the <START:ggp> DNA reiterations <END> all started within a <START:ggp> six-base-pair consensus sequence <END> , G ( or C ) CTGTG , located in the second <START:ggp> exon <END> of the <START:ggp> E1a region <END> ( at nt 1333 , 1367 , or 1419 ) . 
There was not any DNA homology between the breakpoints in the second <START:ggp> exon <END> and the <START:ggp> inserting sequences <END> ( starting at nt 532 , 710 , or 792 ) . 
Northern analyses suggested that the <START:ggp> reiterated splicing sites <END> of the representative mutants were all used in RNA splicing , and the closest donor and recipient joints were used most frequently . 
These observations imply that during persistent infection Ad5 underwent spontaneous mutations by sequence-specific breakage and nonhomologous end-end joining recombination events . 
These E1a reiteration mutants could be propagated in <START:ana> HeLa <END> , <START:ana> A549 <END> , and <START:ana> KB cells <END> ; they were genetically stable ; and they killed <START:ana> CREF cells <END> at a strikingly high frequency . 
Preliminary observations tend to correlate this CREF cell killing with the accumulation of the <START:ggp> early viral proteins <END> and/or <START:ggp> viral DNA <END> in the <START:ana> infected cells <END> . 
This degree of cell damage was not observed in Ad5wt or H5sub304 infection of <START:ana> CREF cells <END> . 
The observed <START:ggp> E1a reiterations <END> provide a model to gain insight into understanding the evolutionary events of some , if not all , adenovirus types during many years of symbiotic , persistent relationship in human tonsils and adenoids and possibly other lymphoid organs . 
Preferential presentation of <START:ggp> herpes simplex virus T-cell antigen <END> by <START:ggp> HLA DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201 <END> in comparison to <START:ggp> HLA DQA1*0201/DQB1*0201 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> HLA DQA1 locus <END> is polymorphic . 
Haplotypes containing <START:ggp> HLA DQA1*0501 <END> , but not <START:ggp> HLA DQA1*0201 <END> , together with <START:ggp> HLA DQB1*0201 <END> are associated with Grave 's disease and celiac sprue . 
In this report , we demonstrate a functional correlate of DQA1 polymorphism . 
<START:ana> T cells <END> infiltrating a herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) lesion from a HLA DQ 2 , 7 individual yielded a <START:ana> virus-specific CD4+ clone <END> restricted by <START:ggp> DQ2 <END> . 
Presentation of viral peptide and protein segregated with <START:ggp> DQA1 allele <END> , because cell lines bearing <START:ggp> DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201 heterodimers <END> presented antigen in proliferation and cytotoxicity assays much more efficiently than <START:ana> cell lines <END> bearing <START:ggp> DQA1*0201/DQB1*0201 <END> . 
Binding of viral peptide to cell lines bearing <START:ggp> DQA1*0201 <END> , in comparison to <START:ggp> DQA1*0501 <END> , was only moderately reduced and may not explain this effect . 
Truncation and substitution analyses of peptide binding and T-cell activation were performed to determine which viral peptide residues contacting <START:ggp> TCR <END> might therefore be presented in an altered conformation by <START:ggp> DQA1*0201/DQB1*0201 <END> . 
Residues 432 , 435 , 437 , 438 , and 440 ( <START:ggp> position P1 , P4 , P6 , P7 , and P9 <END> ) contributed to <START:ggp> DQ2 <END> binding , whereas residues 431 , 433 , 434 , and 436 ( <START:ggp> positions P 1 , P2 , P3 , and P5 <END> ) contributed to <START:ggp> TCR <END> contact . 
Differential presentation of peptide by <START:ggp> HLA DQ2 heterodimers <END> varying at the <START:ggp> DQA1 locus <END> may have relevance to host defense and the pathogenesis of HLA <START:ggp> DQ2 <END> -associated autoimmune diseases . 
Inhibitor ( IK ) of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induced <START:ggp> HLA class II antigens <END> expression also inhibits <START:ggp> HLA class II <END> constitutive expression in the <START:ana> human Raji B cell line <END> . 
The expression of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II antigens <END> is constitutive in <START:ana> professional antigen presenting cells <END> ( <START:ana> APCs <END> ) but can also be induced by <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) on the majority of the non <START:ana> professional APCs <END> ( e.g . <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> ) . 
We have recently characterised a new factor called <START:ggp> IK <END> which is an efficient inhibitor of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induction of <START:ggp> MHC class II antigens <END> expression . 
Here , we demonstrate a novel role for <START:ggp> IK <END> in <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> expression since over-expression of this protein by stable transfection into human B cells led to a total disappearance of constitutive <START:ana> MHC class II mRNA <END> expression . 
The <START:ggp> class II transactivator <END> ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) is necessary for both constitutive and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induced <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> expressions . 
Examination of <START:ana> CIITA mRNA <END> in <START:ggp> IK <END> stably transfected clones revealed a marked reduction of <START:ana> CIITA mRNA <END> transcription . 
Taken together these results demonstrate that the <START:ggp> IK protein <END> plays a key role in the constitutive expression of <START:ggp> MHC class II antigens <END> and that inhibition induced by <START:ggp> IK <END> is upstream of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> in this regulatory pathway . 
Selective expression of an <START:ggp> interleukin-12 receptor component <END> by <START:ana> human T helper 1 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-12 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> ) , a <START:ggp> heterodimeric cytokine <END> produced by activated monocytes and dendritic cells , plays a crucial role in regulating <START:ggp> interferon ( IFN ) -gamma <END> production and in the generation of <START:ana> IFN-gamma-producing T helper 1 ( Th1 ) cells <END> . 
Here we show that the <START:ggp> IL-12 receptor ( IL-12R ) beta 2 subunit <END> , a recently cloned <START:ggp> binding and signal transducing component <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-12R <END> , is expressed on <START:ana> human Th1 but not Th2 clones <END> and is induced during differentiation of <START:ana> human naive cells <END> along the Th1 but not the Th2 pathway . 
<START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and <START:ggp> type I but not type II interferons <END> induce expression of the <START:ggp> IL-12R beta 2 chain <END> during in vitro T cell differentiation after antigen receptor triggering . 
The selective expression and regulation of the <START:ggp> IL-12R beta 2 subunit <END> may help to understand the basis of Th1/Th2 differentiation and may provide therapeutic options for altering the Th1/Th2 balance in several immuno-pathological conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies . 
The <START:ggp> T cell activation factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> positively regulates HIV-1 replication and gene expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Clinical deterioration in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection is associated with increased levels of viral replication and burden in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs . 
T cell activation and ensuing cellular gene activation can be critical for HIV-1 replication . 
The hypothesis that the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) may influence HIV-1 replication is therefore compelling given the tight correlation of HIV-1 transcriptional induction to T cell activation . 
We report that certain <START:ggp> NF-AT ( Rel ) family members <END> productively bind the <START:ggp> kappaB regulatory elements <END> , synergize with <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> Tat <END> in transcriptional activation of HIV-1 , and enhance HIV-1 replication in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
These results link <START:ggp> regulatory factors <END> critical to T cell commitment directly to HIV-1 replication . 
Transcription mediated by <START:ggp> NFAT <END> is highly inducible in effector <START:ana> CD4+ T helper 2 ( Th2 ) cells <END> but not in <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcriptional factors <END> of the <START:ggp> NFAT family <END> play an important role in regulating the expression of several <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> during the immune response , such as the genes for <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , among others . 
Upon antigen stimulation , precursor <START:ana> CD4+ T helper ( pTh ) cells <END> proliferate and differentiate into two populations of <START:ana> effector cells <END> ( <START:ana> eTh1 <END> and <START:ana> eTh2 <END> ) , each one expressing a specific pattern of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> that distinguishes them from their precursors . 
<START:ana> eTh2 cells <END> are the major source of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , while <START:ggp> gamma interferon <END> is produced by <START:ana> eTh1 cells <END> . 
Here we have used reporter transgenic mice to show that DNA binding and transcriptional activities of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> are transiently induced during the differentiation of <START:ana> pTh cells <END> into either <START:ana> eTh1 <END> or <START:ana> eTh2 cells <END> to mediate the expression of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> as a common growth factor in both pathways . 
However , although <START:ggp> NFAT <END> DNA binding is similarly induced in both <START:ana> eTh1 <END> and <START:ana> eTh2 cells <END> upon antigen stimulation , only the <START:ggp> NFAT complexes <END> present in <START:ana> eTh2 cells <END> are able to mediate high-level transcription , and relatively little <START:ggp> NFAT <END> transcriptional activity was induced in <START:ana> eTh1 cells <END> . 
In contrast to activated <START:ana> pTh cells <END> , neither <START:ana> eTh1 <END> nor <START:ana> eTh2 cells <END> produced significant <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> upon stimulation , but the high levels of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> transcriptional activities directly correlate with the <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> production induced in response to antigen stimulation in <START:ana> eTh2 cells <END> . 
These data suggest that activated <START:ggp> NFAT <END> is involved in the effector function of <START:ana> eTh2 cells <END> and that the failure of <START:ana> eTh1 cells <END> to produce <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> in response to an antigen is due , at least partially , to a failure to induce high-level transcription of the <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> by <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> could be therefore a critical element in the polarization to <START:ana> eTh1 <END> or <START:ana> eTh2 <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> lipopolysaccharide-stimulated U937 cells <END> . 
During the course of serious bacterial infections , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) interacts with <START:ggp> monocyte/macrophage receptors <END> , resulting in the generation of <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> is crucial in activating the transcription of genes encoding <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> . 
In this paper , we demonstrate that the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> by LPS in a <START:ana> promonocytic cell line <END> ( <START:ana> U937 <END> ) followed a rather slow kinetics , depending on the rate of <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> inhibitor hydrolysis . 
No degradation of <START:ggp> p105 and p100 inhibitors <END> was observed under these conditions . 
The transduction pathway leading to <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> involved the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , as demonstrated by the concomitant inhibitory effects of antioxidants on <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and the emission of a fluorescent probe reacting intracellularly with hydrogen peroxide . 
This ROS pathway was also characterized by the use of other inhibitors . 
This finding indicates that <START:ggp> phospholipase A2 <END> and <START:ggp> 5-lipoxygenase <END> are also involved . 
However , the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation pathway involving the <START:ggp> acidic sphingomyelinase <END> of the endolysosomial membrane did not seem to participate in the LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> c-Rel <END> is a target of pentoxifylline-mediated inhibition of T lymphocyte activation . 
The possible clinical use of the methyl xanthine derivative , pentoxifylline ( PF ) , for the treatment of T cell-dependent diseases is being noted with increasing interest . 
In this paper , we studied the molecular consequences of PF treatment during lymphocyte activation . 
We found that in <START:ana> T cells <END> , anti-CD3-induced <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> expression was blocked by PF , whereas the induction of other <START:ggp> NF-kappaB family members <END> was not significantly affected . 
However , induction of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , which has the same signaling requirements as <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> induction , was not inhibited by PF . 
Among genes that respond to these <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> induction was suppressed by PF , whereas <START:ana> IL-2R ( alpha ) chain mRNA <END> induction was not affected . 
These observations implicated <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> as an <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter factor <END> , for which experimental support was obtained from transient transfection experiments . 
In contrast with the observation in <START:ana> T cells <END> , <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> induction was not blocked by PF in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
The greater selectivity of PF , compared with FK506 , at both the molecular and cellular levels may prove advantageous in manipulating T cell responses in vivo . 
<START:ggp> V3 loop <END> of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 suppresses <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> -induced T cell growth [ published erratum appears in AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 1997 May 1 ; 13 ( 7 ) : 633 ] 
We tested the effect of three linear or two loop peptides derived from the <START:ggp> V3 region <END> of the HTLV-III BH10 clone or the SF2 strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 on <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -driven T cell proliferation . 
<START:ggp> V3-BH10 <END> , which consists of <START:ggp> 42 amino acids <END> and has a <START:ggp> loop structure <END> , suppressed <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -driven proliferation of all <START:ana> IL-2-dependent cells <END> [ <START:ana> Kit225 <END> , <START:ana> ED-40515 ( + ) <END> , <START:ana> KT-3 <END> , <START:ana> 7-day PHA-blasts <END> , and <START:ana> fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ] tested , whereas it did not suppress the cell growth of <START:ana> IL-2-independent cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> Hut102 <END> , <START:ana> Molt-4 <END> , and <START:ana> Jurkat <END> ) . 
This suppressive effect was also seen in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -driven cell growth of <START:ana> CD8-positive lymphocytes <END> purified from <START:ana> 7-day PHA-blasts <END> , indicating that <START:ggp> CD4 molecules <END> were not required for the suppression . 
The treatment with <START:ggp> anti-V3 loop monoclonal antibody <END> ( <START:ggp> 902 antibody <END> ) completely abolished the suppressive effect of <START:ggp> V3-BH10 <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> V3-BH10 <END> generated the arrest of <START:ana> Kit225 cells <END> and also <START:ana> purified CD8-positive lymphocytes <END> in G1 phase in the presence of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
Neither <START:ggp> chromatin <END> condensation nor DNA fragmentation was detected in <START:ana> Kit225 cells <END> cultured with <START:ggp> V3-BH10 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
<START:ggp> V3-BH10 <END> neither blocked radiolabeled <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> binding to <START:ggp> IL-2 receptors <END> nor affected tyrosyl phosphorylation of several <START:ggp> cellular proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> p120 <END> , <START:ggp> p98 <END> , <START:ggp> p96 <END> , <START:ggp> p54 <END> , and <START:ggp> p38 <END> ) , which is immediately induced by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> stimulation . 
However , <START:ggp> V3-BH10 <END> enhanced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> <START:ana> -induced mRNA <END> expression of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> but not <START:ggp> c-myc <END> or <START:ggp> junB <END> . 
Thus , the binding of <START:ggp> V3 loop <END> of <START:ggp> gp120 <END> to the cell surface molecule ( s ) appears to affect intracellular <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> signaling , which leads to the suppression of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced T cell growth 
A negative role for <START:ggp> phosphoinositide 3-kinase <END> in <START:ggp> T-cell antigen receptor <END> function . 
BACKGROUND : A delicate balance between positive and negative regulatory mechanisms during T-cell activation determines the specificity and magnitude of an immune response . 
<START:ggp> Phosphoinositide 3-kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> ) is activated by a diverse set of receptors that determine T-cell function , including the <START:ggp> T-cell antigen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) , the <START:ggp> costimulatory receptor CD28 <END> , and <START:ggp> negative regulators <END> of T-cell activation such as <START:ggp> CTLA-4 <END> . 
<START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> is also regulated by the haematopoietic cytokines that determine T-cell differentiation and <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> proliferation . 
<START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> can thus dynamically influence the outcome of the immune reactions at various stages . 
In this study , we investigated the importance of <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> in <START:ggp> TCR <END> -directed T-cell activation using activated or inhibitory versions of <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> . 
RESULTS : Certain aspects of <START:ggp> TCR <END> responses such as the induction of transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> AP1 <END> and <START:ggp> serum response factor <END> were not affected by expression of the mutant forms of <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> . 
We found , however , that <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> profoundly influenced the transactivation capacity of ' <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ' ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) elicited by the <START:ggp> TCR <END> : expression of an activated form of <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> inhibited <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> responses , whereas expression of a dominant negative mutant of <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> potently enhanced <START:ggp> TCR <END> -controlled <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> induction . 
These effects of <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> were not mediated by previously identified <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase effectors <END> , such as <START:ggp> protein kinase B <END> , a <START:ggp> positive regulator <END> of <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> , or the <START:ggp> GTPase Rac <END> , and are therefore likely to involve a novel , as yet unknown , <START:ggp> effector molecule <END> . 
CONCLUSIONS : Our results establish that <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> can both positively and negatively regulate T-cell function , and uncover a previously unrecognized function for <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> as a selective negative regulator of <START:ggp> TCR <END> -signalling events and therefore as a determinant of T-cell homeostasis . 
The <START:ggp> Pax-5 gene <END> is alternatively spliced during B-cell development . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor Pax-5 <END> is expressed during the early stages of B-cell differentiation and influences the expression of several <START:ggp> B-cell-specific genes <END> . 
In addition to the existing isoform ( <START:ggp> Pax-5 <END> , which we have named <START:ggp> Pax-5a <END> ) , we have isolated three new isoforms , <START:ggp> Pax-5b <END> , <START:ggp> Pax-5d <END> , and <START:ggp> Pax-5e <END> , from murine spleen and <START:ana> B-lymphoid cell lines <END> using library screenings and polymerase chain reaction amplification . 
Isoforms <START:ggp> Pax-5b <END> and <START:ggp> Pax-5e <END> have spliced out their second exon , resulting in proteins with only a partial <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> . 
Isoforms Pax-5d and <START:ggp> Pax-5e <END> have deleted the <START:ggp> 3'-region <END> , which encodes the transactivating domain , and replaced it with a novel sequence . 
The existence of alternative <START:ana> Pax-5 transcripts <END> was confirmed using <START:ggp> RNase <END> protection assays . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> Pax-5a <END> and <START:ggp> Pax-5b proteins <END> were detected using Western blot analysis . 
<START:ggp> Pax-5a <END> was detectable in <START:ana> pro- , pre- , and mature B-cell lines <END> , but not in two plasmacytomas ; <START:ggp> Pax-5b <END> was shown to be present at low levels in <START:ana> mature B-cell lines <END> and , unexpectedly , in one plasma cell line , but not in <START:ana> pro-B-cell or T-cell lines <END> . 
Mobility shift assays showed that in vitro translated <START:ggp> Pax-5a <END> and <START:ggp> Pax-5d <END> , but not <START:ggp> Pax-5b <END> or <START:ggp> Pax-5e <END> , could interact with a <START:ggp> B-cell-specific activator protein-binding site <END> on the <START:ggp> blk promoter <END> . 
Using this assay , we also showed that <START:ggp> Pax-5d <END> was present in nuclear extracts of some ( but not all ) <START:ana> B-lymphoid lines <END> and interacts with the <START:ggp> B-cell-specific activator protein-binding site <END> . 
The pattern of differential expression of <START:ggp> alternatively spliced Pax-5 isoforms <END> suggests that they may be important <START:ggp> regulators of transcription <END> during B-cell maturation . 
Reconstitution of T cell antigen receptor-induced <START:ggp> Erk2 kinase <END> activation in <START:ana> Lck-negative JCaM1 cells <END> by <START:ggp> Syk <END> . 
The two related <START:ggp> protein-tyrosine kinases <END> <START:ggp> Syk <END> and <START:ggp> Zap <END> are rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and enzymatically activated upon crosslinking of the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> . 
We have previously reported that the activation of <START:ggp> Syk <END> is less dependent on the <START:ggp> Src family kinase <END> <START:ggp> Lck <END> than the activation of <START:ggp> Zap <END> . 
Here we report that overexpression of <START:ggp> Syk <END> in the <START:ana> Lck-negative JCaM1 cells <END> enabled the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor/CD3 complex <END> to induce a normal activation of the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MAPK <END> ) pathway and expression of a <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> reporter construct . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> Zap <END> and other <START:ggp> protein-tyrosine kinases <END> were unable to reconstitute these signaling pathways when expressed at the same levels . 
In parallel , <START:ggp> Syk <END> was phosphorylated on tyrosine , while <START:ggp> Zap <END> was not . 
The <START:ggp> Syk <END> -mediated <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> -induced <START:ggp> MAPK <END> activation was detectable within 1 min of receptor stimulation and peaked at 3-5 min . 
The capacity of <START:ggp> Syk <END> to reconstitute the <START:ggp> MAPK <END> response required the catalytic activity of <START:ggp> Syk <END> , an intact <START:ggp> autophosphorylation site <END> ( Y518 and Y519 ) , both <START:ggp> Src homology 2 domains <END> and it was blocked by the <START:ggp> inhibitory N17-mutated dominant-negative Ras construct <END> . 
A Y341 -- > <START:ggp> F mutant <END> of <START:ggp> Syk <END> , which is deficient in its interaction with <START:ggp> phospholipase Cy1 <END> and <START:ggp> Vav <END> , was less efficient than <START:ggp> wild-type Syk <END> . 
Our results suggest that <START:ggp> Syk <END> , in contrast to <START:ggp> Zap <END> , can transduce signals from the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> independently of <START:ggp> Lck <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> MEF2C <END> by the <START:ggp> MAP kinase p38 <END> in inflammation . 
For cells of the innate immune system to mount a host defence response to infection , they must recognize products of microbial pathogens such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , the endotoxin secreted by Gram-negative bacteria . 
These cellular responses require intracellular signalling pathways , such as the four <START:ggp> MAP kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MAPK <END> ) pathways . 
In mammalian cells the <START:ggp> MAPK p38 <END> is thought to play an important role in the regulation of cellular responses during infection through its effects on the expression of <START:ggp> proinflammatory molecules <END> . 
One means of understanding the role of <START:ggp> p38 <END> in these responses is to identify proteins with functions regulated by <START:ggp> p38 <END> -catalysed phosphorylation . 
Here we demonstrate a link between the <START:ggp> p38 <END> pathway and a member of the <START:ggp> myocyte-enhancer factor 2 ( MEF2 ) group <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
We found that in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> , LPS increases the transactivation activity of <START:ggp> MEF2C <END> through <START:ggp> p38 <END> -catalysed phosphorylation . 
One consequence of <START:ggp> MEF2C <END> activation is increased <START:ggp> c-jun gene <END> transcription . 
Our results show that <START:ggp> p38 <END> may influence host defence and inflammation by maintaining the balance of <START:ggp> c-Jun protein <END> consumed during infection . 
Cellular redox status influences both cytotoxic and NF-kappa B activation in <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> . 
The role of cellular redox status in both cytotoxic activity and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ana> natural killer ( NK ) cells <END> was investigated . 
The results indicate that stimulation of <START:ana> NK cells <END> , either freshly isolated from <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBL <END> ) or <START:ana> long-term cultured NK clones <END> , with specific cell targets results in an increased binding activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> measured by gel retardation . 
Pretreatment of <START:ana> NK cells <END> with the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbarmate ( PDTC ) leads to the inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation but the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding to DNA was superinduced . 
The inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by PDTC paralleled with an inhibition of spontaneous cytotoxicity mediated by <START:ana> NK cells <END> . 
Moreover , the inhibitors of <START:ggp> serine proteases <END> , N-alpha-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone and N-alpha-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone , also blocked the cytolytic activity of <START:ana> NK cells <END> against the sensitive target <START:ana> K562 <END> . 
In contrast , NK activity was not affected by pretreatment of the effector cells with the <START:ggp> proteasome <END> inhibitor N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal which selectively inhibits <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
Altogether , these results support the hypothesis that the activation of <START:ana> NK cells <END> involved transcriptional and post-transcriptional events , and that reactive intermediates may play an important role in the molecular processes related with the generation of a cytotoxic response by <START:ana> NK cells <END> . 
The predominant <START:ggp> E2F complex <END> in <START:ana> human primary haemopoietic cells <END> and in <START:ana> AML blasts <END> contains <START:ggp> E2F-4 <END> , <START:ggp> DP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> p130 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> E2F family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are thought to play an important role in the control of cell cycle progression . 
There is now also increasing evidence that some family members may act as <START:ggp> oncogenes <END> or <START:ggp> tumour suppressor genes <END> . 
The characterization of these proteins in <START:ana> human primary haemopoietic cells <END> and <START:ana> acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) blasts <END> may thus give an insight to the molecular mechanisms governing proliferation and leukaemogenesis in these cells . 
Therefore we analysed the expression of <START:ggp> E2F <END> -DNA binding activity and the constituent proteins found in the complexes in <START:ana> human primary haemopoietic cells <END> of various lineages . 
We also studied blasts from 18 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) . 
On electromobility shift assays ( EMSA ) a single <START:ggp> E2F-DNA binding complex <END> was detected in <START:ana> T cells <END> , <START:ana> B cells <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> which was shown to contain <START:ggp> E2F-4 <END> , <START:ggp> DP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> p130 <END> , indicating that all <START:ana> quiescent haemopoietic cells <END> have the same complex . 
Examination of 18 AML samples by EMSA revealed the presence of <START:ggp> E2F <END> binding and no gross abnormalities were detected . 
An <START:ggp> E2F-4/p130 complex <END> was detected in representative samples of all <START:ggp> FAB <END> types analysed . 
Thus abnormalities of <START:ggp> E2F <END> function are unlikely to play a primary pathogenic role in AML . 
Characterization of a <START:ana> mutant cell line <END> that does not activate <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in response to multiple stimuli . 
Numerous genes required during the immune or inflammation response as well as the adhesion process are regulated by <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) . 
Associated with its inhibitor , <START:ggp> I kappaB <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> resides as an inactive form in the cytoplasm . 
Upon stimulation by various agents , <START:ggp> I kappaB <END> is proteolyzed and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> translocates to the nucleus , where it activates its target genes . 
The transduction pathways that lead to <START:ggp> I kappaB <END> inactivation remain poorly understood . 
In this study , we have characterized a cellular mutant , the <START:ana> 70/Z3-derived 1.3E2 murine pre-B cell line <END> , that does not activate <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in response to several stimuli . 
We demonstrate that upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide , Taxol , phorbol myristate acetate , <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> , or <START:ana> double-stranded RNA <END> , <START:ggp> I kappaB alpha <END> is not degraded , as a result of an absence of induced phosphorylation on serines 32 and 36 . 
Neither a mutation in <START:ggp> I kappaB alpha <END> nor a mutation in <START:ggp> p50 <END> or <START:ggp> relA <END> , the two major subunits of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in this cell line , accounts for this phosphorylation defect . 
As well as culminating in the inducible phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappaB <END> alpha on serines 32 and 36 , all the stimuli that are inactive on <START:ana> 1.3E2 cells <END> exhibit a sensitivity to the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) . 
In contrast , stimuli such as hyperosmotic shock or phosphatase inhibitors , which use PDTC-insensitive pathways , induce <START:ggp> I kappaB <END> alpha degradation in <START:ana> 1.3E2 <END> . 
Analysis of the redox status of <START:ana> 1.3E2 <END> does not reveal any difference from <START:ana> wild-type 70Z/3 <END> . 
We also report that the <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) -derived Tax trans-activator <END> induces <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity in <START:ana> 1.3E2 <END> , suggesting that this viral protein does not operate via the defective pathway . 
Finally , we show that two other <START:ggp> I kappaB molecules <END> , <START:ggp> I kappaB beta <END> and the recently identified <START:ggp> I kappaB epsilon <END> , are not degraded in the <START:ana> 1.3E2 <END> cell line following stimulation . 
Our results demonstrate that <START:ana> 1.3E2 <END> is a <START:ggp> cellular transduction mutant <END> exhibiting a defect in a step that is required by several different stimuli to activate <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
In addition , this analysis suggests a common step in the signaling pathways that trigger <START:ggp> I kappaB alpha <END> , <START:ggp> I kappaB beta <END> , and <START:ggp> I kappaB epsilon <END> degradation . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> <START:ggp> /RelA <END> synergy in distinguishing T cell activation from <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> -induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 <END> transcription . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is an important <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> required for T cell proliferation and other immunological functions . 
The <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 gene <END> encodes a <START:ggp> 105-kD protein <END> that is the precursor of the <START:ggp> p50 component <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Previously , we and others have demonstrated that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> regulates the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 gene <END> . 
In this manuscript we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which <START:ana> T cell lines <END> stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and <START:ggp> phytohemagglutin <END> ( <START:ggp> PHA <END> ) display significantly higher levels of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 <END> encoding <START:ana> transcripts <END> than cells stimulated with <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> , despite the fact that both stimuli activate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Characterization of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 promoter <END> identified an <START:ggp> Egr-1 site <END> which was found to be essential for both the PMA/ <START:ggp> PHA <END> -mediated induction as well as the synergistic activation observed after the expression of the RelA subunit of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> induction was required for endogenous <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 <END> gene expression , since PMA/ <START:ana> PHA-stimulated T cell lines <END> expressing antisense <START:ana> Egr-1 RNA <END> were inhibited in their ability to upregulate NF-kappa B1 transcription . 
Our studies indicate that transcriptional synergy mediated by activation of both <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> may have important ramifications in T cell development by upregulating <START:ggp> NF-kappa B1 <END> gene expression . 
The synthesis and immunogenicity of <START:ggp> varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E <END> and <START:ggp> immediate-early protein <END> ( <START:ggp> IE62 <END> ) expressed in recombinant herpes simplex virus-1 . 
In order to evaluate the conditions for optimal expression and immunogenicity of <START:ggp> varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) proteins <END> in a herpes simplex virus-1 ( HSV-1 ) vector , we selected the <START:ggp> VZV glycoprotein E <END> ( <START:ggp> gE <END> ) , encoded by <START:ggp> ORF 68 <END> and the <START:ggp> VZV product <END> of <START:ggp> ORF 62 <END> , an <START:ggp> immediate-early major tegument protein <END> ( <START:ggp> IE62 <END> ) . 
Three <START:ggp> HSV/VZV recombinants <END> were generated : ( 1 ) <START:ggp> VZV gE protein coding sequences <END> along with the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> were inserted into the <START:ggp> thymidine kinase ( TK ) gene <END> of HSV-1 strain KOS ; ( 2 ) <START:ggp> VZV gE <END> expressed from the <START:ggp> HSV-1 ICP4 promoter <END> was inserted into the <START:ggp> glycoprotein C ( gC ) gene <END> of HSV-1 strain F ; and ( 3 ) <START:ggp> VZV IE62 protein coding sequences <END> under the control of the <START:ggp> HSV-1 ICP4 promoter <END> were inserted into the <START:ggp> gC gene <END> of HSV-1 strain F . 
Immunoblot analysis and immunoperoxidase staining of infected cell monolayers demonstrated vector expression of <START:ggp> VZV proteins <END> . 
Following intracranial inoculation in mice , both <START:ggp> VZV gE-HSV <END> ( <START:ggp> TK <END> ) and <START:ggp> VZV IE62-HSV <END> ( <START:ggp> gC <END> ) induced an <START:ggp> IgG <END> response against <START:ggp> VZV gE <END> or <START:ggp> VZV IE62 <END> . 
When tested in cytotoxicity assays using <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> from VZV immune human donors , the range of precursor frequencies for <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> that recognized <START:ggp> VZV gE <END> or <START:ggp> VZV IE62 <END> was similar whether these proteins were expressed by HSV-1 or a vaccinia vector . 
These experiments demonstrate that HSV-1 is a competent vector for expression of these <START:ggp> VZV proteins <END> and support the feasibility of engineering a combined vaccine for these closely related alpha-herpesviruses . 
Constitutive dephosphorylation and activation of a member of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> , <START:ggp> NF-AT1 <END> , in <START:ana> Tax-expressing and type I human T-cell leukemia virus-infected human T cells <END> . 
The tax gene product of the type I human T-cell leukemia virus ( HTLV-I ) transactivates <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene <END> through activation of an enhancer termed <START:ggp> CD28 responsive element <END> ( <START:ggp> CD28RE <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> activation of the <START:ggp> CD28RE <END> is partially mediated by a member of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> , <START:ggp> NF-AT1 <END> . 
We have previously shown that <START:ggp> NF-AT1 <END> is constitutively active in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> stably transfected with the <START:ggp> Tax cDNA <END> , although the underlying molecular mechanism and physiological relevance of this finding remain unclear . 
In this report , we demonstrate that the active form of <START:ggp> NF-AT1 <END> is also present in the nuclei of <START:ana> HTLV-I-transformed T cells <END> that express the <START:ggp> Tax protein <END> . 
Interestingly , the constitutive activation of <START:ggp> NF-AT1 <END> in these <START:ana> T cells <END> is associated with its dephosphorylation . 
Furthermore , the dephosphorylated <START:ggp> NF-AT1 <END> can be rapidly rephosphorylated when the cells are incubated with cyclosporin A , an immunosuppressant inhibiting the <START:ggp> serine/threonine phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
These results suggest that activation of <START:ggp> NF-AT1 <END> in <START:ana> Tax-expressing and HTLV-I-transformed T cells <END> results from its dephosphorylation , which in turn may be due to deregulation of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> 
Expression of <START:ggp> NFAT-family proteins <END> in <START:ana> normal human T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NFAT proteins <END> constitute a family of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> involved in mediating signal transduction . 
Using a panel of specific antisera in immunoprecipitation assays , we found that <START:ggp> NFATp <END> ( <START:ggp> 135 kDa <END> ) is constitutively expressed in <START:ana> normal human T cells <END> , while synthesis of <START:ggp> NFATc <END> ( predominant form of <START:ggp> 86 kDa <END> ) is induced by ionomycin treatment . 
<START:ggp> NFAT4/x <END> was very weakly expressed in unstimulated cells , and its level did not increase upon treatment with activating agents . 
<START:ggp> NFAT3 protein <END> was not observed under any conditions . 
<START:ggp> Higher-molecular-weight species <END> of <START:ggp> NFATc <END> ( of 110 and 140 kDa ) were also detected . 
In addition , translation of <START:ana> NFATc mRNA <END> apparently initiates at two different <START:ggp> AUG codons <END> , giving rise to proteins that differ in size by 36 amino acids . 
Additional size heterogeneity of both <START:ggp> NFATc <END> and <START:ggp> NFATp <END> results from phosphorylation . 
In contrast to ionomycin treatment , exposure of cells to phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) plus <START:ggp> anti-CD28 <END> did not induce <START:ggp> NFATc <END> , indicating that under these conditions , <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> synthesis by these cells is apparently independent of <START:ggp> NFATc <END> . 
In DNA binding assays , both PMA plus <START:ggp> anti-CD28 <END> and PMA plus ionomycin resulted in <START:ggp> nuclear NFAT <END> . 
Surprisingly , the PMA-ionomycin-induced synthesis of <START:ggp> NFATc <END> that was detected by immunoprecipitation was not mirrored in the DNA binding assays : nearly all of the activity was due to <START:ggp> NFATp <END> . 
This is the first study of expression of all family members at the protein level in <START:ana> normal human T cells <END> . 
Of the <START:ggp> GATA-binding proteins <END> , only <START:ggp> GATA-4 <END> selectively regulates the <START:ggp> human IL-5 gene promoter <END> in <START:ana> IL-5 producing cells <END> which express <START:ggp> multiple GATA-binding proteins <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-5 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> ) is produced by <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> and known to support B cell growth and eosinophilic differentiation of the <START:ana> progenitor cells <END> . 
Using <START:ana> ATL-16T cells <END> which express <START:ana> IL-5 mRNA <END> , we have identified a region , within the <START:ggp> human IL-5 gene promoter <END> , that regulates <START:ggp> IL-5 gene <END> transcription . 
This <START:ggp> cis-acting sequence <END> contains the <START:ggp> core binding motif <END> , ( A/T ) GATA ( A/G ) , for <START:ggp> GATA-binding family proteins <END> and thus suggests the involvement of these family members . 
In this report , we describe the cloning of <START:ggp> human GATA-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> hGATA-4 <END> ) and show that <START:ggp> hGATA-4 <END> selectively interacts with the <START:ggp> -70 GATA site <END> within the <START:ggp> IL-5 proximal promoter region <END> . 
By promoter deletion and mutation analyses , we established this region as a <START:ggp> positive regulatory element <END> . 
Cotransfection experiments revealed that both <START:ggp> hGATA-4 <END> and PMA/A23187 stimulation are necessary for the <START:ggp> IL-5 promoter <END> activation . 
The requirement of another <START:ggp> regulatory element <END> called <START:ggp> CLE0 <END> , which lies downstream of the <START:ggp> -70 GATA site <END> , was also demonstrated . 
<START:ana> ATL-16T cells <END> express <START:ana> mRNA <END> of three <START:ggp> GATA-binding proteins <END> , <START:ggp> hGATA-2 <END> , <START:ggp> hGATA-3 <END> and <START:ggp> hGATA-4 <END> , and each of them has a potential to bind to the <START:ggp> consensus ( A/T ) GATA ( G/ A ) motif <END> . 
However , using ATL-16T nuclear extract , we demonstrated that <START:ggp> GATA-4 <END> is the only <START:ggp> GATA-binding protein <END> that forms specific <START:ggp> DNA-protein complex <END> with the <START:ggp> -70 GATA site <END> . 
The electrophoretic mobility shift assay with extracts of <START:ana> COS cells <END> expressing <START:ggp> GATA-binding proteins <END> showed that <START:ggp> GATA-4 <END> has the highest binding affinity to the <START:ggp> -70 GATA site <END> among the three <START:ggp> GATA-binding proteins <END> . 
When the transactivation ability was compared among the three , <START:ggp> GATA-4 <END> showed the highest activity . 
These results demonstrate the selective role of <START:ggp> GATA-4 <END> in the transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> IL-5 gene <END> in a circumstance where multiple members of the <START:ggp> GATA-binding proteins <END> are expressed . 
Control of <START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> nuclear translocation by a <START:ggp> calcineurin-regulated inhibitory domain <END> . 
The <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) regulates <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> through <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> located in the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of several <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> , which is preferentially expressed in the thymus and <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocytes <END> , is one of four members of the <START:ggp> NFAT family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
We have performed domain analysis of <START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> by examining the effects of deletion mutations . 
We found that <START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> DNA binding activity and interaction with AP-1 polypeptides were dependent on its <START:ggp> central Rel similarity region <END> and that transcriptional activation was reduced by deletions of either its <START:ggp> N-terminal domain <END> or its <START:ggp> C-terminal domain <END> , suggesting the presence of <START:ggp> intrinsic transcriptional activation motifs <END> in both regions . 
We also identified a potent <START:ggp> inhibitory sequence <END> within its <START:ggp> N-terminal domain <END> . 
We show that the inactivation of the inhibition was dependent on the activity of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , a <START:ggp> calcium-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase <END> . 
We also show that <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> associated with the <START:ggp> N-terminal domain <END> of <START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> at <START:ggp> multiple docking sites <END> and caused a reduction of size , indicative of dephosphorylation , in <START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> . 
We have mapped the inhibitory activity to less than <START:ggp> 60 residues <END> , containing motifs that are conserved in all <START:ggp> NFAT proteins <END> . 
Finally , we demonstrate that deletion in <START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> of the mapped <START:ggp> 60 residues <END> leads to its nuclear translocation independent of calcium signaling . 
Our results support the model proposing that the <START:ggp> N-terminal domain <END> confers calcium-signaling dependence on <START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> transactivation activity by regulating its intracellular localization through a protein module that associates with <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> and is a target of its <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> activity . 
<START:ggp> Neuronal ( type I ) nitric oxide synthase <END> regulates <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> activity and <START:ggp> immunologic ( type II ) nitric oxide synthase <END> expression . 
Nitric oxide subserves diverse physiologic roles in the nervous system . 
NO is produced from at least three different <START:ggp> NO synthase ( NOS ) isoforms <END> : <START:ggp> neuronal NOS <END> ( <START:ggp> nNOS <END> ) , <START:ggp> endothelial NOS <END> , and <START:ggp> immunologic NOS <END> ( <START:ggp> iNOS <END> ) . 
We show that <START:ggp> nNOS <END> is the predominant isoform constitutively expressed in <START:ana> glia <END> . 
NO derived from <START:ggp> nNOS <END> in <START:ana> glia <END> inhibits the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF kappaB <END> ) as NOS inhibitors enhance basal <START:ggp> NF kappaB <END> activation . 
Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) is an inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF kappaB <END> in most cells ; however , we show that PDTC is also a potent scavenger of NO through formation of mononitrosyl iron complexes with PDTC . 
In <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , a human <START:ana> T-cell lymphoma cell line <END> , <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) induces <START:ggp> NF kappaB <END> activation that is inhibited by PDTC . 
Contrary to the results in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , PDTC did not inhibit <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> -induced <START:ggp> NF kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> astrocytes <END> ; instead PDTC itself induces <START:ggp> NF kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> astrocytes <END> , and this may be related to scavenging of endogenously produced NO by the PDTC iron complex . 
In <START:ana> astrocytes <END> PDTC also dramatically induces the <START:ggp> NF kappaB-dependent enzyme <END> , <START:ggp> iNOS <END> , supporting the physiologic relevance of endogenous NO regulation of <START:ggp> NF kappaB <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> glia <END> from mice lacking <START:ggp> nNOS <END> responds more rapidly to PDTC compared with <START:ana> astrocytes <END> from wild-type mice . 
Our data suggest that <START:ggp> nNOS <END> in <START:ana> astrocytes <END> regulates <START:ggp> NF kappaB <END> activity and <START:ggp> iNOS <END> expression , and indicate a novel regulatory role for <START:ggp> nNOS <END> in tonically suppressing central nervous system , <START:ggp> NF kappaB-regulated genes <END> . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> in <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> -induced <START:ggp> IgM <END> production in a <START:ana> human B-cell line <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-6 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ) is an important <START:ggp> B-cell growth and differentiation factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-6 <END> treatment of the <START:ana> human lymphoblastoid cell line <END> , <START:ana> SKW6.4 <END> , leads to increased <START:ggp> IgM <END> production . 
We have previously shown that <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> induces activation of <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> in <START:ana> human B cell lines <END> . 
A chimeric <START:ggp> IL-6 receptor <END> , comprised of the <START:ggp> intracellular tail <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-6 receptor subunit <END> <START:ggp> gp130 <END> fused to the <START:ggp> extracellular domain <END> of the <START:ggp> epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor <END> , was stably transfected into <START:ana> SKW6.4 cells <END> . 
EGF treatment induced <START:ggp> IgM <END> production in cells transfected with an intact <START:ggp> gp130 cytoplasmic tail <END> , but not in <START:ana> untransfected cells <END> or cells transfected with a <START:ggp> cytoplasmic tail <END> lacking all four <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat ) binding sites <END> . 
Moreover , EGF treatment induced <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> phosphorylation in cells transfected with the intact <START:ggp> chimeric EGF-gp130 receptor <END> along with induction of DNA-mobility shift of a <START:ggp> classical interferon-gamma-activated site <END> . 
To define further the relation between <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> activation and enhanced <START:ggp> IgM <END> production , we determined the effect of chimeric gp130 on the transcriptional activation of a genetic element linked to <START:ggp> immunoglobulin <END> production , namely the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer <END> ( <START:ggp> IgH-enhancer <END> ) . 
Parental as well as transfected <START:ana> SKW6.4 cells <END> were transiently transfected with an <START:ggp> IgH-enhancer-luciferase construct <END> . 
The transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> IgH-luciferase construct <END> was induced upon ligation of the <START:ggp> full-length chimeric receptor <END> but not by <START:ggp> truncated gp130 receptors <END> . 
Moreover , the <START:ggp> gp130 <END> -induced activity of this <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> was abrogated by <START:ggp> Stat3EE <END> , a mutant <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> incapable of binding DNA . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> -induced B-cell differentiation , as measured by <START:ggp> IgM <END> production , may be controlled by <START:ggp> Stat3 proteins <END> . 
<START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> from individuals with filarial inflammatory disease have increased transendothelial migration in vitro . 
The in vitro transendothelial migration of <START:ana> circulating filarial antigen-specific T-cells <END> was examined in Wuchereria banerofti infection . 
<START:ana> Circulating T-cells <END> from individuals with filaria-induced lymphatic pathology ( LP ) had significantly greater migration through unstimulated <START:ana> HUVEC monolayers <END> than did T-cells from asymptomatic infected ( MF ) individuals ( P = 0.04 ) . 
In contrast to the MF individuals where no effect was seen , transendothelial migration of 48-hr <START:ana> filarial antigen stimulated T-cells <END> from LP individuals was significantly ( P = 0.01 ) greater than migration of 48-hr <START:ana> media-stimulated T-cells <END> . 
In six of seven patients examined , inhibition of the VLA-4/ <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> pathway resulted in greater than 50 % inhibition of transendothelial migration of <START:ana> T-cells <END> . 
Transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> ferritin heavy-chain gene <END> : the activity of the <START:ggp> CCAAT binding factor NF-Y <END> is modulated in <START:ana> heme-treated Friend leukemia cells <END> and during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation . 
The <START:ggp> ferritin H-chain gene promoter <END> regulation was analyzed in <START:ana> heme-treated Friend leukemia cells <END> ( <START:ana> FLCs <END> ) and during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation . 
In the majority of <START:ana> cell lines <END> studied , the regulation of <START:ggp> ferritin <END> expression was exerted mostly at the translational level . 
However , in <START:ana> differentiating erythroid cells <END> , which must incorporate high levels of iron to sustain <START:ggp> hemoglobin <END> synthesis , and in <START:ana> macrophages <END> , which are involved in iron storage , transcriptional regulation seemed to be a relevant mechanism . 
We show here that the minimum region of the <START:ggp> ferritin H-gene promoter <END> that is able to confer transcriptional regulation by heme in <START:ana> FLCs <END> to a <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> is <START:ggp> 77 nucleotides upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> TATA box <END> . 
This <START:ggp> cis element <END> binds a protein complex referred to as <START:ggp> HRF <END> ( <START:ggp> heme-responsive factor <END> ) , which is greatly enhanced both in heme-treated <START:ana> FLCs <END> and during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation . 
The <START:ggp> CCAAT element <END> present in reverse orientation in this promoter region of the <START:ggp> ferritin H-chain gene <END> is necessary for binding and for gene activity , since a single point mutation is able to abolish the binding of <START:ggp> HRF <END> and the transcriptional activity in <START:ana> transfected cells <END> . 
By competition experiments and supershift assays , we identified the induced <START:ggp> HRF <END> as containing at least the ubiquitous <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-Y <END> is formed by three <START:ggp> subunits <END> , <START:ggp> A <END> , <START:ggp> B <END> , and <START:ggp> C <END> , all of which are necessary for DNA binding . 
Cotransfection with a <START:ggp> transdominant negative mutant <END> of the <START:ggp> NF-YA subunit <END> abolishes the transcriptional activation by <START:ggp> heme <END> , indicating that <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> plays an essential role in this activation . 
We have also observed a differential expression of the <START:ggp> NF-YA subunit <END> in heme-treated and control <START:ana> FLCs <END> and during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation . 
Concomitant downregulation of <START:ggp> IgH 3 ' enhancer <END> activity and <START:ggp> c-myc <END> expression in a plasmacytoma x fibroblast environment : implications for dysregulation of translocated <START:ggp> c-myc <END> . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) gene <END> expression is controlled by a <START:ggp> B cell-specific promoter <END> , <START:ggp> intronic enhancer <END> and additional <START:ggp> B cell-specific enhancer elements <END> identified recently in the 3 ' end of the <START:ggp> IgH locus <END> . 
One of the latter elements , the <START:ggp> IgH 3 ' enhancer <END> , is of particular interest : ( 1 ) it is B cell-specific and active only in late B cell development ; ( 2 ) in rodent plasmacytomas and in some human Burkitt 's lymphomas it is part of a <START:ggp> locus control region <END> ( <START:ggp> LCR <END> ) that is involved in deregulation of the <START:ggp> c-myc oncogene <END> as a result of translocation into the <START:ggp> IgH locus <END> ; and ( 3 ) it has been implicated in the mechanisms that control <START:ggp> Ig gene class <END> switch recombination . 
We have used a somatic cell hybridization approach to genetically analyse regulation of the activity of the <START:ggp> IgH 3 ' enhancer <END> . 
When <START:ana> mouse MPC11 plasmacytoma cells <END> , in which the <START:ggp> IgH 3 ' enhancer <END> is active , are fused with <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> , Ig expression is extinguished at the level of transcription . 
Here we show that in a <START:ana> MPC11 plasmacytoma x fibroblast environment <END> , the <START:ggp> IgH 3 ' enhancer <END> is transcriptionally inactive . 
Furthermore , we demonstrate that binding of several <START:ggp> B cell-specific transcription factors <END> , essential for <START:ggp> IgH 3 ' enhancer <END> activity , is lacking , which may explain 3 ' enhancer inactivity , although the binding of repressors can not be excluded . 
Moreover , the high expression level of <START:ggp> c-myc <END> , characteristic of the parental <START:ana> MPC11 cells <END> carrying the <START:ggp> t ( 12 ; 15 ) translocation <END> , is down-regulated in the hybrids to that in unfused <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
Therefore , inactivation of the <START:ggp> IgH 3 ' enhancer <END> is a multifactorial process affecting several <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that control the cell-specific and developmental activity of the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> in a <START:ana> T-lymphocytic cell line <END> by hypochlorous acid . 
Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) such as hydrogen peroxide serve as second messengers in the induction of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , and hence in the activation and replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) in <START:ana> human cells <END> . 
During inflammatory reactions , many oxidative species are produced , one of which is hypochlorous acid ( HOCl ) , which is responsible for the microbicidal effects of activated <START:ana> human polymorphonuclear leukocytes <END> . 
Treatment of a <START:ana> T-lymphocytic cell line <END> with micromolar concentrations of HOCl promoted the appearance of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ( the <START:ggp> heterodimer p50/p65 <END> ) in the nucleus of the cells , even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis . 
Western blot analysis of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB inhibitory subunits <END> ( <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> ) demonstrated that both <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> -alpha proteolysis and <START:ggp> p105 <END> processing were induced by the treatment . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation was very effective when cells were subjected to hyperthermia before being treated with HOCl . 
Various antioxidants , such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , p-bromophenacyl-bromide and nordihydroguaiaretic acid could strongly reduce <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> translocation , demonstrating the importance of oxidative species in the transduction mechanism . 
Moreover , <START:ana> ACH-2 cells <END> treated with HOCl or H2O2 released <START:ggp> tumour necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) in the supernatants . 
The importance of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release in <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> induction by HOCl or H2O2 was demonstrated by the fact that : ( 1 ) the nuclear appearance of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> was promoted in <START:ana> untreated cells <END> ; and ( 2 ) synergism between <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and HOCl was detected . 
Collectively , these results suggest that HOCl should be considered as an oxidative species capable of inducing <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in a <START:ana> T-lymphocytic cell line <END> through a transduction mechanism involving ROS , and having a long-distance effect through subsequent <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release . 
Rapid Ca2+-mediated activation of <START:ggp> Rap1 <END> in <START:ana> human platelets <END> . 
<START:ggp> Rap1 <END> is a small , <START:ggp> Ras-like GTPase <END> whose function and regulation are still largely unknown . 
We have developed a novel assay to monitor the active , <START:ggp> GTP-bound form <END> of <START:ggp> Rap1 <END> based on the differential affinity of <START:ggp> Rap1GTP <END> and <START:ggp> Rap1GDP <END> for the <START:ggp> Rap binding domain <END> of <START:ggp> RalGDS <END> ( <START:ggp> RBD <END> ) . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> blood platelets <END> with <START:ggp> alpha-thrombin <END> or other platelet activators caused a rapid and strong induction of <START:ggp> Rap1 <END> that associated with <START:ggp> RBD <END> in vitro . 
Binding to <START:ggp> RBD <END> increased from undetectable levels in <START:ana> resting platelets <END> to > 50 % of total <START:ggp> Rap1 <END> within 30 s after stimulation . 
An increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration is both necessary and sufficient for <START:ggp> Rap1 <END> activation since it was induced by agents that increase intracellular Ca2+ and inhibited by a Ca2+-chelating agent . 
Neither inhibition of translocation of <START:ggp> Rap1 <END> to the cytoskeleton nor inhibition of platelet aggregation affected <START:ggp> thrombin <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> Rap1 <END> . 
In contrast , prostaglandin I2 ( PGI2 ) , a strong negative regulator of <START:ana> platelet <END> function , inhibited agonist-induced as well as Ca2+-induced activation of <START:ggp> Rap1 <END> . 
From our results , we conclude that <START:ggp> Rap1 <END> activation in <START:ana> platelets <END> is an important common event in early agonist-induced signalling , and that this activation is mediated by an increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration 
Physical interactions between <START:ggp> Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins <END> play an important role in their cooperative activation of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus enhancer <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory elements <END> of many <START:ggp> inducible T-cell genes <END> contain adjacent or <START:ggp> overlapping binding sites <END> for the <START:ggp> Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT families <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Similar arrays of functionally important <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/NFAT and Ets binding sites <END> are present in the <START:ggp> transcriptional enhancers <END> of human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 ( HIV-1 and HIV-2 ) , suggesting that this pattern of <START:ggp> nuclear protein binding sites <END> reflects an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for regulating inducible T-cell gene expression that has been co-opted during HIV evolution . 
Despite these findings , the molecular mechanisms by which <START:ggp> Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins <END> cooperatively regulate inducible T-cell gene expression remained unknown . 
In the studies described in this report , we demonstrated a physical interaction between multiple <START:ggp> Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins <END> both in vitro and in <START:ana> activated normal human T cells <END> . 
This interaction is mediated by the <START:ggp> Ets domain <END> of <START:ggp> Ets proteins <END> and the C-terminal region of the Rel homology domains of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins <END> . 
In addition , the <START:ggp> Ets <END> - <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> / <START:ggp> NFAT <END> interaction requires the presence of <START:ggp> DNA binding sites <END> for both proteins , as it is abolished by the DNA intercalating agents propidium iodide and ethidium bromide and enhanced by the presence of synthetic oligonucleotides containing <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> Ets <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB proteins <END> . 
A dominant-negative mutant of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB p50 <END> that binds DNA but fails to interact with <START:ggp> Ets proteins <END> inhibits the synergistic activation of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 and HIV-2 enhancers <END> by <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> p50 <END> + <START:ggp> p65 <END> ) and <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> , suggesting that physical interaction between <START:ggp> Ets <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB proteins <END> is required for the transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 and HIV-2 enhancers <END> . 
Taken together , these findings suggest that evolutionarily conserved physical interactions between <START:ggp> Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins <END> are important in regulating the inducible expression of <START:ggp> T-cell genes <END> and viruses . 
These interactions represent a potential target for the development of novel immunosuppressive and antiviral therapies . 
An <START:ggp> acute myeloid leukemia gene <END> , <START:ggp> AML1 <END> , regulates transcriptional activation and hemopoietic myeloid cell differentiation antagonistically by two alternative spliced forms . 
The <START:ggp> AML1 gene <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 21 <END> is disrupted in the <START:ggp> ( 8 ; 21 ) ( q22 ; q22 ) and ( 3 ; 21 ) ( q26 ; q22 ) translocations <END> associated with myelogenous leukemias and encodes a <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> . 
From <START:ggp> AML1 gene <END> , two representative forms of proteins , <START:ggp> AML1a <END> and <START:ggp> AML1b <END> , are produced by an alternative splicing . 
Both forms have <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> , but <START:ggp> AML1a <END> lacks a putative transcriptional activation domain which <START:ggp> AML1b <END> has . 
Here we demonstrate that <START:ggp> AML1a <END> , which solely has no effects as a transcriptional regulator , dominantly suppresses transcriptional activation by <START:ggp> AML1b <END> , and that <START:ggp> AML1a <END> exhibits the higher affinity for DNA-binding than <START:ggp> AML1b <END> . 
Furthermore a <START:ggp> dominant negative form <END> of <START:ggp> AML1 <END> , <START:ggp> AML1a <END> , totally suppressed granulocytic differentiation otherwise induced by <START:ggp> granulocyte colony-stimulating factor <END> when <START:ggp> AML1a <END> was overexpressed in <START:ana> 32Dc13 murine myeloid cells <END> . 
Such differentiation block by <START:ggp> AML1a <END> was canceled by the concomitant overexpression of <START:ggp> AML1b <END> . 
These data strongly suggest that a transcriptionally active form of <START:ggp> AML1 <END> is essential for the myeloid cell differentiation . 
In addition , we observed an altered expression level of <START:ggp> AML1 <END> along with the myeloid differentiation in several <START:ana> hemopoietic cell lines <END> . 
In these cases , at least , the <START:ggp> AML1 <END> expression level is a potential regulator for myeloid cell differentiation . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor-kappa B <END> potently up-regulates the promoter activity of <START:ggp> RANTES <END> , a chemokine that blocks HIV infection . 
The complex network of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> that are involved in inflammatory and immunoregulatory responses plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection . 
<START:ggp> RANTES <END> ( <START:ggp> regulated upon activation , normal T cell expressed and secreted <END> ) is a <START:ggp> cytokine <END> that belongs to the <START:ggp> beta-chemokine family <END> ; it is chemoattractant for <START:ana> CD4+/CD45RO T cells <END> , it is produced by various cell types including <START:ana> CD8+ and CD4+ T cells <END> as well as <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> , and has recently been shown to suppress replication of macrophage-tropic strains of HIV in <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> . 
To investigate the molecular mechanisms of <START:ggp> RANTES <END> expression , the <START:ggp> RANTES promoter region <END> was analyzed by transient expression and gel-mobility shift assays . 
We demonstrate that : 1 ) <START:ggp> RANTES <END> promoter activity is up-regulated by PMA plus ionomycin , coexpression of the <START:ggp> p65 subunit <END> of <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> , the <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> , and the <START:ggp> CD28 <END> costimulatory pathway ; 2 ) the <START:ggp> RANTES promoter region <END> contains four <START:ggp> NF-kappa B binding sites <END> at <START:ggp> positions -30 , -44 , -213 , and -579 <END> relative to the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> ; 3 ) one site ( -213 ) is an <START:ggp> NF-AT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) binding site <END> that also has weak affinity to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , and the most distal site ( -579 ) also serves as a <START:ggp> CD28-responsive element <END> ; and 4 ) mutation on any of those <START:ggp> NF-kappa B sites <END> or coexpression of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-kappa B <END> ) markedly reduced the promoter activity . 
Thus , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , a potent transcriptional activator of HIV expression , is also involved in the expression of <START:ggp> RANTES <END> , a <START:ggp> chemokine <END> that blocks infection by macrophage-tropic strains of HIV . 
Pivotal role for the <START:ggp> NFIL3/E4BP4 transcription factor <END> in <START:ggp> interleukin 3 <END> -mediated survival of <START:ana> pro-B lymphocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> E2A-HLF ( hepatic leukemia factor ) oncoprotein <END> , generated in <START:ana> pro-B lymphocytes <END> by fusion of the <START:ggp> trans-activation domain <END> of <START:ggp> E2A <END> to the <START:ggp> basic region/leucine zipper ( bZIP ) domain <END> of <START:ggp> HLF <END> , functions as an <START:ggp> anti-apoptotic transcription factor <END> in leukemic cell transformation . 
When introduced into <START:ggp> interleukin 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> ) -dependent mouse <START:ana> pro-B lymphocytes <END> , <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> prevents apoptosis induced by <START:ggp> growth factor <END> deprivation , suggesting that <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> mediates cell survival through activation of a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> whose activity can be constitutively replaced by the <START:ggp> chimeric oncoprotein <END> . 
We considered four <START:ggp> bZIP transcription factors <END> as candidates for this putative <START:ggp> IL-3-regulated factor <END> , each of which binds avidly to the <START:ggp> DNA consensus sequence <END> recognized by <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> and is related to the <START:ggp> Caenorhabditis elegans CES-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> cell death specification protein <END> ) <START:ggp> neuron-specific mediator of cell death <END> . 
The expression and binding activity of the <START:ggp> Nfil3 protein <END> ( also called <START:ggp> E4bp4 <END> ) , but not of <START:ggp> Hlf <END> , <START:ggp> Dbp <END> , or <START:ggp> Tef <END> , was found to be regulated by <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> in <START:ana> mouse pro-B cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> Baf-3 <END> and <START:ana> FL5.12 <END> ) . 
Northern blot analysis showed that <START:ggp> Nfil3/E4bp4 <END> is regulated as a <START:ggp> `` delayed-early '' IL-3-responsive gene <END> , requiring de novo protein synthesis . 
In the absence of <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> , enforced expression of the <START:ggp> human NFIL3/E4BP4 cDNA <END> promoted the survival but not the growth of <START:ana> IL-3-dependent pro-B cells <END> . 
Our results implicate <START:ggp> NFIL3/E4BP4 <END> ( <START:ggp> nuclear factor regulated by IL-3/adenovirus E4 promoter binding protein <END> ) in a distinct growth factor-regulated signaling pathway that is responsible for the survival of <START:ana> early B-cell progenitors <END> , and whose alteration by <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> leads to childhood B lineage leukemia . 
Detection of adenovirus DNA in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> by polymerase chain reaction assay . 
Adenovirus can establish persistent infections which may reactivate and cause disease in immunocompromised hosts . 
<START:ana> Lymphocytes <END> have been postulated to serve as a site of adenoviral persistence based upon the ability to isolate adenovirus from tonsils and to detect adenovirus DNA by Southern blot hybridization in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) . 
To test this hypothesis , a more sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay was developed to detect adenovirus DNA . 
Two sets of nested primers were designed to conserved sequences in the <START:ggp> adenovirus E1A and hexon genes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> E1A and hexon primers <END> amplified DNA from representative adenoviral serotypes in all six adenoviral groups ( A-F ) . 
Both primers detected a single copy of the <START:ggp> adenovirus type 2 genome <END> but were less sensitive for the group B type 35 . 
None of 33 <START:ana> PBMC specimens <END> from healthy adults and only one of 40 pediatric samples was positive ( at a low level ) for adenovirus DNA by nested PCR assay . 
In comparison , <START:ana> PBMC <END> from two children with fatal adenoviral infection were both strongly positive for adenovirus DNA . 
It is concluded that , in contrast to a previous study , <START:ana> PBMC <END> are not a common site of persistent group C adenoviral infection . 
In addition , assay of <START:ana> PBMC <END> by the adenovirus-specific PCR may help detect early invasive disease and warrants further evaluation . 
Common and distinct intracellular signaling pathways in <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> utilized by <START:ggp> platelet activating factor <END> and <START:ggp> FMLP <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> with <START:ggp> chemoattractants <END> <START:ggp> FMLP <END> or <START:ggp> platelet activating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> PAF <END> ) results in different but overlapping functional responses . 
We questioned whether these differences might reflect patterns of intracellular signal transduction . 
Stimulation with either <START:ggp> PAF <END> or <START:ggp> FMLP <END> resulted in equivalent phosphorylation and activation of the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPk ) homologue <END> <START:ggp> 38-kD murine MAP kinase <END> homologous to <START:ggp> HOG-1 ( p38 ) MAPk <END> . 
Neither <START:ggp> FMLP <END> nor <START:ggp> PAF <END> activated <START:ggp> c-jun NH2-terminal MAPk <END> ( <START:ggp> JNKs <END> ) . 
Under identical conditions , <START:ggp> FMLP <END> but not <START:ggp> PAF <END> , resulted in significant <START:ggp> p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk <END> activation . 
Both <START:ggp> FMLP <END> and <START:ggp> PAF activated MAP kinase kinase-3 <END> ( <START:ggp> MKK3 <END> ) , a known activator of <START:ggp> p38 MAPk <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> MAP ERK kinase kinase-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> MEKK1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> Raf <END> are activated strongly by <START:ggp> FMLP <END> , but minimally by <START:ggp> PAF <END> . 
<START:ggp> Pertussis toxin <END> blocked <START:ggp> FMLP <END> -induced activation of the <START:ggp> p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk <END> cascade , but not that of <START:ggp> p38 MAPk <END> . 
A specific <START:ggp> p38 MAPk <END> inhibitor ( SK & F 86002 ) blocked superoxide anion production in response to <START:ggp> FMLP <END> and reduced adhesion and chemotaxis in response to <START:ggp> PAF <END> or <START:ggp> FMLP <END> . 
These results demonstrate distinct patterns of intracellular signaling for two <START:ggp> chemoattractants <END> and suggest that selective activation of intracellular signaling cascades may underlie different patterns of functional responses . 
Cloning of the <START:ggp> novel human myeloid-cell-specific C/EBP-epsilon transcription factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> Chicken NF-M transcription factor <END> , in cooperation with either <START:ggp> c-Myb <END> or <START:ggp> v-Myb <END> , is active in the combinatorial activation of <START:ggp> myeloid-cell-specific genes <END> in <START:ana> heterologous cell types <END> , such as <START:ana> embryonic fibroblasts <END> . 
In humans , similar effects were observed with homologous members of the <START:ggp> CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ( C/EBP ) family <END> of <START:ggp> transcriptional regulators <END> , especially the human homolog of <START:ggp> chicken NF-M <END> , <START:ggp> C/EBP-beta <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> ) . 
However , the <START:ggp> NF-IL6 gene <END> is expressed in a variety of nonmyeloid cell types and is strongly inducible in response to inflammatory stimuli , making it an unlikely candidate to have an exclusive role as a combinatorial differentiation switch during myelopoiesis in <START:ana> human cells <END> . 
By using a reverse transcription-PCR-based approach and a set of primers specific for the <START:ggp> DNA-binding domains <END> of highly homologous members of the <START:ggp> C/EBP family <END> of <START:ggp> transcriptional regulators <END> , we have cloned a <START:ggp> novel human gene <END> encoding a member of the <START:ggp> C/EBP gene family <END> , identified as the human homolog of <START:ggp> CRP1 <END> , <START:ggp> C/EBP-epsilon <END> . 
A <START:ggp> 1.2-kb cDNA <END> encoding full-length <START:ggp> human C/EBP-epsilon <END> was cloned from a <START:ggp> promyelocyte-late myeloblast-derived lambda gt11 library <END> . 
Molecular analysis of the cDNA and genomic clones indicated the presence of two <START:ggp> exons <END> encoding a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa and a pI of 9.5 . 
Primer extension analysis of <START:ana> C/EBP-epsilon mRNA <END> detected a single major <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> approximately 200 bp upstream of the <START:ggp> start codon <END> . 
The putative promoter area is similar to those of several other myeloid-cell-specific genes in that it contains no <START:ggp> TATAAA box <END> but has a number of <START:ggp> purine-rich stretches <END> with multiple sites for the factors of the <START:ggp> Ets family <END> of <START:ggp> transcriptional regulators <END> . 
Northern blot analyses indicated a highly restricted mRNA expression pattern , with the strongest expression occurring in <START:ana> promyelocyte and late-myeloblast-like cell lines <END> . 
Western blot and immunoprecipitation studies using <START:ggp> rabbit anti-C/EBP-epsilon antibodies <END> raised against the <START:ggp> N-terminal portion <END> of <START:ggp> C/EBP-epsilon <END> ( <START:ggp> amino acids 1 to 115 <END> ) showed that <START:ggp> C/EBP-epsilon <END> is a <START:ggp> 32-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein <END> . 
The human <START:ggp> C/EBP-epsilon <END> protein exhibited strong and specific binding to <START:ggp> double-stranded DNA containing consensus C/EBP sites <END> . 
Cotransfection of the <START:ggp> C/EBP-epsilon <END> sense and antisense expression constructs together with <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter vectors <END> containing <START:ggp> myeloid-cell-specific c-mim and human myeloperoxidase promoters <END> suggested a role for <START:ggp> C/EBP-epsilon <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> in the regulation of a subset of <START:ggp> myeloid-cell-specific genes <END> . 
Transient tranfection of a <START:ana> promyelocyte cell line <END> ( <START:ana> NB4 <END> ) with a <START:ggp> C/EBP-epsilon expression plasmid <END> increased cell growth by sevenfold , while antisense <START:ggp> C/EBP-epsilon <END> caused a fivefold decrease in clonal growth of these cells . 
The <START:ggp> tumour associated cell surface antigen <END> <START:ggp> A6H <END> is costimulatory for <START:ana> human CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> A6H monoclonal antibody <END> ( mAb ) recognizes a <START:ggp> 120 , 000-140 , 000 MW antigen <END> that is expressed at similar densities on 85-90 % of human <START:ana> CD4+ and CD8+ T cells <END> and on renal cell carcinomas . 
The binding of the <START:ggp> A6H mAb <END> induced a costimulatory signal in <START:ana> anti-CD3 activated T cells <END> . 
In the present report , we show that <START:ggp> A6H <END> costimulated cell proliferation and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production in purified <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> . 
Unexpectedly , the <START:ana> CD8+ T-cell subpopulation <END> failed to respond . 
<START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> costimulated with the <START:ggp> A6H mAb <END> upregulated <START:ggp> CD80 <END> , <START:ggp> CD86 <END> , <START:ggp> CD71 <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) R alpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2R gamma <END> , while no corresponding up-regulation of these <START:ggp> cell surface molecules <END> was seen in <START:ana> CD8+ T cells <END> . 
In order to investigate the nature of the <START:ggp> A6H mAb <END> costimulus at the transcriptional level we have examined induction of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> OCT-1 <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> which are known to be <START:ggp> transcriptional regulators <END> of several <START:ggp> cytokine <END> and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> receptor genes , including the <START:ggp> IL-2 and IL-2R genes <END> . 
Co-ligation of the <START:ggp> A6H <END> antigen and the <START:ggp> CD3 complex <END> induced expression of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> in <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> , whereas no increase in <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> octamer-binding ( Oct ) proteins <END> was seen compared to <START:ana> T cells <END> stimulated with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> alone . 
Furthermore , no induction of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> was seen in <START:ggp> A6H <END> costimulated <START:ana> CD8+ T cells <END> . 
These results suggests that both proximal steps in CD8+ T-cell activation as well as the later phases are unresponsive to <START:ggp> A6H <END> ligation . 
Molecular differences of the <START:ggp> A6H molecule <END> or distinct regulation of the <START:ggp> A6H <END> transduced <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activation pathway may exist in <START:ana> CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations <END> . 
Cloning and expression of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> from the squirrel monkey ( Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis ) , a glucocorticoid-resistant primate . 
New World primates such as the squirrel monkey have elevated cortisol levels and glucocorticoid resistance . 
We have shown that the apparent binding affinity of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> in <START:ana> squirrel monkey lymphocytes <END> is 5-fold lower than that in <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> ( apparent Kd , 20.9 +/- 1.8 and 4.3 +/- 0.2 nmol/L , respectively ; n = 3 ) , consistent with previous studies in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> isolated from the two species . 
As a first step in understanding the mechanism of decreased binding affinity in New World primates , we used reverse transcription-PCR to clone the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> from squirrel monkey liver and have compared the sequence to receptor sequences obtained from owl monkey liver , <START:ana> cotton-top tamarin B95-8 cells <END> , and <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> . 
The squirrel monkey <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> is approximately 97 % identical in nucleotide and amino acid sequence to the <START:ggp> human receptor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> ligand-binding domain <END> ( <START:ggp> amino acids 528-777 <END> ) of the squirrel monkey <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> contains four amino acid differences ( Ser551 to Thr , Ser616 to Ala , Ala618 to Ser , and Ile761 to Leu ) , all of which are present in <START:ggp> owl monkey and cotton-top tamarin receptors <END> . 
The <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> ( <START:ggp> amino acids 421-486 <END> ) is completely conserved among <START:ggp> human , squirrel monkey , owl monkey , and cotton-top tamarin receptors <END> . 
Twenty-two differences from the human sequence were found in the <START:ggp> N-terminal region <END> ( <START:ggp> amino acids 1-421 <END> ) of the squirrel monkey receptor . 
None of the substitutions in the <START:ggp> ligand-binding domain <END> matched mutations known to influence binding affinity in other species . 
To determine whether the substitutions per se were responsible for decreased affinity , squirrel monkey and <START:ggp> human glucocorticoid receptors <END> were expressed in the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System . 
Expressions of human and squirrel monkey <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> and a <START:ggp> squirrel monkey receptor <END> in which Phe774 was mutated to Leu ( F774L ) were similar . 
When expressed in the TNT System , squirrel monkey and <START:ggp> human glucocorticoid receptors <END> had similar , high affinity binding for dexamethasone ( apparent Kd , 5.9 +/- 1.2 and 4.3 +/- 0.5 nmol/L , respectively ; n = 3 ) , whereas the <START:ggp> squirrel monkey F774L receptor <END> had lower affinity binding ( apparent Kd , 20.4 +/- 2.0 nmol/L ; n = 3 ) . 
Thus , substitutions within the <START:ggp> ligand-binding domain <END> of the squirrel monkey <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> can not account for the decreased binding affinity of these receptors in <START:ana> squirrel monkey cells <END> . 
Rather , the binding affinity is probably influenced by the expression of <START:ggp> cytosolic factors <END> that affect <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> function . 
Shared <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) subunit <END> within the <START:ggp> human interleukin-7 receptor complex <END> . 
A molecular basis for the pathogenesis of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency . 
Genetic evidence suggests that mutations in the <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) receptor subunit <END> cause X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( X-SCID ) . 
The <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) subunit <END> can be employed in <START:ggp> receptor complexes <END> for <START:ggp> IL-2 , -4 , -7 , -9 , and -15 <END> , and the multiple signaling defects that would result from a defective <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) chain <END> in these receptors are proposed to cause the severe phenotype of X-SCID patients . 
Interestingly , gene disruption of either <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> or the <START:ggp> IL-7 receptor ( IL-7R ) alpha subunit <END> in mice leads to immunological defects that are similar to human X-SCID . 
These observations suggest the functional importance of <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-7R complex <END> . 
In the present study , structure/function analyses of the <START:ggp> IL-7R complex <END> using a <START:ggp> chimeric receptor <END> system demonstrated that <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> is indeed critical for <START:ggp> IL-7R <END> function . 
Nonetheless , only a limited portion of the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> of <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> is necessary for <START:ggp> IL-7R <END> signal transduction . 
Furthermore , replacement of the <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> by a <START:ggp> severely truncated erythropoeitin receptor <END> does not affect measured <START:ggp> IL-7R <END> signaling events . 
These findings support a model in which <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> serves primarily to activate signal transduction by the <START:ggp> IL-7R complex <END> , while <START:ggp> IL-7R alpha <END> determines specific signaling events through its association with <START:ggp> cytoplasmic signaling molecules <END> . 
Finally , these studies are consistent with the hypothesis that the molecular pathogenesis of X-SCID is due primarily to <START:ggp> gamma ( c ) <END> -mediated defects in the <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> <START:ggp> /IL-7R <END> system 
S-allyl cysteine inhibits activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
Reactive oxygen species are involved in signal transduction pathways leading to <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) activation which has been implicated in the regulation of gene transcription . 
We recently reported that a garlic compound , S-allyl cysteine ( SAC ) , protects <START:ana> bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells <END> from oxidant injury induced by hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) . 
In this study we determined the effects of SAC on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> ) induced by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF- alpha <END> ) and H2O2 . 
Activated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in nuclear extracts was measured by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using <START:ggp> 32P-labeled probe <END> . 
SAC consistently exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation induced by both <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and H2O2 . 
Supershift with specific antibodies to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B subunits <END> confirmed that the inducible retarded bands observed in the EMSA and <START:ggp> p65-p50 heterodimer <END> of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel protein <END> . 
Our data suggest that SAC may act via antioxidant mechanisms to block <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Elf-2 <END> , a <START:ggp> rhombotin-2 binding ets transcription factor <END> : discovery and potential role in T cell leukemia . 
<START:ggp> Rhombotin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> RBTN-2 <END> ) is a <START:ggp> proto-oncogene <END> only in the context of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
We postulated that the oncogenic effect of <START:ggp> RBTN-2 <END> in T cells is likely mediated by <START:ggp> binding protein <END> ( s ) with T cell-specific expression . 
By screening a T cell <START:ggp> cDNA library <END> , we identified a <START:ggp> novel ets transcription factor <END> that binds <START:ggp> RBTN-2 <END> . 
This protein was named <START:ggp> elf-2 <END> because its <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> is virtually identical to that of <START:ggp> ets family member <END> <START:ggp> elf-1 <END> . 
Northern analyses showed similar levels of two <START:ana> elf-2 transcripts <END> ( 3.5 kb and 3.8 kb ) in all tissues except thymus . 
<START:ana> Thymocytes <END> expressed four- to 10-fold greater amounts of the <START:ana> 3.5 kb transcript <END> than other tissues . 
Sequence analyses of <START:ggp> cDNA clones <END> indicated that these transcripts encode proteins differing only at their <START:ggp> amino termini <END> , and likely represent alternatively spliced isoforms . 
These isoforms ( <START:ggp> elf-2a <END> and <START:ggp> elf-2b <END> ) contain identical <START:ggp> RBTN-2 binding regions <END> and <START:ggp> DNA-binding domains <END> . 
<START:ggp> Elf-2b <END> lacks a <START:ggp> putative transactivation domain <END> . 
The expression patterns suggest that <START:ggp> RBTN-2 <END> normally interacts equally with <START:ggp> elf-2a <END> and <START:ggp> elf-2b <END> . 
In contrast , when <START:ggp> RBTN-2 <END> is inappropriately expressed in <START:ana> T cells <END> , <START:ggp> RBTN-2 <END> would interact predominantly with <START:ggp> elf-2b <END> ; this interaction may lead to T cell proliferation . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor <END> effects on chromosome constitution of <START:ana> cell hybrids <END> . 
When <START:ana> immunoglobulin ( Ig ) -secreting plasmacytomas <END> are fused to a <START:ana> T-cell lymphoma <END> , <START:ggp> Ig gene <END> expression ceases in greater than 95 % of the resulting hybrids . 
In the rare hybrids that continue to express Ig , all other tested <START:ggp> B lymphocyte-specific genes <END> also remain active . 
The low frequency with which these <START:ana> Ig-expressing hybrids <END> are recovered , along with the fact that cell fusions can lead to chromosome loss , led us to propose that this rare phenotype was due to loss of a <START:ggp> T-cell-derived chromosome encoding a factor <END> or factors with gene silencing activity . 
To identify the relevant chromosome , we have used a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -assisted method of chromosome mapping to analyze both <START:ana> Ig-silenced ( common ) and Ig-expressing ( rare ) hybrids <END> . 
Although no single chromosome was found to correlate with <START:ggp> Ig gene <END> silencing , we discovered that the two types of hybrids had undergone distinct patterns of chromosome loss . 
Moreover , we found that ectopic expression of a <START:ggp> B-cell-specific transcription factor <END> ( <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> ) dramatically altered both the phenotype and chromosome constitution of hybrids arising in these cell fusions . 
Reactivation of Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection from latency by expression of the <START:ggp> ORF 50 transactivator <END> , a homolog of the <START:ggp> EBV R protein <END> . 
Kaposi 's sarcoma ( KS ) -associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) , or human herpesvirus 8 , is a lymphotropic virus strongly linked to several AIDS-related neoplasms . 
The primary reservoir of infection consists of latently infected <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> and possibly other <START:ana> mononuclear cells <END> . 
Viral reactivation from latency and spread from this lymphoid reservoir is presumably required for development of nonlymphoid tumors like KS . 
Here we show that deregulated expression of a single <START:ggp> viral gene <END> , <START:ggp> ORF 50 <END> , which encodes a transactivator able to selectively upregulate <START:ggp> delayed-early viral genes <END> , suffices to disrupt latency and induce the lytic gene cascade in <START:ana> latently infected B cells <END> . 
The identification of this gene opens the way to studies of the physiologic mechanisms controlling reactvation of KSHV from latency .

<START:ggp> Nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> are insufficient for <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activation : requirement for <START:ggp> CD28 <END> up-regulation of <START:ggp> RE/AP <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> gene transcription in <START:ana> T cells <END> requires both TCR and costimulatory signals . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activation in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> stimulated with superantigen presented by <START:ana> Raji B cells <END> requires <START:ggp> CD28 <END> activation . 
The addition of rCTLA4Ig , which blocks <START:ggp> CD28 <END> binding to its ligand , to the cultures decreased <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activation by > 80 % . 
Interestingly , CTLA4Ig did not significantly inhibit the activation of either <START:ggp> NF of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) or <START:ggp> AP-1 reporters <END> . 
Therefore , activation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> is insufficient for <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activation . 
In contrast , an <START:ggp> RE/AP <END> reporter was blocked by CTLA4Ig by > 90 % . 
Thus , the requirement for <START:ggp> CD28 <END> in <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activation appears to be due to <START:ggp> RE/AP <END> and not the <START:ggp> NFAT or AP-1 sites <END> . 
In addition , these data suggest that transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> RE/AP <END> is not mediated by <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , because activation of a <START:ggp> NFAT <END> reporter is not affected by the addition of CTLA4Ig . 
The control of lytic replication of Epstein-Barr virus in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> ( Review ) . 
Uncontrolled replication of a virus , which is harmful to the host is also disadvantageous to the virus . 
Most viruses can not compete with the various immune mechanisms and become eliminated in the course of infection . 
Therefore , only the time between infection and eradication remains for these viruses to proliferate . 
A few viruses , like the Herpesviruses or the papillomaviruses , however , have developed a sophisticated strategy for persisting lifelong , usually asymptomatically in the host , hiding from the immune system and producing infectious progeny at the same time . 
This strategy depends on a separation of latency and the lytic replication , either by time due to differentiation-dependent mechanisms or by spatial separation as the result of different host cell types . 
Both are true for the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) . 
<START:ana> B cells <END> and <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> have a pivotal role in the life cycle of the virus . 
The former can become latently infected and are thought to be the virus reservoir in vivo , whereas the latter were shown to be permissive for lytic replication . 
However , replication of EBV in vivo is controlled primarily by host immune mechanisms selecting for cells that are not permissive for viral replication as the result of a particular set of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
These factors control the activity of the <START:ggp> regulatory immediate-early genes <END> and , in addition , lytic and latent cycle regulatory genes negatively interfere with each other and thus link cellular and <START:ggp> viral gene <END> regulatory mechanisms . 
Disturbance of both the immune surveillance as well as <START:ggp> viral gene <END> regulation may result in EBV-associated disease . 
Adaptor function for the <START:ggp> Syk kinases-interacting protein <END> <START:ggp> 3BP2 <END> in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> gene activation . 
<START:ggp> Syk-family tyrosine kinases <END> are essential for lymphocyte development and activation . 
Using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify <START:ggp> Syk kinases-interacting proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> SKIPs <END> ) , we isolated <START:ggp> 3BP2 <END> , an <START:ggp> Abl SH3-interacting protein <END> of unknown function . 
<START:ggp> 3BP2 <END> was selectively expressed in hematopoietic/lymphoid tissues and bound via its <START:ggp> SH2 domain activated Syk-family kinases <END> in <START:ana> mammalian cells <END> , including in <START:ana> antigen receptor-stimulated T cells <END> . 
In addition to <START:ggp> Zap-70 <END> , the <START:ggp> 3BP2 SH2 domain <END> associated in vitro with <START:ggp> LAT <END> , <START:ggp> Grb2 <END> , <START:ggp> PLCgamma1 <END> , and <START:ggp> Cbl <END> from activated T cell lysates . 
Transient <START:ggp> 3BP2 <END> overexpression induced transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> and its <START:ggp> NFAT or AP-1 elements <END> . 
This activity was dependent on the <START:ggp> SH2 <END> and <START:ggp> pleckstrin-homology domains <END> of <START:ggp> 3BP2 <END> , and required functional <START:ggp> Syk kinases <END> , <START:ggp> Ras <END> , and <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> 3BP2 <END> is an important adaptor that may couple activated <START:ggp> Zap-70/Syk <END> to a <START:ggp> LAT-containing signaling complex <END> involved in TCR-mediated gene transcription . 
In vitro suppression of programmed cell death of <START:ana> B cells <END> by tissue inhibitor of <START:ggp> metalloproteinases-1 <END> . 
Cellular pathways for induction of programmed cell death ( PCD ) have been identified , but little is known about specific extracellular matrix processes that may affect apoptosis along those pathways . 
In this study , a series of <START:ana> Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) cell lines <END> were assayed for their expression of <START:ggp> tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( TIMP ) -1 <END> . 
Results indicate that <START:ana> TIMP-1-positive BL lines <END> show resistance to cold-shock-induced apoptosis . 
Furthermore , recombinant <START:ggp> TIMP-1 <END> , but not <START:ggp> TIMP-2 <END> or a synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitor ( BB-94 ) , confers resistance to apoptosis induced by both CD95-dependent and -independent ( cold shock , serum deprivation , and gamma-radiation ) pathways in <START:ana> TIMP-1-negative BL lines <END> . 
<START:ggp> TIMP-1 <END> suppression of PCD is not due to <START:ggp> metalloproteinase <END> inhibition , as reduction and alkylation of the <START:ggp> TIMP-1 <END> did not abolish this activity . 
Retroviral induction of <START:ggp> TIMP-1 <END> not only resulted in cell survival but also in continued DNA synthesis for up to 5 d in the absence of serum , while controls underwent apoptosis . 
This resistance to apoptosis is reversed by <START:ggp> anti-TIMP-1 antibodies <END> , demonstrating that secreted <START:ggp> TIMP-1 <END> is active in blocking apoptosis . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> TIMP-1 <END> upregulation induced expression of <START:ggp> Bcl-XL <END> but not <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> as well as decreased <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity as compared with controls . 
These results demonstrate that <START:ggp> TIMP-1 <END> suppresses apoptosis in <START:ana> B cells <END> and suggests a novel activity for <START:ggp> TIMP-1 <END> in tissue homeostasis . 
<START:ggp> Spi-1/PU.1 <END> <START:ggp> proto-oncogene <END> induces opposite effects on monocytic and erythroid differentiation of <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Spi-1/PU.1 <END> is a <START:ggp> hematopoietic transcription factor <END> of the <START:ggp> Ets family <END> . 
To analyze the effects of ectopic expression of <START:ggp> spi-1 <END> on the proliferation/differentiation of <START:ana> human myeloid leukemia cells <END> , <START:ana> K562 cells <END> were stably transfected with a <START:ggp> spi-1 expression vector <END> . 
The <START:ana> transfected cell lines <END> expressed elevated levels of <START:ana> spi-1 mRNA <END> and protein and high <START:ggp> Spi-1 <END> -DNA binding activity . 
The <START:ana> spi-1 transfected cells <END> showed reduced growth rates and reduced clonogenic cell growth . 
When the erythroid and monocytic differentiation markers were analyzed , <START:ggp> spi-1 <END> overexpression resulted in opposite effects : erythroid differentiation was significantly inhibited in <START:ana> spi-1 transfectants <END> , while <START:ggp> spi-1 <END> overexpression increased the monocytic differentiation of cells . 
These results indicate a differential role of <START:ggp> Spi-1 <END> on the differentiation of <START:ana> human myeloid leukemia cells <END> .

In vivo function of an <START:ggp> interleukin 2 receptor beta chain <END> <START:ggp> ( IL-2Rbeta ) /IL-4Ralpha cytokine receptor chimera <END> potentiates allergic airway disease . 
Strength of <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) signaling , <START:ggp> coreceptors <END> , costimulation , <START:ana> antigen-presenting cell type <END> , and cytokines all play crucial roles in determining the efficiency with which <START:ana> type 2 T lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> Th2 <END> , <START:ana> Tc2 <END> ) develop from <START:ggp> uncommitted precursors <END> . 
To investigate in vivo regulatory mechanisms that control the population of <START:ana> type 2 T cells <END> and disease susceptibility , we have created lines of transgenic mice in which expression of a <START:ggp> chimeric cytokine receptor <END> ( the <START:ggp> mouse interleukin 2 receptor beta chain [ IL-2Rbeta ] extracellular domain <END> fused to the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic tail <END> of <START:ggp> IL-4Ralpha <END> ) is targeted to the <START:ana> T lymphoid lineage <END> using the <START:ggp> proximal lck promoter <END> . 
This chimera transduced <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -specific signals in response to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> binding and dramatically enhanced type 2 responses ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> , and <START:ggp> immunoglobulin E <END> production ) upon in vitro <START:ggp> TCR <END> stimulation or in vivo antigen challenge . 
Thus , type 2 effector function was augmented by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> signals transduced through a <START:ggp> chimeric receptor <END> expressed in a T cell-specific manner . 
This influence was sufficient for establishment of antigen-induced allergic airway hyperresponsiveness on a disease-resistant background 
Differentiation-dependent expression of a <START:ggp> human carboxylesterase <END> in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> and <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> binding to the <START:ggp> promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> Carboxylesterases <END> play an important role in defense and clearance mechanisms of the monocyte/macrophage system . 
During the differentiation process of cells from the <START:ana> monocytic cell line THP-1 <END> we observed a transient transcriptional upregulation of a <START:ggp> human carboxylesterase <END> analyzed by means of Northern blots . 
In <START:ana> PMA-treated THP-1 cells <END> we could detect three major <START:ggp> transcription initiation sites <END> as revealed by Nuclease Protection Assay carried out with two <START:ana> overlapping antisense RNA probes <END> . 
We have recently cloned the <START:ggp> carboxylesterase upstream sequence <END> and showed its <START:ggp> basal promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> CHO cells <END> . 
Using electrophoretic mobility shift analysis we demonstrated that the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> spanning <START:ggp> base pairs -1 to -275 <END> , which contains several putative binding sites for <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , is bound by <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> IRBP <END> but not by <START:ggp> C/EBPs <END> . 
Taken together these data indicate that carboxylesterase gene transcription in <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> starts at multiple initiation sites and that <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> IRBP <END> may be critical factors for modulating the differentiation-dependent transcription of this <START:ggp> human carboxylesterase gene <END> . 
The role of the <START:ggp> Ikaros gene <END> in lymphocyte development and homeostasis . 
The <START:ggp> Ikaros gene <END> , which encodes a family of <START:ggp> hemopoietic-specific zinc finger proteins <END> , is described as a central regulator of lymphocyte differentiation . 
During fetal development , it is required at the earliest stage of T cell and B cell specification . 
In the adult , however , <START:ana> lymphoid lineages <END> rely on <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> at distinct phases of their development . 
Its activity is essential for the generation of <START:ana> B cell <END> but not of <START:ana> T cell precursors <END> , although the differentiation of the latter is not normal . 
A significant increase in <START:ana> CD4 thymocytes <END> and their immediate precursors is detected , and because these cells lack markers that correlate with positive selection , a deregulation in their maturation process is suggested . 
Furthermore , <START:ana> Ikaros-null thymocytes <END> hyperproliferate in response to <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) signaling ; within days after their appearance in the thymus , clonally expanding populations are detected . 
Deregulated <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated responses and the fast kinetics of tumor development in these <START:ana> mutant thymocytes <END> implicate Ikaros as a <START:ggp> central tumor suppressor gene <END> for the <START:ana> T cell lineage <END> . 
In addition , lack of <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> and selective defects in <START:ana> gamma delta T cells <END> and <START:ana> dendritic antigen-presenting cells <END> point to <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> as an essential factor for the establishment of early branchpoints of the T cell pathway . 
The dominant interference activity of <START:ggp> Ikaros isoforms <END> unable to bind DNA and their effects in lymphocyte development suggest that <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> works in concert with other factors . 
The role of <START:ggp> Aiolos <END> , a <START:ggp> lymphoid-restricted and structurally related gene <END> , in lymphoid differentiation is discussed . 
A model is proposed that defines <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> as the backbone of a <START:ggp> complex regulatory protein network <END> that controls cell fate decisions and regulates homeostasis in the hemo-lymphoid system . 
Changes in this regulatory network may reflect differentiation and proliferation adjustments made in <START:ana> hemo-lymphoid progenitors <END> and <START:ana> precursors <END> as they give rise to the cells of our immune system . 
<START:ggp> STAT1 <END> pathway is involved in activation of caprine <START:ggp> arthritis-encephalitis virus long terminal repeat <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus ( CAEV ) long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) is activated by <START:ggp> gamma interferon <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) in <START:ana> promonocytic cells <END> . 
We have previously shown that a <START:ggp> 70-bp element <END> is necessary and sufficient for the response of the <START:ggp> CAEV LTR <END> to this <START:ggp> cytokine <END> . 
At the <START:ggp> 5 ' end <END> , this <START:ggp> 70-bp IFN-gamma response element <END> contains sequence similarity to the <START:ggp> gamma activated site <END> ( <START:ggp> GAS <END> ) . 
Here we demonstrate that the putative <START:ggp> GAS element <END> in the <START:ggp> CAEV LTR <END> binds specifically to a <START:ggp> cellular factor <END> induced by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> in <START:ana> promonocytic cells <END> . 
Substitution mutations in this <START:ggp> consensus sequence <END> eliminate binding of the <START:ggp> inducible factor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> GAS element <END> from the <START:ggp> 70-bp motif <END> is sufficient to confer responsiveness to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> using a heterologous minimal promoter . 
Consistent with the binding data , the same mutations in the <START:ggp> GAS element <END> eliminate responsiveness to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> in the context of both a functional <START:ggp> CAEV LTR <END> and a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> . 
The cellular factor that binds to the <START:ggp> GAS element <END> is present from 5 min to 14 h after stimulation with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
Binding of the nuclear factor to the <START:ggp> GAS element <END> in the <START:ggp> CAEV LTR <END> is inhibited by antibody directed against <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> ( <START:ggp> p91/84 <END> ) . 
Thus , the GAS sequence in the <START:ggp> CAEV LTR <END> is essential for the response to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and a <START:ggp> STAT1-like factor <END> binds to this site . 
The STAT-1 signaling pathway provides at least one mechanism for activation of the <START:ggp> CAEV LTR <END> by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
These data are the first demonstration of a role for a <START:ggp> STAT family member <END> in the regulation of a <START:ggp> viral promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> 1 , 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> from patients with renal insufficiency . 
A reduced expression of the <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> ( VDR ) in parathyroid glands of uremic animals and humans has been observed . 
Similar results have been obtained by our own group in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) from patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism to chronic renal failure . 
However , the reasons for these changes are not clear . 
In the present study , we have investigated the specific uptake of [ 3H ] 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 by <START:ana> PBMC <END> of 11 women with advanced chronic renal failure ( A-CRF ) , 6 women with mild-moderate renal insufficiency ( M-CRF ) , and 23 healthy women . 
The mean dissociation constant ( KD ) was similar in both groups of patients and in healthy women ( A-CRF : 0.7 +/- 0.5 x 10 ( -10 ) M ; M-CRF : 1.1 +/- 0.9 x 10 ( -10 ) M ; controls : 1.0 +/- 0.6 x 10 ( -10 ) M ) . 
However , <START:ggp> VDR <END> concentration was significantly decreased in A-CRF ( 0.8 +/- 0.5 fmol/10 ( 7 ) cells vs. 2.3 +/- 0.9 fmol/10 ( 7 ) cells in controls , p < 0.001 ) , whereas no changes were seen in M-CRF ( 1.7 +/- 0.7 fmol/10 ( 7 ) cells vs. 2.3 +/- 0.9 fmol/10 ( 7 ) cells in controls ) . 
No correlation was seen between <START:ggp> VDR <END> and serum calcitriol or PTH levels , when considering both groups of patients together or separately . 
Conversely , a significant negative correlation was found between <START:ggp> VDR <END> and serum creatinine values when A-CRF and M-CRF were considered altogether ( r = -0.63 ; p < 0.01 ) . 
Treatment with two different schedules of oral calcitriol ( five patients with 0.5 microgram/day for 1 month and four patients with 2 micrograms/day for 7 days ) did not change <START:ggp> VDR <END> concentrations . 
We conclude that the low levels of serum 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 of uremia are not responsible for the decrease in <START:ggp> VDR <END> concentration found in these patients . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor <END> binding to the <START:ggp> core promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> human monoamine oxidase B gene <END> in the cerebral cortex and in <START:ana> blood cells <END> . 
Many studies show that <START:ggp> monoamine oxidase B <END> in <START:ana> blood cells <END> is a biological marker for personality characteristics such as sensation seeking . 
The mechanism underlying this association is so far not explored . 
In the present study we have performed electrophoretic mobility-shift assays to investigate the pattern of protein binding to a <START:ggp> 150 bp fragment <END> of the <START:ggp> proximal 5'-flanking region <END> of the <START:ggp> human monoamine oxidase B gene <END> . 
We compared the pattern using nuclear extracts from human brain and <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
Interestingly , a correlation was observed between <START:ggp> monoamine oxidase B <END> enzyme activity in <START:ana> blood cells <END> ( <START:ana> platelets <END> ) and the binding pattern of two uncharacterized <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
These data are well in line with the long-standing notion that interindividual differences in <START:ggp> platelet monoamine oxidase <END> may represent differences in expression of the enzyme rather than genotypic variation . 
Enhanced differentiation of <START:ana> HL-60 leukemia cells <END> to <START:ana> macrophages <END> induced by ciprofibrate . 
Ciprofibrate , an hypolipidaemic peroxisome proliferator , induced differentiation of <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> . 
The effect was greatly potentiated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at a concentration where neither phorbol ester nor ciprofibrate alone had any effect on these cells . 
As occurs for HL-60 cell differentiation induced by high phorbol ester concentration , the ciprofibrate-induced phorbol ester-dependent differentiation of <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> proceeded through the monocytic/macrophage pathway and induced the phosphorylation of proteins with similar molecular weights suggesting that increased <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> activity may be involved in the effect . 
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPARalpha ) <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> is expressed in <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> , but no changes were observed in its expression upon HL-60 cell differentiation . 
The involvement of multiple <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) -associated factors <END> in the signaling mechanisms of <START:ggp> receptor activator <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , a member of the <START:ggp> TNFR superfamily <END> . 
<START:ggp> Receptor activator of NF-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> RANK <END> ) is a recently identified member of the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily <END> and is expressed on <START:ana> activated T cells <END> and <START:ana> dendritic cells <END> . 
Its <START:ggp> cognate ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> RANKL <END> ) plays significant roles in the activation of dendritic cell function and osteoclast differentiation . 
We demonstrate here the interaction of <START:ggp> RANK <END> with <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors ( TRAFs ) 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 <END> both in vitro and in cells . 
Mapping of the structural requirements for <START:ggp> TRAF <END> <START:ggp> /RANK <END> interaction revealed multiple <START:ggp> TRAF binding sites <END> clustered in two distinct domains in the <START:ggp> RANK cytoplasmic tail <END> . 
These <START:ggp> TRAF binding domains <END> were shown to be functionally important for the <START:ggp> RANK <END> -dependent induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> <START:ggp> NH2-terminal kinase <END> activities . 
Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that these <START:ggp> TRAF binding sites <END> exhibited selective binding for different <START:ggp> TRAF proteins <END> . 
In particular , <START:ggp> TRAF6 <END> interacted with <START:ggp> membrane-proximal determinants <END> distinct from those binding <START:ggp> TRAFs 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 <END> . 
When this <START:ggp> membrane-proximal TRAF6 interaction domain <END> was deleted , <START:ggp> RANK <END> -mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> signaling was completely inhibited while <START:ggp> c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase <END> activation was partially inhibited . 
An <START:ggp> NH2-terminal truncation mutant <END> of <START:ggp> TRAF6 <END> inhibited <START:ggp> RANKL <END> -mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation , but failed to affect constitutive signaling induced by receptor overexpression , revealing a selective role for <START:ggp> TRAF6 <END> in ligand-induced activation events . 
<START:ggp> Stat6 <END> inhibits human <START:ggp> interleukin-4 promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The differentiation of <START:ana> naive T-helper ( Th ) cells <END> into <START:ana> cytokine-secreting effector Th cells <END> requires exposure to multiple signals , including <START:ggp> exogenous cytokines <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) plays a major role in this process by promoting the differentiation of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -secreting Th2 cells . 
In Th2 cells , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> gene expression is tightly controlled at the level of transcription by the coordinated binding of multiple <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> to regulatory elements in the proximal <START:ggp> promoter region <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NFAT ) family members <END> play a critical role in regulating <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> transcription and interact with up to five sequences ( termed P0 through P4 ) in the <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter <END> . 
The molecular mechanisms by which <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> induces expression of the <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> are not known , although the <START:ggp> IL-4-activated transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 <END> ( <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> ) is required for this effect . 
We report here that <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> interacts with three binding sites in the <START:ggp> human IL-4 promoter <END> by electrophoretic mobility shift assays . 
These sites overlap the <START:ggp> P1 , P2 , and P4 NFAT elements <END> . 
To investigate the role of <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> in regulating <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> transcription , we used <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> -deficient Jurkat <START:ana> T cells <END> with different intact <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter constructs <END> in cotransfection assays . 
We show that , whereas a <START:ggp> multimerized response element <END> from the <START:ggp> germline IgE promoter <END> was highly induced by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> in <START:ana> Stat6-expressing Jurkat cells <END> , the intact <START:ggp> human IL-4 promoter <END> was repressed under similar conditions . 
We conclude that the function of <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> is highly dependent on promoter context and that this factor promotes <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> gene expression in an indirect manner . 
Epithelial cell-initiated inflammation plays a crucial role in early tissue damage in amebic infection of human intestine . 
BACKGROUND & AIMS : Entamoeba histolytica infection of the intestine can induce severe gut inflammation . 
The aims of this study were to assess the role of the host inflammatory response in the tissue damage observed with amebiasis and the role of the <START:ana> intestinal epithelial cell <END> in initiating that response . 
METHODS : E. histolytica infection was established in human intestinal xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient ( SCID-HU-INT ) mice . 
Human <START:ana> intestinal epithelial cell <END> inflammatory responses to amebic infection were inhibited by the intraluminal administration of an antisense oligonucleotide to the <START:ggp> human p65 subunit <END> of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> , and the role of neutrophils in tissue damage observed with amebiasis was studied by depleting <START:ana> neutrophils <END> from SCID-HU-INT mice . 
RESULTS : Administration of the antisense oligonucleotide blocked the production of <START:ggp> human interleukin 1beta <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin 8 <END> by <START:ana> intestinal epithelial cells <END> and inhibited neutrophil influx into the E. histolytica-infected intestinal xenografts . 
Inhibition of the gut inflammatory response by the antisense oligonucleotide or the depletion of <START:ana> neutrophils <END> from SCID-HU- INT mice blocked the increase in intestinal permeability observed with amebic infection . 
CONCLUSIONS : <START:ana> Intestinal epithelial cells <END> initiate an inflammatory response with resulting neutrophil-mediated tissue damage in response to E. histolytica infection ; this inflammatory cascade can be blocked by inhibiting the transcription of genes regulated by <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> . 
Triptolide induces apoptotic death of <START:ana> T lymphocyte <END> . 
Extract of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f ( TWHf ) has immunosuppressive activity and has been used as anti-inflammatory agent in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries . 
Recent studies have demonstrated that triptolide is the major active component in the extract that inhibits antigen or <START:ggp> mitogen <END> -induced T cell proliferation . 
In attempting to investigate its effect on activation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , we found triptolide induces apoptotic death of <START:ana> T cell hybridomas <END> and <START:ana> peripheral T cells <END> but not that of <START:ana> thymocytes <END> . 
The triptolide-induced apoptosis is accompanied by increase of DEVD-cleavable <START:ggp> caspases <END> activity and degradation of <START:ggp> caspase substrate poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase <END> ( <START:ggp> PARP <END> ) . 
A specific inhibitor of <START:ggp> caspases <END> , zVAD-FMK , prevents triptolide-induced <START:ggp> PARP <END> degradation and DNA fragmentation but not growth arrest . 
Furthermore , enforced expression of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> inhibited triptolide-induced degradation of <START:ggp> PARP <END> and apoptosis . 
These results indicate that triptolide induces T cell apoptosis through activating <START:ggp> caspases <END> , and suggest the growth arrest and apoptotic effect of triptolide may contribute to the immunosuppressive activity of TWHf extract 
A novel <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> regulates expression of the <START:ggp> vacuolar H+-ATPase B2 subunit <END> through <START:ggp> AP-2 sites <END> during monocytic differentiation . 
During monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation , the cellular content of <START:ggp> vacuolar H+-ATPase <END> ( <START:ggp> V-ATPase <END> ) increases more than 4-fold . 
We have shown previously that amplified expression of the <START:ggp> B2 subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> V-ATPase <END> occurs solely by increased transcription , and that the <START:ggp> 5'-untranslated region <END> of the <START:ggp> B2 gene <END> , containing multiple <START:ggp> consensus binding sites <END> for the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , is required for this expression . 
The present study demonstrates that <START:ggp> AP-2 binding sequences <END> are essential for increased transcription from the <START:ggp> B2 promoter <END> during monocyte-macrophage differentiation and that <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> , expressed exogenously in <START:ana> THP-1 <END> and other cells , activates transcription from the <START:ggp> B2 promoter <END> . 
In mobility shift assays , a <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> from <START:ana> THP-1 <END> and <START:ana> U-937 cells <END> was identified that binds to several <START:ggp> AP-2 response elements <END> within the <START:ggp> B2 promoter <END> , but does not react with <START:ggp> AP-2 antibodies <END> , and has a <START:ggp> DNA sequence <END> binding affinity profile that differs from <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> . 
These findings suggest that a novel <START:ggp> AP-2-like transcription factor <END> is responsible for <START:ggp> V-ATPase B subunit <END> amplification during monocyte differentiation . 
c-Jun and GST-pi expression in <START:ana> human plasma cells <END> . 
Bone marrow samples from 33 patients affected by MM and MGUS , and 8 patients not affected by lymphoproliferative diseases were studied for expression of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> ( a component of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> glutathione-S-transferase pi <END> ( <START:ggp> GST-pi <END> ) using immunocytochemical methods . 
A high and frequent expression of these two proteins was found both in MM and MGUS patients ( 31/33 patients positive for <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and 29/33 patients positive for <START:ggp> GST-pi <END> ) and in controls not affected by monoclonal gammopathy ( 7/8 patients positive for both <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> GST-pi <END> ) . 
No statistically significant correlation was found between <START:ana> c-Jun- and GST-pi-positive plasma cells <END> . 
The expression of these two proteins was not related to clinical or laboratory data . 
Our results seem to confirm a possible role of the <START:ggp> transcriptional complex <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> in activating <START:ggp> GST-pi promoter <END> in <START:ana> human plasma cells <END> . 
Activation of signaling pathways and prevention of apoptosis by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
Inhibition of apoptosis in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> such as <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> and <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> may play an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic and parasitic disorders . 
Recently , there has been some progress in the understanding of the signal transduction pathways activated by these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
The <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> and <START:ggp> GM-CSF receptors <END> share a <START:ggp> common signal transducer <END> that possesses no <START:ggp> intrinsic kinase domain <END> . 
It has been shown that eosinophil stimulation by these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> is associated with increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular substrates . 
In the past few years , there has been some progress in defining the tyrosine kinases that are activated by the <START:ggp> IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptor beta-subunit <END> in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
This review will concentrate on this topic and on its role for the regulation of eosinophil apoptosis . 
Requirement of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> p45 NF-E2 <END> expression in butyric acid-induced erythroid differentiation . 
Butyric acid ( BA ) is known to induce overexpression of <START:ggp> fetal hemoglobin <END> and then erythroid differentiation . 
Therefore , BA is currently under clinical investigation as a potential therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease and cancer . 
Nevertheless , the molecular mechanisms involved in BA-induced differentiation remain largely unknown . 
Previous reports have shown that BA-induced overexpression of <START:ggp> erythroid genes <END> occurred at the transcriptional level , suggesting the involvement of <START:ggp> erythroid transcription factors <END> . 
Here , we intend to demonstrate the requirement of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-E2 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in the BA-induced erythroid differentiation of <START:ana> human leukemic K562 cells <END> . 
Time-course experiments showed that nuclear levels of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> p45 NF-E2 <END> proteins increased during BA treatment . 
Moreover , antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting either <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> or <START:ggp> p45 NF-E2 <END> proteins inhibited both protein expression and BA-induced differentiation . 
In contrast , BA-induced cell growth inhibition was not affected . 
These results provide the first direct evidence for the requirement of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-E2 <END> in BA-induced differentiation process . 
Characterisation of regulatory sequences at the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus BamHI W promoter <END> . 
Epstein-Barr virus , a human gammaherpesvirus , possesses a unique set of <START:ggp> latent genes <END> whose constitutive expression in <START:ana> B cells <END> leads to cell growth transformation . 
The initiation of this growth transforming infection depends on a <START:ggp> viral promoter <END> in BamHI W ( Wp ) whose regulation is poorly understood . 
Using <START:ggp> Wp reporter constructs <END> in in vitro transfection assays , we found that Wp was 11- to 190-fold more active in <START:ana> B cell <END> than in <START:ana> non-B cell lines <END> and that three regions of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> ( termed <START:ggp> UAS1 <END> , <START:ggp> UAS2 <END> , and <START:ggp> UAS3 <END> ) contributed to transcriptional activation . 
The upstream regions <START:ggp> UAS3 <END> ( <START:ggp> -1168 to -440 <END> ) and <START:ggp> UAS2 <END> ( <START:ggp> -352 to -264 <END> ) both functioned in a cell lineage-independent manner and were together responsible for the bulk of Wp activity in <START:ana> non-B cells <END> ; mutational analysis indicated the importance of a <START:ggp> YY1 binding site <END> in <START:ggp> UAS2 <END> in that context . 
By contrast , <START:ggp> UAS1 <END> ( <START:ggp> -140 to -87 <END> ) was B cell specific and was the key determinant of the promoter 's increased activity in <START:ana> B cell lines <END> . 
Mutational analysis of <START:ggp> UAS1 sequences <END> combined with in vitro bandshift assays revealed the presence of three <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> cellular factors <END> in this region . 
When mutations that abolished factor binding in bandshift assays were introduced into a <START:ggp> Wp reporter construct <END> , the loss of any one of the three <START:ggp> UAS1 binding sites <END> was sufficient to reduce promoter activity by 10- to 30-fold in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
From sequence analysis , two of these appear to be novel <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> binding sites <END> , whereas the third was identified as a <START:ggp> cyclic AMP response element <END> ( <START:ggp> CRE <END> ) . 
Our data indicate that this <START:ggp> CRE <END> interacts with <START:ggp> CREB and ATF1 proteins <END> present in B cell nuclear extracts and that this interaction is important for Wp activity . 
In situ RT-PCR detection of <START:ana> Epstein-Barr virus immediate-early transcripts <END> in <START:ana> CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes <END> . 
AIDS-related Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -associated T cell lymphomas are emerging as a new , distinct histopathological entity . 
The pathway whereby EBV infects <START:ana> T cells <END> as well as the initial EBV transcriptional program in <START:ana> T cells <END> has not been established . 
In order to shed light on the early events of the EBV infection of <START:ana> T cells <END> , we have used in situ reverse transcription based polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) to study the initial EBV transcriptional program in <START:ana> homogeneous CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes <END> . 
Following EBV infection , Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen ( <START:ggp> EBNA <END> ) expression could be detected in <START:ana> T rosetting CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes <END> . 
Only a few cells showed <START:ggp> viral capsid antigen <END> ( <START:ggp> VCA <END> ) . 
<START:ana> EBV immediate-early gene transcripts <END> ( <START:ana> BZLF1 <END> , <START:ana> BRLF1 <END> , and <START:ana> BMLF1 <END> ) encoded in the BamHI Z , R , and M fragments could be detected by in situ RT-PCR in the EBV producer cell line B95.8 . 
Both <START:ana> BZLF1 and BRLF1 immediate-early transcripts <END> , but not <START:ana> BMLF1 transcript <END> , could be detected in individual <START:ana> CD4+ and CD8+ T cells <END> infected with EBV . 
Demonstration of <START:ana> EBV mRNA transcripts <END> encoding <START:ggp> immediate-early transcriptional transactivators <END> in <START:ana> EBV-infected T cells <END> provides the first evidence for a possible mechanism whereby EBV could contribute to T cell proliferation and EBV-associated T cell malignancies . 
The linkage between T-cell and dendritic cell development in the mouse thymus . 
<START:ana> Thymic dendritic cells <END> ( <START:ana> DC <END> ) mediate negative selection at a relatively late stage of the T-cell developmental pathway . 
We present evidence that the development of <START:ana> thymic DC <END> and of <START:ana> T-lineage cells <END> is linked via a common precursor at an early stage of thymocyte development . 
T-lineage precursor populations from the adult mouse thymus , prior to T-cell receptor gene rearrangement , display a capacity to produce <START:ana> DC <END> as well as <START:ana> T cells <END> in the thymus , and are very efficient precursors of <START:ana> DC <END> in culture . 
These <START:ana> lymphoid/DC precursors <END> have little capacity to form <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> , indicating that <START:ana> thymic DC <END> are a lymphoid-related rather than <START:ana> myeloid-related lineage <END> . 
In contrast to <START:ana> myeloid-related DC <END> , <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> is not required for the development of these <START:ana> lymphoid-related DC <END> in vivo or in vitro . 
<START:ana> DC <END> can develop in mutant mice lacking <START:ana> mature T cells <END> , provided the common precursors are present . 
However , in mutant mice lacking functional <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , there are deficiencies in <START:ana> lymphoid precursor cells <END> , in <START:ana> mature lymphoid cells <END> and in <START:ana> DC <END> . 
Host control of HIV-1 parasitism in <START:ana> T cells <END> by the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> . 
Post HIV-1 entry , productive HIV-1 infection of <START:ana> primary T cells <END> requires overcoming several cellular blocks to provirus establishment and replication . 
Activation of unknown host intracellular events overcomes such inhibitory steps and is concomitant with HIV-1 replication . 
We show that the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NFATc <END> was sufficient as a cellular factor to induce a highly permissive state for HIV-1 replication in <START:ana> primary CD4+ T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NFATc <END> overcame a blockade at reverse transcription and permitted active HIV-1 replication . 
Pharmacologic blockade of <START:ggp> endogenous NFAT <END> activity by FK506 or CsA inhibited synthesis of reverse transcription and also potently blocked HIV-1 replication . 
<START:ana> T cells <END> therefore can become competent for HIV-1 replication by control of <START:ggp> regulated host factors <END> such as the <START:ggp> NFATc <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
The host mechanisms regulated by such permissivity factors are potential targets for anti-HIV-1 therapy . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> nuclear import in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> by noninvasive delivery of peptide carrying the <START:ggp> nuclear localization sequence <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p50 <END> . 
Activation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> by <START:ggp> Ags <END> or <START:ggp> cytokines <END> results in translocation of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT <END> from the cytoplasm into the nucleus . 
The first step in the nuclear import process is recognition of a <START:ggp> nuclear localization sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> NLS <END> ) within the <START:ggp> karyophilic protein <END> by a <START:ggp> cytoplasmic receptor <END> such as the <START:ggp> importin ( karyopherin ) -alpha subunit <END> . 
The <START:ggp> NLSs <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> NFAT <END> differ and the <START:ggp> NLS <END> of <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> has not yet been identified . 
Herein we demonstrate that the inducible nuclear import of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T lymphocytes <END> is significantly inhibited by a cell-permeable peptide carrying the <START:ggp> NLS <END> of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p50 subunit <END> . 
<START:ggp> NLS <END> peptide-mediated disruption of the nuclear import of these <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> results in inhibition of I kappa B alpha and IL-2 gene expression , processes dependent on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> or the combination of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
Further , we show that inhibitory <START:ggp> NLS <END> peptide interacts in vitro with a <START:ggp> cytoplasmic NLS receptor complex <END> comprised of the <START:ggp> Rch1/importin ( karyopherin ) -beta heterodimer <END> expressed in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
Taken together , these data indicate that the inducible nuclear import of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> can be regulated by <START:ggp> NLS <END> peptide delivered noninvasively to the cytoplasm of <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> to target members of the <START:ggp> importin ( karyopherin ) -alpha beta <END> <START:ggp> NLS receptor complex <END> . 
<START:ggp> Membrane-associated lymphotoxin <END> on <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> activates <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> via an <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent pathway . 
BACKGROUND : Inhibition of complement in small animal models of xenotransplantation has demonstrated graft infiltration with <START:ana> natural killer ( NK ) cells <END> and monocytes associated with <START:ana> endothelial cell <END> ( <START:ana> EC <END> ) activation . 
We have previously demonstrated that <START:ana> human NK cells <END> activate porcine <START:ana> EC <END> in vitro , which results in <START:ggp> adhesion molecule <END> expression and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> secretion . 
In this study , we used the <START:ana> NK cell line NK92 <END> to define the molecular and cellular basis of NK cell-mediated <START:ana> EC <END> activation . 
METHODS : <START:ana> EC <END> were transfected with either reporter constructs containing the <START:ggp> luciferase gene <END> driven either by <START:ggp> E-selectin or interleukin ( IL ) -8 promoters <END> or a synthetic <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-dependent promoter <END> . 
In addition , a <START:ggp> dominant-negative mutant tumor necrosis factor receptor I ( TNFRI ) expression vector <END> was co-transfected in inhibition studies . 
Forty-eight hours after transfection , <START:ana> EC <END> were stimulated with <START:ana> NK cells <END> or <START:ana> NK cell membrane extracts <END> for 7 hr and activation was measured by a <START:ggp> luciferase <END> assay . 
RESULTS : Co-culture of <START:ana> NK cells <END> with transfected <START:ana> EC <END> enhanced <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent promoter activity . 
NK cell membrane extracts retained the capacity to activate <START:ana> EC <END> and induced nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 <END> ) . 
Western blotting of <START:ana> NK cell <END> and membrane extracts detected the presence of <START:ggp> Lymphotoxin-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> LTalpha <END> ) but not <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> LTalpha <END> was secreted in <START:ana> NK : EC co-cultures <END> . 
Co-transfection with <START:ggp> dominant-negative mutant TNFRI <END> inhibited <START:ana> EC <END> activation by NK cell membrane extracts and by <START:ana> NK cells <END> by 80 % and 47 % , respectively . 
The same pattern of inhibition was observed using anti-human LT sera . 
CONCLUSIONS : Human NK cell membrane-bound LT signals across species via <START:ggp> TNFRI <END> , leading to <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> nuclear translocation and transcription of <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> and <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , which results in <START:ana> EC <END> activation . 
The discrepancy in the degree of inhibition by membrane extracts and <START:ana> NK cells <END> with <START:ggp> mutant TNFRI <END> suggests that additional pathways are utilized by <START:ana> NK cells <END> to activate <START:ana> EC <END> 
<START:ggp> Ras <END> -dependent , Ca2+-stimulated activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> by a constitutively active <START:ggp> Cbl mutant <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) stimulation induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> cellular proteins <END> , including <START:ggp> Cbl <END> , a <START:ggp> protooncogene product <END> whose function remains unclear . 
As a first step toward elucidating the function of <START:ggp> Cbl <END> in <START:ggp> TCR <END> -initiated signaling , we evaluated the ability of <START:ggp> wild-type Cbl <END> or a transforming <START:ggp> Cbl mutant <END> ( 70Z/3 ) to induce transcriptional activation of a <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) element <END> derived from the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 ( IL2 ) promoter <END> in transiently cotransfected <START:ana> Jurkat-TAg T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> 70Z/3 <END> , but not <START:ggp> Cbl <END> , caused <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation which was significantly enhanced by stimulation with calcium ionophore , and was drastically reduced by cyclosporin A pretreatment . 
A point mutation of a potential <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-K ) binding site <END> ( <START:ggp> Y731EAM <END> to <START:ggp> Y731EAC <END> ) in <START:ggp> 70Z/3 <END> disrupted the association of <START:ggp> PI3-K <END> with <START:ggp> 70Z/3 <END> , but did not reduce the induction of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activity , suggesting that the interaction between <START:ggp> Cbl <END> and <START:ggp> PI3-K <END> is not required in the <START:ggp> 70Z/3 <END> -mediated induction of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
Additional mapping studies indicated that defined deletions of C-terminal <START:ggp> 70Z/3 <END> sequences affected to a variable degree its ability to stimulate <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activity . 
Strikingly , deletion of <START:ggp> 346 C-terminal residues <END> augmented this activity , whereas removal of 20 additional residues abolished it . 
Coexpression of <START:ggp> dominant negative Ras <END> abrogated the basal or ionomycin-stimulated , <START:ggp> 70Z/3 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation , suggesting a <START:ggp> functional Ras <END> is required for this activation . 
These results implicate <START:ggp> Cbl <END> in <START:ggp> Ras <END> -dependent signaling pathways which lead to <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation . 
Requirement of <START:ana> prestimulated THP-1 monocytic cells <END> for <START:ana> endothelial cell <END> activation . 
Involvement of TNF alpha . 
<START:ana> Blood monocytes <END> spontaneously activate <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> in culture , leading to adhesion of <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> onto the endothelial surface and overproduction of endothelial proteins such as <START:ggp> von Willebrand factor <END> ( <START:ggp> vWf <END> ) and <START:ggp> plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> PAI-1 <END> ) . 
To overcome the difficulty in obtaining <START:ana> quiescent monocytes <END> , we studied the ability of <START:ana> promonocytic THP-1 cells <END> to activate <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> . 
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -prestimulated and untreated <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> were cocultured with <START:ana> resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> HUVEC <END> ) for 3 and 24 h in the presence of colimycin to neutralize LPS traces . 
Addition of untreated <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> had little effect on <START:ana> HUVEC <END> adhesiveness . 
Addition of prestimulated <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> was followed by a noticeable adhesion after 3 h which reversed to basal values within 24 h . 
Under these conditions <START:ggp> HUVEC adhesion molecules <END> , <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> , <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> , were increased at 3 h with only <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> remaining overexpressed at 24 h . 
<START:ggp> Diffusible endothelial proteins <END> such as soluble <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> , <START:ggp> PAI-1 <END> and <START:ggp> vWf <END> to a minimal extent , increased in supernatants from <START:ana> HUVEC <END> cocultured for 24 h with prestimulated <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> . 
In those cocultures , <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> concentrations peaked at 3 h whereas IL-1 beta levels progressively rose until 24 h . 
Addition of an <START:ggp> anti-TNF alpha antibody <END> decreased by 40 % <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> and <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> induction and suppressed <START:ggp> PAI-1 <END> overproduction with a weak effect on <START:ggp> vWf <END> . 
An <START:ggp> anti-IL-1 beta antibody <END> had negligible effects on <START:ggp> HUVEC adhesion molecules <END> , <START:ggp> PAI-1 <END> or <START:ggp> vWf <END> production . 
These results provide evidence that <START:ana> promonocytic THP-1 cells <END> require prestimulation in order to activate <START:ana> HUVEC <END> and that <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> contributes to this phenomenon . 
Engagement of the Lewis X antigen ( CD15 ) results in monocyte activation . 
We previously reported that monocyte adhesion to <START:ana> tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) -treated endothelial cells <END> increased expression of tissue factor and <START:ggp> CD36 <END> on monocytes . 
Using immunological cross-linking to mimic receptor engagement by natural ligands , we now show that CD15 ( Lewis X ) , a <START:ggp> monocyte counter-receptor <END> for <START:ggp> endothelial selectins <END> may participate in this response . 
We used cytokine production as a readout for monocyte activation and found that CD15 cross-linking induced <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release from <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> and cells from the <START:ana> monocytic cell line MM6 <END> . 
Quantitative <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase <END> -polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) showed an increase in steady-state <START:ana> TNF-alpha mRNA <END> after 3 to 4 hours of cross-linking . 
CD15 cross-linking also concomitantly increased <START:ana> interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 beta ) mRNA <END> , while no apparent change was observed in the levels of <START:ana> beta-actin mRNA <END> , indicating specificity . 
To examine transcriptional regulation of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> by CD15 engagement , a CAT plasmid reporter construct containing <START:ggp> IL-1 beta promoter/enhancer sequences <END> was introduced into <START:ana> MM6 <END> . 
Subsequent cross-linking of CD15 increased <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity . 
CD15 engagement by <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> also attenuated <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> transcript degradation , demonstrating that signaling via CD15 also had posttranscriptional effects . 
Nuclear extracts of anti- <START:ana> CD15 cross-linked cells <END> demonstrated enhanced levels of the <START:ggp> transcriptional factor activator protein-1 <END> , minimally changed <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> , and did not affect <START:ggp> SV40 promoter specific protein-1 <END> . 
We conclude that engagement of CD15 on monocytes results in monocyte activation . 
In addition to its well-recognized adhesive role , CD15 may function as an important signaling molecule capable of initiating proinflammatory events in <START:ana> monocytes <END> that come into contact with activated endothelium . 
<START:ggp> CD2 <END> signalling induces phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CREB <END> in <START:ana> primary lymphocytes <END> . 
Promoter sequences responsive to cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) are found in a number of <START:ggp> cellular genes <END> , and bind <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> of the <START:ggp> cAMP response element binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> CREB ) /activating transcription factor-1 ( ATF-1 ) family <END> . 
We have used a human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) model of <START:ggp> cAMP response element <END> ( <START:ggp> CRE <END> ) transcription to investigate the influence of lymphocyte activation on transcription from homologous regions in the <START:ggp> viral promoter <END> . 
We previously demonstrated increased HTLV-1 transcription following CD2 but not CD3 receptor cross-linking . 
We hypothesized that this increased viral transcription was mediated , in part , through the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CREB <END> . 
Therefore , we investigated <START:ggp> CD2 <END> and <START:ggp> CD3 receptor <END> -mediated signalling in <START:ana> primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> CD2 <END> , but not <START:ggp> CD3 <END> , cross-linking increased cAMP detected by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) approximately fourfold . 
<START:ggp> CD2 <END> cross-linking concurrently increased phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CREB <END> detected by immunoblot assay eightfold . 
Consistent with post-translational regulation , no change in total level of <START:ggp> CREB <END> protein was observed . 
Phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CREB <END> occurred through a herbimycin A and Rp-cAMP- sensitive pathway , suggesting phosphorylation required antecedent activation of both <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinases <END> ( <START:ggp> PTK <END> ) and <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> ( <START:ggp> PKA <END> ) . 
Both <START:ggp> CD2 <END> and <START:ggp> CD3 <END> cross-linking increased binding of <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> to a radiolabelled CRE oligonucleotide probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggesting that lymphocyte activation enhances binding independently of phosphorylation of <START:ggp> CREB <END> at serine 133 . 
These data indicate specific modulation of the <START:ggp> CREB/ATF-1 family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> by the <START:ggp> CD2 <END> signalling pathway and suggest <START:ggp> CD2 <END> receptor modulation of <START:ggp> CRE <END> -mediated transcription following ligand engagement ( e.g. cell-to-cell contact ) . 
X-rays-induced secretion of <START:ggp> cellular factor <END> ( s ) that enhance ( s ) <START:ggp> HIV-1 promoter <END> transcription in various <START:ana> non-irradiated transfected cell lines <END> . 
Various cellular stress agents like ionizing radiation exposure could activate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV- 1 ) replication or <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> expression . 
In addition , <START:ggp> extracellular factor <END> ( s ) released by <START:ana> X-ray-treated human colonic carcinoma cell line <END> ( <START:ana> HT29 <END> ) might activate the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) of HIV-1 in <START:ana> non-irradiated HT29 cells <END> . 
In the present report we show that in various transiently or <START:ana> stably transfected cell lines <END> , X-ray irradiation up-regulates <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> transcription through the <START:ggp> kappaB regulatory elements <END> . 
A factor ( s ) , which is processed by and acts upon a variety of cell types , was detected by addition to <START:ana> non-irradiated cells <END> of either <START:ana> X-ray-treated cells <END> or a conditioned medium taken from <START:ana> irradiated cultures <END> . 
The magnitude of responsiveness is cell type dependent . 
In addition , X-ray activation of <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> in transiently or stably transfected <START:ana> cell lines <END> is inhibited by a potent antioxidant drug , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and by another drug , known for its role in the trapping of <START:ggp> growth factors <END> , suramin . 
The importance of these observations in the pathophysiology of patients with AIDS-related cancers treated by radiotherapy remains to be established . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> human delta-globin gene promoter <END> in <START:ana> primary adult erythroid cells <END> . 
Restoration of the <START:ggp> CCAAT box <END> or insertion of an <START:ggp> erythroid Kruppel-like factor ( EKLF ) binding site <END> in the <START:ggp> delta promoter <END> activates its expression in several <START:ana> erythroid cell lines <END> . 
We extended these studies using a novel <START:ana> primary human adult erythroid cell ( hAEC ) system <END> to investigate these effects at the <START:ana> late erythroblast stage <END> . 
Restoration of the <START:ggp> CCAAT box <END> at <START:ggp> -70 bp <END> , or insertion of an <START:ggp> EKLF binding site <END> at <START:ggp> -85 bp <END> or <START:ggp> -95 bp <END> in the <START:ggp> promoter <END> significantly increased delta globin gene expression in hAEC . 
Our results demonstrate that the altered <START:ggp> CCAAT box <END> ( CCAAC ) and the lack of an <START:ggp> EKLF binding site <END> in <START:ggp> delta-globin <END> contribute to its low level of expression in the <START:ana> hAEC model <END> as well . 
Constitutive association of <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> in <START:ana> pro-B cells <END> is dissolved by <START:ggp> interleukin-4 <END> -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both proteins . 
The <START:ggp> bipartite human interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) receptor <END> was functionally expressed in <START:ana> murine pro-B cells <END> and activated by <START:ggp> human IL-4 <END> to evoke intracellular signaling . 
Mutual association of <START:ggp> signal transducing proteins <END> within the receptor complex was then studied in dependence of ligand stimulation . 
Besides ligand-induced receptor heterodimerization and contacts of the two <START:ggp> IL-4 receptor subunits alpha and gamma <END> with <START:ggp> Janus kinases <END> <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> a prominent constitutive binding between <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription <END> <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> was detected . 
Since both these proteins become phosphorylated in response to <START:ggp> IL-4 receptor <END> stimulation , the influence of tyrosine phosphorylation on their mutual contact was analyzed . 
Association of <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> was found to occur exclusively between <START:ggp> unphosphorylated proteins <END> . 
Activation of <START:ana> human macrophages <END> by mechanical ventilation in vitro . 
Positive-pressure mechanical ventilation supports gas exchange in patients with respiratory failure but is also responsible for significant lung injury . 
In this study , we have developed an in vitro model in which isolated <START:ana> lung cells <END> can be submitted to a <START:ana> prolonged cyclic pressure-stretching strain <END> resembling that of conventional mechanical ventilation . 
In this model , cells cultured on a Silastic membrane were elongated up to 7 % of their initial diameter , corresponding to a 12 % increase in cell surface . 
The <START:ana> lung macrophage <END> was identified as the main cellular source for critical <START:ggp> inflammatory mediators <END> such as <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> , the <START:ggp> chemokines <END> <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -8 and -6 <END> , and <START:ggp> matrix metalloproteinase-9 <END> in this model system of mechanical ventilation . 
These mediators were measured in supernatants from <START:ana> ventilated alveolar macrophages <END> , <START:ana> monocyte-derived macrophages <END> , and <START:ana> promonocytic THP-1 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor-kappaB <END> was found to be activated in <START:ana> ventilated macrophages <END> . 
Synergistic proinflammatory effects of mechanical stress and molecules such as <START:ggp> bacterial endotoxin <END> were observed , suggesting that mechanical ventilation might be particularly deleterious in preinjured or infected lungs . 
Dexamethasone prevented <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> secretion in <START:ana> ventilated macrophages <END> . 
Mechanical ventilation induced low levels of <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> secretion by <START:ana> alveolar type II-like cells <END> . 
Other lung cell types such as <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> , <START:ana> bronchial cells <END> , and <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> failed to produce <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> in response to a prolonged cyclic pressure-stretching load . 
This model is of particular value for exploring physical stress-induced signaling pathways , as well as for testing the effects of novel ventilatory strategies or adjunctive substances aimed at modulating cell activation induced by mechanical ventilation . 
Signaling pathways mediated by the <START:ggp> TNF- and cytokine-receptor <END> families target a common <START:ggp> cis-element <END> of the <START:ggp> IFN regulatory factor 1 promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD40 <END> activation of <START:ana> B cells <END> is strongly influenced by the presence of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
However , the molecular basis for the interplay between these distinct stimuli is not clearly delineated . 
<START:ggp> IFN regulatory factor 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> ) is a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> activated by either <START:ggp> CD40 <END> or <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
We have found that these different sets of signals target a common cis-acting element in the promoter of this gene , the <START:ggp> IRF-1 gamma-activated site <END> ( <START:ggp> GAS <END> ) . 
Targeting of the <START:ggp> IRF-1 GAS <END> is not confined to activation via <START:ggp> CD40 <END> but extends to other stimuli that mimic the <START:ggp> CD40 <END> signaling cascade , like <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and EBV . 
In contrast to induction of <START:ggp> STATs <END> by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , the <START:ggp> IRF-1 GAS <END> -binding complex activated by <START:ggp> CD40 <END> , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , or EBV contains <START:ggp> Rel proteins <END> , specifically <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 <END> . 
In this system , simultaneous exposure to <START:ggp> CD40L <END> together with either <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> or <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> does not lead to the activation of novel <START:ggp> Rel/STAT complexes <END> . 
Given the importance of <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> in a variety of biologic functions from proliferation to apoptosis , our findings support the notion that modulation of <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> levels may be a critical control point in B cell activation . 
Differential effects of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> inhibitors on <START:ggp> fibronectin <END> -induced <START:ggp> interleukin-beta gene <END> transcription , protein synthesis and secretion in <START:ana> human monocytic cells <END> . 
<START:ana> Human monocytic cells <END> express <START:ggp> interleukin-1beta <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> ) when stimulated with the <START:ggp> extracellular matrix glycoprotein <END> , <START:ggp> fibronectin <END> ( <START:ggp> FN <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> Protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) activation is considered important for this process ; however , the metabolic steps at which <START:ggp> PKC <END> acts upon to mediate the <START:ggp> FN <END> -induced <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> response remain unclear . 
We performed an analysis of the mechanisms by which two <START:ggp> PKC <END> inhibitors , Calphostin C and Staurosporine , prevent the <START:ggp> FN <END> -induced <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> response . 
Both inhibitors blocked the secretion of <START:ggp> IL-1beta protein <END> into the media of <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> exposed to <START:ggp> FN <END> . 
Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that unde3r these circumstances , Calphostin C inhibited the production of <START:ggp> IL-1beta protein <END> , whereas Staurosporine allowed protein production , but inhibited its secretion . 
To determine the mechanisms responsible for these differences , we turned to <START:ana> human U937 promonocytic cells <END> . 
U937 cells transfected with the human <START:ggp> full-length IL-1beta promoter <END> connected to a <START:ggp> luciferase reporter gene <END> were submitted to transcription assays , Northern blotting , and DNA electrophoresis mobility gel shift assays . 
These studies revealed that Calphostin C inhibited the nuclear translocation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor activator protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) which is considered necessary for <START:ggp> FN <END> induction of <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> gene transcription , and prevented the transcription of the <START:ggp> IL-1beta gene <END> . 
In contrast , Staurosporine alone induced <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> translocation and stimulation of the gene . 
Overall , our data indicate that Calphostin C prevents the transcription of the <START:ggp> IL-1beta gene <END> thereby inhibiting protein synthesis . 
Based on the high specificity of this compound for <START:ggp> PKC <END> , we conclude that <START:ggp> PKC <END> is necessary for <START:ggp> FN <END> -induced <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> protein production . 
In contrast , Staurosporine prevented secretion of <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> by unknown mechanisms 
The <START:ggp> carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain <END> of <START:ggp> CD36 <END> is required for oxidized low-density lipoprotein modulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> . 
The binding of oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( Ox LDL ) by <START:ana> monocyte <END> <START:ana> -macrophages <END> causes pleiotropic effects , including changes in gene expression , and is thought to represent an early event in atherogenesis . 
The integral membrane <START:ggp> glycoprotein CD36 <END> appears to play a physiological role in binding and uptake of Ox LDL by <START:ana> monocyte-macrophages <END> , although the molecular events associated with <START:ggp> CD36 <END> -Ox LDL interaction are unknown . 
To approach this issue , we used <START:ggp> CD36 <END> transfected <START:ana> Chinese hampster ovary ( CHO ) cells <END> , exposed them to Ox LDL , and determined changes in the activity of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
We report here that Ox LDL enhanced DNA binding activity of nuclear extracts to an <START:ggp> NF-kappaB sequence <END> following activation of <START:ana> CD36-producing CHO cells <END> with the <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokine <END> <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) . 
This enhanced DNA binding activity was inhibited by coincubation of <START:ggp> CD36 <END> transfected cells with the <START:ggp> human CD36-specific antibody <END> <START:ggp> OKM5 <END> . 
We also determined that activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA binding activity required an intact <START:ggp> carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic segment <END> on <START:ggp> CD36 <END> . 
Our results support the idea that <START:ggp> human CD36 <END> mediates signal transduction events in response to Ox LDL . 
<START:ggp> TRAMP <END> , a novel <START:ggp> apoptosis-mediating receptor <END> with sequence homology to <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 <END> and <START:ggp> Fas <END> ( <START:ggp> Apo-1/CD95 <END> ) . 
A novel member of the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor family <END> , designated <START:ggp> TRAMP <END> , has been identified . 
The structural organization of the <START:ggp> 393 amino acid long human TRAMP <END> is most homologous to <START:ggp> TNF receptor 1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> TRAMP <END> is abundantly expressed on <START:ana> thymocytes <END> and <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
Its extracellular domain is composed of four <START:ggp> cysteine-rich domains <END> , and the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic region <END> contains a <START:ggp> death domain <END> known to signal apoptosis . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> TRAMP <END> leads to two major responses , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and apoptosis . 
<START:ggp> TRAMP <END> -induced cell death is inhibited by an inhibitor of <START:ggp> ICE-like proteases <END> , but not by <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> TRAMP <END> does not appear to interact with any of the known <START:ggp> apoptosis-inducing ligands <END> of the <START:ggp> TNF family <END> . 
The state of maturation of <START:ana> monocytes <END> into <START:ana> macrophages <END> determines the effects of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> on HIV replication . 
The molecular mechanisms of the effects of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> on HIV infection in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> as they matured into <START:ana> monocyte-derived macrophages <END> over 7 days were investigated using HIV-1 ( BaL ) , and low passage clinical strains . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> up-regulated the expression of both genomic and spliced <START:ana> HIV mRNA <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> cultured on Teflon , as determined by Northern analysis and <START:ggp> p24 Ag <END> assay . 
Using a nuclear run-on assay , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> stimulation was shown to enhance transcription by two- to threefold . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> stimulated <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> nuclear translocation and binding before enhancement of <START:ana> HIV RNA <END> expression . 
Conversely , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> markedly and significantly inhibited HIV replication at the transcriptional level in <START:ana> monocyte-derived macrophages <END> , and this occurred whether these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> were added before or after HIV infection . 
The reversal from stimulation to inhibition occurred after 3 to 5 days of adherence to plastic . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> had no significant effect on HIV reverse transcription . 
The effect of both <START:ggp> cytokines <END> on the monocyte maturation/differentiation ( <START:ggp> CD11b <END> , <START:ggp> CD13 <END> , and <START:ggp> CD26 <END> ) and other <START:ggp> macrophage markers <END> ( <START:ggp> CD14 <END> and <START:ggp> CD68 <END> ) was examined . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> enhanced <START:ggp> CD11b <END> , but inhibited <START:ggp> CD26 <END> expression and delayed <START:ggp> CD13 <END> loss . 
<START:ggp> IL-13 <END> had similar effects on <START:ggp> CD11b <END> and <START:ggp> CD13 <END> , but no effect on <START:ggp> CD26 <END> . 
Hence , these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> do not simply enhance monocyte differentiation , but have complex and slightly divergent effects that impact on HIV replication probably through cell signaling pathways and <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> translocation . 
Mice lacking the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> CIITA <END> -- a second look . 
We have generated a second line of mice lacking a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> thought to be a critical regulator of <START:ggp> MHC class II gene <END> expression , <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ( for class II <START:ggp> transactivator <END> ) . 
Our and the previously published lines differ in the deletion that was engineered and by the fact that we removed the <START:ggp> neomycin-resistance promoter <END> and <START:ggp> structural gene <END> via the cre-loxP recombination system . 
Characterization of our line led to two new findings . 
First , a substantial number of cells can express <START:ggp> class II molecules <END> in the absence of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> , albeit at 5-fold reduced levels , most notably <START:ana> dendritic cells <END> in s.c. lymph nodes ; therefore , the <START:ggp> CIITA gene <END> can not be an absolute ' <START:ggp> master gene <END> ' controlling the expression of <START:ggp> class II molecules <END> , as had been thought . 
Second , in contrast to recent results on <START:ana> human cell lines <END> , <START:ggp> CIITA <END> is not critically involved in the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -induced up-regulation of <START:ggp> MHC class I genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-10 <END> stabilizes inhibitory <START:ggp> kappaB-alpha <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-10 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ) protects animals from lethal endotoxemia . 
This beneficial effect is mediated , in part , by inhibition of <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokine <END> production , including <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) . 
Evidence suggests that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> may inhibit activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) through an unknown mechanism . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in response to inflammatory signals is dependent upon degradation of its associated inhibitory peptide , <START:ggp> inhibitory kappaB-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> ) . 
We hypothesized that <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> prevents human monocyte <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and resultant <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> production by stabilization of <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> . 
The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced human monocyte <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> production , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation , and <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> degradation . 
Monocytes were isolated from human donors . 
Cells were stimulated with <START:ggp> endotoxin <END> ( LPS , 100 ng/mL ) with and without human <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ( 10 ng/mL ) . 
Following stimulation , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> was measured in cell supernatants by ELISA , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay , and <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> levels by Western blot . 
We observed that after LPS stimulation of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> increased to 798+/-67 pg/mL ( p < .001 versus control ) . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> attenuated LPS-stimulated <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> production ( 297+/-54 ; p < .001 versus LPS alone ) . 
After LPS stimulation in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> , <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> protein levels decreased , and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA binding increased . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> pretreatment prevented LPS-induced decreases in <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> protein levels and attenuated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA binding . 
<START:ggp> IL-10 <END> appears to prevent activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> by preserving <START:ggp> IkappaB-alpha <END> protein levels , leading to a reduction in <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> release . 
Down-regulation of human <START:ggp> granzyme B <END> expression by glucocorticoids . 
Dexamethasone inhibits binding to the <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 regulatory elements <END> of the <START:ggp> granzyme B promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> serine protease granzyme B <END> is an essential component of the granule exocytosis pathway , a major apoptotic mechanism used by <START:ana> cytotoxic T lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> to induce target cell apoptosis . 
Granzyme B gene transcription is induced in activated <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> upon antigenic stimulation , and several <START:ggp> regulatory regions <END> including <START:ggp> CBF <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> Ikaros binding sites <END> have been shown to be essential in the control of <START:ggp> granzyme B promoter <END> activation . 
Dexamethasone , a glucocorticoid that is widely used as an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agent , inhibits <START:ana> granzyme B mRNA transcript <END> in <START:ana> phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
Transfection of a reporter construct containing the <START:ggp> -148 to +60 region <END> of the human <START:ggp> granzyme B promoter <END> demonstrated that this region was the target for dexamethasone repression . 
Mutation of <START:ggp> Ikaros <END> or <START:ggp> AP-1 binding sites <END> in the context of the <START:ggp> granzyme B promoter <END> demonstrated that both sites participate in dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of the <START:ggp> granzyme B promoter <END> activity . 
Electromobility shift assay revealed that dexamethasone abolished the binding of <START:ggp> nuclear transcription factors <END> to the <START:ggp> Ikaros binding site <END> and reduced <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding activity . 
These results indicate that dexamethasone is able to abrogate the transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> human granzyme B gene promoter <END> by inhibiting the binding of <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> at the <START:ggp> AP-1 and Ikaros sites <END> . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> on <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> in polycystic ovary syndrome . 
OBJECTIVE : Many studies have suggested that there is a possible hormonal dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis and an increased cortisol clearance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) . 
Therefore in this study , we have examined the role of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor/s <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) characteristics in the developing of these abnormalities in patients with PCOS . 
METHOD : For this purpose , the number and affinity of <START:ggp> GR <END> in peripheral <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> ( MNL ) of 10 patients with PCOS and 10 healthy women ( controls ) were determined . 
RESULTS : There were no significant differences in the number ( 6500+/-1001 sites/cell and 6352+/-1697 sites/cell , respectively ; P > 0.05 ) and affinity ( 3.93+/-0.89 nM and 4.49+/-0.71 nM , respectively ; P > 0.05 ) of <START:ggp> GR <END> between the PCOS patients and the controls . 
CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that the alterations in the HPA axis and in the cortisol metabolism observed in PCOS are not related to <START:ggp> GR <END> deficiency . 
Heterogeneous expression of the <START:ggp> lipocalin NGAL <END> in primary breast cancers . 
We have previously shown that neu oncogene-initiated rat mammary carcinomas uniquely over-express <START:ggp> neu-related lipocalin <END> ( <START:ggp> NRL <END> ) , a member of the <START:ggp> calycin protein superfamily <END> . 
Here , we characterize the <START:ggp> putative human homolog <END> of <START:ggp> NRL <END> , <START:ggp> neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin <END> ( <START:ggp> NGAL <END> ) . 
ngal gene expression was found at moderate levels in only 2 of 17 human tissues examined , breast and lung . 
When breast cancers were examined for NGAL mRNA and protein levels , they were found to exhibit heterogeneous expression . 
<START:ggp> NGAL <END> levels varied in these tumors from undetectable to exceeding those in normal breast parenchyma . 
Immuno-histochemical analysis confirmed the presence of <START:ggp> NGAL <END> within <START:ana> breast carcinoma cells <END> but detected only low levels of this protein in normal ductal epithelium . 
In contrast , large amounts of the protein were localized to the lumen of normal breast ducts in the vicinity of <START:ggp> NGAL <END> -expressing tumors . 
Interestingly , unlike <START:ggp> NRL <END> in rat mammary carcinomas , no significant association between <START:ggp> NGAL <END> expression and <START:ggp> HER-2/neu <END> activation was found in human breast tumors . 
In contrast , a significant correlation between <START:ggp> NGAL <END> expression in breast cancer was found with several other markers of poor prognosis , including estrogen and <START:ggp> progesterone receptor <END> -negative status and high proliferation ( S-phase fraction ) . 
<START:ggp> NGAL <END> levels were stratified as high or low in breast cancers from a cohort of node-positive patients with known outcome . 
No significant association between <START:ggp> NGAL <END> expression and disease-free or overall survival was observed . 
<START:ggp> BASH <END> , a <START:ggp> novel signaling molecule <END> preferentially expressed in <START:ana> B cells <END> of the bursa of Fabricius . 
The bursa of Fabricius is a gut-associated lymphoid organ that is essential for the generation of a diversified <START:ana> B cell repertoire <END> in the chicken . 
We describe here a novel gene preferentially expressed in <START:ana> bursal B cells <END> . 
The gene encodes an <START:ggp> 85-kDa protein <END> , designated <START:ggp> BASH <END> ( <START:ggp> B cell adaptor containing SH2 domain <END> ) , that contains <START:ggp> N-terminal acidic domains <END> with <START:ggp> SH2 domain-binding phosphotyrosine-based motifs <END> , a <START:ggp> proline-rich domain <END> , and a <START:ggp> C-terminal SH2 domain <END> . 
<START:ggp> BASH <END> shows a substantial sequence similarity to <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> , an adaptor protein functioning in <START:ggp> TCR <END> -signal transduction . 
<START:ggp> BASH <END> becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated with the <START:ggp> B cell Ag receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> BCR <END> ) cross-link or by coexpression with <START:ggp> Syk <END> and <START:ggp> Lyn <END> and associates with <START:ggp> signaling molecules <END> including <START:ggp> Syk <END> and a <START:ggp> putative chicken Shc homologue <END> . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> BASH <END> results in suppression of the <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> activation induced by <START:ggp> BCR <END> -cross-linking . 
These findings suggest that <START:ggp> BASH <END> is involved in <START:ggp> BCR <END> -mediated signal transduction and could play a critical role in B cell development in the bursa . 
<START:ggp> Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor <END> activates a <START:ggp> 72-kDa isoform <END> of <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> in <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> . 
<START:ggp> Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> ) signaling involves activation of <START:ggp> STATs <END> , proteins that serve the dual function of signal transduction and activation of transcription . 
We previously demonstrated that <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> activated a distinct <START:ggp> Stat3-like protein <END> in <START:ana> immature and mature normal myeloid cells <END> , <START:ggp> StatG <END> . 
<START:ggp> StatG <END> in <START:ana> normal immature human myeloid cells <END> , i.e . <START:ana> adult CD34+ bone marrow cells <END> , was composed of <START:ggp> Stat3beta <END> . 
This investigation was undertaken to determine the composition of <START:ggp> StatG <END> in <START:ana> mature normal human myeloid cells <END> , i.e . <START:ana> polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PMN <END> ) . 
These studies revealed that the <START:ggp> major protein <END> in extracts of <START:ana> PMN <END> activated by <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> to bind the <START:ggp> high-affinity serum-inducible element <END> ( <START:ggp> hSIE <END> ) is a <START:ggp> 72-kDa protein <END> that cross-reacts with <START:ggp> Stat3 monoclonal antibody <END> , which we have designated <START:ggp> Stat3gamma <END> . 
<START:ggp> Stat3gamma <END> is derived from <START:ggp> Stat3alpha <END> by limited proteolysis and lacks the <START:ggp> carboxyl-terminal portion <END> of <START:ggp> Stat3alpha <END> . 
Because this region of <START:ggp> Stat3alpha <END> is involved in transcriptional activation , our findings suggest the possibility that <START:ggp> Stat3gamma <END> may be transcriptionally inactive and may compete with <START:ggp> Stat3alpha <END> for <START:ggp> Stat3 binding sites <END> in these <START:ana> terminally differentiated myeloid cells <END> 
Association between expression of <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> and integration of human T-cell-leukemia virus type 1 in <START:ana> adult T-cell leukemia cells <END> . 
It is known that the expression levels of <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ) in <START:ana> adult T cell leukemia ( ATL ) cells <END> are high , whereas those in <START:ana> T-lymphoid cells <END> are not . 
In order to investigate the factors that influence the induction of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> molecules , Northern blot analysis to measure the expression level of <START:ana> ICAM-1 mRNAs <END> and Southern blot hybridization to analyze the integration of human T-cell-leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) provirus were done . 
The levels of <START:ana> ICAM-1 mRNA <END> expression of <START:ana> ATL cells <END> were generally higher than those of <START:ana> T-lymphoid cells <END> . 
However , <START:ana> ILT-mat cells <END> and <START:ana> ATL16T ( - ) cells <END> , although they were <START:ana> ATL cells <END> , showed rather low surface <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> expression and <START:ana> ICAM-1 mRNA <END> expression . 
Southern blot hybridization showed that only two and four bands were found in <START:ana> ILT-mat <END> and <START:ana> ATL16T ( - ) cells <END> , respectively , whereas > 10 bands were detected in other <START:ana> ATL cells <END> . 
These results suggest that monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 provirus to the genome of <START:ana> T cell <END> , especially the number of integration sites , is one of the factors for induction of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 molecules <END> . 
Heat-shock and cadmium chloride increase the vimentin mRNA and protein levels in <START:ana> U-937 human promonocytic cells <END> . 
Heat-shock for 2 hours at 42 degrees C , or the administration for 3 hours of 100 or 150 microM cadmium chloride , inhibited the <START:ana> subsequent proliferation activity <END> , induced the expression of functional <START:ggp> differentiation markers <END> , and caused an increase in the amount of the <START:ggp> stress-responsive HSP70 protein <END> in <START:ana> U-937 human promonocytic cells <END> . 
In addition , both heat and cadmium produced an increase in the amount of the <START:ggp> intermediate filament protein <END> <START:ggp> vimentin <END> , as determined by immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays . 
By contrast , the amounts of <START:ggp> actin <END> and <START:ggp> beta-tubulin <END> were not significantly altered . 
The amount of <START:ana> vimentin mRNA <END> was also increased during recovery from stress , indicating that <START:ggp> vimentin <END> expression was not exclusively regulated at the protein level . 
Although cadmium caused an early , transient stimulation of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding activity , heat-shock failed to alter both <START:ggp> protooncogene <END> expression and transcription factor binding , indicating that the stress-induced <START:ggp> vimentin <END> increase was not the result of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -mediated transcriptional activation . 
Finally , it was observed that the rate of decay of <START:ana> vimentin mRNA <END> upon actinomycin D administration was decreased in <START:ana> heat- and cadmium-pretreated cells <END> in comparison to <START:ana> untreated cells <END> . 
These results indicate that stress treatments cause an increase in <START:ggp> vimentin <END> levels in <START:ana> promonocytic cells <END> , which may be explained at least in part by transcript stabilization . 
Ovarian and breast <START:ana> cytotoxic T lymphocytes <END> can recognize peptides from the amino enhancer of split protein of the <START:ggp> Notch complex <END> . 
In this study we investigated recognition by <START:ana> ovarian tumor associated lymphocyte <END> ( <START:ana> OVTAL <END> ) , and <START:ana> breast tumor associated lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> BRTAL <END> ) , of peptides corresponding to the sequence <START:ggp> 125-135 of the Aminoenhancer of split ( AES ) protein <END> . 
Three of these peptides designated as G75 : AES1/2 ( <START:ggp> 128-135 <END> ) , G60 : AES1/2 ( <START:ggp> 127-137 <END> ) and G61 : AES1/2 ( <START:ggp> 125-133 <END> ) correspond to the <START:ggp> wildtype AES sequence <END> , while the fourth G76 : GPLTPLPV , <START:ggp> AES1/2 ( 128-135 ) <END> corresponds to a variant sequence of the peptide G75 with the N-terminal Leu substituted to glycine . 
These sequences were chosen for study because mass-spectrometric analysis ( MS ) of a <START:ana> CTL <END> active HPLC peptide fraction eluted from <START:ggp> immunoaffinity precipitated HLA-A2 molecule <END> , revealed : ( a ) the presence of an ion with a mass-to-charge ratio ( m/z ) of 793 which was more abundant than other ions of similar masses ; ( b ) the tentatively reconstituted sequence of the ion 793 matched the sequence of peptide G76 . 
We found that AES peptides G75 ( <START:ggp> 128-135 <END> ) and G76 ( <START:ggp> 128-135 <END> ) ( L128G ) reconstituted CTL recognition at concentrations ranging between 200-500 nM . 
These concentrations are lower than concentrations reported to activate effector function of CTL recognizing other <START:ggp> epithelial tumor Ag <END> . 
Furthermore , analysis with cloned <START:ana> CD8+ T cells <END> indicated that G75 and G76 were not cross-reactive specificities , suggesting a key role for the <START:ggp> N-terminal residues <END> of the variant peptide in dictating specificities . 
Since the <START:ggp> AES proteins <END> are part of a set of transcriptional repressors encoded by the <START:ggp> Enhancer of split [ E ( spl ) ] genes <END> , and since these repressors are activated to suppress cell differentiation in response to <START:ggp> Notch receptors <END> signalling , the AES peptides may represent a novel class of <START:ggp> self-antigens <END> that deserve further consideration as <START:ggp> tumor Ag <END> in epithelial cancers . 
Induction of the <START:ggp> pro-myelocytic leukaemia gene <END> by <START:ggp> type I and type II interferons <END> . 
The physiological role of the <START:ggp> pro-myelocytic leukaemia ( PML ) gene product <END> is poorly defined . 
Among other functions , <START:ggp> PML <END> is involved in haematopoietic differentiation and in control of cell growth and tumorigenesis . 
We investigated the regulation of human <START:ggp> PML <END> expression by <START:ggp> interferons <END> ( <START:ggp> IFNs <END> ) and <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> in various <START:ana> human haematopoietic lines <END> ( <START:ana> U937 <END> , <START:ana> THP1 <END> , <START:ana> HL60 <END> , <START:ana> NB4 <END> ) , in <START:ana> human diploid fibroblasts <END> and in <START:ana> human peripheral blood leukocytes <END> . 
Cytokine-induced modulation of <START:ggp> PML <END> expression was assessed by Northern blot analyses , flow cytometry studies and in situ immunolabelling . 
Our data show that <START:ggp> IFNs <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> upregulate PML transcript and protein expression in a time and dose-dependent manner . 
In situ immunolabelling revealed that upregulation of protein expression by <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> is a consequence of a marked increase in both the number and the intensity of the staining of so-called <START:ggp> PML nuclear bodies <END> . 
Our data suggest that stimulation of <START:ggp> PML <END> expression by <START:ggp> interferons <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> may account for upregulation of <START:ggp> PML proteins <END> observed in inflammatory tissues and in proliferative states . 
The position of the <START:ggp> ZEBRA activation domain <END> does not influence its biological activity . 
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a human herpesvirus which latently infects <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
EBV encodes a unique transcriptional activator , known as <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> , which can disrupt viral latency in <START:ana> B cells <END> and induce lytic viral replication . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> has been shown to bind at the EBV origin of lytic replication , and is necessary for viral DNA replication to occur . 
Previously we demonstrated that <START:ggp> heterologous activation domains <END> can fully substitute for the <START:ggp> ZEBRA activation domain <END> . 
Here we extend those results by showing that the position of the <START:ggp> ZEBRA activation domain <END> or a heterologous replacement domain does not influence its ability to function in the disruption of EBV latency . 
In this study three novel clones were constructed in which the <START:ggp> ZEBRA activation region <END> was repositioned to the <START:ggp> carboxy terminus <END> of the protein . 
These mutants were used to demonstrate that the ability of <START:ggp> ZEBRA 's wild type domain <END> to function in the complex biological process of virus activation is not compromised by altering its position within the protein . 
The modulation of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> content by 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport in <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocyte <END> in obesity . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) and 3-O-methyl-D glucose ( 3-O-MG ) transport were determined in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> ( <START:ana> MNL <END> ) from 11 abdominal obese subjects , 10 pituitary-dependent Cushing 's syndrome ( Cushing 's disease ) and 10 healthy controls . 
Using a whole-cell competitive binding assay and 3H-dexamethasone as tracer , <START:ana> MNL <END> of abdominal obese subjects were found to have 4855 +/- 1389 sites/cell which was significantly lower ( p < 0.05 ) than controls ( 6234 +/- 1568 sites/cell ) , although no significant difference was found in the mean serum cortisol level . 
Their mean Kd ( affinity ) was also significantly lower than that found in the healthy controls ( obese Kd : 2.92 +/- 0.84 nmol/l , control Kd : 4.55 +/- 0.67 nM , p < 0.05 ) . 
On the other hand , the receptor characteristics in Cushing 's disease patients were within the normal range . 
At the same time , 3-O-MG transport was determined in the same subjects . 
In Cushing 's disease , 3-O-MG transport was within the normal range , whereas in abdominal obesity this value was significantly lower than the healthy controls ( abdominal obese : 31.90 +/- 8.20 ; control : 46.26 +/- 12.91 fmol/10 ( 6 ) cell , min , p < 0.05 ) . 
We also found a positive correlation between 3-O-MG transport and <START:ggp> GR <END> binding capacity in abdominal subjects ( r = 0.89 , p < 0.001 ) , however we did not find such a correlation in Cushing 's disease ( r = 0.60 , p > 0.05 ) . 
These results indicated that , in abdominal obesity , the <START:ggp> GR <END> binding capacity in <START:ana> MNL <END> is influenced by the changes in glucose transport . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-10 <END> and <START:ggp> transforming growth factor-beta promoter polymorphisms <END> in allergies and asthma . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-10 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> ) and <START:ggp> transforming growth factor beta <END> ( <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> ) are inhibitory for <START:ana> B and T cells <END> , <START:ggp> IgE <END> production , and mast cell proliferation , and they induce apoptosis in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
These <START:ggp> cytokines <END> are therefore candidate genes which could contribute to the development of asthma or allergies . 
We investigated the hypothesis that polymorphic nucleotides within the <START:ggp> IL-10 and TGF-beta gene promoters <END> would link to the expression of allergies and asthma . 
DNA taken from families with an asthmatic proband was examined for base exchanges by single-stranded conformational polymorphism ( SSCP ) . 
We demonstrated the presence of a polymorphism in the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-10 gene <END> and four in the <START:ggp> TGF-beta gene promoters <END> ( 3 in <START:ggp> TGF-beta1 <END> and 1 in <START:ggp> TGF-beta2 <END> ) . 
The <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> gene polymorphism was a C-to-A exchange <START:ggp> 571 base pairs upstream <END> from the <START:ggp> translation start site <END> and was present between <START:ggp> consensus binding sequences <END> for <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and elevated total serum . 
This polymorphism was associated with elevated <START:ggp> total serum IgE <END> in subjects heterozygotic or homozygotic for this base exchange ( p < 0.009 ) . 
The base exchange at -509 ( from the transcription initiation site ) in the <START:ggp> TGF-beta promoter <END> also linked to elevated total <START:ggp> IgE <END> ( p < 0.01 ) . 
This polymorphism represented a C-to-T base exchange which induced a <START:ggp> YY1 consensus sequence <END> and is present in a region of the promoter associated with negative transcription regulation . 
<START:ggp> Tpl-2 <END> induces <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression in <START:ana> T-cell lines <END> by triggering multiple signaling pathways that activate <START:ggp> NFAT <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Tpl-2 kinase <END> activates the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) and induces <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression in <START:ana> T-cell lines <END> . 
Here we show that the activation of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> by <START:ggp> Tpl-2 <END> is inhibited by <START:ggp> mutant signaling molecules <END> that inhibit the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MAPK <END> ) or the <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> <START:ggp> /NFAT <END> pathways and is promoted by combinations of <START:ggp> signaling molecules <END> that activate these pathways . 
We , therefore , conclude that signals generated by the convergence of the <START:ggp> MAPK <END> and the <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> <START:ggp> /NFAT <END> pathway are necessary and sufficient for the activation of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> by <START:ggp> Tpl-2 <END> . 
The activation of both the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> and an <START:ggp> NFAT-driven minimal promoter <END> were shown to depend on signals transduced by <START:ggp> Raf1 <END> . 
However , it was only the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> whose activation by <START:ggp> Tpl-2 <END> was fully blocked by the <START:ggp> dominant negative mutant MEK1S218/222A <END> and the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor PD098059 . 
Since the activation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> is <START:ggp> MAPK <END> -dependent these findings suggested that the activation of <START:ggp> MAPK <END> by <START:ggp> Tpl-2 <END> is either independent or only partially dependent on <START:ggp> MEK1 <END> and <START:ggp> MEK2 <END> . 
In addition , they suggested that the activation of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> is under the control of not only <START:ggp> NFAT <END> but also a second factor whose activation is <START:ggp> MEK <END> -dependent . 
Experiments in <START:ana> COS-1 <END> and <START:ana> EL-4 cells <END> confirmed both hypotheses and revealed that the second factor activated by <START:ggp> Tpl-2 <END> is <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
While the activation of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> and an <START:ggp> NFAT-driven minimal promoter <END> by <START:ggp> Tpl-2 <END> was fully blocked by the <START:ggp> dominant negative mutant <END> <START:ggp> NFAT delta418 <END> , it was only partially blocked by the <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> inhibitor cyclosporin A suggesting that the <START:ggp> Tpl-2 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activation is under the control of a combination of calcineurin-dependent and independent pathways . 
Both pathways were fully blocked by <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> or <START:ggp> Bcl-X ( L ) <END> . 
Differential activation of functionally distinct <START:ggp> STAT5 proteins <END> by <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> and <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> during eosinophil and neutrophil differentiation from <START:ana> human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-5 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> ) and <START:ggp> granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) are important <START:ggp> cytokines <END> for the proliferation , differentiation , and activation of <START:ana> myeloid lineages <END> . 
The <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> /STAT <END> pathway is one of the signaling pathways implicated in mediating biological responses induced by these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
Previous studies have demonstrated that these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> predominantly activate an <START:ggp> 80 kDa STAT5 isoform <END> in mature granulocytes . 
To better understand the role of STAT proteins during growth and differentiation of granulocytes , we evaluated differentiation of <START:ana> human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells <END> ex vivo toward <START:ana> eosinophils <END> and neutrophils . 
Bandshift experiments showed that in an early stage of both differentiation pathways ( 14 days ) , the 94 kDa <START:ggp> STAT5B protein <END> was activated by both <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> ( <START:ana> eosinophil lineage <END> ) and <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ( <START:ana> neutrophil lineage <END> ) . 
However , during maturation of both lineages ( days 21 and 28 ) , increased expression of a functionally distinct <START:ggp> 80 kDa STAT5 isoform <END> was observed , resulting in <START:ggp> heterodimer DNA-binding complexes <END> containing both the 94 and 80 kDa <START:ggp> STAT5 proteins <END> . 
The finding that functionally distinct isoforms of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> are activated during the early and late differentiation stages of granulocytes suggests that they might be involved in regulating different biological functions in these cells . 
The <START:ggp> T-cell oncogenic protein HOX11 <END> activates <START:ggp> Aldh1 <END> expression in <START:ana> NIH 3T3 cells <END> but represses its expression in mouse spleen development . 
<START:ggp> Hox11 <END> is a <START:ggp> homeobox gene <END> essential for spleen formation in mice , since atrophy of the anlage of a developing spleen occurs in early embryonic development in Hox11 null mice . 
<START:ggp> HOX11 <END> is also expressed in a subset of T-cell acute leukemias after specific chromosomal translocations . 
Since the protein has a <START:ggp> homeodomain <END> and can activate transcription , it probably exerts at least some of its effects in vivo by regulation of <START:ggp> target genes <END> . 
Representational difference analysis has been used to isolate <START:ggp> cDNA clones <END> corresponding to <START:ana> mRNA species <END> activated following stable expression of <START:ggp> HOX11 <END> in <START:ana> NIH 3T3 cells <END> . 
The gene encoding the <START:ggp> retinoic acid-synthesizing enzyme <END> <START:ggp> aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> Aldh1 <END> ) , initially called <START:ggp> Hdg-1 <END> , was found to be ectopically activated by <START:ggp> HOX11 <END> in this system . 
Study of <START:ggp> Aldh1 <END> gene expression during spleen development showed that the presence of <START:ana> Aldh1 mRNA <END> inversely correlated with <START:ggp> Hox11 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Hox11 <END> null mouse embryos have elevated <START:ana> Aldh1 mRNA <END> in spleen primordia prior to atrophy , while <START:ggp> Aldh1 <END> seems to be repressed by <START:ggp> Hox11 <END> during organogenesis of the spleens of wild-type mice . 
This result suggests that expression of <START:ggp> Aldh1 protein <END> is negatively regulated by <START:ggp> Hox11 <END> and that abnormal expression of <START:ggp> Aldh1 <END> in <START:ggp> Hox11 <END> null mice may cause loss of <START:ana> splenic precursor cells <END> by aberrant retinoic acid metabolism 
Role of the <START:ggp> X2 box <END> in activated transcription from the <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
We investigated the function of the evolutionary conserved <START:ggp> X2 box <END> in the <START:ggp> promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> HLA-DRA gene <END> from the <START:ggp> human major histocompatibility complex <END> ( <START:ggp> MHC <END> ) in resting and activated <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-X2 <END> , which contains members of the <START:ggp> AP-1/ATF/CREB families <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , interacts with the <START:ggp> X2 box <END> ( 5'-TGCGTCA-3 ' ) from positions -97 to -91 in the <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> . 
In resting <START:ana> Raji cells <END> , little to no binding to the <START:ggp> X2 box <END> was observed . 
In sharp contrast , in <START:ana> B cells <END> treated with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) , strong interactions between the <START:ggp> X2 box <END> and <START:ggp> NF-X2 <END> containing <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> were observed . 
As determined by transient expression and RNA analyses , the activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) also increased rates of transcription from the wild-type <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> but not from a <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> bearing clustered point mutations in the <START:ggp> X2 box <END> . 
Since the co-expression with a dominant negative <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> abolished the responsiveness to TPA , we conclude that activated transcription of the <START:ggp> DRA gene <END> depends on interactions between the <START:ggp> X2 box <END> and <START:ggp> NF-X2 <END> , which contains <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> . 
Thymocytes control the <START:ggp> CD4 gene <END> differently from <START:ana> mature T lymphocytes <END> . 
We analyzed the activity of the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> , the <START:ggp> promoter <END> and the <START:ggp> silencer <END> of the <START:ggp> human CD4 gene <END> during T cell development using transgenic mice . 
Immunofluorescence studies on <START:ana> thymic populations <END> of mice carrying transgenes in various combinations of these <START:ggp> regulatory DNA elements <END> revealed that <START:ana> thymocytes <END> control the <START:ggp> CD4 gene <END> in a different manner than mature <START:ana> peripheral T lymphocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> 5'-positive regulatory unit <END> , consisting of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> and the <START:ggp> 5 ' enhancer <END> , is already active at the <START:ggp> CD4 <END> - <START:ggp> CD8 <END> -double-negative ( DN ) stage of development . 
However , its activity becomes lower in the double-positive and a fraction of the <START:ana> CD4+ CD8int/- cell population <END> , indicating that an additional enhancer , located in either the <START:ggp> first or the third intron <END> of the <START:ggp> CD4 gene <END> , is required for <START:ggp> CD4 gene <END> expression in this population . 
The other studied <START:ggp> regulatory element <END> is the <START:ggp> minimal CD4 silencer <END> which inhibits <START:ggp> CD4 gene <END> expression in <START:ana> peripheral CD8 T lymphocytes <END> . 
This silencer is inactive in the most <START:ana> immature DN thymocytes <END> , which probably use a distinct silencer mechanism to down-regulate <START:ggp> CD4 gene <END> expression . 
Unexpectedly , the <START:ggp> CD4 silencer <END> is also active in <START:ana> CD4+ CD8int/- cells <END> of the thymus , implying that an anti-silencer may be required to resume <START:ggp> CD4 <END> expression in this cell population . 
Altogether , the <START:ggp> CD4 gene <END> is regulated by several positive and negative regulatory mechanisms which come into play in a developmentally coordinated manner . 
[ Induction of apoptosis in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> by glucocorticoids : between physiology and pharmacology ] 
Glucocorticoids are physiological molecules that are also extensively used in clinics as anti-inflammatory , immunosuppressive or anti-tumoral agents . 
Glucocorticoids can induce apoptosis on <START:ana> normal lymphoid cells <END> and play a key role in the physiology of thymic selection . 
In clinics these molecules are also used for their potencies in inducing apoptosis of <START:ana> malignant lymphoid cells <END> . 
Glucocorticoids are mediating their effects after binding to an <START:ggp> intracellular receptor <END> belonging to the <START:ggp> steroid receptor superfamily <END> : the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) . 
Once activated , the <START:ggp> GR <END> , can mediate his effects through direct binding on the DNA or via protein/protein interactions with <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Depending on the type of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , the mechanism of apoptosis induced by glucocorticoids fall roughly in two categories : induction of `` death genes '' by the activated <START:ggp> GR <END> ( <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> c-jun <END> ) or repression of <START:ggp> survival factors <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> c-Myc <END> ) . 
In the case of thymic selection the mechanism is more subtle depending on the mutual repression of <START:ggp> Nur77 <END> and <START:ggp> GR <END> . 
Direct suppression of <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> function during adenoviral infection . 
The action of <START:ggp> adenoviral E1A oncoprotein <END> on <START:ggp> host immune-response genes <END> has been attributed to interaction with <START:ggp> p300/CBP-type transcriptional coactivators <END> in competition with <START:ggp> endogenous transcription factors <END> such as <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) proteins <END> . 
However , we show that mutant forms of <START:ggp> E1A <END> that no longer bind <START:ggp> p300/CBP <END> can still interact directly with <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> ( via <START:ggp> E1A N-terminal and Stat1 C-terminal residues <END> ) and block IFNgamma-driven , <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> -dependent gene activation and consequent function during early-phase infection in the <START:ana> natural host cell <END> . 
The results provide a distinct and more specific mechanism for <START:ggp> E1A <END> -mediated immune suppression and an alternative model of <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> -driven enhanceosome formation that may allow for other adaptors ( in addition to <START:ggp> p300/CBP <END> ) to link <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> to the <START:ggp> basal transcription complex <END> . 
Effect of environmental estrogens on <START:ggp> IL-1beta promoter <END> activity in a <START:ana> macrophage cell line <END> . 
Environmental estrogens or estrogen disrupters have recently received a great deal of attention because of their potential health impact on reproductive tissues . 
Few , if any , studies have been made on the impact of these compounds on the immune system . 
We sought to determine the activities of various environmental estrogens on the modulation of the <START:ggp> interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) gene <END> in a <START:ana> model monocytic cell line <END> , <START:ana> hER + IL-1beta-CAT+ <END> . 
This cell line stably transfected with the <START:ggp> human estrogen receptor <END> , and an <START:ggp> IL-1beta promoter <END> construct fused to the <START:ggp> CAT reporter gene <END> allows us to monitor the effect of estrogenic compounds on <START:ggp> IL-1beta promoter <END> activity . 
17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) markedly enhanced lipopolysaccharide - ( LPS ) induced <START:ggp> IL-1beta promoter <END> -driven <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity in a dose-dependent manner . 
The mycotoxins alpha-zearalenol and zearalenone both exhibited full agonist activity , but at lower potencies , with EC50 values of 1.8 and 54 nM , respectively , compared with E2 at 0.5 nM . 
In addition , genistein was a very low-potency agonist , having an EC50 of 1.5 microM . 
Similar to the E2 response , the slope factors for alpha-zearalenol , zearalenone , and genistein were close to 3.0 , suggesting positive cooperativity in the estrogenic response . 
The activity of the mycotoxins appeared to be mediated through the estrogen receptor , since both the antiestrogens H1285 and ICI 182 , 780 effectively inhibited their agonist activity in a dose-dependent manner . 
Representative environmental estrogenic compounds both from plant and industrial sources were also tested . 
Unlike the mycoestrogens , none of the compounds , with the exception of genistein , synergized with LPS to enhance <START:ggp> IL-1beta promoter <END> activity . 
When tested for antiestrogenic activity , the industrial compound 4-octylphenol was able to antagonize the response to E2 ; however , the response was three orders of magnitude less potent than H 1285 . 
Naringenin , a plant flavonoid , showed little or no ability to antagonize the response to E2 . 
Overall , the results show that some environmental estrogens that display agonist activity in reproductive tissue also have an effect on <START:ggp> IL-1 gene <END> expression in hemopoietic-derived tissue . 
Isolation and utilization of <START:ana> human dendritic cells <END> from peripheral blood to assay an in vitro primary immune response to varicella-zoster virus peptides . 
A human dendritic cell-based assay used to monitor a T cell proliferation response to viral peptides in vitro is described . 
<START:ana> Dendritic cells <END> and <START:ana> autologous CD4+ T cells <END> were isolated from peripheral blood by a series of density-gradient centrifugations or magnetic bead separations ( or both ) . 
Peptides corresponding to residues of the <START:ggp> immediate early protein <END> , <START:ggp> IE62 <END> , of varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) were used as <START:ggp> stimulating antigens <END> , and persons with no history of varicella and no humoral or cellular immunity to VZV served as naive donors for the assays . 
Three VZV-susceptible donors were tested , and all demonstrated an in vitro response to multiple VZV peptides . 
This assay has potential as a screen to establish the immunogenicity of viral antigens in vitro using <START:ana> T cells <END> from naive donors . 
Xenogeneic human serum promotes leukocyte adhesion to porcine endothelium under flow conditions , possibly through the activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor NF-kappa B <END> . 
Endothelial cell activation and leukocyte infiltration are a consistent feature of discordant xenograft rejection . 
Here we evaluated whether xenogeneic serum , as a source of <START:ggp> xenoreactive natural antibodies <END> and complement , induced endothelial cell activation with consequent leukocyte adhesion under flow conditions . 
<START:ana> Porcine aortic endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> PAEC <END> ) were incubated for 1 hr 30 min or 5 hr with 10 % homologous porcine serum ( control ) or 10 % xenogeneic human serum and then perfused with total <START:ana> human leukocytes <END> in a parallel plate flow chamber under laminar flow ( 1.5 dynes/cm2 ) . 
Adherent cells were counted by digital image analysis . 
Xenogeneic human serum significantly ( P < 0.01 ) increased the number of <START:ana> adherent leukocytes <END> as compared with porcine serum . 
A similar adhesive response was elicited by TNF alpha ( 100 U/ml ) , one of the most potent inducers of <START:ana> endothelial cell <END> adhesive properties , here used as positive control . 
In order to elucidate possible mechanisms underlying <START:ana> endothelial cell <END> activation by xenogeneic serum , we focussed on <START:ggp> transcription factor NF-kappa B <END> , a central regulator for the induction of different genes , including <START:ggp> adhesive molecules <END> and <START:ggp> chemoattractants <END> . 
By confocal fluorescence microscopy , we observed a positive staining for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> p65 subunit <END> ) in the nuclei of <START:ana> PAEC <END> exposed for 1 hr 30 min to human serum , which indicated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in this setting . 
At variance , in <START:ana> PAEC <END> incubated with the homologous serum , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was strictly localized in the cell cytoplasm . 
Treatment of <START:ana> PAEC <END> exposed to xenogeneic serum with the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> inhibitors pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate ( PDTC , 25 microM ) and tosyl-phechloromethylketone ( TPCK , 25 microM ) significantly ( P < 0.01 ) reduced leukocyte adhesion in respect to <START:ana> PAEC <END> treated with human serum alone . 
Findings that xenogeneic serum promotes leukocyte-endothelium interaction possibly through <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation might be relevant for designing future therapeutic strategies aimed at prolonging xenograft survival . 
<START:ggp> Anaphylatoxins <END> <START:ggp> C5a <END> and <START:ggp> C3a <END> induce <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> human peripheral blood monocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> anaphylatoxins <END> <START:ggp> C5a <END> and <START:ggp> C3a <END> are involved in the regulation of cytokine production . 
In this study the capability of <START:ggp> C5a <END> and <START:ggp> C3a <END> to induce transcription factor activation was examined . 
<START:ggp> C5a <END> and <START:ggp> C3a <END> stimulation of <START:ana> human peripheral blood monocytes <END> resulted in nuclear expression of a DNA binding activity with specificity to the <START:ggp> kappaB sequence <END> . 
The <START:ggp> p50 and p65 proteins <END> , constituents of the prototypic <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> , were identified as components of the DNA-protein complexes by <START:ggp> anti-peptide antibodies <END> in gel supershift assays . 
<START:ggp> C5a <END> induced <START:ggp> kappaB <END> binding activity was detected 15 min after agonist stimulation , peaked at 30-40 min , and remained detectable at 2 h . 
Binding to <START:ggp> kappaB sequence <END> was accompanied by an initial decrease and subsequent increase in the cytoplasmic <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> levels , as detected by Western blotting using an <START:ggp> anti-IkappaBalpha antibody <END> . 
Pertussis toxin treatment markedly decreased <START:ggp> kappaB <END> binding activities induced by both <START:ggp> C5a <END> and <START:ggp> C3a <END> , whereas <START:ggp> cholera toxin <END> displayed no inhibitory effect . 
Neither of the two toxins affected <START:ggp> kappaB <END> binding activity induced by <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> in the same cells . 
These results imply a potential role of the <START:ggp> anaphylatoxins <END> <START:ggp> C5a <END> and <START:ggp> C3a <END> in regulating leukocytes gene expression through G protein-coupled transcription factor activation . 
<START:ggp> Thrombopoietin <END> and its receptor . 
<START:ggp> Thrombopoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> TPO <END> ) , the primary physiological regulator of platelet production , was initially thought to be a lineage-specific factor acting predominantly on megakaryocytopoiesis . 
Detailed studies establish that this cytokine mediates biological effects on a broad spectrum of <START:ana> hematopoietic progenitor cells <END> , including <START:ana> stem cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> TPO <END> is a hormone constitutively produced mainly by the liver and kidney . 
Plasma <START:ggp> TPO <END> levels are regulated by the platelet and megakaryocyte mass through <START:ggp> Mpl receptor <END> binding , internalization and degradation . 
The <START:ggp> Mpl receptor <END> is a member of the <START:ggp> hematopoietin receptor superfamily <END> lacking intrinsic kinase activity . 
Upon ligand-induced Mpl homodimerization , the major signaling events for proliferation are mediated through the <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> <START:ggp> /STAT5 <END> pathway , while differentiation might occur through a prolonged activation of the <START:ggp> MAPK <END> pathway . 
Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate the potential use of <START:ggp> TPO <END> in a variety of contexts , but it is too early to evaluate its benefit in reducing platelet transfusion . 
<START:ggp> TAL1 <END> and <START:ggp> LIM-only proteins <END> synergistically induce <START:ggp> retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 <END> expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by acting as cofactors for <START:ggp> GATA3 <END> . 
Previously , we have shown that <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> and the <START:ggp> LIM-only protein gene <END> ( <START:ggp> LMO <END> ) are regularly coactivated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) . 
This observation is likely to relate to the findings that <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> and <START:ggp> LMO <END> are highly synergistic in T-cell tumorigenesis in double-transgenic mice . 
To understand the molecular mechanisms of functional synergy between <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> and <START:ggp> LMO <END> in tumorigenesis and transcriptional regulation , we tried to identify <START:ggp> downstream target genes <END> regulated by <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> and <START:ggp> LMO <END> by a subtractive PCR method . 
One of the isolated genes , that for <START:ggp> retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> RALDH2 <END> ) , was regularly expressed in most of the <START:ana> T-ALL cell lines <END> that coexpressed <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> and <START:ggp> LMO <END> . 
Exogenously transfected <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> and <START:ggp> LMO <END> , but not either alone , induced <START:ggp> RALDH2 <END> expression in a <START:ana> T-ALL cell line <END> , <START:ana> HPB-ALL <END> , not expressing endogeneous <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> or <START:ggp> LMO <END> . 
The <START:ana> RALDH2 transcripts <END> in T-ALL were , however , mostly initiated within the <START:ana> second intron <END> . 
Promoter analysis revealed that a <START:ggp> GATA site <END> in a <START:ggp> cryptic promoter <END> in the <START:ggp> second intron <END> was essential and sufficient for the TAL1- and LMO-dependent transcriptional activation , and <START:ggp> GATA3 <END> binds to this site . 
In addition , forced expression of <START:ggp> GATA3 <END> potentiated the induction of <START:ggp> RALDH2 <END> by <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> and <START:ggp> LMO <END> , and these three factors formed a complex in vivo . 
Furthermore , a <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> mutant not binding to DNA also activated the transcription of <START:ggp> RALDH2 <END> in the presence of <START:ggp> LMO <END> and <START:ggp> GATA3 <END> . 
Collectively , we have identified the <START:ggp> RALDH2 gene <END> as a first example of direct <START:ggp> transcriptional target genes <END> regulated by <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> and <START:ggp> LMO <END> in T-ALL . 
In this case , <START:ggp> TAL1 <END> and <START:ggp> LMO <END> act as cofactors for <START:ggp> GATA3 <END> to activate the transcription of <START:ggp> RALDH2 <END> 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> in relation to age and to sport activity . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) are ubiquitous molecules and are present also in the hippocampus and in several other nervous and immune tissues . 
<START:ana> Peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMCs <END> ) are a good model for studies of <START:ggp> GR <END> in humans . 
Glucocorticoids are important for maintaining cellular and humoral homeostasis and are key mediators of neuroendocrine-immune regulatory interactions . 
The increase of cortisol is immunosuppressive and reduces <START:ggp> GR <END> concentration both in nervous and immune systems . 
Variation of glucocorticoids in healthy aged subjects and athletes has been shown . 
Prompted by these results , we have investigated in man a possible relationship between <START:ggp> GR <END> binding capacity in the <START:ana> PBMCs <END> and age , in relation also to plasma testosterone and cortisol . 
The same parameters have been examined in a group of soccer players for comparison with the sedentary group . 
<START:ggp> GR <END> binding capacity was higher in younger subjects than in older ones , and lower in the group of athletes than in the younger and older sedentary subjects . 
In the sedentary group a negative correlation was present between <START:ggp> GR <END> binding capacity and age . 
Plasma cortisol was higher and testosterone lower in the athletes ; they were negatively correlated in athletes and positively correlated in the sedentary subjects . 
The results for athletes agree with their lower anabolic/catabolic balance . 
The mechanism of reduced <START:ggp> GR <END> levels in relation to age and sport activity could involve a loss or an involution of receptor synthesis . 
However other possibilities , such as altered distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations with different receptor concentrations and with different <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production , can not be excluded . 
Several neuroendocrine-immune interactions could be responsible for reduced <START:ggp> GR <END> levels with age and sport activity in man . 
Glycation-dependent , reactive oxygen species-mediated suppression of the insulin gene promoter activity in <START:ana> HIT cells <END> . 
Prolonged poor glycemic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients often leads to a decline in insulin secretion from <START:ana> pancreatic beta cells <END> , accompanied by a decrease in the insulin content of the cells . 
As a step toward elucidating the pathophysiological background of the so-called glucose toxicity to <START:ana> pancreatic beta cells <END> , we induced glycation in <START:ana> HIT-T15 cells <END> using a sugar with strong deoxidizing activity , D-ribose , and examined the effects on insulin gene transcription . 
The results of <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> analyses revealed that the <START:ggp> insulin gene promoter <END> is more sensitive to glycation than the control <START:ggp> beta-actin gene promoter <END> ; approximately 50 and 80 % of the <START:ggp> insulin gene promoter <END> activity was lost when the cells were kept for 3 d in the presence of 40 and 60 mM D-ribose , respectively . 
In agreement with this , decrease in the <START:ana> insulin mRNA <END> and insulin content was observed in the <START:ana> glycation-induced cells <END> . 
Also , gel mobility shift analyses using specific antiserum revealed decrease in the DNA-binding activity of an <START:ggp> insulin gene transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> PDX-1/IPF1/STF-1 <END> . 
These effects of D-ribose seemed almost irreversible but could be prevented by addition of 1 mM aminoguanidine or 10 mM N-acetylcysteine , thus suggesting that glycation and reactive oxygen species , generated through the glycation reaction , serve as mediators of the phenomena . 
These observations suggest that protein glycation in <START:ana> pancreatic beta cells <END> , which occurs in vivo under chronic hyperglycemia , suppresses insulin gene transcription and thus can explain part of the beta cell glucose toxicity . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor-kappa B <END> activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> from patients with rheumatic diseases : a preliminary report . 
OBJECTIVE : The <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> regulates the expression of many genes involved in the immune or inflammatory response at the transcriptional level . 
The aim of this study was to determine whether distinctive patterns of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation are seen in different forms of joint disease . 
METHODS : The DNA binding activity of these <START:ggp> nucleoproteins <END> was examined in purified <START:ana> synovial and peripheral T cells <END> from patients with various chronic rheumatic diseases ( 12 : four with rheumatoid arthritis ; five with spondyloarthropathies ; and three with osteoarthritis ) . 
RESULTS : Electrophoretic mobility shift assays disclosed two specific complexes bound to a <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> specific 32P-labelled oligonucleotide in <START:ggp> nucleoproteins <END> extracted from <START:ana> purified T cells <END> isolated from synovial fluid and peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis . 
The <START:ggp> complexes <END> consisted of <START:ggp> p50/p50 homodimers <END> and p50/p65 heterodimers . 
Increased <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding to DNA in <START:ana> synovial T cells <END> was observed relative to peripheral T cells . 
In non-rheumatoid arthritis , binding of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> synovial T cells <END> was exclusively mediated by <START:ggp> p50/p50 homodimers <END> . 
CONCLUSION : Overall , the results suggest that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> may play a central part in the activation of <START:ana> infiltrating T cells <END> in chronic rheumatoid arthritis . 
The activation of this nuclear factor is qualitatively different in <START:ana> rheumatoid synovial T cells <END> to that in other forms of non-rheumatoid arthritis ( for example , osteoarthritis , spondyloarthropathies ) . 
<START:ggp> X chromosome <END> inactivation patterns in normal females . 
Since one of the two <START:ggp> X chromosomes <END> is randomly inactivated at an early stage of female embryonic development , <START:ggp> X-linked markers <END> have been used to study the origin and development of various neoplastic disorders in affected heterozygous women ; clonality assays have provided a useful tool to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of neoplasia . 
Recently , a technique of clonal analysis has been devised that takes advantage of a highly polymorphic <START:ggp> short tandem repeat <END> within the <START:ggp> X-linked human androgen receptor ( AR ) gene <END> , resulting in a heterozygosity rate approaching 90 % . 
The rapid expansion of the number of women now suitable for X inactivation analysis has however given rise to new controversies , one of the more troublesome being the possibility of a modification of the pattern of <START:ggp> X- chromosome <END> inactivation pattern in <START:ana> blood cells <END> of elderly women . 
In the present study we analyze with the AR assay a group of 166 healthy females aged between 8 and 94 years , with no history of genetic or neoplastic familial disorders . 
We failed to find any correlation between age and <START:ggp> X- chromosome <END> inactivation pattern ( r = 0.17 ) , even subdividing the subjects in different age groups according to the criteria used by other researchers , and therefore reaffirm that , when tested for with well-standardized and accurate criteria , extremely unbalanced inactivation of the <START:ggp> X chromosome <END> is a truly uncommon phenomenon in normal women .

The role of <START:ggp> Stat4 <END> in species-specific regulation of Th cell development by <START:ggp> type I IFNs <END> . 
<START:ggp> Type I IFNs <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-alpha/beta <END> ) , in addition to <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , have been shown to play an important role in the differentiation of human , but not mouse , <START:ana> Th cells <END> . 
We show here that <START:ggp> IFN-alpha/beta <END> act directly on <START:ana> human T cells <END> to drive Th1 development , bypassing the need for <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> -induced signaling , whereas <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> can not substitute <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> for mouse Th1 development . 
The molecular basis for this species specificity is that <START:ggp> IFN-alpha/beta <END> activate <START:ggp> Stat4 <END> in differentiating human , but not mouse , <START:ana> Th cells <END> . 
Unlike <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , which acts only on <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> , <START:ggp> IFN-alpha/beta <END> can activate <START:ggp> Stat4 <END> not only in <START:ana> human Th1 <END> , but also in <START:ana> Th2 cells <END> . 
However , restimulation of <START:ana> human Th2 lines <END> and clones in the presence of <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> does not induce the production of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
These results suggest that activation of <START:ggp> Stat4 <END> , which is necessary for the differentiation of <START:ana> naive T cells <END> into polarized <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> , is not sufficient to induce phenotype reversal of <START:ana> human Th2 cells <END> . 
Molecular cloning of <START:ggp> FKHRL1P2 <END> , a member of the developmentally regulated <START:ggp> fork head domain transcription factor family <END> . 
Here we report the expression of a <START:ggp> fork head domain protein <END> in <START:ana> human T helper cells <END> . 
We cloned and characterized a <START:ggp> fork head cDNA <END> from <START:ana> human T helper cell mRNA <END> using differential display RT-PCR . 
The cDNA contains a <START:ggp> 546-nucleotide ( nt ) open reading frame <END> ( <START:ggp> ORF <END> ) that codes for the <START:ggp> carboxyl-terminal 180 amino acids <END> ( aa ) of the recently identified <START:ggp> fkhrl1 gene <END> . 
This <START:ggp> ORF <END> does not contain the characteristic <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> found in members of the <START:ggp> forkhead protein family <END> . 
In-vitro transcription/translation of this <START:ggp> cDNA <END> expressed a protein of approximately 20 kDa . 
We have generated antibodies that specifically immunoprecipitated the <START:ggp> in-vitro-translated 20-kDa protein <END> . 
This antibody also recognizes in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> a 70-kDa protein corresponding in size to that predicted for the <START:ggp> fkhrl1 gene <END> product . 
The mRNA levels for <START:ggp> fkhrl1 <END> is elevated in <START:ana> T helper-induced lymphocytes <END> in comparison to <START:ana> PHA-stimulated T lymphocytes <END> . 
Further characterization of <START:ggp> FKHRL1 <END> and its related family members should shed light on the transcriptional mechanisms of this <START:ggp> fork head gene subfamily <END> and their role in T helper cell differentiation and regulation of cell growth . 
Inhibition of Th1 development mediated by <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> through an IL-4-independent mechanism . 
Recently , the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> was shown to be selectively expressed in Th2 but not <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> and to augment <START:ggp> Th2-specific cytokines <END> . 
Here , we show that loss of <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> expression by developing <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> requires <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> signaling through <START:ggp> Stat4 <END> and does not simply result from an absence of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> . 
Moreover , we demonstrate a novel role for <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> in directly repressing Th1 development distinct from its positive actions on <START:ggp> Th2-specific cytokines <END> . 
<START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> inhibits <START:ggp> Th1 cytokines <END> by a cell-intrinsic mechanism that is not dependent on <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and that may involve repression of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> signaling . 
Thus , <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> expression and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> signaling are mutually antagonistic , which facilitates rapid dominance of one pathway during early Th development , producing a stable divergence in <START:ggp> cytokine <END> profiles . 
<START:ggp> Conserved elements <END> containing <START:ggp> NF-E2 and tandem GATA binding sites <END> are required for erythroid-specific chromatin structure reorganization within the <START:ggp> human beta-globin locus control region <END> . 
Proper expression of the genes of the <START:ggp> human beta-globin gene locus <END> requires the associated <START:ggp> locus control region <END> ( <START:ggp> LCR <END> ) . 
Structurally , the <START:ggp> LCR <END> is defined by the presence of four domains of erythroid-specific chromatin structure . 
These domains , which have been characterized as <START:ggp> DNase I hypersensitive sites <END> ( <START:ggp> HSs <END> ) , comprise the active elements of the <START:ggp> LCR <END> . 
The major focus of this research is to define the <START:ggp> cis -acting elements <END> which are required for the formation of these domains of unique chromatin structure . 
Our previous investigations on the formation of <START:ggp> LCR HS4 <END> demonstrated that <START:ggp> NF-E2 and tandem , inverted GATA binding sites <END> are required for the formation of the <START:ggp> native HS <END> . 
Similarly arranged <START:ggp> NF-E2 and tandem GATA sites <END> are present within the <START:ggp> core regions <END> of the other <START:ggp> human LCR HSs <END> and are evolutionarily conserved . 
Using site-directed mutagenesis of <START:ggp> human HSs 2 and 3 <END> we have tested the hypothesis that these <START:ggp> NF-E2 and GATA sites <END> are common requirements for the formation of all <START:ggp> LCR HSs <END> . 
We find that mutation of these elements , and particularly the <START:ggp> GATA elements <END> , results in a decrease or complete loss of <START:ggp> DNase I <END> hypersensitivity . 
These data imply the presence of common structural elements within the core of each <START:ggp> LCR HS <END> which are required for erythroid-specific chromatin structure reorganization . 
Cloning of <START:ggp> ARE-containing genes <END> by AU-motif-directed display . 
A procedure suitable for <START:ana> cloning labile mRNAs <END> that contain AU motifs is presented ( AU-DD ) . 
These motifs are <START:ggp> regulatory sequences <END> within the so-called <START:ggp> AU-rich elements <END> ( <START:ggp> AREs <END> ) often found in <START:ggp> 3 ' untranslated regions <END> of genes such as <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , <START:ggp> proto-oncogenes <END> , and <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
<START:ggp> AU-DD <END> is an <START:ggp> AU-motif-directed differential display <END> that permits the identification of <START:ggp> ARE-containing genes <END> differentially expressed after cell activation . 
It has been applied to <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> and a <START:ana> T cell clone <END> to isolate <START:ggp> 59 cDNA fragments <END> associated to activation . 
Fourteen percent of isolated fragments belong to already known genes that certainly are <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> transduction/transcription factors <END> . 
The remaining 86 % correspond to unknown <START:ggp> genes <END> of which 92 % have been confirmed to be differentially expressed . 
These data demonstrate the efficiency of the system and support the notion that numerous <START:ggp> genes <END> falling into those categories remain unidentified and that they can be cloned by this method .

Transcription factor <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> regulation of renal fibrosis during ureteral obstruction . 
Irrespective of the etiology , many kidney diseases result in inflammation and fibrosis of the tubulointerstitium , with the subsequent loss of renal function . 
To initiate any disease process or for any disease process to progress , there must be changes in the transcription of genes within the affected tissue . 
The <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> regulates genes involved in inflammation , cell proliferation , and cell differentiation . 
This review discusses the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB transcription factor family <END> in general and the association of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation with cellular/molecular events of renal inflammation and fibrosis 
Expression of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> during sodium phenylacetate induced erythroid differentiation in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
During 15 days of treatment of <START:ana> K562 cells <END> with sodium phenylacetate , we observed an increase in the cellular <START:ggp> hemoglobin <END> concentration with a similar increase in the expression of <START:ana> gamma-globin mRNA <END> . 
Morphological studies demonstrated characteristic features of erythroid differentiation and maturation . 
At the same time there was no change in the level of expression of the <START:ggp> cell surface antigenes <END> <START:ggp> CD33 <END> , <START:ggp> CD34 <END> , <START:ggp> CD45 <END> , <START:ggp> CD71 <END> and <START:ggp> glycophorin A <END> . 
Likewise , the level of expression of the <START:ggp> erythroid transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> , <START:ggp> NF-E2 <END> , <START:ggp> SCL <END> and <START:ggp> RBTN2 <END> , all expressed in untreated <START:ana> K562 cells <END> , did not increase during sodium phenylacetate induced erythroid differentiation . 
The expression of the <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> <START:ggp> Evi-1 <END> and <START:ggp> c-myb <END> , known to inhibit erythroid differentiation , did not decrease . 
We conclude that sodium phenylacetate treatment of <START:ana> K562 cells <END> increases <START:ana> gamma-globin mRNA <END> and induces cell maturation as judged by morphology without affecting the expression of the <START:ggp> erythroid transcription factors <END> , some of which are known to be involved in the regulation of <START:ggp> beta-like globin genes <END> . 
Isolation of a <START:ggp> B-cell-specific promoter <END> for the <START:ggp> human class II transactivator <END> . 
The <START:ggp> class II transactivator <END> ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) is essential for the expression of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II antigens <END> . 
The tissular patterns of CIITA and MHC class II gene expression are tightly correlated : <START:ana> CIITA mRNA <END> is highly expressed in <START:ana> B cells <END> , and is induced by <START:ggp> interferon gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) in <START:ana> macrophage and epithelial cell lines <END> . 
We first isolated two overlapping <START:ggp> cosmids <END> encoding <START:ggp> human CIITA <END> which , when co-transfected , are able to restore <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> expression in a <START:ana> B-lymphoblastoid cell line <END> ( <START:ana> B-LCL <END> ) defective for <START:ggp> CIITA <END> . 
Subsequently , a <START:ggp> 1.8 kilobase ( kb ) fragment <END> of the <START:ggp> CIITA promoter <END> was isolated and sequenced . 
A motif presenting a strong similarity to an initiator was detected , as well as <START:ggp> putative binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> , <START:ggp> LyF-1 <END> , <START:ggp> ets-1 <END> , <START:ggp> AP1 <END> , and <START:ggp> MZF1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , and two <START:ggp> GAS motifs <END> . 
When introduced in front of a <START:ggp> luciferase reporter gene <END> , this promoter is able to direct a high <START:ggp> luciferase <END> activity in a <START:ana> human B-LCL <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> luciferase <END> expression was not stimulated after <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> treatment when the construct was transfected in macrophage or in <START:ana> epithelial cell lines <END> . 
However , an induction of the <START:ggp> human CIITA gene <END> was observed in <START:ana> mouse macrophage and fibrosarcoma cell lines <END> , when the cells were transfected with a <START:ggp> cosmid <END> containing the <START:ggp> human CIITA gene <END> , but lacking the <START:ggp> 1.8 kb promoter <END> described above . 
Taken together , these data suggest the existence of an intragenic promoter driving an <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -inducible expression of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> . 
Phenotypic and functional studies of <START:ana> leukocytes <END> in human endometrium and endometriosis . 
The aetiology of endometriosis , a common and disabling disorder , is presently unknown , although immune dysfunction could allow ectopic endometrial fragments to survive outside the uterine cavity . 
These studies investigate the relationship between <START:ana> leukocyte populations <END> , <START:ggp> steroid hormone receptor <END> expression , proliferative activity , <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression and apoptosis in eutopic and ectopic endometrium from women with endometriosis or adenomyosis at different phases of the menstrual cycle . 
Significantly increased <START:ggp> oestrogen receptor <END> expression , <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression and numbers of CD8+ <START:ana> leukocytes <END> were found in ectopic compared with eutopic endometrium in endometriosis , and CD56+ endometrial granulated lymphocytes ( eGLs ) were significantly reduced in ectopic endometrium . 
<START:ana> Apoptotic cells <END> were rarely found in control and subject endometria . 
In contrast with endometriosis , adenomyotic lesions showed identical <START:ggp> steroid hormone receptor <END> expression , proliferative activity , <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression and leukocyte subpopulations to eutopic endometrium , indicating different aetiologies for these disorders . 
The unusual <START:ana> CD56+ CD16- eGLs <END> present in large numbers in late secretory phase eutopic endometrium were highly purified ( > 98 % ) by immunomagnetic separation . 
Except for a negligible cytotoxic activity of <START:ana> eGLs <END> from early proliferative samples , cytotoxic activity of <START:ana> eGLs <END> from non-pregnant endometrium during the menstrual cycle was comparable with those in peripheral blood , predominantly <START:ana> CD56+ CD16+ natural killer cells <END> . 
<START:ana> eGLs <END> from non-pregnant endometrium and early pregnancy showed a variable proliferative response to 5 and 100 U/ml <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> over 48-h and 120-h time courses . 
<START:ana> eGLs <END> are evidently functionally important in the eutopic endometrium . 
Their absence in endometriotic lesions together with increased <START:ana> CD+8 T-cell <END> numbers and increased <START:ggp> oestrogen receptor <END> and <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> expression may have significant effects on the development and progression of endometriosis . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> interleukin-1beta <END> transcription by Epstein-Barr virus involves a number of <START:ggp> latent proteins <END> via their interaction with <START:ggp> RBP <END> . 
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infects <START:ana> B cells <END> , resulting in the outgrowth of <START:ana> immortalised lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> LCLs <END> ) . 
Here , we demonstrate through the use of intracellular staining that <START:ggp> interleukin-1beta <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> ) is expressed in <START:ana> LCLs <END> and investigate the influence of the individual <START:ggp> latent proteins <END> on the expression of <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> . 
Using RT-PCR , <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> was shown to be up-regulated in <START:ana> EBV-transformed LCLs <END> as well as in <START:ana> group III Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) cell lines <END> , compared with <START:ana> group I BL cell lines <END> . 
The up-regulation of <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> message could be mediated by the <START:ggp> latent membrane protein-1 <END> , <START:ggp> EBV nuclear proteins 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 genes <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) demonstrated that the -300 region of the <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> promoter , which contains a <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) binding site <END> , contained a <START:ggp> functional RBP binding site <END> . 
Binding of RBP to this site could be inhibited by addition of <START:ggp> EBV nuclear proteins 3 and 6 <END> , suggesting that these proteins displace <START:ggp> RBP <END> from its <START:ggp> recognition sequence <END> , removing transcriptional repression and allowing gene transcription to occur . 
In <START:ana> group I BL cells <END> , containing low levels of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , only <START:ggp> RBP <END> binding was observed in EMSAs , whereas <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding could be demonstrated in <START:ana> EBV-transformed B cell lines <END> containing high levels of activated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
In addition , the expression of <START:ggp> latent membrane protein-1 <END> led to activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> that was capable of binding the <START:ggp> IL-1beta promoter <END> . 
The study demonstrates that EBV can up-regulate <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> expression , possibly by using <START:ggp> RBP <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , or both .

<START:ggp> CD27 <END> /CD70 interaction augments <START:ggp> IgE <END> secretion by promoting the differentiation of <START:ana> memory B cells <END> into <START:ana> plasma cells <END> . 
The induction of <START:ggp> IgE <END> switching in <START:ana> B cells <END> requires several signals given by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and cell contact-delivered signals . 
Here , we investigated the role of <START:ggp> CD27 <END> /CD70 interaction in B cell <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis . 
The addition of CD27 ligand ( CD70 ) transfectants to <START:ana> B cell cultures <END> increased the <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis synergistically in the presence of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> plus <START:ggp> anti-CD40 mAb <END> ( <START:ggp> anti-CD40 <END> ) . 
The effect of <START:ana> CD70 transfectants <END> was dose dependent and was completely blocked by <START:ggp> anti-CD70 mAb . <END> 
<START:ana> CD27+ B cells <END> had the ability to produce <START:ggp> IgE <END> , which was increased by contact with CD70 transfectants , whereas CD27- B cells did not produce <START:ggp> IgE <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD27 <END> /CD70 interaction enhanced <START:ana> B cell <END> proliferation in the presence of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> plus <START:ggp> anti-CD40 <END> . 
The augmentation of B cell proliferation by CD70 transfectants was apparent in <START:ana> CD27+ B cells <END> , but was mild in <START:ana> CD27- B cells <END> . 
The helper activity for <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis by the <START:ggp> CD27 <END> /CD70 interaction did not contribute to the enhancement of <START:ana> germline epsilon transcripts <END> . 
Flow cytometric and morphological analyses demonstrated that the addition of CD70 transfectants to <START:ana> B cell cultures <END> remarkably promoted differentiation into <START:ana> plasma cells <END> in the presence of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> CD40 <END> signaling . 
Finally , <START:ggp> CD27 <END> cross-linking resulted in the up-regulation of <START:ggp> positive regulatory domain I-binding factor-1 <END> . 
Taken together , our findings indicate that signaling via <START:ggp> CD27 <END> on <START:ana> B cells <END> induces <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis , in cooperation with <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> CD40 <END> signaling , by promoting the generation of <START:ana> plasma cells <END> through up-regulation of <START:ggp> positive regulatory domain I-binding factor-1 <END> . 
Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 transcription : role of the 5'-untranslated leader region ( review ) . 
Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) transcription is dependent on the interaction of <START:ggp> host-cell transcription factors <END> with <START:ggp> cis-regulatory DNA elements <END> within the <START:ggp> viral long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) . 
Much attention has focused on the series of sequence elements upstream of the <START:ggp> transcriptional initiation site <END> in the <START:ggp> U3 region <END> of the <START:ggp> LTR <END> including the <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> <START:ggp> binding sites <END> . 
Recent studies , however , demonstrate that the transcribed <START:ggp> 5'-untranslated leader region <END> ( <START:ggp> 5'-UTR <END> ) also contains important <START:ggp> transcriptional elements <END> . 
These <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> situated downstream of transcription interact with constitutive and inducible <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , mediate transmission of cellular activation signals , and are important for efficient HIV-1 transcription and replication . 
The <START:ggp> 5'-UTR <END> contains <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> AP-1 , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , <START:ggp> IRF <END> , and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> . 
Mutations in these <START:ggp> binding sites <END> can interfere with the viral response to cell activation signals , decrease <START:ggp> LTR <END> transcription , and inhibit viral replication . 
The <START:ggp> 5'-UTR <END> also interacts with a specific <START:ggp> nucleosome <END> that is rapidly displaced during transcriptional activation of the latent provirus . 
We propose that the <START:ggp> inducible transcription factor binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> 5'-UTR <END> comprise a <START:ggp> downstream enhancer domain <END> that can function independent of , or in concert with , the <START:ggp> LTR promoter <END> to rapidly increase latent proviral transcription in response to cell activation signals . 
In this review , we describe the <START:ggp> host-cell transcription factors <END> that interact with the <START:ggp> 5'-UTR <END> and discuss their role in the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 gene expression . 
Regulation of PAK activation and the T cell cytoskeleton by the <START:ggp> linker protein <END> <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> . 
Tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> linker proteins <END> enables the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) -associated protein tyrosine kinases <END> to phosphorylate and regulate <START:ggp> effector molecules <END> that generate <START:ggp> second messengers <END> . 
We demonstrate here that the <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> linker protein interacts with both <START:ggp> nck <END> , an <START:ggp> adaptor protein <END> , and <START:ggp> Vav <END> , a <START:ggp> guanine nucleotide exchange factor <END> for <START:ggp> Rho-family GTPases <END> . 
The assembly of this <START:ggp> tri-molecular complex <END> permits the activated <START:ggp> Rho-family GTPases <END> to regulate target effectors that interact through <START:ggp> nck <END> . 
In turn , assembly of this complex mediates the enzymatic activation of the <START:ggp> p21-activated protein kinase 1 <END> and facilitates <START:ggp> actin <END> polymerization . 
Hence , phosphorylation of <START:ggp> linker proteins <END> not only bridges the <START:ggp> TCR-associated PTK <END> , <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> , with downstream effector proteins , but also provides a scaffold to integrate distinct <START:ggp> signaling complexes <END> to regulate <START:ana> T cell <END> function . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-12 <END> expression in <START:ana> B cells <END> by transformation with Epstein-Barr virus . 
Although <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -12 <END> was originally purified from an <START:ana> Epstein-Barr ( EBV ) -transformed B cell line <END> and the high correlation of EBV infection and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> expression has been suggested , no study has reported whether EBV infection is directly linked to <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> expression . 
To address this issue , we have investigated <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> expression in <START:ana> B cells <END> during in vitro transformation with EBV . 
<START:ana> Human peripheral B cells <END> became capable of constitutively producing p40 by in vitro transformation with EBV , coincident with the expression of <START:ggp> latent membrane protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> ) of EBV . 
These <START:ana> B cells <END> expressed <START:ana> p40 and p35 mRNA <END> , and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) stimulation strongly enhanced p40 and p70 production . 
Furthermore , transfection with <START:ggp> LMP1 expression vector <END> into a <START:ana> human B lymphoma cell line <END> , <START:ana> Daudi <END> , led to <START:ggp> p40 <END> production with <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB <END> activation . 
These results suggest that transformation of <START:ana> primary B cells <END> with EBV induces <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> expression potentially through <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> expression .

The <START:ggp> human gene <END> encoding the <START:ggp> lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> OLR1 <END> ) is a novel member of the <START:ggp> natural killer gene complex <END> with a unique expression profile . 
<START:ggp> LOX-1 <END> is an <START:ggp> endothelial receptor <END> for <START:ggp> oxidized low-density lipoprotein <END> that plays essential roles in atherogenesis . 
<START:ggp> LOX-1 <END> has the highest homology with <START:ggp> C-type lectin receptors <END> expressed on <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> . 
In the present study , we cloned and characterized the <START:ggp> human LOX-1 gene <END> ( <START:ggp> HGMW-approved symbol OLR1 <END> ) . 
The gene structure of <START:ggp> LOX-1 <END> resembles that of the <START:ggp> natural killer cell receptors <END> . 
Fluorescence in situ hybridization and analyses of a yeast artificial chromosome contig revealed that the <START:ggp> human LOX-1 gene <END> is located in the <START:ggp> natural killer gene complex <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 12p12-p13 <END> , where the genes of the <START:ggp> natural killer cell receptors <END> cluster . 
In contrast , the expression pattern of <START:ggp> LOX-1 <END> is different from that of the <START:ggp> natural killer cell receptors <END> ; <START:ggp> LOX-1 <END> is expressed in vascular-rich organs , but not in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
A <START:ggp> 1753-bp fragment <END> of the <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking region <END> of the <START:ggp> LOX-1 gene <END> had a functional promoter activity . 
This region contains <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for several <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , including the <START:ggp> STAT family <END> and <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> , and the expression of <START:ggp> LOX-1 <END> was upregulated by several <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
These results demonstrate that the <START:ggp> human LOX-1 gene <END> is a new member of the <START:ggp> natural killer gene complex <END> with a unique expression profile .

Transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> beta-casein gene <END> by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> : cross-talk between <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> and other <START:ggp> signaling molecules <END> . 
The <START:ggp> beta-casein promoter <END> has been widely used to monitor the activation of <START:ggp> STAT ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) 5 <END> since <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> was originally found as a mediator of PRL-inducible <START:ggp> beta-casein <END> expression . 
However , not only is expression of the <START:ggp> beta-casein gene <END> regulated by <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> but it is also affected by other molecules such as glucocorticoid and <START:ggp> Ras <END> . 
In this report , we describe the transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> beta-casein gene <END> by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
We have found that the <START:ggp> beta-casein gene <END> is expressed in a <START:ana> cytotoxic T cell line <END> , <START:ana> CTLL-2 <END> , in response to <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) , which activates <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> . 
While <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> does not activate <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> , it induces expression of <START:ggp> STAT5-regulated genes <END> in <START:ana> CTLL-2 <END> , i.e . <START:ggp> beta-casein <END> , a <START:ggp> cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein <END> ( <START:ggp> CIS <END> ) , and <START:ggp> oncostatin M <END> ( <START:ggp> OSM <END> ) , suggesting that STAT6 activated by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> substitutes for the function of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced <START:ggp> beta-casein <END> expression was enhanced by dexamethasone , and this synergistic effect of Dexamethasone requires the sequence between <START:ggp> -155 and -193 <END> in the <START:ggp> beta-casein promoter <END> . 
Coincidentally , a deletion of this region enhanced the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced expression of <START:ggp> beta-casein <END> . 
Expression of an active form of <START:ggp> Ras <END> , <START:ggp> Ras ( G12V ) <END> , suppressed the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced <START:ggp> beta-casein <END> and <START:ggp> OSM <END> gene expression , and the negative effect of <START:ggp> Ras <END> is mediated by the region between <START:ggp> -105 and -193 <END> in the <START:ggp> beta-casein promoter <END> . 
In apparent contradiction , expression of a dominant negative form of <START:ggp> Ras <END> , <START:ggp> RasN17 <END> , also inhibited <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced activation of the promoter containing the minimal <START:ggp> beta-casein STAT5 element <END> as well as the promoters of <START:ggp> CIS <END> and <START:ggp> OSM <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> Ras ( G12V ) <END> complemented signaling by an <START:ggp> erythropoietin receptor mutant <END> defective in <START:ggp> Ras <END> activation and augmented the activation of the <START:ggp> beta-casein promoter <END> by the <START:ggp> mutant erythropoietin receptor <END> signaling , suggesting a possible role of <START:ggp> Ras <END> in <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> -mediated gene expression . 
These results collectively reveal a complex interaction of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> with other signaling pathways and illustrate that regulation of gene expression requires integration of opposing signals 
<START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> represses <START:ggp> gp91phox gene <END> expression in <START:ana> eosinophil-committed HL-60-C15 cells <END> . 
To study the regulatory mechanism of <START:ggp> gp91phox gene <END> expression in eosinophils , we transiently transfected <START:ana> eosinophil-committed HL-60-C15 cells <END> with <START:ggp> gp91phox promoter constructs <END> , and identified a <START:ggp> negative element <END> from bp <START:ggp> -267 to -246 <END> of the <START:ggp> gp91phox gene <END> , the deletion of which caused an 83 % increase in promoter activity . 
Electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrated <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> binds to the <START:ggp> GATA consensus site <END> from bp <START:ggp> -256 to -250 . <END> 
An 81 % increment in promoter activity was obtained when a mutation was introduced in the <START:ggp> GATA-3 binding site <END> of the <START:ggp> bp -267 to +12 construct <END> , which is comparable to that of the <START:ggp> bp -245 to +12 construct <END> . 
We therefore conclude that <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> specifically binding to the <START:ggp> GATA site <END> negatively regulates the expression of the gene in <START:ana> HL-60-C15 cells <END> . 
Uncoupling activation-dependent <START:ggp> HS1 <END> phosphorylation from <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> transcriptional activation in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> : differential signaling through <START:ggp> CD3 <END> and the costimulatory receptors <START:ggp> CD2 <END> and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD3 <END> , <START:ggp> CD2 <END> , and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> are functionally distinct receptors on <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Engagement of any of these receptors induces the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a shared group of <START:ggp> intracellular signaling proteins <END> , including <START:ggp> Vav <END> , <START:ggp> Cbl <END> , <START:ggp> p85 phosphoinositide 3-kinase <END> , and the <START:ggp> Src family kinases <END> <START:ggp> Lck <END> and <START:ggp> Fyn <END> . 
Ligation of <START:ggp> CD3 <END> also induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> HS1 <END> , a <START:ggp> 75-kDa hematopoietic cell-specific intracellular signaling protein <END> of unknown function . 
We have examined changes in <START:ggp> HS1 <END> phosphorylation after differential stimulation of <START:ggp> CD3 <END> , <START:ggp> CD2 <END> , and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> to elucidate its role in <START:ana> T cells <END> and to further delineate the signaling pathways recruited by these receptors . 
Unlike ligation of <START:ggp> CD3 <END> , stimulation with <START:ggp> anti-CD28 mAb <END> or <START:ana> CHO cells <END> expressing the <START:ggp> CD28 ligands <END> <START:ggp> CD80 <END> or <START:ggp> CD86 <END> did not lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> HS1 <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
Additionally , no tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> HS1 <END> was induced by <START:ana> mitogenic pairs <END> of <START:ggp> anti-CD2 mAbs <END> capable of activating the <START:ggp> transcription factor NFAT <END> ( <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ) . 
Costimulation through <START:ggp> CD28 <END> and/or <START:ggp> CD2 <END> did not modulate the <START:ggp> CD3 <END> -dependent phosphorylation of <START:ggp> HS1 <END> . 
In vivo studies indicated that <START:ggp> CD3 <END> -induced <START:ggp> HSI <END> phosphorylation was dependent upon both the <START:ggp> Src family tyrosine kinase <END> <START:ggp> Lck <END> and the <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> CD45 <END> , did not require <START:ggp> MEK1 <END> kinase activity , and was regulated by <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> activation . 
Thus , although <START:ggp> CD3 <END> , <START:ggp> CD28 <END> , and CD2 activate many of the same <START:ggp> signaling molecules <END> , they differed in their capacity to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> HSI <END> . 
Furthermore , activation-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> HS1 <END> was not required for <START:ggp> NFAT <END> transcriptional activation . 
c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression in <START:ana> activated cord and adult lymphocytes <END> : an analysis by Northern hybridization . 
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : To further analyze the neonatal immune response to an antigenic challenge such as blood transfusion , c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression were analyzed in twelve in-vitro-stimulated normal cord blood and ten <START:ana> in-vitro-stimulated normal adult peripheral blood lymphocyte samples <END> . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS : <START:ana> Lymphocyte samples <END> were stimulated by either the <START:ggp> mitogen phytohemagglutinin <END> ( <START:ggp> PHA <END> ) or the monoclonal antibody <START:ggp> alphaCD3 <END> . 
Proliferation rate and Northern blot hybridization were employed . 
RESULTS : Cord lymphocytes revealed a greater proliferation rate with <START:ggp> PHA <END> and <START:ggp> alphaCD3 <END> than adult lymphocytes ( p = 0.0081 and 0.0023 , respectively ) . 
In addition , Northern blot analysis of cord and adult samples revealed similar maximal increases in <START:ana> c-fos <END> ( 99+/-15 and 126+/-11 % , p = 0.0126 ) and <START:ana> c-jun ( 123+/-9 and 185+/-38 % , p = 0.0291 ) mRNA <END> expression , respectively , as early as 15 min post- <START:ggp> alphaCD3 <END> stimulation . 
Adult lymphocytes showed an equivalent increase in mRNA expression of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> ( 140+/-25 and 155+/-31 % ) at 30 min post- <START:ggp> PHA <END> stimulation , while <START:ana> cord lymphocyte <END> maximum c-fos and c-jun expression ( 82+/-6 and 142+/-12 % ) occurred at 15 min post- <START:ggp> PHA <END> stimulation ( <START:ggp> c-fos <END> , p = 0.0354 ; <START:ggp> c-jun <END> , p = 0.0112 ) . 
CONCLUSION : Although <START:ana> cord lymphocyte <END> proliferation rates were significantly greater than those of adult lymphocytes following stimulation , lymphocyte activation , as analyzed by c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression , appears similar in both cord and adult samples . 
We conclude that cord lymphocyte activation exhibits an adult-type profile . 
<START:ggp> Fcgamma receptor <END> -mediated <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> activation in <START:ana> monocytes <END> is independent of <START:ggp> Ras <END> . 
Receptors for the <START:ggp> Fc portion <END> of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin molecules <END> ( <START:ggp> FcR <END> ) present on leukocyte cell membranes mediate a large number of cellular responses that are very important in host defense , including phagocytosis , cell cytotoxicity , production and secretion of <START:ggp> inflammatory mediators <END> , and modulation of the immune response . 
Cross-linking of <START:ggp> FcR <END> with <START:ggp> immune complexes <END> leads , first to activation of <START:ggp> protein-tyrosine kinases <END> . 
The molecular events that follow and that transduce signals from these receptors to the nucleus are still poorly defined . 
We have investigated the signal transduction pathway from <START:ggp> Fc receptors <END> that leads to gene activation and production of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Cross-linking of <START:ggp> FcR <END> , on the <START:ana> THP-1 monocytic cell line <END> , by <START:ggp> immune complexes <END> resulted in both activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin 1 <END> production . 
These responses were completely blocked by <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> inhibitors . 
In contrast , expression of <START:ggp> dominant negative mutants <END> of <START:ggp> Ras <END> and <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> , in these cells , did not have any effect on <START:ggp> FcR <END> -mediated <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> activation , suggesting that the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> MAPK <END> ) signaling pathway was not used by these receptors . 
However , <START:ggp> MAPK <END> activation was easily detected by in vitro kinase assays , after <START:ggp> FcR <END> cross-linking with <START:ggp> immune complexes <END> . 
Using the specific <START:ggp> MAPK <END> /extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase ( MAPK kinase ) inhibitor PD98059 , we found that <START:ggp> MAPK <END> activation is necessary for <START:ggp> FcR <END> -dependent activation of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
These results strongly suggest that the signaling pathway from <START:ggp> Fc receptors <END> leading to expression of different genes important to leukocyte biology , initiates with <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> and requires <START:ggp> MAPK <END> activation ; but in contrast to other <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase receptors <END> , <START:ggp> FcR <END> -mediated <START:ggp> MAPK <END> activation does not involve <START:ggp> Ras <END> and <START:ggp> Raf <END> . 
<START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> mutations in <START:ana> normal germinal center B cells <END> : evidence of somatic hypermutation acting outside <START:ggp> Ig loci <END> . 
The molecular mechanism involved in the process of antigen-driven somatic hypermutation of <START:ggp> Ig genes <END> is unknown , but it is commonly believed that this mechanism is restricted to the <START:ggp> Ig loci <END> . 
<START:ana> B cell lymphomas <END> commonly display multiple somatic mutations clustering in the <START:ggp> 5'-regulatory region <END> of <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> , a <START:ggp> proto-oncogene <END> encoding for a <START:ggp> POZ/Zinc finger transcriptional repressor <END> expressed in <START:ana> germinal center ( GC ) B cells <END> and required for GC formation . 
To determine whether <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> mutations represent a tumor-associated phenomenon or reflect a physiologic mechanism , we screened single <START:ana> human tonsillar GC B cells <END> for mutations occurring in the <START:ggp> BCL-6 5'-noncoding region <END> and in the <START:ggp> Ig variable heavy chain sequences <END> . 
Thirty percent of <START:ana> GC B cells <END> , but not <START:ana> naive B cells <END> , displayed mutations in the <START:ggp> 742 bp region <END> analyzed within the first intron of <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> ( overall frequency : 5 x 10 ( -4 ) /bp ) . 
Accordingly , an expanded survey in lymphoid malignancies showed that <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> mutations are restricted to B cell tumors displaying GC or post-GC phenotype and carrying <START:ggp> mutated Ig variable heavy chain sequences <END> . 
These results indicate that the somatic hypermutation mechanism active in <START:ana> GC B cells <END> physiologically targets <START:ggp> non-Ig sequences <END> . 
The <START:ggp> AD1 <END> and <START:ggp> AD2 <END> transactivation domains of <START:ggp> E2A <END> are essential for the antiapoptotic activity of the <START:ggp> chimeric oncoprotein <END> <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> . 
The <START:ggp> chimeric oncoprotein <END> <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> , generated by the <START:ggp> t ( 17 ; 19 ) chromosomal translocation <END> in pro-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia , incorporates the <START:ggp> transactivation domains <END> of <START:ggp> E2A <END> and the <START:ggp> basic leucine zipper ( bZIP ) DNA-binding and protein dimerization domain <END> of <START:ggp> HLF <END> ( <START:ggp> hepatic leukemic factor <END> ) . 
The ability of <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> to prolong the survival of <START:ana> interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) -dependent murine pro-B cells <END> after <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> withdrawal suggests that it disrupts signaling pathways normally responsible for cell suicide , allowing the cells to accumulate as <START:ana> transformed lymphoblasts <END> . 
To determine the structural motifs that contribute to this antiapoptotic effect , we constructed a panel of <START:ggp> E2A-HLF mutants <END> and programmed their expression in <START:ana> IL-3-dependent murine pro-B cells <END> ( <START:ana> FL5.12 line <END> ) , using a zinc-inducible vector . 
Neither the <START:ggp> E12 <END> nor the <START:ggp> E47 <END> product of the <START:ggp> E2A gene <END> nor the <START:ggp> wild-type HLF protein <END> was able to protect the cells from apoptosis induced by <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> deprivation . 
Surprisingly , different combinations of disabling mutations within the <START:ggp> HLF bZIP domain <END> had little effect on the antiapoptotic property of the <START:ggp> chimeric protein <END> , so long as the amino-terminal portion of <START:ggp> E2A <END> remained intact . 
In the context of a <START:ggp> bZIP domain <END> defective in DNA binding , mutants retaining either of the two <START:ggp> transactivation domains <END> of <START:ggp> E2A <END> were able to extend cell survival after <START:ggp> growth factor <END> deprivation . 
Thus , the block of apoptosis imposed by <START:ggp> E2A-HLF <END> in <START:ana> pro-B lymphocytes <END> depends critically on the <START:ggp> transactivating regions <END> of <START:ggp> E2A <END> . 
Since neither DNA binding nor protein dimerization through the <START:ggp> bZIP domain <END> of <START:ggp> HLF <END> is required for this effect , we propose mechanisms whereby protein-protein interactions with the amino-terminal region of <START:ggp> E2A <END> allow the <START:ggp> chimera <END> to act as a transcriptional cofactor to alter the expression of genes regulating the apoptotic machinery in <START:ana> pro-B cells <END> . 
Induction of <START:ggp> Mn SOD <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> without <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokine <END> production by a <START:ggp> mutant endotoxin <END> . 
<START:ggp> Endotoxin <END> selectively induces <START:ggp> monocyte Mn superoxide dismutase <END> ( <START:ggp> SOD <END> ) without affecting levels of Cu , <START:ggp> Zn SOD <END> , <START:ggp> catalase <END> , or <START:ggp> glutathione peroxidase <END> . 
However , little is known about the structure-activity relationship and the mechanism by which endotoxin induces <START:ggp> Mn SOD <END> . 
In this study we demonstrated that a mutant Escherichia coli endotoxin lacking myristoyl fatty acid at the 3 ' R-3-hydroxymyristate position of the lipid A moiety retained its full capacity to coagulate Limulus amoebocyte lysate compared with the wild-type E. coli endotoxin and markedly stimulated the activation of <START:ggp> human monocyte nuclear factor-kappaB <END> and the induction of <START:ana> Mn SOD mRNA <END> and enzyme activity . 
However , in contrast to the wild-type endotoxin , it failed to induce significant production of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha <END> by <START:ana> monocytes <END> and did not induce the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> . 
These results suggest that 1 ) lipid A myristoyl fatty acid , although it is important for the induction of <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokine <END> production by <START:ana> human monocytes <END> , is not necessary for the induction of <START:ggp> Mn SOD <END> , 2 ) <START:ggp> endotoxin <END> -mediated induction of <START:ggp> Mn SOD <END> and inflammatory <START:ggp> cytokines <END> are regulated , at least in part , through different signal transduction pathways , and 3 ) failure of the <START:ggp> mutant endotoxin <END> to induce <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> production is , at least in part , due to its inability to activate <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> . 
Regulation of the <START:ggp> vitellogenin gene B1 promoter <END> after transfer into <START:ana> hepatocytes <END> in primary cultures . 
The estrogen-dependent and tissue-specific regulation of the Xenopus laevis <START:ggp> vitellogenin gene B1 promoter <END> has been studied by lipid-mediated DNA transfer into <START:ana> Xenopus hepatocytes <END> in primary culture . 
Hepatocytes achieve an efficient hormonal control of this promoter through a functional interaction between the <START:ggp> estrogen responsive elements <END> and a <START:ggp> promoter proximal region <END> upstream of the <START:ggp> TATA box <END> , which is characterized by a high density of binding sites for the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> CTF/NF-1 <END> , <START:ggp> C/EBP <END> and <START:ggp> HNF3 <END> . 
DNA accessibility to <START:ggp> restriction enzymes <END> within the chromosomal copy of the <START:ggp> vitellogenin gene B1 promoter <END> shows that the <START:ggp> estrogen responsive unit <END> and the <START:ggp> promoter proximal region <END> are sensitive to digestion in uninduced and <START:ana> estrogen-induced hepatocytes <END> but not in erythrocyte nuclei . 
Together , these findings support the notion that <START:ggp> chromatin <END> configuration as well as the interplay of <START:ggp> promoter elements <END> mediate proper hormone-dependent and tissue-specific expression of the <START:ggp> B1 vitellogenin gene <END> . 
Characterization of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> differential induction of <START:ggp> STAT complexes <END> in <START:ana> primary human T and NK cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Cytokines <END> , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> are key regulators of human peripheral blood T and NK cell activation and differentiation but the precise mechanisms that give rise to their differential activities within these cells are not clear . 
Recent studies reveal that a family of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription <END> ( <START:ggp> STATs <END> ) directly mediate many <START:ggp> cytokine <END> signals . 
We analyzed the activation of <START:ggp> STATs <END> in <START:ana> primary human T and NK cells <END> by a variety of specific <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
We demonstrate that <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> induces <START:ggp> STAT4 <END> only in freshly isolated <START:ana> primary NK cells <END> , but not in <START:ana> primary T cells <END> , consistent with the lack of the <START:ggp> IL-12 receptor <END> in <START:ana> resting T cells <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> induces different <START:ggp> C epsilon GAS DNA-protein binding complexes <END> in both T and <START:ana> NK cells <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> costimulation with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> does not alter their own preferential <START:ggp> GAS <END> -like DNA binding patterns when <START:ggp> C epsilon- , Fc gamma RI- , and SIE GAS motif <END> containing oligonucleotide probes are compared , suggesting that induction of <START:ggp> GAS-like DNA-protein binding complexes <END> by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> is highly selective and represents one important factor in determining specific gene activation . 
In addition , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> synergistically induce homo- and heterodimerized <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> and <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> in both <START:ana> NK and T cells <END> , consistent with their reported synergism in modulating <START:ggp> perforin gene <END> expression . 
We further demonstrated that <START:ggp> IL-2 , -7 , and -15 <END> induce <START:ggp> multiple STAT proteins <END> , including <START:ggp> STAT5a <END> , <START:ggp> STAT5b <END> , <START:ggp> STAT1 alpha <END> , <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> , and another unidentified <START:ggp> Fc gamma RI GAS DNA-binding protein <END> . 
Finally , we observed that activated <START:ggp> STAT5a <END> and <START:ggp> STAT5b <END> proteins form distinct Fc gamma RI GAS binding patterns in <START:ana> T and NK cells <END> , suggesting that they might have different roles in gene regulation . 
Our data provide evidence that the differential responses in gene expression and cell activation seen in primary <START:ana> NK and T cells <END> on direct stimulation with different <START:ggp> cytokines <END> may be a direct result of distinct activation of <START:ggp> STAT transcription factors <END> . 
A <START:ggp> regulatory element <END> in the <START:ggp> CD95 ( APO-1/Fas ) ligand promoter <END> is essential for responsiveness to <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated activation . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> CD95 ( APO-1/Fas ) ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> CD95L <END> ) in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> is a major cause of T cell activation-induced apoptosis . 
To study the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional control of <START:ggp> CD95L <END> expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> , we investigated the <START:ggp> human CD95L promoter <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
Deletion studies revealed that the <START:ggp> CD95L proximal promoter sequence <END> from <START:ggp> -220 <END> to the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> is essential for T cell stimulation-induced expression of <START:ggp> CD95L <END> . 
In this study , we discovered a novel <START:ggp> regulatory element <END> located at <START:ggp> -120 <END> of the <START:ggp> CD95L promoter <END> which contains <START:ggp> DNA binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> SP-1 <END> and a yet unknown <START:ggp> inducible factor <END> . 
Mutation analysis demonstrated that binding of the inducible factor to the <START:ggp> -120 region <END> is crucial for the biological function of the <START:ggp> CD95L promoter <END> upon T cell stimulation . 
The DNA sequence at <START:ggp> -120 <END> also contains two <START:ggp> DNA motifs <END> homologous to the binding site for <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-AT <END> does not directly bind to this element . 
However , cotransfection studies with an <START:ggp> NF-AT expression vector <END> showed that <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> may confer a strong inducible activity to the <START:ggp> CD95L promoter <END> at this <START:ggp> regulatory region <END> . 
Our data also show that the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A down-regulates <START:ggp> CD95L <END> transcription by inhibiting the function of this positive <START:ggp> regulatory element <END> 
A nongenomic mechanism for progesterone-mediated immunosuppression : inhibition of <START:ggp> K+ channels <END> , Ca2+ signaling , and gene expression in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
The mechanism by which progesterone causes localized suppression of the immune response during pregnancy has remained elusive . 
Using <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> T cell lines <END> , we show that progesterone , at concentrations found in the placenta , rapidly and reversibly blocks <START:ggp> voltage-gated and calcium-activated K+ channels <END> ( <START:ggp> KV <END> and <START:ggp> KCa <END> , respectively ) , resulting in depolarization of the membrane potential . 
As a result , Ca2+ signaling and <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) -driven gene expression are inhibited . 
Progesterone acts distally to the initial steps of <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) -mediated signal transduction , since it blocks sustained Ca2+ signals after thapsigargin stimulation , as well as oscillatory Ca2+ signals , but not the Ca2+ transient after <START:ggp> TCR <END> stimulation . 
K+ channel blockade by progesterone is specific ; other steroid hormones had little or no effect , although the progesterone antagonist RU 486 also blocked <START:ggp> KV <END> and <START:ggp> KCa <END> channels . 
Progesterone effectively blocked a broad spectrum of <START:ggp> K+ channels <END> , reducing both <START:ggp> Kv1.3 <END> and <START:ggp> charybdotoxin-resistant components <END> of <START:ggp> KV <END> current and <START:ggp> KCa <END> current in <START:ana> T cells <END> , as well as blocking several <START:ggp> cloned KV channels <END> expressed in <START:ana> cell lines <END> . 
Progesterone had little or no effect on a <START:ggp> cloned voltage-gated Na+ channel <END> , an inward rectifier <START:ggp> K+ channel <END> , or on <START:ggp> lymphocyte Ca2+ and Cl- channels <END> . 
We propose that direct inhibition of <START:ggp> K+ channels <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> by progesterone contributes to progesterone-induced immunosuppression . 
A mouse carrying genetic defect in the choice between <START:ana> T and B lymphocytes <END> . 
Transgenic mice with <START:ggp> human CD3epsilon gene <END> have been shown to exhibit early arrest of T cell development in the thymus . 
The present study shows that , instead of <START:ana> T cells <END> , <START:ana> B cells <END> are generated in the thymus of a line , tg epsilon26 , of the human CD3epsilon transgenic mice . 
The accumulation of <START:ana> mature B cells <END> in the thymus was found only in tg epsilon26 mice , not in other <START:ana> human CD3epsilon transgenic mouse lines <END> or other T cell-deficient mice , including CD3-epsilon knockout mice and TCR-beta/TCR-delta double knockout mice . 
Hanging drop-mediated transfer into 2-deoxyguanosine-treated thymus lobes showed that <START:ana> lymphoid progenitor cells <END> rather than thymus stromal cells were responsible for abnormal B cell development in <START:ggp> tg epsilon26 <END> thymus , and that <START:ana> tg epsilon26 fetal liver cells <END> were destined to become <START:ana> B cells <END> in normal thymus even in the presence of <START:ana> normal progenitor cells <END> undergoing T cell development . 
These results indicate that <START:ana> lymphoid progenitor cells <END> in <START:ggp> tg epsilon26 <END> mice are genetically defective in thymic choice between <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> B cells <END> , generating <START:ana> B cells <END> even in normal thymus environment . 
Interestingly , <START:ana> tg epsilon26 thymocytes <END> expressed <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> and <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> , but not <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> PEBP-2alpha <END> , among <START:ggp> T cell-specific transcription factors <END> that are involved in early T cell development , indicating that <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> and <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> expressed during thymocyte development do not necessarily determine the cell fate into <START:ana> T cell lineage <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> tg epsilon26 <END> mice provide a novel mouse model in that lineage choice between <START:ana> T and B lymphocytes <END> is genetically defective . 
Downstream activation of a <START:ggp> TATA-less promoter <END> by <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , Bob1 , and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> directs expression of the <START:ggp> homing receptor BLR1 <END> to <START:ana> mature B cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> chemokine receptor <END> , <START:ggp> BLR1 <END> , is a major regulator of the microenvironmental homing of <START:ana> B cells <END> in lymphoid organs . 
In vitro studies identify three essential elements of the <START:ggp> TATA-less blr1 core promoter <END> that confer cell type- and differentiation-specific expression in the <START:ana> B cells <END> of both humans and mice , a <START:ggp> functional promoter region <END> ( -36 with respect to the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> ) , a <START:ggp> NF-kappaB motif <END> ( +44 ) , and a <START:ggp> noncanonical octamer motif <END> ( +157 ) . 
The importance of these sites was confirmed by in vivo studies in gene-targeted mice deficient of either <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , <START:ggp> Bob1 <END> , or both <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> subunits p50 and p52 . 
In all of these animals , the expression of <START:ggp> BLR1 <END> was reduced or absent . 
In mice deficient only of <START:ggp> p52/NF-kappaB <END> , <START:ggp> BLR1 <END> expression was unaffected . 
Thus our data demonstrate that <START:ggp> BLR1 <END> is a target gene for <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , <START:ggp> Bob1 <END> , and members of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel family <END> and provides a link to the impaired B cell functions in mice deficient for these factors . 
<START:ggp> CD4 promoter <END> transactivation by human herpesvirus 6 . 
The observation that human herpesvirus 6 ( HHV-6 ) can induce <START:ggp> CD4 gene <END> transcription and expression in <START:ana> CD4 ( - ) cells <END> was reported several years ago ( P.Lusso , A.De Maria , M.Malnati , F.Lori , S.E.DeRocco , M. Baseler , and R.C.Gallo , Nature 349 : 533-535 , 1991 ) and subsequently confirmed ( P.Lusso , M.S.Malnati , A.Garzino-Demo , R.W.Crowley , E. O.Long , and R.C.Gallo , Nature 362 : 458-462 , 1993 ; G.Furlini , M. Vignoli , E.Ramazzotti , M.C.Re , G.Visani , and M.LaPlaca , Blood 87 : 4737-4745 , 1996 ) . 
Our objective was to identify the mechanisms underlying such phenomena . 
Using <START:ggp> reporter gene constructs <END> driven by the <START:ggp> CD4 promoter <END> , we report that HHV-6 can efficiently transactivate such <START:ggp> genetic elements <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> CD4 promoter <END> occurs in the presence of the viral DNA polymerase inhibitor phosphonoformic acid , which limits expression to the <START:ggp> immediate-early and early classes of viral genes <END> . 
Using deletion mutants and specific <START:ggp> CD4 promoter mutants <END> , we identified an <START:ggp> ATF/CRE binding site <END> located at <START:ggp> nucleotides -67 to -60 upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> CD4 gene transcription start site <END> that is important for HHV-6 transactivation . 
The <START:ggp> ATF/CRE site <END> is also essential for <START:ggp> CD4 promoter <END> activation by forskolin , an activator of adenylate cyclase . 
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and specific antibodies , we showed that <START:ggp> CREB-1 <END> binds specifically to the <START:ggp> -79 to -52 region <END> of the <START:ggp> CD4 promoter <END> . 
Last , we have identified two <START:ggp> open reading frames <END> ( <START:ggp> ORFs <END> ) of HHV-6 , <START:ggp> U86 <END> and <START:ggp> U89 <END> from the immediate-early locus A , that can transactivate the <START:ggp> CD4 promoter <END> in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
However , transactivation of the <START:ggp> CD4 promoter <END> by <START:ggp> ORFs <END> <START:ggp> U86 <END> and <START:ggp> U89 <END> is independent of the <START:ggp> CRE element <END> , suggesting that additional <START:ggp> HHV-6 ORFs <END> are likely to contribute to <START:ggp> CD4 gene <END> activation . 
Taken together , our results will help to understand the complex interactions occurring between HHV-6 and the <START:ggp> CD4 promoter <END> and provide additional information regarding the class of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> involved in the control of <START:ggp> CD4 gene <END> expression . 
The <START:ggp> PEBP2betaMYH11 <END> fusion created by <START:ggp> Inv ( 16 ) ( p13 ; q22 ) <END> in myeloid leukemia impairs neutrophil maturation and contributes to granulocytic dysplasia . 
Chromosomal translocations involving the genes encoding the <START:ggp> alpha and beta subunits <END> of the <START:ggp> Pebp2/Cbf transcription factor <END> have been associated with human acute myeloid leukemia and the preleukemic condition , myelodysplasia . 
<START:ggp> Inv ( 16 ) ( p13 ; q22 ) <END> fuses the gene encoding the <START:ggp> beta subunit <END> of <START:ggp> Pebp2 <END> to the <START:ggp> MYH11 gene <END> encoding a <START:ggp> smooth muscle myosin heavy chain <END> ( <START:ggp> Smmhc <END> ) . 
To examine the effect of the <START:ggp> inv ( 16 ) ( p13 ; q22 ) <END> on myelopoiesis , we used the <START:ggp> hMRP8 promoter element <END> to generate transgenic mice expressing the <START:ggp> Pebp2beta <END> <START:ggp> Smmhc chimeric fusion protein <END> in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> . 
Neutrophil maturation was impaired in <START:ggp> PEBP2betaMYH11 <END> transgenic mice . 
Although the transgenic mice had normal numbers of <START:ana> circulating neutrophils <END> , their bone marrow contained increased numbers of <START:ana> immature neutrophilic cells <END> , which exhibited abnormal characteristics . 
In addition , <START:ggp> PEBP2betaMYH11 <END> inhibited neutrophilic differentiation in colonies derived from <START:ana> hematopoietic progenitors <END> . 
Coexpression of both <START:ggp> PEBP2betaMYH11 <END> and <START:ggp> activated NRAS <END> induced a more severe phenotype characterized by abnormal nuclear morphology indicative of granulocytic dysplasia . 
These results show that <START:ggp> PEBP2betaMYH11 <END> can impair neutrophil development and provide evidence that alterations of <START:ggp> Pebp2 <END> can contribute to the genesis of myelodysplasia . 
Human T cell leukemia virus-I ( HTLV-I ) <START:ggp> Tax <END> -mediated apoptosis in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> requires an enhanced intracellular prooxidant state . 
We have shown that an estradiol-dependent activation of human T cell leukemia virus-I <START:ggp> Tax <END> leads to the inhibition of cell proliferation and to the induction of apoptosis . 
The present study demonstrates that a hormone-dependent activation of <START:ggp> Tax <END> promotes an enhanced prooxidant state in <START:ana> stably transfected Jurkat cells <END> as measured by changes in the intracellular levels of glutathione and H2O2 ; these changes are followed by apoptotic cell death . 
Additional stimulation of the <START:ggp> CD3 <END> <START:ggp> /TCR <END> pathway enhances the oxidative and apoptotic effects . 
Both <START:ggp> Tax <END> -mediated apoptosis and oxidative stress can be potently suppressed by antioxidants , as is seen with the administration of <START:ggp> recombinant thioredoxin <END> ( <START:ggp> adult T cell leukemia-derived factor <END> ) or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate . 
Hormone-induced <START:ggp> Tax <END> activation induces a long-lasting activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , which is a major target of reactive oxygen intermediates . 
The long-term exposure of <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> to hormone eventually results in a selection of <START:ana> cell clones <END> that have lost <START:ggp> Tax <END> activity . 
A subsequent transfection of these apparently <START:ana> `` nonresponsive '' clones <END> allows the recovery of <START:ggp> Tax <END> responses in these cells . 
Our observations indicate that changes in the intracellular redox status may be a determining factor in <START:ggp> Tax <END> -mediated DNA damage , apoptosis , and selection against the long-term expression of <START:ggp> Tax <END> function . 
An allosteric drug , o , o'-bismyristoyl thiamine disulfide , suppresses HIV-1 replication through prevention of nuclear translocation of both <START:ggp> HIV-1 Tat <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
The efficacy of o , o'-bismyristoyl thiamine disulfide ( BMT ) was examined in detail against HIV-1 laboratory isolates ( HTLV-IIIB , JRFL , and MN ) , primary isolates ( KMT and KMO ) , and simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIVmac251 ) in vitro . 
BMT inhibited the replication of HIV-1 in both laboratory and primary isolates in vitro . 
In addition , BMT exhibited antiviral activity against SIVmac251 . 
Minimizing energy studies of BMT structure reveal that a trans-disulfide of thiamine ( holo drug ) disulfide ( TDS , protodrug ) is allosterically transited to the reactive twisted disulfide of BMT ( allo drug ) by o , o'-bismyristoyl esterification of TDS . 
BMT inhibits nuclear translocation of both <START:ggp> HIV-1 transactivator <END> ( <START:ggp> TAT <END> ) and the <START:ggp> cellular transcriptional nuclear factor-KB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) , resulting in the suppression of HIV-1 replication . 
Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and regulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity in <START:ana> human leukemic T cells <END> . 
Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis was investigated in <START:ana> glucocorticoid-sensitive 6TG1.1 <END> and <START:ana> resistant ICR27TK.3 <END> <START:ana> human leukemic T cells <END> . 
Following glucocorticoid treatment of <START:ana> 6TG1.1 cells <END> , <START:ggp> chromatin <END> fragmentation was observed after a delay of 24 h . 
Fragmentation was not observed in <START:ana> ICR27TK.3 cells <END> containing <START:ggp> mutant glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ana> L753F <END> ) that are activation-deficient but retain the ability to repress <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity . 
Nor was fragmentation observed after treatment with RU38486 , indicating that repression of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity is not involved . 
As described in other systems , fragmentation required ongoing protein synthesis . 
However , inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide anytime during the first 18 h of steroid treatment was as effective in blocking chromatin fragmentation as inhibition for the entire period , suggesting that synthesis of a component with a rapid turnover rate is required . 
Dexamethasone treatment completely blocked 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate induction of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) activity and elicited an increase in the amount of <START:ggp> immunoreactive IkappaB alpha <END> in sensitive <START:ana> 6TG1.1 cells <END> but not in resistant <START:ana> ICR27TK.3 cells <END> . 
In addition , mild detergent treatment of cell extracts indicated that a substantial amount of <START:ggp> cytoplasmic NF-kappaB <END> is complexed with <START:ggp> IkappaB alpha <END> or some other inhibitory factor. These results suggest that induction of a <START:ggp> labile inhibitory factor <END> such as <START:ggp> IkappaB alpha <END> may contribute to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis . 
Inhibition of HIV-1 replication by combination of a novel inhibitor of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> with AZT . 
The small molecule S9a was derived from an established <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) inhibitor ( Canventol ) by replacement of the isopropylidine group with a phenyl ring . 
S9a at 10 to 100 nM inhibited HIV production as potently as 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine ( AZT ) , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> viral reverse transcriptase <END> . 
Furthermore , S9a and AZT in combination , at noncytoxic concentrations strongly inhibited HIV-1 replication that was more than additive and substantially prolonged the appearance of virus both in <START:ana> acutely infected CD4+ lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> SupT <END> ) in culture and in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMCs <END> ) infected with a primary HIV-1 isolate . 
S9a inhibited <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> promoter-driven <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> activity . 
It was proposed that the mechanism of antiviral action of S9a was on the host cell , by blocking <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> transcription via a <START:ggp> Tat <END> -induced tar-independent loop , which decreases downstream <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation of <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) . 
S9a was superior to the first generation compound Canventol , which was superior to the natural compound sarcophytol A , demonstrating that further structure-based enhancement of potency of these compounds is feasible . 
This study suggests a therapeutic approach against AIDS by application of two drugs , one against a cellular and the other a viral target , which may provide an approach to the problem of frequent emergence of resistant variants to combinations of drugs that target only <START:ggp> HIV genes <END> . 
Highly polarized <START:ggp> HLA class II antigen <END> processing and presentation by <START:ana> human intestinal epithelial cells <END> . 
The high concentration of <START:ggp> foreign antigen <END> in the <START:ana> lumen <END> of the gastrointestinal tract is separated from the underlying <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> by a single cell layer of polarized epithelium . 
<START:ana> Intestinal epithelial cells <END> can express <START:ggp> HLA class II antigens <END> and may function as <START:ana> antigen-presenting cells to CD4 ( + ) T cells <END> within the intestinal mucosa . 
Using <START:ana> tetanus toxoid specific and HLA-DR-restricted T lymphocytes <END> , we show that <START:ana> polarized intestinal epithelial cells <END> directed to express <START:ggp> HLA-DR molecules <END> are able to initiate class II processing only after internalization of antigen from their apical surface . 
Coexpression of the <START:ggp> class II transactivator CIITA <END> in these cells , which stimulates highly efficient class II processing without the characteristic decline in barrier function seen in polarized monolayers treated with the <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokine gamma-IFN <END> , facilitates antigen processing from the basolateral surface . 
In both cases , peptide presentation to <START:ana> T cells <END> via <START:ggp> class II molecules <END> was restricted to the basolateral surface . 
These data indicate a highly polarized functional architecture for antigen processing and presentation by <START:ana> intestinal epithelial cells <END> , and suggest that the functional outcome of antigen processing by the intestinal epithelium is both dependent on the cellular surface at which the foreign antigen is internalized and by the underlying degree of mucosal inflammation 
Tobacco smoke induces coordinate activation of <START:ggp> HSF <END> and inhibition of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> : effects on <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> release . 
Tobacco smoke ( TS ) exposure is a major risk factor for human disease , and <START:ana> macrophages <END> of healthy smokers have a depressed capacity to release <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , including <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha <END> . 
TS induces the synthesis of <START:ggp> heat shock ( HS ) /stress proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> HSP <END> ) , and , in particular , of <START:ggp> Hsp70 <END> . 
We determined whether <START:ggp> Hsp70 <END> induction by TS was mediated by the activation of the <START:ggp> HS transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> HSF <END> . 
<START:ggp> HSF <END> activation has been shown to inhibit <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> . 
Thus , we also determined the effects of TS on <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> . 
<START:ana> U937 cells <END> and <START:ana> human peripheral blood monocytes <END> were exposed to TS , binding activities of the respective <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> were analyzed , and <START:ggp> Hsp70 <END> expression and <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> release were determined in parallel . 
TS activated <START:ggp> HSF <END> , which was associated with <START:ggp> Hsp70 <END> overexpression and inhibition of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> binding activity and <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> release . 
The altered <START:ggp> cytokine profile <END> observed in smokers may relate to an <START:ggp> HSF <END> / <START:ggp> Hsp70 <END> -mediated inhibition of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activity .

[ Molecular mechanism of <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> expression in <START:ana> Th1 <END> and <START:ana> Th2 <END> ] 
Upon activation by <START:ggp> antigens <END> , <START:ana> helper T cells <END> differentiate into one of several subsets , characterized by their distinct <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -production patterns . 
Among these subsets , <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> are known to activate cellular immunity resulting in inflammatory response , whereas <START:ana> Th2 cells <END> induce humoral and allergic responses and suppress inflammation . 
Th1 and Th2 effector functions and their development are attributable to their distinct <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression patterns . 
Recent reports have demonstrated that differential expression of cell surface molecules , such as <START:ggp> adhesion molecule <END> and <START:ggp> chemokine receptor <END> , is involved in their recruitment into target tissues . 
It is , therefore , suggested that clarification of the mechanisms of differential gene expression in <START:ana> Th1/Th2 <END> should lead to rational strategies for manipulating pathological immune responses . 
Activation of <START:ana> helper T cells <END> mediated by the T cell receptor induces a series of biochemical events . 
Among them , both the activation of PKC/Ras- and CaM/CN-mediated pathways play a central role in the signal transduction of <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> expression . 
Closer examination using <START:ana> non-transformed murine Th1 and Th2 clones <END> suggested that a balance between the activities of the two signaling pathways contributes to <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> expression . 
We propose that one of the targets of PGE2 , whose effect distinguishes <START:ana> Th1 <END> from Th2 , resides in the downstream <START:ggp> PKC/Ras <END> -mediated pathway . 
Signalling into the T-cell nucleus : <START:ggp> NFAT <END> regulation . 
The <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) plays an important role in T-cell biology . 
Activation of T cells results in the rapid <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> -dependent translocation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> from the cytoplasm to the nucleus . 
This translocation process coupled to the subsequent active maintenance of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> in the nucleus compartment is critical for the induction of expression of several genes encoding <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> membrane proteins <END> that modulate immune responses . 
The molecular cloning of the <START:ggp> NFAT family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> has facilitated rapid progress in the understanding of the signalling mechanisms that control the activity of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
Differential RNA display identifies <START:ggp> novel genes <END> associated with decreased <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> expression . 
To characterize further the function of the <START:ggp> intracellular vitamin D receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) , we have developed <START:ana> stable transfectant variants <END> of a <START:ana> vitamin D-responsive cell line <END> ( <START:ana> U937 <END> ) which express either decreased or increased numbers of <START:ggp> VDR <END> . 
In this study we have analyzed changes in gene expression associated with this variable <START:ggp> VDR <END> expression . 
Initial experiments indicated that a 50 % decrease in <START:ggp> VDR <END> levels was associated with a 2-fold increase in cell proliferation and a similar rise in <START:ana> c-myc mRNA <END> expression . 
Further studies were carried out using differential RNA display ( DD ) . 
Sequence analysis of <START:ggp> DD products <END> revealed two <START:ggp> cDNAs <END> with identity to <START:ggp> known gene products <END> : the <START:ggp> catalytic sub-unit of DNA-protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> DNA-PK ( CS ) <END> ) , and the <START:ggp> peroxisomal enzyme 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type IV <END> ( <START:ggp> 17beta-HSD IV <END> ) . 
Northern analysis confirmed that expression of both <START:ana> mRNAs <END> was reduced in cells with decreased numbers of <START:ggp> VDR <END> . 
Down-regulation of <START:ggp> 17beta-HSD IV <END> mRNA expression was associated with enhanced estradiol inactivation by <START:ana> U937 cells <END> , suggesting a link between estrogenic pathways and cell proliferation . 
Further Northern analyses indicated that there was no significant change in <START:ggp> 17beta-HSD IV <END> or <START:ana> DNA-PK ( CS ) mRNA <END> levels following treatment with 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 , although expression of both genes varied with changes in cell proliferation . 
These data suggest that , in addition to its established role as a <START:ggp> hormone-dependent trans-activator <END> , <START:ggp> VDR <END> may influence gene expression by ligand-independent mechanisms . 
Prostaglandin E2 Up-regulates <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> -driven gene activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> via NF-kappaB-dependent and -independent signaling pathways . 
Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) is highly dependent on the state of activation of the <START:ana> infected cells <END> and is modulated by interactions between <START:ggp> viral and host cellular factors <END> . 
Prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , a <START:ggp> pleiotropic immunomodulatory molecule <END> , is observed at elevated levels during HIV-1 infection as well as during the course of other pathogenic infections . 
In <START:ana> 1G5 <END> , a <START:ana> Jurkat-derived T cell line <END> stably transfected with a <START:ggp> luciferase gene <END> driven by <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) , we found that PGE2 markedly enhanced <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> -mediated <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> activity . 
Experiments have been conducted to identify <START:ggp> second messengers <END> involved in this PGE2-dependent up-regulating effect on the regulatory element of HIV-1 . 
In this study , we present evidence indicating that signal transduction pathways induced by PGE2 necessitate the participation of cyclic AMP , <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> , and Ca2+ . 
Experiments conducted with different <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR-based vectors <END> suggested that PGE2-mediated activation effect on HIV-1 transcription was transduced via both NF-kappaB-dependent and -independent signaling pathways . 
The involvement of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in the PGE2-dependent activating effect on HIV-1 transcription was further confirmed using a <START:ggp> kappaB-regulated luciferase encoding vector <END> and by electrophoretic mobility shift assays . 
Results from Northern blot and flow cytometric analyses , as well as the use of a selective antagonist indicated that PGE2 modulation of <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> -driven <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> activity in studied <START:ana> T lymphoid cells <END> is transduced via the <START:ggp> EP4 receptor subtype <END> . 
These results suggest that secretion of PGE2 by <START:ana> macrophages <END> in response to infection or inflammatory activators could induce signaling events resulting in activation of proviral DNA present into <START:ana> T cells <END> latently infected with HIV-1 . 
Activation of distinct <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> by bacterial LPS , <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> , and <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> and the necessity to overcome the action of <START:ggp> endogenous proteases <END> . 
Human <START:ana> neutrophils <END> can be induced to actively transcribe a number of <START:ggp> early-response genes <END> , in particular those encoding <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , <START:ggp> chemokines <END> , and the high-affinity surface receptor for <START:ggp> IgG <END> , <START:ggp> FcgammaRI <END> . 
Although little is known to date about the regulation of gene transcription in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> , several indications point to a role for distinct <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , such as members of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> STAT families <END> . 
In this study , we investigated whether these <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> become activated under stimulatory conditions which are known to induce gene transcription in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> . 
Unexpectedly , we found that conventional procedures employed to prepare cellular extracts cause the release of proteolytic activities that are normally stored in intracellular granules , resulting in the degradation of various <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel <END> and <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> . 
To circumvent this problem , we developed an alternative procedure which allowed us to show that in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> , LPS and <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> induce a <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> DNA-binding activity which essentially consists of <START:ggp> p50/RelA dimers <END> , and that <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> promotes the binding of <START:ggp> STAT1 homodimers <END> to the <START:ggp> IFNgamma response region <END> of the <START:ggp> FcgammaRI promoter <END> . 
Moreover , we report that neutrophil stimulation with <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> results in the formation of a <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> -containing DNA-binding activity . 
Collectively , the current findings open new perspectives about mechanisms that are likely to regulate gene transcription in <START:ana> neutrophils <END> . 
In addition , the procedure described herein could prove useful in other cell types that express high levels of <START:ggp> endogenous proteases <END> . 
Low CD3+CD28-induced <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> production correlates with decreased reactive oxygen intermediate formation in <START:ana> neonatal T cells <END> . 
The capacity of <START:ana> neonatal T cells <END> to secrete <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) has been reported to be variable . 
We analysed <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production in purified <START:ana> neonatal and adult T cells <END> using polyclonal activator phorbol ester + calcium ionophore ( PDBu + iono ) or receptor-mediated <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> /anti-CD3+ <START:ggp> anti-CD28 <END> stimulation . 
PDBu + iono induced equally high <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> levels in both groups and , when stimulated with plate-bound <START:ggp> anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody <END> ( <START:ggp> mAb <END> ) , the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion by <START:ana> neonatal cells <END> was undetectable and <START:ana> adult cells <END> produced low amounts of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ( mean 331 +/- 86 pg/ml ) . 
The addition of <START:ggp> anti-CD28 mAb <END> to <START:ana> anti-CD3-stimulated cells <END> markedly increased <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production in both cell types , but levels of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in <START:ana> neonatal T cells <END> remained clearly lower than those of <START:ana> adult T cells <END> ( respective mean values : 385 +/- 109 pg/ml and 4494 +/- 1199 pg/ml ) . 
As <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is a critical <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> in the control of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression , we next analysed its nuclear translocation in <START:ana> neonatal and adult T cells <END> using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and , because induction of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) is required for the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , we also analysed levels of intracellular ROI in these cells using the ROI-reactive fluorochrome DCFH-DA and flow cytometry . 
In <START:ana> neonatal T cells <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation and ROI formation after <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> stimulation were low compared with <START:ana> adult T cells <END> and , although addition of <START:ggp> anti-CD28 mAb <END> increased induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and ROI formation , levels similar to those of adults were not achieved . 
After PDBu + iono stimulation , the cells showed similar ROI formation and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion . 
Our results suggest that reduced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production by <START:ana> neonatal T cells <END> is specific for <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> + <START:ggp> anti-CD28 <END> -mediated stimulation and that these activators can not effectively activate the ROI <START:ggp> -NF-kappa B <END> signalling pathway in <START:ana> neonatal T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD30 <END> is a <START:ggp> CD40-inducible molecule <END> that negatively regulates <START:ggp> CD40-mediated immunoglobulin <END> class switching in <START:ana> non-antigen-selected human B cells <END> . 
We used our monoclonal model of germinal center maturation , <START:ana> CL-01 B cells <END> , to investigate the role of <START:ggp> CD30 <END> in human B cell differentiation . 
<START:ana> CL-01 cells <END> are <START:ggp> IgM <END> + <START:ggp> IgD <END> + <START:ggp> CD30 <END> + and switch to <START:ggp> IgG <END> , <START:ggp> IgA <END> , and <START:ggp> IgE <END> when exposed to <START:ggp> CD40L <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> . 
Switching is hampered by <START:ggp> CD30 <END> coengagement , possibly through interference with the <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> downstream C ( H ) genes <END> . 
The physiological relevance of this phenomenon is emphasized by similar <START:ggp> CD30 <END> -mediated effects in <START:ana> naive B cells <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> CD30 <END> by these cells is induced by <START:ggp> CD40L <END> but is inhibited by B cell receptor coengagement and/or exposure to <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> . 
Our data suggest that <START:ggp> CD30 <END> critically regulates the <START:ggp> CD40 <END> -mediated differentiation of <START:ana> non-antigen-selected human B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Calcineurin <END> and the biological effect of cyclosporine and tacrolimus . 
The mechanism of the immunosuppressive effect of CyA and FK 506 can be monitored in vivo in humans . 
The picture emerging is of a close relationship between drug concentrations and CN inhibition . 
But many puzzles of the drugs remain . 
What is the role of CyA in the activation of <START:ggp> transforming growth factor-beta <END> ( <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> ) , particularly in relationship to nephrotoxicity and fibrogenesis ? 
How important are the anti-inflammatory ( non T ) effects of CyA , and which cells do they operate in ? 
Are there effects of CyA and FK 506 all attributable to CN inhibition , and how much of them are mediated through the <START:ggp> NFATC family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> ? 
Finally , it would be useful to know what the inhibitory effects of CyA are on tolerance and negative regulatory events . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> B and T cells <END> activates expression of <START:ggp> transcription and differentiation factors <END> . 
During B and T cell differentiation and proliferation many genes are induced or repressed while certain genes are constitutively expressed . 
To investigate processes related to B and T cell activation , the gene expression of stimulated and <START:ana> nonstimulated Ramos and Jurkat cells <END> was studied using cDNA microarray technology . 
Simultaneous analysis of close to <START:ggp> 600 genes <END> indicated highest increase in the expression of certain <START:ggp> transcription , differentiation and proliferation factors <END> . 
Many of these genes have not previously been shown to funcion in the <START:ana> stimulated lymphocytes <END> . 
Also genes encoding proteins involved in DNA replication , binding , transcription and translation were induced . 
Large part of the <START:ggp> activated genes <END> were under very stringent regulation being expressed only after stimulation . 
The mechanism and function of the <START:ggp> expressed genes <END> during lymphocyte differentiation and in disorders is discussed . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin 2 and 15 <END> activate <START:ggp> Stat3alpha <END> in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> ) has recently been shown to exist in two alternatively spliced isoforms , a short form , <START:ggp> Stat3beta <END> , and a longer form , <START:ggp> Stat3alpha <END> , displaying differences in transcriptional activity . 
It is unknown which <START:ggp> Stat3 isoform <END> ( s ) is activated in response to <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> . 
Here , <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> in previously activated <START:ana> CD4 ( + ) human T cells <END> was examined using <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> antibodies directed against different regions of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> . 
As determined by tyrosine phosphorylation , nuclear translocation and binding to an hSIE-oligonucleotide probe , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> activated the slowly migrating isoform , <START:ggp> Stat3alpha <END> . 
In contrast , minimal or no activation of <START:ggp> Stat3beta <END> was observed , suggesting that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> predominantly activate <START:ggp> Stat3alpha <END> in <START:ana> human CD4 ( + ) T cells <END> . 
In this way , diversity in the expression and activation of <START:ggp> Stat3 proteins <END> may provide additional means of regulating <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -induced T cell responses .

Transcriptional regulation of <START:ggp> lysosomal acid lipase <END> in differentiating monocytes is mediated by <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> . 
Human <START:ggp> lysosomal acid lipase <END> ( <START:ggp> LAL <END> ) is a <START:ggp> hydrolase <END> required for the cleavage of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides derived from plasma lipoproteins . 
It is shown here that during monocyte to macrophage differentiation , the expression of <START:ana> LAL-mRNA <END> is induced . 
This induction is dependent on <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> activity and protein synthesis . 
The cell type-specific increase in <START:ggp> LAL <END> expression is further investigated in the <START:ana> THP-1 cell line <END> with respect to transcriptional regulation . 
The <START:ana> human monocytic leukemia cell line <END> <START:ana> THP-1 <END> differentiates into <START:ana> macrophage-like cells <END> when treated with phorbol esters . 
In order to determine the <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> necessary for both basal and phorbol 12-myristate-13 acetate ( PMA ) -enhanced promoter activity , we performed deletion analysis and <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> assays . 
A <START:ggp> PMA responsive element <END> has been identified between <START:ggp> -182 bp <END> and <START:ggp> -107 bp <END> upstream of the <START:ggp> major transcription start site <END> . 
Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that binding of <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> to the <START:ggp> LAL promoter <END> is increased by PMA in <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> . 
Co-transfections with <START:ggp> expression plasmids <END> for <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> further emphasized the important role of these <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in both basal and PMA-enhanced <START:ggp> LAL <END> expression . 
Our data suggest that differentiation dependent increase of <START:ggp> lysosomal acid lipase <END> ( <START:ggp> LAL <END> ) expression in <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> is mediated by a concerted action of <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> . 
Relationship between <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> constitutive expression , <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> synthesis , and apoptosis in <START:ana> EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cells <END> . 
In order to understand the role of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in EBV transformation we have established stably transfected <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> into <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cells <END> . 
Two clones were obtained in which the loss of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding activity correlated with the constitutive expression of the transgenic <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> . 
Protein latency expression was determined by immunocytochemistry . 
Expression of surface markers , intracytoplasmic content of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> cell cycle analysis after <START:ggp> BrdU <END> incorporation and DNA staining with propidium iodide were studied by flow cytometry . 
Percentage of <START:ana> apoptotic cells <END> was determined by in-situ labelling of DNA strand breaks . 
No significative changes in EBV latency nor in cell surface marker expression was found . 
In contrast , intracytoplasmic <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> levels were strongly reduced in <START:ana> transfected clones <END> . 
Furthermore , 30 % of <START:ana> IkappaBalpha transfected cells <END> were apoptotic after 8 h of <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> treatment . 
This correlated with a strong reduction of BrdU incorporation after 24 h of <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> treatment . 
No effect was seen with non <START:ana> transfected cells <END> or with cells transfected with a control plasmid . 
Our results suggest that the <START:ggp> TNFalpha gene <END> could be one of the targets of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in EBV infected cells and that <START:ana> NF-kappaB protects EBV-infected cells <END> from apoptosis induced by <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> , which may favour the proliferative effect of this <START:ggp> cytokine <END> . 
Seminoma in a postmenopausal woman with a <START:ggp> Y ; 15 translocation <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> and a t ( Y ; 15 ) /45 , X Turner mosaic pattern in <START:ana> skin fibroblasts <END> . 
We report an unusual case of a 55 year old Japanese woman with a seminoma but relatively normal menses . 
The patient was a phenotypic female with late onset menarche ( 18 years of age ) , who was amenorrhoeic for the first year , followed by menses of one to three days ' slight flow with dysmenorrhoea , but an otherwise normal menstrual history . 
A typical seminoma was removed from the left adnexal region and an immature testis was identified separately as an associated right adnexal mass . 
Repeated karyotypic studies on <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures <END> showed only 46 , X , -Y , t ( Y ; 15 ) ( q12 ; p13 ) . 
Cytogenetic examination of the patient 's younger brother , who had fathered three healthy children , showed an identical karyotype . 
Mosaicism of <START:ana> 46 , X , -Y , t ( Y ; 15 ) ( q12 ; p13 ) /45 , X cell lines <END> was found in skin samples from the patient 's elbow and genital regions , although there were no clinical stigmata of Turner syndrome . 
An androgen receptor binding assay of <START:ana> cultured genital skin fibroblasts <END> was negative . 
Molecular analysis using Southern blot hybridisation , PCR , and direct DNA sequencing showed that neither the patient nor her brother had a detectable deletion or other abnormalities of Y chromosome sequences , including the <START:ggp> SRY ( sex determining region of the Y chromosome ) gene sequence <END> . 
These findings suggest that Turner mosaicism of the <START:ana> 45 , X cell line <END> may have contributed to this atypical presentation in an XY female , although we can not exclude abnormalities of other genes related to sex differentiation . 
Potent inhibition of HIV type 1 replication by an antiinflammatory alkaloid , cepharanthine , in <START:ana> chronically infected monocytic cells <END> . 
Cepharanthine is a biscoclaurine alkaloid isolated from Stephania cepharantha Hayata and has been shown to have antiinflammatory , antiallergic , and immunomodulatory activities in vivo . 
As several <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> and oxidative stresses are involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection , we investigated the inhibitory effects of cepharanthine on tumor necrosis factor alpha ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) - and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -induced HIV-1 replication in <START:ana> chronically infected cell lines <END> . 
Two <START:ana> chronically HIV-1-infected cell lines <END> , <START:ana> U1 <END> ( monocytic ) and <START:ana> ACH-2 <END> ( T lymphocytic ) , were stimulated with <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> or PMA and cultured in the presence of various concentrations of the compound . 
HIV-1 replication was determined by <START:ggp> p24 antigen <END> level . 
The inhibitory effects of cepharanthine on <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) -driven gene expression and <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) activation were also examined . 
Cepharanthine dose dependently inhibited HIV-1 replication in <START:ana> TNF-alpha- and PMA-stimulated U1 cells <END> but not in <START:ana> ACH-2 cells <END> . 
Its 50 % effective and cytotoxic concentrations were 0.016 and 2.2 microg/ml in <START:ana> PMA-stimulated U1 cells <END> , respectively . 
Cepharanthine was found to suppress <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> -driven gene expression through the inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
These results indicate that cepharanthine is a highly potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication in a <START:ana> chronically infected monocytic cell line <END> . 
Since biscoclaurine alkaloids , containing cepharanthine as a major component , are widely used for the treatment of patients with various inflammatory diseases in Japan , cepharanthine should be further pursued for its chemotherapeutic potential in HIV-1-infected patients . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> only partially mediates <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 <END> activation of B cells . 
The <START:ggp> latent membrane protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> ) of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is required for EBV-induced immortalization of <START:ana> human B cells <END> and causes tumorigenic transformation of <START:ana> cell lines <END> . 
<START:ggp> LMP1 <END> expression induces phenotypic changes resembling B cell activation , such as cell size increase and up-regulation of <START:ggp> cell surface activation markers <END> . 
<START:ggp> LMP1 <END> contains two domains that activate the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , one through interactions with <START:ggp> TRAF proteins <END> and the other with the <START:ggp> TRADD protein <END> . 
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the importance of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> induction in the up-regulation of the B cell activation markers <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> CD71 <END> by <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> . 
This study shows that expression of <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> activates transcription from <START:ggp> p50/p65- and c-Rel- responsive promoters <END> , and that this activity can be completely inhibited by expression of a dominant <START:ggp> inhibitory IkappaB mutant <END> . 
<START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> CD71 <END> are nevertheless up-regulated by <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> in <START:ana> primary B cells <END> and cell lines expressing the <START:ggp> dominant IkappaB <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> -induced cell size increase of <START:ana> primary B cells <END> was unaffected by <START:ggp> IkappaB <END> expression . 
It was concluded that even when <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> is unable to activate <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , it is still capable of inducing certain characteristics of <START:ana> activated B cells <END> , strongly suggesting that <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> can also activate cells independently of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Models of lineage switching in hematopoietic development : a new <START:ana> myeloid-committed eosinophil cell line <END> ( <START:ana> YJ <END> ) demonstrates trilineage potential . 
A new <START:ana> human leukemia cell line <END> with an eosinophilic phenotype , designated <START:ana> YJ <END> , was established from the <START:ana> peripheral blood cells <END> of a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMMoL ) with eosinophilia . 
When cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , most <START:ana> YJ cells <END> were myeloblastoid with a small number of the cells having eosinophilic granules . 
<START:ggp> Cell surface markers <END> in the <START:ana> YJ cells <END> were positive for <START:ggp> CD33 <END> and were negative for <START:ggp> CD34 <END> , <START:ggp> CD16 <END> and <START:ggp> CD23 <END> . 
The eosinophilic characteristics of <START:ana> YJ cells <END> were confirmed by histochemical staining with Fast-Green/Neutral-Red and by the expression of <START:ana> mRNAs <END> for <START:ggp> eosinophil-associated granule proteins <END> , <START:ggp> eosinophil cationic protein <END> ( <START:ggp> ECP <END> ) , <START:ggp> eosinophil-derived neurotoxin <END> ( <START:ggp> EDN <END> ) , <START:ggp> eosinophil peroxidase <END> ( <START:ggp> EPO <END> ) , and <START:ggp> major basic protein <END> ( <START:ggp> MBP <END> ) , and for the <START:ggp> Charcot-Leyden crystal ( CLC ) protein <END> . 
The <START:ana> YJ cells <END> could be induced towards monocytic differentiation by stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) . 
The monocytic characteristics of <START:ana> YJ cells <END> treated with PMA were confirmed by morphological analysis with alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase staining , by <START:ggp> CD14 <END> expression , and by increased expression of <START:ana> Egr-1 mRNA <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ana> YJ cells <END> could be differentiated towards the <START:ana> neutrophil lineage <END> by stimulation with all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) . 
<START:ana> YJ cells <END> treated in vitro with 2 microM RA differentiated into <START:ana> metamyelocytes <END> and <START:ana> band neutrophils <END> , and increased the number of <START:ana> nitroblue tetrazolium ( NBT ) -positive cells <END> and increased <START:ana> gp91phox mRNA <END> expression . 
Thus , the <START:ana> YJ cell line <END> exhibited eosinophilic characteristics , but was able to differentiate to the <START:ana> monocytic or neutrophilic lineages <END> in response to PMA or RA , respectively . 
The expression of genes for <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> involved in myeloid differentiation was evaluated by Northern blot analysis . 
Increased expression of <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> was observed with macrophage differentiation . 
In contrast , increased expressions of <START:ggp> C/EBPbeta <END> and <START:ana> MZF-1 mRNA <END> occurred with neutrophilic differentiation . 
The <START:ana> YJ cell line <END> should be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing lineage switching from the <START:ana> eosinophil <END> to <START:ana> monocytic or neutrophil lineages <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-6 <END> production in hemorrhagic shock is accompanied by neutrophil recruitment and lung injury . 
Hemorrhagic shock ( HS ) initiates an inflammatory cascade that includes the production of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and recruitment of <START:ana> neutrophils <END> ( <START:ana> PMN <END> ) and may progress to organ failure , inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . 
To examine the hypothesis that <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ) contributes to PMN infiltration and lung damage in HS , we examined the lungs of rats subjected to unresuscitated and resuscitated HS for the production of <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> and activation of <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> . 
Using semiquantitative RT-PCR , we found a striking increase in <START:ana> IL-6 mRNA <END> levels only in resuscitated HS , with peak levels observed 1 h after initiation of resuscitation . 
Increased <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> protein expression was localized to <START:ana> bronchial and alveolar cells <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of protein extracts from shock lungs exhibited an increase in <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> activation with kinetics similar to <START:ana> IL-6 mRNA <END> . 
In situ DNA binding assay determined <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> activation predominantly within alveoli . 
Intratracheal instillation of <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> alone into normal rats resulted in PMN infiltration into lung interstitium and alveoli , marked elevation of bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity , and increased wet-to-dry ratio . 
These findings indicate that <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> production and <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> activation occur early in HS and may contribute to PMN-mediated lung injury , including ARDS after HS . 
The <START:ggp> MHC class II transactivator <END> ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) requires conserved <START:ggp> leucine charged domains <END> for interactions with the conserved <START:ggp> W box promoter element <END> . 
The <START:ggp> class II transactivator <END> <START:ggp> CIITA <END> is required for transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes <END> . 
Aside from an <START:ggp> N-terminal acidic transcriptional activation domain <END> , little is known about how this factor functions . 
Extensive mutagenesis of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> was undertaken to identify structural motifs required for function . 
The ability of mutants to activate a reporter gene under the control of <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> conserved <START:ggp> W-X-Y or X-Y regulatory elements <END> was determined . 
Two mutants displayed differential activity between the two <START:ggp> promoters <END> , activating transcription with the <START:ggp> W-X-Y but not the X-Y elements <END> . 
All mutants were tested for their ability to interfere with wild-type <START:ggp> CIITA <END> activity . 
Five <START:ggp> CIITA mutant constructions <END> were able to down-regulate wild-type <START:ggp> CIITA <END> activity . 
Three of these mutants contained targeted disruptions of potential functional motifs : the <START:ggp> acidic activation domain <END> , a putative <START:ggp> GTP-binding motif <END> and two <START:ggp> leucine charged domains <END> ( <START:ggp> LCD motifs <END> ) . 
The other two contained mutations in regions that do not have homology to described proteins . 
The characterization of <START:ggp> CIITA mutants <END> that are able to discriminate between promoters with or without the <START:ggp> W box <END> strongly suggests that <START:ggp> CIITA <END> requires such interactions for function . 
The identification of <START:ggp> LCD motifs <END> required for <START:ggp> CIITA <END> function brings to light a previously undefined role of these motifs in <START:ggp> CIITA <END> function . 
The <START:ggp> peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> PPARalpha <END> ) ligand WY 14 , 643 does not interfere with leukotriene B4 induced adhesion of <START:ana> neutrophils <END> to <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> PPAR <END> ) control discrete genes involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism . 
Recently , it was suggested that activation of the <START:ggp> alpha isoform <END> of <START:ggp> PPAR <END> by the potent proinflammatory mediator leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) enhanced degradation of this eicosanoid , offersuggesting a new aspect of down-regulation of inflammation . 
Here , we studied whether <START:ggp> PPARalpha <END> activation ( by means of the selective agonist WY 14 , 643 ) of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> , pivotal in the regulation of inflammatory responses , interfered with LTB4 induced adhesion of <START:ana> PMN neutrophil granulocytes <END> in vitro . 
When <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> were treated with WY 14 , 643 prior to activation with LTB4 ( or <START:ggp> fMLP <END> , <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> or <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> , as controls ) we could not document any effect on the number of <START:ana> adhering PMN <END> or duration of the response . 
Thus , this study provides no evidence indicating a regulatory function of <START:ggp> PPARalpha <END> in LTB4 induced adhesive interactions between <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> and <START:ana> neutrophils <END> 
Interaction of <START:ana> sickle erythrocytes <END> with <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> in the presence of endothelial cell conditioned medium induces oxidant stress leading to transendothelial migration of <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
The abnormal adherence of <START:ana> sickle red blood cells <END> ( <START:ana> SS RBC <END> ) to <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> has been thought to contribute to vascular occlusion , a major cause of morbidity in sickle cell disease ( SCD ) . 
We determined whether the interaction of <START:ana> SS RBC <END> with cultured <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> induced cellular oxidant stress that would culminate in expression of <START:ggp> cell adhesion molecules <END> ( <START:ggp> CAMs <END> ) involved in the adhesion and diapedesis of <START:ana> monocytes <END> and the adherence of <START:ana> SS reticulocytes <END> . 
We showed that the interaction of <START:ana> SS RBC <END> at 2 % concentration in the presence of multimers of <START:ggp> von Willebrand factor <END> ( <START:ggp> vWf <END> ) , derived from endothelial cell-derived conditioned medium ( E-CM ) with <START:ana> cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> HUVEC <END> ) , resulted in a fivefold increased formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances ( TBARS ) and activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> , both indicators of cellular oxidant stress . 
<START:ana> Normal RBC <END> show none of these phenomena . 
The oxidant stress-induced signaling resulted in an increased surface expression of a subset of <START:ggp> CAMs <END> , <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> , <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> , and <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> in <START:ana> HUVEC <END> . 
The addition of <START:ggp> oxygen radical scavenger enzymes <END> ( <START:ggp> catalase <END> , <START:ggp> superoxide dismutase <END> ) and antioxidant ( probucol ) inhibited these events . 
Additionally , preincubation of <START:ana> HUVEC <END> with a synthetic peptide Arg-Gly-Asp ( RGD ) that prevents <START:ggp> vWf <END> -mediated adhesion of <START:ana> SS RBC <END> reduced the surface expression of <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> activation . 
Furthermore , <START:ana> SS RBC <END> -induced oxidant stress resulted in a twofold increase in the transendothelial migration of both <START:ana> monocyte-like HL-60 cells <END> and <START:ana> human peripheral blood monocytes <END> , and approximately a sixfold increase in <START:ggp> platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> PECAM-1 <END> ) phosphorylation , each of which was blocked by <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> inhibitor and antioxidants . 
These results suggest that the adherence/contact of <START:ana> SS RBC <END> to <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> in large vessel can generate enhanced oxidant stress leading to increased adhesion and diapedesis of <START:ana> monocytes <END> , as well as heightened adherence of <START:ana> SS reticulocytes <END> , indicating that injury/activation of endothelium can contribute to vaso-occlusion in SCD . 
Signal transduction abnormalities in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> from patients with advanced renal carcinoma : clinical relevance and effects of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> therapy . 
Studies have demonstrated abnormalities of the <START:ggp> CD3/T-cell antigen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) and pathways of signal transduction in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> from animals and patients with advanced malignancy . 
Diminished expression of <START:ggp> TCRzeta <END> and <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> that are associated with the <START:ggp> TCR <END> and reduced nuclear localization of <START:ggp> RelA containing nuclear factor kappaB ( NFkappaB ) complexes <END> have been noted . 
These defects have been described in <START:ana> T cells <END> from patients with malignant melanoma , renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , ovarian cancer , and colorectal cancer . 
Preliminary observations also indicate possible correlation with clinical variables such as stage in selected instances . 
To further characterize altered expression of <START:ggp> TCRzeta <END> , <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> , and impaired activation of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> , <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> were obtained from 65 patients with RCC , the majority of whom were receiving combination <START:ggp> cytokine <END> therapy [ <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -2 <END> , <START:ggp> IFN alpha <END> -containing regimens ] and 37 control individuals . 
In 29 of these patients , levels of <START:ggp> TCRzeta <END> and <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> were determined by Western blots of T-cell lysates and semiquantitated using densitometry . 
Relative levels were then correlated with a series of clinical variables including response to therapy , performance status , survival , disease sites , age , and others . 
In another group of 28 patients ( three individuals from the first group ) , the frequency of abnormal <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activation was studied using electrophoretic mobility shift assays after activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> with phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin or <START:ggp> anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody <END> . 
Changes in these signaling molecules during <START:ggp> cytokine <END> treatment were also investigated . 
<START:ggp> TCRzeta <END> and <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> were detected in the <START:ana> peripheral blood T cells <END> in 27 of 29 patients , and overall , reduced levels were noted visually in 12 of 29 ( 41 % ) and 13 of 29 ( 45 % ) individuals , respectively . 
When levels were semiquantitated using densitometry , significant decreases of <START:ggp> TCRzeta <END> ( P = 0.029 ) and <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> ( P = 0.029 ) but not <START:ggp> CD3epsilon <END> ( P = 0.131 ) , compared with control levels , were found . 
In patients treated with IL-2/ <START:ggp> IFN alpha <END> -based therapy , relative levels of <START:ggp> TCRzeta <END> increased significantly ( P = 0.002 ) on day 15 of cycle one compared with the baseline . 
Correlations of <START:ggp> TCRzeta <END> or <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> levels with response or disease variables , except for lower <START:ggp> TCRzeta <END> levels ( P < 0.001 ) in the presence of bone metastases , were not found . 
Abnormal <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activation after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin and/or <START:ggp> anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody <END> was found in 59 % of patients ( 17 of 28 ) and was not accounted for by the advanced age of the study cohort . 
Activation of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood T cells <END> was inducible during <START:ggp> cytokine <END> therapy in four of six individuals who displayed impaired <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activity prior to therapy . 
Moreover , impaired activation of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> does not appear linked to a reduction of <START:ggp> TCRzeta <END> expression , because in five patients , normal <START:ggp> TCRzeta <END> levels were present although <START:ggp> kappaB <END> binding was not inducible . 
In the majority of patients with advanced RCC , <START:ana> peripheral blood T cells <END> express <START:ggp> TCRzeta <END> and <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> , and in a subset , reduced levels of these <START:ggp> TCRzeta associated molecules <END> are seen that may increase during <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -based therapy . 
Abnormal activation of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> is also present in > 50 % of patients and may also revert to normal during IL-2/ <START:ggp> IFN alpha <END> -based treatment . 
This alteration in <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activation occurred in the presence of normal expression of <START:ggp> TCRzeta-associated signaling elements <END> . 
The clinical significance of these findings remains unclear . 
Identification of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> expressed during ATRA-induced neutrophil differentiation of <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> . 
A recent clinical therapeutic initiative has been the use of chemical agents which induce the <START:ana> leukaemic cells <END> to overcome their block in differentiation . 
In order to understand this block the cascade of molecular events needs to be characterized . 
Haemopoietic differentiation is ultimately controlled at the level of gene transcription which is mediated by an array of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Many <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> contain similar <START:ggp> structural protein sequences <END> , and we have used an RT-PCR-based approach to isolate sequences , from <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> gene families which share similar domains . 
Degenerate primers corresponding to the <START:ggp> TFIIIA zinc-finger consensus amino acid sequences <END> and to the <START:ggp> POU-homeodomain <END> and <START:ggp> POU-specific domain <END> were used to amplify genes on the basis that they contained similarities in structural motifs shared within these families of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
A <START:ana> serum-independent HL60 cell line <END> was induced towards the neutrophil lineage by treatment with all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) for 24 h . 
<START:ana> CD38+ cells <END> committed towards this lineage were enriched and a population of these cells treated with dihydroxyvitamin D3 to induce neutrophil maturation . 
RNA extracted from uninduced , <START:ana> ATRA-induced CD38+ cells <END> , and <START:ana> vitamin D3 treated maturing cell cultures <END> were amplified using the degenerate primers . 
<START:ggp> PCR fragments <END> were cloned , sequenced , clustered into homologous groups , and the group sequences searched on the GenBank database . 
The Oct 1 <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , and a very close homologue , <START:ggp> KIAA0144 <END> , was identified using the POU family primers . 
The zinc-finger primers identified three zinc-finger genes . 
The pattern of gene expression was suggested from the number of clones in each group at neutrophil commitment and maturation . 
The differential expression of the genes in the <START:ggp> zinc finger and POU families <END> will lead to a better understanding of the cascade of gene expression which occurs following ATRA-induced differentiation . 
<START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> -dependent enhancer activity in <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> regulation . 
Previously , we analyzed the <START:ggp> proximal IL-4 promoter <END> in directing Th2-specific activity . 
An <START:ggp> 800-base pair proximal promoter <END> conferred some Th2-selective expression in transgenic mice . 
However , this region directed extremely low reporter mRNA levels relative to endogenous <START:ana> IL-4 mRNA <END> , suggesting that full gene activity requires additional <START:ggp> enhancer elements <END> . 
Here , we analyzed large <START:ggp> genomic IL-4 regions <END> for enhancer activity and interaction with <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
The proximal <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter <END> is only moderately augmented by <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> , but certain <START:ggp> genomic regions <END> significantly enhanced <START:ggp> GATA-3 promoter <END> transactivation . 
Some enhancing regions contained consensus , <START:ggp> GATA sites <END> that bound <START:ggp> Th2-specific complexes <END> . 
However , retroviral transduction of <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> into <START:ana> developing T cells <END> induced <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> to full <START:ggp> Th2 <END> levels , but only partially restored <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> production . 
Thus , we propose that <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> is permissive , but not sufficient , for full <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> enhancement and may act through <START:ggp> GATA elements <END> surrounding the <START:ggp> IL-13/IL-4 gene locus <END> . 
Position effect of translocations involving the <START:ggp> inactive X chromosome <END> : physical linkage to <START:ggp> XIC/XIST <END> does not lead to long-range de novo inactivation in <START:ana> human differentiated cells <END> . 
Given the reported long-range cis-inactivating effect of the <START:ggp> XIST gene <END> in early embryonic development and the lack of requirement of <START:ggp> X-chromosome-specific elements <END> for propagating the inactive state , there exists the possibility of cis inactivation of autosomal material after de novo translocation to an <START:ggp> inactive X chromosome <END> ( <START:ggp> Xi <END> ) in <START:ana> differentiated cells <END> . 
We have analyzed de novo radiation-induced translocations between the <START:ggp> Xi <END> and <START:ggp> autosomes <END> to study the maintenance and spreading of <START:ggp> X-chromosome <END> inactivation ( X inactivation ) in relation to the position of the X-inactivation center <START:ggp> ( XIC ) /XIST <END> in <START:ana> differentiated cells <END> . 
Autosome/ <START:ggp> Xi <END> translocations were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . 
The activation status of the <START:ggp> chromosomes <END> involved in the translocation was determined by simultaneous immunocytogenetic studies using <START:ggp> antibodies <END> against either <START:ggp> BrdU <END> incorporated at late S phase or <START:ggp> acetylated histone H4 <END> . 
The position of <START:ggp> XIC/XIST <END> in the reciprocal products of the translocation was determined by XIST-specific FISH and computer enhancement . 
In other experiments , the <START:ggp> Xq13 region <END> carrying <START:ggp> XIC/XIST <END> was localized by computer enhancement of the DAPI banding pattern . 
Our study in <START:ana> differentiated cells <END> provides a visual demonstration that physical separation from <START:ggp> XIC/XIST <END> does not result in reactivation of <START:ggp> inactive X-chromosome <END> material and that X inactivation is not spread to the <START:ggp> translocated autosomes <END> irrespective of the position of <START:ggp> XIC/XIST <END> . 
This observation suggests that physical linkage to <START:ggp> XIC/XIST <END> does not lead to de novo inactivation of autosomal material . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-4 and -13 <END> induce upregulation of the murine macrophage <START:ggp> 12/15-lipoxygenase activity <END> : evidence for the involvement of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> . 
When human <START:ana> monocytes <END> or <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> are cultured in the presence of <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -4 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> , the expression of the <START:ggp> reticulocyte-type 15-lipoxygenase <END> is induced . 
In mice a <START:ggp> 15-lipoxygenase <END> is not expressed , but a <START:ggp> leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase <END> is present in <START:ana> peritoneal macrophages <END> . 
To investigate whether both <START:ggp> lipoxygenase isoforms <END> exhibit a similar regulatory response toward <START:ggp> cytokine <END> stimulation , we studied the regulation of the <START:ggp> leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase <END> of <START:ana> murine peritoneal macrophages <END> by <START:ggp> interleukins <END> and found that the activity of this <START:ggp> enzyme <END> is upregulated in a dose-dependent manner when the cells were cultured in the presence of the <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> but not by <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> . 
When peripheral murine <START:ana> monocytes <END> that do not express the <START:ggp> lipoxygenase <END> were treated with <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> expression of <START:ana> 12/15-lipoxygenase mRNA <END> was induced , suggesting pretranslational control mechanisms . 
In contrast , no upregulation of the <START:ggp> lipoxygenase <END> activity was observed when the <START:ana> macrophages <END> were prepared from homozygous <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> -deficient mice . 
<START:ana> Peritoneal macrophages <END> of transgenic mice that systemically overexpress <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> exhibited a threefold to fourfold higher <START:ggp> 12-lipoxygenase <END> activity than cells prepared from control animals . 
A similar upregulation of <START:ggp> 12-lipoxygenase <END> activity was detected in heart , spleen , and lung of the transgenic animals . 
Moreover , a strong induction of the enzyme was observed in <START:ana> red cells <END> during experimental anemia in mice . 
The data presented here indicate that ( 1 ) the <START:ggp> 12-lipoxygenase <END> activity of murine macrophages is upregulated in vitro and in vivo by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and/or <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> , ( 2 ) this upregulation requires expression of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> , and ( 3 ) the constitutive expression of the enzyme appears to be <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> independent . 
The <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -dependent upregulation of the <START:ggp> murine macrophage 12-lipoxygenase <END> and its induction during experimental anemia suggests its close relatedness with the <START:ggp> human reticulocyte-type 15-lipoxygenase <END> despite their differences in the positional specificity of arachidonic acid oxygenation . 
<START:ggp> Interferon-gamma-induced factor <END> binding to the <START:ggp> interleukin-4-responsive element <END> of <START:ggp> CD23b promoter <END> in <START:ana> human tonsillar mononuclear cells <END> : role in transient up-regulation of the <START:ana> interleukin-4-induced CD23b mRNA <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> human tonsillar mononuclear cells <END> with <START:ggp> interleukin-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) and <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) rapidly induced the activation of distinct <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> with different mobilities , both of which bind the <START:ggp> IL-4 response element <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4RE <END> ) of <START:ggp> CD23b promoter <END> as examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) . 
Co-treatment of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> induced , in addition to the two distinct complexes , a new complex with an intermediate mobility . 
The <START:ggp> IL-4-induced complex <END> reacted with <START:ggp> anti-STAT ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) 6 <END> , resulting in a supershift whereas the formation of the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma-induced complex <END> was inhibited by <START:ggp> anti-STAT 1 <END> . 
The intermediate complex appeared to react with both <START:ggp> anti-STAT 6 <END> and <START:ggp> anti-STAT 1 <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> alone did not induce <START:ana> CD23 mRNA <END> transcription , Northern blot analysis revealed a transient up-regulation of the <START:ana> IL-4-induced CD23 mRNA <END> by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> within 2 h of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> treatment in these <START:ana> tonsillar cells <END> . 
The results suggest that the <START:ggp> IL-4RE <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-4-inducible gene <END> can accommodate both <START:ggp> IL-4- and IFN-gamma-activated factors <END> , such as <START:ggp> STAT 6 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT 1 <END> , either in <START:ggp> homodimeric or heterodimeric forms <END> and the binding of these different proteins to the respective promoter may play a potential regulatory role in the <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -inducible gene expression . 
A <START:ggp> p56lck <END> -independent pathway of <START:ggp> CD2 <END> signaling involves <START:ggp> Jun kinase <END> . 
The <START:ggp> p56 Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase <END> has been shown to be critical for T lymphocyte differentiation and activation . 
Hence in the absence of <START:ggp> p56 <END> , <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> triggered activation does not occur . 
We now provide evidence for a <START:ggp> CD2 <END> -based signaling pathway which , in contrast to that of the <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> , is independent of <START:ggp> p56 <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD2 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> production occurs via activation of <START:ggp> Jun kinase <END> in cell lines lacking <START:ggp> p56 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Jun kinase <END> then facilitates the binding of <START:ggp> c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers <END> to the <START:ggp> AP-1 consensus site <END> and the subsequent transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 promoter <END> . 
These data elucidate differences between <START:ggp> TCR <END> and <START:ggp> CD2 <END> signaling pathways in the same <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> E2F <END> -mediated transcription by <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax protein <END> in a <START:ana> p16 ( INK4A ) -negative T-cell line <END> . 
The human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is a causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia . 
Although the exact mechanism by which HTLV-I contributes to leukemogenesis is still unclear , the <START:ggp> Tax protein <END> is thought to play a major role in this process . 
This 40-kDa polypeptide is able to interact with the <START:ggp> tumor suppressor <END> <START:ggp> p16 ( INK4A ) <END> . 
Consequently , <START:ggp> Tax <END> can activate the signaling pathway that lead to the release of <START:ggp> E2F <END> that in turn induces expression of factors required for cell cycle progression . 
In this paper , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> Tax <END> can also activate <START:ggp> E2F <END> -mediated transcription independently of <START:ggp> p16 ( INK4A ) <END> . 
Indeed , when <START:ggp> Tax <END> is coexpressed with the <START:ggp> E2F-1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> in <START:ana> CEM T-cells <END> , which lack expression of <START:ggp> p16 ( INK4A ) <END> , it strongly potentiates the <START:ggp> E2F <END> -dependent activation of a reporter construct driven by a promoter containing <START:ggp> E2F binding sites <END> . 
This stimulation is abrogated by mutations affecting the <START:ggp> E2F-binding sites <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> Tax <END> also stimulates the transcription of the <START:ggp> E2F-1 gene <END> itself . 
Using <START:ggp> Tax <END> mutants that fail to activate either <START:ggp> ATF <END> -or <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-dependent promoters <END> and different <START:ggp> 5 ' truncation mutants <END> of the <START:ggp> E2F-1 promoter <END> , we show that the <START:ggp> Tax <END> -dependent transcriptional control of the <START:ggp> E2F1 gene <END> involves , at least in part , the <START:ggp> ATF binding site <END> located in the <START:ggp> E2F-1 promoter <END> . 
Inducible nitric oxide : an autoregulatory feedback inhibitor of vascular inflammation . 
Inducible nitric oxide ( iNO ) is produced at sites of vascular inflammation by resident and nonresident <START:ana> vascular wall cells <END> , but its role in the inflammatory process is not known . 
In this study , we show that a novel function of iNO is to terminate inflammatory processes . 
We find that iNO produced by <START:ana> murine macrophage-like cells <END> , <START:ana> RAW264.7 <END> , can inhibit <START:ggp> cytokine <END> -induced endothelial cell activation in a separated and mixed <START:ana> endothelial-RAW264.7 coculture system <END> . 
Both iNO production and endothelial <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> expression were induced simultaneously with bacterial LPS and <START:ggp> murine-specific IFN-gamma <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> iNO synthase <END> ( <START:ggp> iNOS <END> ) activity with N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine in <START:ana> endothelial-RAW264.7 cocultures <END> , stimulated with <START:ggp> murine-specific IFN-gamma <END> and LPS , decreased iNO production by 86 % , augmented <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> iNOS <END> expression in endothelial and <START:ana> RAW264.7 cells <END> , respectively , and increased monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cell surface . 
Transient transfection studies using various <START:ggp> VCAM-1 promoter <END> constructs demonstrated that inhibitory effects of iNO on <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> gene transcription were mediated , in part , by inhibitory effects of iNO on <START:ggp> kappa B cis-acting elements <END> . 
Immunofluorescence studies using an Ab to the <START:ggp> RelA ( p65 ) subunit <END> of nuclear <START:ggp> factor-kappa B <END> revealed that iNO inhibited the activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> . 
These studies indicate that iNO attenuates <START:ggp> iNOS <END> expression in <START:ana> macrophages <END> and inhibits monocyte adhesion to <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> , and suggest that endogenously derived iNO may be an important autoregulatory inhibitor of vascular inflammation 
Detection of <START:ggp> oestrogen receptor variants <END> in endometrium , myometrium , leiomyoma and <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> : comparison to variants present in breast cancer . 
Oestradiol has mitogenic and regulatory effects on various organs and cells , mediated mainly by its <START:ggp> nuclear receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) . 
The presence of aberrant <START:ggp> ER <END> forms in Oestrogen-dependent tumours has been discussed in correlation with tumour progression . 
<START:ggp> ER <END> variants , generated by alternative splicing , have been detected in human breast cancer , but also in normal mammary glands , therefore their role in tumorigenesis has been questioned . 
We have investigated , by the use of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification technique , the possible existence of <START:ggp> ER <END> variants in other normal oestrogen target organs and cells , such as uterus ( myometrium and endometrium ) , in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> and in a benign uterus tumour ( leiomyoma ) . 
We have detected variant <START:ggp> ER <END> in these samples and have compared the variant profile to that observed in breast cancer . 
All tissues and cells studied expressed both <START:ggp> wild-type ER <END> and <START:ggp> variant species <END> . 
Variant forms encompassed <START:ggp> ER <END> with deletions of <START:ggp> exons 2 , 5 and 7 <END> . 
Variants with <START:ggp> exon 5 <END> deleted were detected only in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> and in breast cancer . 
Variants with <START:ggp> exons 2 and 7 <END> deleted were present in all specimens tested . 
These results corroborate previous findings that the presence of <START:ggp> ER <END> variants is not a characteristic of breast cancer . 
The physiological significance and possible clinical relevance of the variant <START:ggp> ER <END> forms remain to be elucidated . 
<START:ggp> p21ras <END> initiates <START:ggp> Rac-1 <END> but not <START:ggp> phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase/PKB <END> , mediated signaling pathways in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> p21ras <END> is activated by the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) and then co-ordinates important signaling pathways for <START:ggp> T lymphocyte <END> activation . 
Effector pathways for this <START:ggp> guanine nucleotide binding protein <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> are mediated by the <START:ggp> serine/threonine kinase <END> <START:ggp> Raf-1 <END> and the <START:ggp> Ras-related GTPase <END> <START:ggp> Rac-1 <END> . 
In <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> , an important effector for the <START:ggp> Ras oncogene <END> is <START:ggp> Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PtdIns 3-kinase <END> ) . 
Activation of this <START:ggp> lipid kinase <END> is able to induce critical <START:ggp> Rac-1 <END> signaling pathways and can couple <START:ggp> p21ras <END> to cell survival mechanisms via the <START:ggp> serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB <END> . 
The role of <START:ggp> PtdIns 3-kinase <END> in <START:ggp> Ras <END> signaling in <START:ana> T cells <END> has not been explored . 
In the present study , we examined the ability of <START:ggp> PtdIns 3-kinase <END> to initiate the <START:ggp> Rac-1 <END> signaling pathways important for T cell activation . 
We also examined the possibility that <START:ggp> Akt/PKB <END> is regulated by Ras signaling pathways in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
The results show that <START:ggp> Ras <END> can initiate a <START:ggp> Rac-1 <END> mediated pathway that regulates the transcriptional function of <START:ggp> AP-1 complexes <END> . 
<START:ggp> PtdIns 3-kinase <END> signals can not mimic <START:ggp> p21ras <END> and induce the <START:ggp> Rac <END> mediated responses of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> transcriptional activation . 
Moreover , neither <START:ggp> TCR <END> or <START:ggp> Ras <END> activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> is dependent on <START:ggp> PtdIns 3-kinase <END> . 
<START:ggp> PKB <END> is activated in response to triggering of the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> ; <START:ggp> PtdIns 3-kinase <END> activity is both required and sufficient for this <START:ggp> TCR <END> response . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> p21ras <END> signals are unable to induce <START:ggp> Akt/PKB <END> activity in <START:ana> T cell <END> nor is <START:ggp> Ras <END> function required for <START:ggp> Akt/PKB <END> activation in response to the <START:ggp> TCR <END> . 
The present data thus highlight that <START:ggp> PtdIns 3-kinase <END> and <START:ggp> Akt/PKB <END> are not universal <START:ggp> Ras effector molecules <END> . 
<START:ggp> Ras <END> can initiate <START:ggp> Rac-1 <END> regulated signaling pathways in the context of <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> function independently of <START:ggp> PtdIns 3-kinase <END> activity . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin 1beta <END> mediates the modulatory effects of <START:ana> monocytes <END> on <START:ana> LNCaP human prostate cancer cells <END> . 
Proliferative and secretory responses in <START:ana> androgen-sensitive prostate cancer LNCaP cells <END> are regulated by steroid and peptide hormones and by differentiation-promoting substances . 
In the present study , we evaluated whether <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> that exhibit anti-tumour activity in haematopoietic and solid tumours influence growth and secretion in the <START:ana> LNCaP cell line <END> . 
For this purpose , <START:ana> LNCaP cells <END> were incubated with monocyte-conditioned medium ( MCM ) , and proliferation as well as expression of <START:ggp> androgen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> AR <END> ) and secretion of <START:ggp> prostate-specific antigen <END> ( <START:ggp> PSA <END> ) were assessed . 
Conditioned medium from <START:ana> monocytes <END> reduced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner . 
Incubation with 40 % MCM caused a 50 % reduction in cell proliferation . 
<START:ggp> AR protein <END> decreased by 70 % and <START:ggp> PSA <END> levels in supernatants from <START:ana> LNCaP cells <END> were reduced by approximately 80 % following treatment with MCM . 
We focused on the contribution of two major products of activated <START:ana> monocytes <END> , prostaglandin E2 and <START:ggp> interleukin 1beta <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> ) , to the MCM modulatory action . 
<START:ana> LNCaP cells <END> treated with prostaglandin E2 showed neither a reduction in proliferation nor a down-regulation of <START:ggp> AR <END> and <START:ggp> PSA <END> levels . 
The effects of MCM on cellular proliferation , <START:ggp> AR protein <END> and <START:ggp> PSA <END> secretion were abolished by pretreatment of MCM with a neutralizing <START:ggp> anti-IL-1beta antibody <END> . 
In addition , recombinant <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> was able to replace MCM for the inhibition of proliferation and down-regulation of <START:ggp> AR <END> and <START:ggp> PSA <END> proteins . 
<START:ana> LNCaP cells <END> were shown to express the <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> receptor type 1 , which transduces <START:ggp> IL-1beta <END> signal . 
Our findings reveal that <START:ggp> monocyte-derived IL-1beta <END> inhibits the proliferation of <START:ana> androgen-responsive prostate tumour cells <END> and reduces <START:ggp> AR <END> and <START:ggp> PSA <END> levels . 
Differential responsiveness of the <START:ggp> IL-5 and IL-4 genes <END> to <START:ggp> transcription factor GATA-3 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> cytokines <END> <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> are often coordinately produced by <START:ana> Th2 cells <END> as in asthma . 
However , it is unclear whether similar molecular mechanisms underlie transcription of the two <START:ggp> genes <END> . 
We have previously shown that the <START:ggp> transcription factor GATA-3 <END> is expressed in <START:ana> Th2 but not Th1 cells <END> and is crucial for activation of the <START:ggp> IL-5 promoter <END> by different stimuli . 
In a different study , <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> was shown to be sufficient for the expression of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and other <START:ggp> Th2 cytokine genes <END> . 
Here , we show that ectopic expression of <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> is sufficient to drive <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> but not <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> gene expression . 
Also , in <START:ana> Th2 cells <END> , antisense <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> RNA inhibits <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> but not <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> promoter activation . 
The induction of <START:ggp> IL-5 gene <END> expression by <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> involves high affinity binding of <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> to an inverted <START:ggp> GATA repeat <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-5 promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> interleukin 2 receptor alpha chain/CD25 promoter <END> is a target for <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> . 
The expression of the <START:ggp> murine interleukin ( IL ) -2 receptor alpha chain/CD25 <END> is strongly induced at the transcriptional level after T cell activation . 
We show here that <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NF-AT ) factors <END> are involved in the control of <START:ggp> CD25 promoter <END> induction in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> and <START:ggp> NF-ATc <END> bind to two sites around <START:ggp> positions -585 and -650 <END> located upstream of the <START:ggp> proximal CD25 promoter <END> . 
Immediately 3 ' from these <START:ggp> NF-AT motifs <END> , <START:ggp> nonconsensus sites <END> are located for the binding of <START:ggp> AP-1-like factors <END> . 
Mutations of sites that suppress <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> binding impair the induction and strong <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> -mediated transactivation of the <START:ggp> CD25 promoter <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
In <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> from <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> -deficient mice , the expression of <START:ggp> CD25 <END> is severely impaired , leading to a delayed <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor <END> expression after T cell receptor ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) / <START:ggp> CD3 <END> stimulation . 
Our data indicate an important role for <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> in the faithful expression of <START:ggp> high affinity IL-2 receptors <END> and a close link between the <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated induction of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor alpha chain promoters <END> , both of which are regulated by <START:ggp> NF-AT factors <END> . 
A novel mutation in the coding sequence of the <START:ggp> FY*B allele <END> of the <START:ggp> Duffy chemokine receptor gene <END> is associated with an altered erythrocyte phenotype . 
The Duffy blood group system is of clinical and biological significance . 
<START:ggp> Antibodies <END> to <START:ggp> Duffy antigens <END> are responsible for some cases of transfusion incompatibility and newborn hemolytic disease . 
The <START:ggp> Duffy protein <END> is a receptor for the <START:ggp> Plasmodium vivax erythrocyte-binding protein <END> and is also a receptor for various <START:ggp> chemokines <END> ( thus renamed <START:ggp> Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines <END> [ <START:ggp> DARC <END> ] ) . 
The two <START:ggp> Duffy polymorphic antigens <END> , <START:ggp> Fya <END> and <START:ggp> Fyb <END> ( coded by the <START:ggp> FY*A and FY*B alleles <END> ) , are present on <START:ggp> erythrocyte membranes <END> . 
The Fy ( a-b- ) phenotype is the predominant one in populations of black people and also occurs in other populations , including some non-Ashkenazi Jewish groups . 
The Fy ( a-b- ) phenotype has been associated with a mutation in the <START:ggp> FY*B promoter <END> at the <START:ggp> GATA box <END> that abolishes the expression of <START:ggp> erythrocyte Duffy protein <END> . 
We describe here a novel mutation , present in the <START:ggp> FY*B coding sequence <END> ( 271C -- > T ) , that is associated with some Fy ( b- ) phenotypes among non-Ashkenazi Jews and among Brazilian blacks . 
The mutation is present in Fy ( b- ) individuals , who have <START:ggp> wild-type FY*B GATA <END> and carry the previously described 304G -- > A substitution . 
The 271C -- > T and 304G -- > A can be identified by <START:ggp> restriction enzyme-generated restriction fragment length polymorphisms <END> . 
The 271C -- > T substitution represents a considerable change in chemical nature ( Arg91 -- > Cys ) , one which may affect the antigenic determinants of <START:ggp> DARC <END> , and thus be of clinical significance . 
The mutation may have implications for some physiological roles of <START:ggp> DARC <END> and be of interest in malaria research and in studies of population genetics . 
Establishment and characterization of <START:ana> EBV-positive and EBV-negative primary effusion lymphoma cell lines <END> harbouring human herpesvirus type-8 . 
In this study we report on the establishment and characterization of two novel <START:ana> lymphoma cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> CRO-AP/3 <END> and <START:ana> CRO-AP/5 <END> ) which carry infection by human herpesvirus type-8 ( HHV-8 ) and have derived from AIDS-related primary effusion lymphoma ( <START:ana> PEL <END> ) . 
These two <START:ana> cell lines <END> are representative of different virologic subtypes of <START:ana> PEL <END> , i.e . <START:ana> HHV-8+/EBV- PEL <END> in the case of <START:ana> CRO-AP/3 and HHV-8+/EBV+ PEL <END> in the case of <START:ana> CRO-AP/5 <END> . 
Consistent with the diagnosis of <START:ana> PEL <END> , both <START:ana> CRO-AP/3 <END> and <START:ana> CRO-AP/5 <END> expressed indeterminate ( i.e. non-B , non-T ) phenotypes although immunogenotypic studies documented their <START:ana> B-cell origin <END> . 
Both <START:ana> cell lines <END> are devoid of genetic lesions of <START:ggp> c-MYC <END> , <START:ggp> BCL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> p53 <END> as well as gross rearrangements of <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> . 
Detailed histogenetic characterization of these novel <START:ana> PEL cell lines <END> suggests that <START:ana> PEL <END> may derive from a <START:ana> post-germinal centre B cell <END> which has undergone pre-terminal differentiation . 
The <START:ana> CRO-AP/3 <END> and <START:ana> CRO-AP/5 cell lines <END> may provide a valuable model for clarifying the pathogenesis of <START:ana> PEL <END> . 
In particular , these <START:ana> cell lines <END> may help understand the relative contribution of HHV-8 and EBV to PEL growth and development and may facilitate the identification of recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities highlighting putative novel cancer related loci relevant to <START:ana> PEL <END> . 
Two-site interaction of <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> with activated <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factors <END> belonging to the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family <END> regulate the expression of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> and other inducible genes during the immune response . 
The functions of <START:ggp> NFAT proteins <END> are directly controlled by the <START:ggp> calcium- and calmodulin- dependent phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
Here we show that the binding of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> to <START:ggp> NFAT <END> is substantially increased when <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> is activated with <START:ggp> calmodulin <END> and calcium . 
FK506.FKBP12 drug-immunophilin complexes inhibited the interaction of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> with activated <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> much more effectively than they inhibited the interaction with inactive <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , suggesting that part of the interaction with activated <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> involved the <START:ggp> enzyme active site <END> . 
We have previously shown that <START:ggp> NFAT <END> is targeted to inactive <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> at a region distinct from the <START:ggp> calcineurin active site <END> ( Aramburu , J. , Garcia-Cozar , F. J. , Raghavan , A. , Okamura , H. , Rao , A. , and Hogan , P. G. ( 1998 ) Mol. Cell 1 , 627-637 ) ; this region is also involved in <START:ggp> NFAT <END> binding to activated <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , since binding is inhibited by an NFAT peptide spanning the <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> docking site on <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
The interacting surfaces are located on the <START:ggp> catalytic domain <END> of the <START:ggp> calcineurin A chain <END> and on an <START:ggp> 86-amino acid fragment <END> of the <START:ggp> NFAT regulatory domain <END> . 
<START:ggp> NFAT <END> binding to the <START:ggp> calcineurin catalytic domain <END> was inhibited by the <START:ggp> calcineurin autoinhibitory domain <END> and the RII substrate peptide , which bind in the <START:ggp> calcineurin active site <END> , as well as by the <START:ggp> NFAT <END> docking site peptide , which binds to a region of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> distinct from the <START:ggp> active site <END> . 
We propose that , in <START:ana> resting cells <END> , <START:ggp> NFAT <END> is targeted to a region of the <START:ggp> calcineurin catalytic domain <END> that does not overlap the <START:ggp> calcineurin active site <END> . 
Upon cell activation , displacement of the <START:ggp> autoinhibitory domain <END> by <START:ggp> calmodulin <END> binding allows <START:ggp> NFAT <END> to bind additionally to the <START:ggp> calcineurin active site <END> , thus positioning <START:ggp> NFAT <END> for immediate dephosphorylation at functional phosphoserine residues . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor-kappaB <END> induction in <START:ana> CD45RO+ and CD45RA+ T cell subsets <END> during aging . 
An increase in the ratio of <START:ana> memory to naive T cells <END> has been postulated to underlie immune hyporesponsiveness accompanying aging . 
Our analyses of the induction of <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> ) in activated <START:ana> memory ( CD45RO+ ) and naive ( CD45RA+ ) T cell subsets <END> from young and elderly donors has demonstrated that , regardless of donor age , <START:ana> memory T cells <END> are not significantly altered in their responsiveness to <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -mediated induction of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> . 
Although treatment with <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> induced nuclear localization of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> in both <START:ana> memory and naive T cell subsets <END> , irrespective of the age of the donor , the levels of induced <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> were significantly lower in both subsets of <START:ana> T cells <END> obtained from the elderly , when compared to those in young . 
Examination of <START:ggp> IkappaB alpha <END> regulation revealed that <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -mediated degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaB alpha <END> in both <START:ana> memory and naive T cells <END> from the elderly was severely impaired , thus contributing to the lowered induction of the observed <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> . 
In addition , this age-related decrease in induction of <START:ggp> nuclear NFkappaB <END> correlated with decrease in intracellular <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> receptor expression and <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> -induced proliferation of both <START:ana> memory and naive T cells subsets <END> . 
Taken together , our results suggest that the age-related hyporesponsiveness can not be attributed to a skewing of the T cell population towards a memory phenotype in the elderly . 
Cyclosporin A-resistant transactivation of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> requires activity of <START:ggp> okadaic acid-sensitive serine/threonine phosphatases <END> . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> requires activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> through stimulation of the <START:ggp> TCR <END> and costimulation through <START:ggp> accessory receptors <END> . 
We have found recently that <START:ggp> okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases <END> are involved in a cyclosporin A-insensitive pathway that selectively transmits costimulatory signals . 
In this study , we analyzed whether activities of these phosphatases are necessary for the expression of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> . 
In both <START:ana> activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> activated tumorigenic T cell lines <END> , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> gene expression was blocked at the transcriptional level by okadaic acid . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> active at the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> were differentially influenced : upon down-modulation of <START:ggp> okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases <END> , transactivation by octamer , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , and <START:ggp> NF of activated T cells proteins <END> was abrogated , while transactivation by <START:ggp> AP-1 proteins was even enhanced . <END> 
YM268 increases the glucose uptake , cell differentiation , and mRNA expression of <START:ggp> glucose transporter <END> in <START:ana> 3T3-L1 adipocytes <END> . 
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of bis [ 4- [ 2 , 4-dioxo-5-thiazolidinyl ) methyl ] phenyl ] methane ( YM-268 ) , a thiazolidinedione derivative , on glucose uptake , <START:ana> adipocyte <END> differentiation through <START:ggp> peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> ) , and <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> ) activity in <START:ana> cultured cells <END> . 
YM268 and pioglitazone dose-dependently increased the 2-deoxyglucose uptake in <START:ana> 3T3-L1 cells <END> . 
YM268 facilitated the insulin-stimulated triglyceride accumulation in <START:ana> 3T3-L1 adipocytes <END> and increased the mRNA expression of <START:ggp> fatty acid-binding protein <END> . 
YM268 , with and without insulin , increased the mRNA expression of <START:ggp> glucose transporter <END> isoforms such as <START:ggp> GLUT1 <END> and <START:ggp> GLUT4 <END> , indicating enhancement of <START:ana> adipocyte <END> differentiation . 
Additionally , YM268 and pioglitazone showed activity of the <START:ggp> PPARgamma ligand <END> , a member of the <START:ggp> nuclear receptor superfamily <END> responsible for adipogenesis . 
To examine the possible involvement of the increased activity of <START:ggp> PI 3-kinase <END> in YM268-stimulated glucose uptake , the enzyme activity was estimated by measuring the phosphatidylinositol-3 , 4 , 5-trisphosphate ( PI-3 , 4 , 5-P3 ) concentration in <START:ana> human monocytic cells <END> . 
Insulin dose-dependently increased the PI-3 , 4 , 5-P3 production but YM268 had no significant effect on the insulin-dependent and -independent PI 3-kinase activation . 
These results indicate that the mechanism by which YM268 increased glucose uptake , may be accounted for in part by the enhancement of <START:ggp> GLUT1 <END> and <START:ggp> GLUT4 <END> expression through <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> activation . 
The <START:ggp> nuclear receptor <END> <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> - bigger than fat . 
Work reported over the past year has provided insights into the mechanisms whereby ligand activation of the <START:ggp> nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> ) regulates systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis . 
<START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> has also been implicated recently in the biology of monocytes and in cell-cycle regulation and cancer . 
Polyunsaturated fatty acids and eicosanoids bind and activate <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> , suggesting that these lipids may serve as hormonal regulators of a variety of biological processes . 
The role of caspases in T cell development and the control of immune responses . 
Apoptosis is responsible for the removal of potentially autoreactive or useless T cells during thymic selection and <START:ana> activated T cells <END> in the periphery . 
Specific families of <START:ggp> receptors <END> , <START:ggp> kinases <END> , <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , and <START:ggp> cysteine proteases <END> , <START:ggp> termed caspases <END> , are involved in the apoptotic cascade leading to proteolysis of specific substrates and to morphological changes associated with programmed cell death . 
Although common members of the apoptotic cascade are shared between different cell types , it appears that <START:ggp> cell-specific factors <END> can influence the response to a given apoptotic stimuli . 
Characterization and understanding of the basic mechanisms involved in the different pathways protecting or leading to cell death may provide novel ways to control inappropriate apoptosis involved in several diseases . 
Cross-priming of CTL responses in vivo does not require antigenic peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum of <START:ana> immunizing cells <END> . 
It has been proposed that the cross-priming of CTL responses in vivo involves the transfer to host <START:ana> APCs <END> of <START:ggp> heat shock protein glycoprotein 96 <END> -chaperoned antigenic peptides released from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) of <START:ana> dying or infected cells <END> . 
We have tested this possibility directly using <START:ana> TAP-deficient cell lines <END> lacking antigenic ER peptides derived from two model <START:ggp> Ags <END> , the <START:ggp> human adenovirus type 5 early regions E1A and E1B <END> . 
Although both proteins were well expressed , the cells were not recognized by <START:ana> E1A- or E1B-specific CTLs <END> unless the relevant epitope was either provided exogenously as a synthetic peptide or targeted to the ER in a TAP-independent fashion . 
Despite the absence of these ER peptides , the <START:ana> TAP1-/- cells <END> were able to efficiently <START:ana> cross-prime E1A- and E1B-specific CTLs <END> following immunization of syngeneic mice . 
These results indicate that , although purified <START:ggp> peptide/glycoprotein 96 complexes <END> are potent immunogens , the mechanism of CTL cross-priming in vivo does not depend upon antigenic peptides in the ER of <START:ana> immunizing cells <END> . 
A critical role of the <START:ggp> p75 tumor necrosis factor receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> p75TNF-R <END> ) in organ inflammation independent of <START:ggp> TNF <END> , <START:ggp> lymphotoxin alpha <END> , or the <START:ggp> p55TNF-R . <END> 
Despite overwhelming evidence that enhanced production of the <START:ggp> p75 tumor necrosis factor receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> p75TNF-R <END> ) accompanies development of specific human inflammatory pathologies such as multi-organ failure during sepsis , inflammatory liver disease , pancreatitis , respiratory distress syndrome , or AIDS , the function of this receptor remains poorly defined in vivo . 
We show here that at levels relevant to human disease , production of the <START:ggp> human p75TNF-R <END> in transgenic mice results in a severe inflammatory syndrome involving mainly the pancreas , liver , kidney , and lung , and characterized by constitutively increased <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity in the <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cell <END> compartment . 
This process is shown to evolve independently of the presence of <START:ggp> TNF <END> , <START:ggp> lymphotoxin alpha <END> , or the <START:ggp> p55TNF-R <END> , although coexpression of a <START:ggp> human TNF transgene <END> accelerated pathology . 
These results establish an independent role for enhanced <START:ggp> p75TNF-R <END> production in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease and implicate the direct involvement of this receptor in a wide range of human inflammatory pathologies . 
Expression status of <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> and <START:ggp> syndecan-1 <END> identifies distinct histogenetic subtypes of Hodgkin 's disease . 
The <START:ana> tumor cells <END> in most cases of Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) have been recently recognized to originate from the <START:ana> B-cell lineage <END> , but their precise differentiation stage is not fully clarified . 
Recently , we have reported that the histogenesis of <START:ana> B-cell lymphomas <END> may be assessed by monitoring the expression pattern of <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> expressed in <START:ana> germinal center ( GC ) B cells <END> , and <START:ggp> CD138/syndecan-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> syn-1 <END> ) , a proteoglycan associated with post-GC , terminal B-cell differentiation . 
In this study , we have applied these two markers to the study of HD histogenesis . 
We have found that in nodular lymphocyte predominance HD ( NLPHD ) <START:ana> tumor cells <END> consistently display the <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> ( + ) / <START:ggp> syn-1 <END> ( - ) phenotype , indicating their derivation from <START:ana> GC B cells <END> . 
Conversely , classic HD ( CHD ) is heterogeneous because the <START:ana> tumor cells <END> of a fraction of CHD display the <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> ( - ) / <START:ggp> syn-1 <END> ( + ) phenotype of post-GC B-cells , whereas another fraction of CHD is constituted by a mixture of <START:ana> tumor cells <END> reflecting the GC ( <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> ( + ) / <START:ggp> syn-1 <END> ( - ) ) or post-GC ( <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> ( - ) / <START:ggp> syn-1 <END> ( + ) ) phenotypes . 
<START:ana> BCL-6 ( - ) /syn-1 ( + ) tumor cells <END> of CHD are mostly found surrounded by <START:ana> T cells <END> expressing <START:ggp> CD40L <END> , consistent with the observation that <START:ggp> CD40 <END> signaling downregulates <START:ggp> BCL-6 <END> expression . 
These data indicate that <START:ana> tumor cells <END> of NLPHD uniformly display a GC B-cell phenotype , whereas the phenotype of <START:ana> tumor cells <END> of CHD appears to be modulated by the surrounding cellular background , particularly <START:ana> CD40L+ reactive T cells <END> . 
Molecular and cellular analysis of human immunodeficiency virus-induced apoptosis in <START:ggp> lymphoblastoid T-cell-line-expressing wild-type and mutated CD4 receptors <END> . 
We have previously shown that the presence of the <START:ggp> CD4 cytoplasmic tail <END> is critical for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -induced apoptosis ( J.Corbeil , M.Tremblay , and D.D.Richman , J.Exp.Med.183 : 39-48 , 1996 ) . 
We have pursued our investigation of the role of the <START:ggp> CD4 <END> transduction pathway in HIV-induced apoptosis . 
To do this , wild-type and mutant forms of the <START:ggp> CD4 cytoplasmic tail <END> were stably expressed in the <START:ana> lymphoblastoid T-cell line <END> <START:ana> A2.01 <END> . 
Apoptosis was prevented when <START:ggp> CD4 <END> truncated at residue 402 was expressed ; however , cells expressing mutated receptors that do not associate with <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> ( mutated at the <START:ggp> dicysteine motif <END> and truncated at residue 418 ) but which conserved proximal domains of the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic tail <END> underwent apoptosis like <START:ggp> wild- type CD4 <END> . 
The differences between <START:ggp> wild-type and mutated receptors <END> in the induction of apoptosis were not related to levels of <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> or <START:ggp> NF- kappaB <END> activation . 
Initial signaling through the <START:ggp> CD4 receptor <END> played a major role in the sensitization of <START:ana> HIV-infected T cells <END> to undergo apoptosis . 
Incubation of <START:ana> HIV-infected cells <END> with <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) 13B8-2 <END> , which binds to <START:ggp> CD4 <END> in a region critical for dimerization of the receptor , prevented apoptosis without inhibiting HIV replication . 
Moreover , the apoptotic process was not related to <START:ggp> Fas <END> <START:ggp> -Fas ligand <END> interaction ; however , an antagonistic anti-Fas MAb ( ZB-4 ) enhanced apoptosis in <START:ana> HIV-infected cells <END> without inducing apoptosis in <START:ana> uninfected cells <END> . 
These observations demonstrate that <START:ggp> CD4 <END> signaling mediates HIV-induced apoptosis by a mechanism independent of <START:ggp> Fas <END> <START:ggp> -Fas ligand <END> interaction , does not require <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> signaling , and may involve a critical region for <START:ggp> CD4 <END> dimerization . 
<START:ggp> p130 <END> , <START:ggp> p107 <END> , and <START:ggp> pRb <END> are differentially regulated in <START:ana> proliferating cells <END> and during cell cycle arrest by <START:ggp> alpha-interferon <END> . 
We have determined how the phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> retinoblastoma family <END> ( <START:ggp> pRb <END> , <START:ggp> p107 <END> , and <START:ggp> p130 <END> ) is governed in individual cell cycle phases of <START:ana> Daudi B-cells <END> during cell cycle exit triggered by <START:ggp> alpha-interferon <END> ( <START:ggp> alpha-IFN <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> alpha-IFN <END> causes dephosphorylation of <START:ggp> pRb <END> and loss of <START:ggp> p130 phosphorylated Form 3 <END> . 
However , the change in <START:ggp> p130 <END> phosphorylation in response to <START:ggp> alpha-IFN <END> occurs before dephosphorylation of <START:ggp> pRb <END> is complete because loss of <START:ggp> p130 Form 3 <END> occurs throughout the cell cycle prior to complete arrest in G1 , whereas <START:ggp> pRb <END> is dephosphorylated only in G1 . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> p107 <END> is dephosphorylated and is then depleted from cells as they exit the cell cycle . 
<START:ggp> p130 <END> , predominantly in Form 1 , and <START:ggp> hypophosphorylated pRb <END> bind an <START:ggp> E2F DNA binding site <END> ; <START:ggp> p130 <END> complexes <START:ggp> E2F-4 <END> , whereas <START:ggp> pRb <END> binds both E2F-4 and <START:ggp> E2F-1 <END> . 
The phosphorylated forms of <START:ggp> E2F-4 <END> that bind to the <START:ggp> E2F DNA site <END> are different from hyperphosphorylated <START:ggp> E2F-4 <END> , which predominates in <START:ana> primary hemopoietic cells <END> in G0 . 
We conclude that although cell cycle arrest induced by <START:ggp> alpha-IFN <END> may be mediated in part by formation of a complex containing <START:ggp> p130 <END> and <START:ggp> E2F-4 <END> , <START:ggp> alpha-IFN <END> does not induce hyperphosphorylation of <START:ggp> E2F-4 <END> , which characterizes <START:ana> primary hemopoietic cells <END> in G0 . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> c-myb <END> and <START:ggp> C/EBP alpha <END> regulate the <START:ggp> monocytic/myeloic gene <END> <START:ggp> MRP14 <END> . 
The entry of microorganisms into the body induces inflammatory processes . 
During this process a sequence of cellular , humoral , non-specific and specific actions are evoked to combat the infection . 
<START:ana> Macrophages <END> and <START:ana> granulocytes <END> , which are developed from a common progenitor cell , are the cellular components of the specific and non-specific immunoreaction . 
<START:ggp> MRP14 <END> ( <START:ggp> Macrophage migration inhibitory related protein <END> ) and <START:ggp> MRP8 <END> , two <START:ggp> S-100 proteins <END> contained in high concentrations in these cells are obviously essential for adhesion and migration of <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> granulocytes <END> . 
To investigate the transcriptional regulation of these genes we cotransfected constructs expressing <START:ggp> CAT <END> under control of the <START:ggp> MRP14 promoter <END> and expression constructs of <START:ggp> C/EBP alpha <END> and <START:ggp> v-myb <END> , two <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> involved in myeloid/monocytic differentiation . 
Transfection with <START:ggp> C/EBP alpha <END> revealed a massive enhancement of the <START:ggp> MRP14 promoter <END> in both , <START:ana> HL 60 cells <END> ( granulocytic differentiated ) and <START:ana> L132 fibroblasts <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> v-myb <END> reduces <START:ggp> MRP14 promoter <END> activity . 
Northern blot analysis of <START:ana> L132 cells <END> transfected with the <START:ggp> C/EBP alpha <END> expression vector demonstrate that <START:ggp> C/EBP alpha <END> is sufficient to enhance <START:ggp> MRP14 <END> expression in the context of the whole genome . 
A <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -associated signaling pathway leading to <START:ggp> cytokine gene <END> transcription and T cell proliferation without <START:ggp> TCR <END> engagement . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> resting human T cells <END> with the <START:ggp> CD28-specific mAb BW 828 <END> induces proliferation and <START:ggp> cytokine <END> synthesis without further requirement for <START:ggp> TCR <END> coengagement . 
This observation prompted us to postulate that signal 2 ( costimulatory signal ) alone without signal 1 ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> signal ) can activate <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
To test whether this putative function of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> is mediated via a particular signaling pathway , we compared early signaling events initiated in resting <START:ana> T cells <END> by the <START:ggp> stimulatory mAb BW 828 <END> with signals triggered by the <START:ggp> nonstimulating CD28 mAb 9.3 <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> T cells <END> with <START:ggp> BW 828 <END> induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ , but did not lead to detectable activation of the <START:ggp> protein kinases <END> <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> and <START:ggp> c-Raf-1 <END> . 
This pathway resulted in the induction of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , and proteins binding to the <START:ggp> CD28 <END> response element of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> . 
On the other hand , stimulation of <START:ana> T cells <END> with <START:ggp> mAb 9.3 <END> increased the level of intracellular Ca2+ and triggered the activation of <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> and <START:ggp> c-Raf-1 <END> , but was unable to induce the binding of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> to the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> . 
In contrast to the differential signaling of <START:ggp> BW 828 <END> and <START:ggp> 9.3 <END> in resting T cells , the two mAbs exhibited a similar pattern of early signaling events in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> and <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> ( <START:ggp> p56 ( lck ) <END> activation , association of <START:ggp> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <END> with <START:ggp> CD28 <END> ) , indicating that the signaling capacity of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> changes with activation . 
These data support the view that stimulation through <START:ggp> CD28 <END> can induce some effector functions in <START:ana> T cells <END> and suggest that this capacity is associated with a particular pattern of early signaling events 
Decreased <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> production and Th1 cell development by acetyl salicylic acid-mediated inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-12 <END> is a <START:ggp> 75-kDa heterodimeric cytokine <END> composed of two covalently linked <START:ggp> p35 and p40 chains <END> . 
This <START:ggp> pro-inflammatory cytokine <END> plays a prominent role in the development of Th1 cell-mediated immune responses . 
Th1 cell-mediated immune responses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases . 
Thus , <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> appears to be a critical factor in the generation and maintenance of chronic inflammatory conditions . 
In this study , we investigated the effects of a commonly prescribed anti-inflammatory drug , acetyl salicylic acid ( ASA ) , on <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> production and Th1 cell development . 
ASA was found to inhibit secretion of the <START:ggp> IL-12 heterodimer <END> as well as <START:ggp> p40 monomer <END> by <START:ana> human monocytic cells <END> . 
This was associated with the down-regulation of <START:ana> IL-12p40 mRNA <END> expression . 
Analysis of the regulation of the <START:ggp> p40 gene promoter <END> revealed that ASA inhibited <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation and binding to the <START:ggp> p40-kappaB site <END> in the <START:ggp> p40 promoter <END> , leading to transcriptional repression of the <START:ggp> p40 gene <END> . 
Addition of ASA to an in vitro T helper cell differentiation system , at concentrations compatible with plasma levels reached during anti-inflammatory therapy , resulted in reduced development of <START:ana> Th1 cells <END> . 
These results suggest that the inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation by ASA leads to down-regulation of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> production and inhibition of Th1 cell development . 
Attenuation of <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> expression by <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is related to intracellular sequestration of <START:ggp> immature class II heterodimers <END> . 
<START:ggp> MHC class II <END> expression was examined in <START:ana> macrophages <END> infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis . 
<START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> increased the surface expression of <START:ggp> class II molecules <END> in <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> and this was markedly reduced in cells infected with M. tuberculosis . 
Despite this effect , steady state levels of <START:ggp> HLA-DRalpha <END> , <START:ggp> HLA-DRbeta <END> , and <START:ggp> invariant ( Ii ) chains <END> were equivalent in <START:ana> control and infected cells <END> . 
Metabolic labeling combined with pulse-chase experiments and biochemical analysis showed that the majority of <START:ggp> class II molecules <END> in infected cells became resistant to <START:ggp> endoglycosidase H <END> , consistent with normal Golgi processing . 
However , results of intracellular staining and dual color confocal microscopy revealed a significant defect in transport of newly synthesized <START:ggp> class II molecules <END> through the endocytic compartment . 
Thus , compared with findings in control cells , <START:ggp> class II molecules <END> in <START:ana> infected cells <END> colocalized to a minimal extent with a <START:ggp> lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 <END> + endosomal compartment . 
In addition , in contrast to <START:ana> control cells <END> , <START:ggp> class II molecules <END> in <START:ana> infected cells <END> failed to colocalize with <START:ggp> endocytosed BSA <END> under conditions where this marker is known to label late endosomes , lysosomes , and the <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> compartment . 
Consistent with defective transport along the endocytic pathway , the maturation of <START:ggp> SDS-stable class II alphabeta dimers <END> -- dependent upon removal of <START:ggp> Ii chain <END> and peptide loading of <START:ggp> class II dimers <END> in the <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> compartment -- was markedly impaired in M. tuberculosis <START:ana> -infected cells <END> . 
These findings indicate that defective transport and processing of <START:ggp> class II molecules <END> through the endosomal/lysosomal system is responsible for diminished cell surface expression of <START:ggp> MHC class II molecules <END> in cells infected with M. tuberculosis . 
Identification of <START:ggp> upstream regulatory elements <END> that repress expression of <START:ggp> adult beta-like globin genes <END> in a primitive erythroid environment . 
Our investigations have focused on localizing <START:ggp> cis-elements <END> responsible for the down regulation of the <START:ggp> adult beta-like globin genes <END> ( <START:ggp> delta <END> and <START:ggp> beta <END> ) in immature , or primitive erythroid tissues . 
We studied their activity after transfection into <START:ana> K562 cells <END> , an <START:ana> erythroleukemia cell line <END> with an embryonic-fetal phenotype . 
Analyzed <START:ggp> DNA sequences <END> included <START:ggp> delta and beta 5 ' flanking regions <END> extending from approximately <START:ggp> -500 to +50bp <END> ( <START:ggp> promoter regions <END> ) , truncated delta and <START:ggp> beta 5 ' flanking regions <END> extending from approximately <START:ggp> -250 to +50 bp <END> , and <START:ggp> chimeric promoter constructions <END> , which consisted of a distal <START:ggp> delta or beta fragment <END> fused to a <START:ggp> proximal beta or delta sequence <END> . 
In <START:ggp> CAT reporter constructions <END> no appreciable level of <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity was supported by the <START:ggp> beta globin promoter <END> , and only low level activity by the <START:ggp> delta promoter <END> . 
Truncation of the <START:ggp> beta globin promoter <END> led to a 2-3 fold increase in promoter activity . 
In contrast , deletion of the <START:ggp> upstream portion <END> of the <START:ggp> delta promoter <END> led to a 10 fold decrease in expression . 
Coupling of the <START:ggp> upstream beta globin sequence <END> from approximately -500 to -250 bp to the truncated <START:ggp> delta promoter <END> fragment led to complete extinction of transcription activity , consistent with a negative regulatory effect of the <START:ggp> beta globin gene upstream element <END> ( s ) . 
Fusion of the <START:ggp> upstream portion <END> of the <START:ggp> delta promoter <END> to the truncated <START:ggp> beta globin promoter <END> yielded a modest increase in promoter strength relative to the <START:ggp> truncated beta gene promoter <END> , indicating the presence of a <START:ggp> positive transcriptional element <END> ( s ) in the <START:ggp> upstream delta globin regulatory region <END> . 
Site-directed mutagenesis of binding sites for the <START:ggp> repressor proteins BP1 and BP2 <END> in the <START:ggp> upstream portion <END> of the <START:ggp> beta globin gene flanking region <END> led to a 4-6 fold increase in promoter activity . 
<START:ggp> DNase I <END> footprinting of the <START:ggp> upstream delta-globin region <END> revealed <START:ggp> protected sequences <END> corresponding to <START:ggp> consensus binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and <START:ggp> BP2 <END> . 
These results confirm that sequences in the <START:ggp> upstream promoter region <END> of the <START:ggp> adult beta globin gene <END> contribute to its factor-mediated suppression early in development and then may modulate its expression at a later stage . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> signaling in patients with extrinsic asthma and hyperimmunoglobulin E . 
BACKGROUND : Recent data suggest that the regulation of class switching to <START:ggp> IgE <END> by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> is mediated by <START:ggp> STAT transcription factors <END> . 
The induction of <START:ggp> IgE <END> by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> occurs through the activation of the <START:ggp> intracellular signal-transducing protein Stat6 <END> , whereas the inhibition of <START:ggp> IgE <END> class switching by <START:ggp> interferon-y <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) occurs through the activation of <START:ggp> Statl <END> . 
OBJECTIVE : We hypothesized that in extrinsic asthma or in cases of markedly elevated <START:ggp> IgE <END> ( ie , hyperimmunoglobulin E [ HIE ] ) increased levels of <START:ggp> IgE <END> may be associated with alterations in the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> levels or the activation of <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> . 
METHODS : <START:ana> PBMCs <END> and sera from 8 patients with extrinsic asthma ( mean <START:ggp> IgE <END> , 285+/-100 IU/mL ) , 3 patients with HIE ( mean <START:ggp> IgE <END> , 7050+/-1122 IU/mL ) , and 14 nonatopic control subjects ( mean <START:ggp> IgE <END> , 112+/-28 IU/mL ) were analyzed . 
RESULTS : The mean <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> level detected by ELISA was much greater in patients with HIE than control subjects ( 88.6+/-11.5 pg/mL vs 11.5+/-7.1 pg/mL , P = .005 ) , and increased <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> levels among patients with both asthma and HIE correlated with the increased <START:ggp> IgE <END> levels . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> levels were not elevated . 
Levels of <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> protein present in <START:ana> PBMCs <END> did not differ in the patients and control subjects . 
Examination of <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> DNA-binding activity demonstrated no activation of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> signaling in patients with either HIE or acute asthma . 
Interestingly , evidence for the presence of <START:ana> B cells <END> that have already switched to <START:ggp> IgE <END> was seen in <START:ana> PBMCs <END> of several patients with asthma or HIE . 
CONCLUSION : These results indicate that ( 1 ) <START:ggp> IgE <END> production in asthma and HIE usually is associated with elevated levels of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , but not <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> , in the peripheral blood ; ( 2 ) the increased sera <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> levels in asthma and HIE are not sufficient to induce <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> activation in <START:ana> PBMCs <END> ; and ( 3 ) evidence of switch recombination to epsilon may be detected in isolated cases of elevated <START:ggp> IgE <END> . 
This implies that high levels of <START:ggp> IgE <END> in these patients either results from <START:ana> B cells <END> that have already undergone class switching , from Ig class switching that is localized to target tissues , or both . 
<START:ggp> Carboxyl-terminal 15-amino acid sequence <END> of <START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> is possibly created by tissue-specific splicing and is essential for transactivation activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NFAT <END> regulates transcription of a number of cytokine and other <START:ggp> immunoregulatory genes <END> . 
We have isolated <START:ggp> NFATx <END> , which is one of four members of the <START:ggp> NFAT family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> and is preferentially expressed in the thymus and <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocytes <END> , and an isoform of <START:ggp> NFATx <END> , <START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> . 
Here we provide evidence showing that 15 amino acids in the <START:ggp> carboxyl-terminal end <END> of <START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> are required for its maximum transactivation activity in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
A fusion between these 15 amino acids and the <START:ggp> GAL4 DNA binding domain <END> was capable of transactivating reporters driven by the <START:ggp> GAL4 DNA binding site <END> . 
Interestingly , this <START:ggp> 15-amino acid transactivation sequence <END> is well conserved in <START:ggp> NFAT family proteins <END> , although the sequences contiguous to the <START:ggp> carboxyl-terminal regions <END> of the <START:ggp> NFAT family <END> are much less conserved . 
We also report three additional isoforms of <START:ggp> NFATx <END> , designated <START:ggp> NFATx2 <END> , <START:ggp> NFATx3 <END> , and <START:ggp> NFATx4 <END> . 
This transactivation sequence is altered by tissue-specific alternative splicing in newly isolated <START:ggp> NFATx isoforms <END> , resulting in lower transactivation activity in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> is expressed predominantly in the thymus and <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocyte <END> , while the skeletal muscle expressed primarily <START:ggp> NFATx2 <END> . 
In <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , transcription from the <START:ggp> NFAT site <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> is activated strongly by <START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> but only weakly by <START:ggp> NFATx2 <END> . 
These data demonstrate that the <START:ggp> 15-amino acid sequence <END> of <START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> is a <START:ggp> major transactivation sequence <END> required for induction of genes by <START:ggp> NFATx1 <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> and possibly regulates <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activity through tissue-specific alternative splicing . 
<START:ggp> Altered DNA-binding specificity mutants <END> of <START:ggp> EKLF <END> and Sp1 show that <START:ggp> EKLF <END> is an activator of the <START:ggp> beta-globin locus control region <END> in vivo . 
The <START:ggp> locus control region <END> of the <START:ggp> beta-globin cluster <END> contains five <START:ggp> DNase I hypersensitive sites <END> ( <START:ggp> 5'HS1-5 <END> ) required for locus activation . 
<START:ggp> 5'HS3 <END> contains six G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity . 
Members of a protein family , characterized by three <START:ggp> zinc fingers <END> highly homologous to those found in <START:ggp> transcription factor Sp1 <END> , interact with these motifs . 
Because point mutagenesis can not distinguish between family members , it is not known which protein activates <START:ggp> 5'HS3 <END> . 
We show that the function of such closely related proteins can be distinguished in vivo by matching point mutations in <START:ggp> 5'HS3 <END> with amino acid changes in the <START:ggp> zinc fingers <END> of <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> EKLF <END> . 
Testing their activity in transgenic mice shows that <START:ggp> EKLF <END> is a direct activator of <START:ggp> 5'HS3 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus Rta protein <END> activates <START:ggp> lytic cycle genes <END> and can disrupt latency in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
The transition of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) from latency into the lytic cycle is associated with the expression of two <START:ggp> immediate-early viral genes <END> , <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> and <START:ggp> BRLF1 <END> . 
Overexpression of ZEBRA , the product of <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> , is sufficient to disrupt latency in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> by stimulating expression of <START:ggp> lytic cycle genes <END> , including <START:ggp> BRLF1 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> BRLF1 product Rta <END> functions as a transcriptional activator in both <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> . 
However , <START:ggp> Rta <END> has recently been reported to disrupt latency in an epithelial specific manner ( S. Zalani , E. Holley-Guthrie , and S. Kenney , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 : 9194-9199 , 1996 ) . 
Here we demonstrate that expression of <START:ggp> Rta <END> is also sufficient for disruption of latency in a <START:ana> permissive B-cell line <END> . 
In <START:ana> HH514-16 cells <END> , transfection of <START:ggp> Rta <END> leads to synthesis of <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> , viral DNA replication , and late gene expression . 
However , <START:ggp> Rta <END> by itself is less potent than <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> in the ability to activate most early and late <START:ggp> lytic cycle genes <END> . 
In light of previous work implicating <START:ggp> ZEBRA <END> in the activation of <START:ggp> Rta <END> , we suggest a cooperative model for EBV entry into the lytic cycle . 
Expression of either <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> or <START:ggp> BRLF1 <END> triggers expression of the other <START:ggp> immediate-early factor <END> , and together these activators act individually or in synergy on <START:ggp> downstream targets <END> to activate the viral lytic cycle . 
Transcription of a <START:ggp> minimal promoter <END> from the <START:ggp> NF-IL6 gene <END> is regulated by <START:ggp> CREB/ATF <END> and <START:ggp> SP1 proteins <END> in <START:ana> U937 promonocytic cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> is an important transcriptional regulator of genes induced in <START:ana> activated monocytes/macrophages <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> is the only <START:ggp> CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ( C/EBP ) family <END> member whose steady-state mRNA levels increase upon activation of <START:ana> monocytes <END> ( 1 ) . 
We show that increased transcription of the <START:ggp> NF-IL6 gene <END> is responsible , at least in part , for induction of <START:ana> NF-IL6 mRNA <END> following activation of <START:ana> U937 promonocytic cells <END> . 
We have identified a <START:ggp> 104-bp minimal promoter region <END> of the <START:ggp> NF-IL6 gene <END> that is sufficient for basal and activation-dependent induction of transcription in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
This region contains binding sites for the <START:ggp> cAMP response element-binding protein/activation transcription factor <END> ( <START:ggp> CREB/ATF <END> ) and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> families of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Each site is functionally important and contributes independently to transcription of the <START:ggp> NF-IL6 gene <END> in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> CIITA <END> <START:ggp> B-cell-specific promoter <END> suppression in <START:ana> MHC class II-silenced cell hybrids <END> . 
In this study , various sets of <START:ana> somatic cell hybrids <END> , generated by the fusion of <START:ana> epithelial cell lines <END> with <START:ana> B-lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> , were analyzed for the expression of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II antigens <END> . 
We first demonstrate , in <START:ana> human and mouse intraspecies hybrids <END> , the coordinate suppression of <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> , <START:ggp> Ii <END> ( <START:ggp> invariant chain <END> ) and <START:ggp> HLA-DM gene <END> transcription , and the release of the silencing by the addition of <START:ggp> interferon gamma <END> . 
Using interspecies hybrids , the segregation of <START:ggp> human chromosomes <END> allowed us to establish that <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> extinction is linked to the presence in the hybrids of the <START:ggp> chromosomes <END> from the <START:ana> epithelial fusion partner <END> . 
Moreover , our data provide evidence that the expression pattern of <START:ana> MHC class II mRNA <END> is correlated with that of the <START:ggp> class II transactivator <END> ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) , suggesting that <START:ggp> CIITA <END> is the actual target of the silencing . 
To gain further insight into the suppression phenomenon we performed luciferase assays which show that silencing affects the activity of the <START:ggp> B-cell-specific promoter <END> of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> . 
These results therefore demonstrate that the <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> gene silencing in <START:ana> somatic cell hybrids <END> is due to an active suppression of one of the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of the <START:ggp> CIITA gene <END> , mediated by the <START:ana> epithelial cell fusion partner <END> . 
Class II transactivator-independent endothelial cell <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> gene activation induced by lymphocyte adhesion . 
NK cells induce <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> molecules on the surface of allogeneic endothelial cells in an adhesion-dependent , <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -independent manner . 
Here , we demonstrate that <START:ana> NK cells <END> induce <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> on the surface of a <START:ana> mutant cell line <END> that is defective in <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -induced <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> expression . 
RNA analysis in these cells and in a cell line that is defective in <START:ggp> class II transactivator <END> ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) demonstrates that NK cell-induced <START:ana> HLA-DR alpha mRNA <END> expression is also <START:ggp> CIITA <END> -independent . 
The <START:ana> Janus kinase-1-deficient cell line U4A <END> expresses <START:ana> HLA-DR alpha mRNA <END> in response to NK cell activation , and <START:ggp> HLA-DR alpha promoter constructs <END> transfected into these cells are induced by <START:ana> NK cells <END> but not <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
These data indicate that the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -independent component of the target cell <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> expression induced by lymphocyte adhesion uses a signaling pathway that is distinct from the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> -dependent mechanism and also suggest that <START:ggp> CIITA <END> is not required . 
Effects of overexpression of <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor-associated kinase <END> on <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activation , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production and stress-activated protein kinases in the <START:ana> murine T cell line EL4 <END> . 
The association and activation of the <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor-associated protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> IRAK <END> ) to the <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor complex <END> is one of the earliest events detectable in <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> signal transduction . 
We generated permanent clones of the <START:ana> murine T cell line EL4 6.1 <END> overexpressing <START:ggp> human ( h ) IRAK <END> to evaluate the role of this kinase in <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> signaling . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> hIRAK <END> enhanced <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -stimulated activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor NFkappaB <END> , whereas a truncated form ( <START:ggp> N-IRAK <END> ) specifically inhibited <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -dependent <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activity . 
In clones stably overexpressing <START:ggp> hIRAK <END> a weak constitutive activation of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> correlated with a low basal <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production which was enhanced in an <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -dependent manner . 
Compared to the <START:ana> parental cell line <END> the dose-response curve of <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -induced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production was shifted in both potency and efficacy . 
These results demonstrate that <START:ggp> IRAK <END> directly triggers <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> -mediated gene expression in <START:ana> EL4 cells <END> . 
Qualitatively different effects were observed for the <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> stress-activated protein ( SAP ) kinases <END> : permanent overexpression of <START:ggp> IRAK <END> did not affect the dose dependence but prolonged the kinetics of <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> SAP kinases <END> , suggesting that this signaling branch may be regulated by distinct mechanisms . 
The role of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> signaling in activated <START:ggp> DRA <END> transcription . 
Expression of <START:ggp> human MHC HLA-DRA class II gene <END> can be up-regulated in <START:ana> B cells <END> by Ig cross-linking as well as by phorbol esters such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) . 
Induced <START:ggp> DRA <END> expression involves activation of <START:ggp> restricted protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoforms <END> , resulting in activated activator <START:ggp> protein-1 <END> -dependent transcription . 
In this report expression profiles and activation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> were analyzed in <START:ana> human Raji B lymphoblastoid cells <END> . 
Transient transfection analysis with <START:ggp> target plasmids <END> containing either <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> ( wild-type or mutated ) or <START:ggp> TPA response elements <END> demonstrated that pretreatment with the selective <START:ggp> PKC <END> inhibitor GF 109203X repressed TPA-mediated activation . 
Western analysis performed on cellular fractions of <START:ana> resting cells <END> and of <START:ana> TPA-activated cells <END> revealed abundant expression of <START:ggp> classical PKC-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> cPKC-alpha <END> ) , <START:ggp> cPKC-betaII <END> , and <START:ggp> atypical PKC-zeta isoforms <END> and identified a sustained translocation of <START:ggp> cPKC-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> cPKC-betaII <END> from the cytosolic compartment to membranes . 
As expected , the distribution of <START:ggp> atypical PKC-zeta <END> was unaffected by TPA treatment and displayed an even distribution between cytosol and membranes . 
This finding was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy . 
The TPA-mediated translocation of <START:ggp> cPKC-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> cPKC-betaII <END> was not influenced by pretreatment with GF 109203X . 
Finally , functional activation and translocation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> were investigated with a selective in vitro kinase assay . 
Together , these results show that activated <START:ggp> HLA-DRA <END> expression in response to TPA treatment is strictly dependent on <START:ggp> PKC <END> activation acting on the <START:ggp> X2 box <END> of the <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> and that selective inhibition of <START:ggp> PKC <END> enzymatic activity does not influence subcellular localization of expressed <START:ggp> PKC isoenzymes <END> . 
Thus , the translocation event per se occurs independently of <START:ggp> PKC <END> activation in these cells . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> RNA polymerase II <END> transcription in <START:ana> human cells <END> by synthetic DNA-binding ligands [ see comments ] 
Sequence-specific DNA-binding small molecules that can permeate <START:ana> human cells <END> potentially could regulate transcription of specific genes . 
Multiple <START:ggp> cellular DNA-binding transcription factors <END> are required by HIV type 1 for RNA synthesis . 
Two pyrrole-imidazole polyamides were designed to bind DNA sequences immediately adjacent to binding sites for the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> , <START:ggp> lymphoid-enhancer binding factor 1 <END> , and <START:ggp> TATA-box binding protein <END> . 
These synthetic ligands specifically inhibit DNA-binding of each <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> and HIV type 1 transcription in cell-free assays . 
When used in combination , the polyamides inhibit virus replication by > 99 % in <START:ana> isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> , with no detectable cell toxicity . 
The ability of small molecules to target predetermined <START:ggp> DNA sequences <END> located within <START:ggp> RNA polymerase II promoters <END> suggests a general approach for regulation of gene expression , as well as a mechanism for the inhibition of viral replication . 
<START:ggp> musculin <END> : a <START:ggp> murine basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene <END> expressed in embryonic skeletal muscle . 
We describe the embryonic expression of <START:ggp> musculin <END> , a new murine member of the <START:ggp> bHLH family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Musculin protein is closely related to <START:ggp> human ABF-1 <END> , which is expressed in activated <START:ana> B cells <END> , and to <START:ggp> epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 <END> , which is expressed in <START:ana> branchial myoblasts <END> , visceral and urogenital mesoderm and epicardium . 
In situ hybridisation revealed <START:ggp> musculin <END> expression in embryos was largely restricted to the <START:ana> embryonic skeletal muscle lineage <END> . 
While all skeletal muscles expressed the gene , only a subset of myocytes within each muscle were positive , indicating molecular heterogeneity within fetal muscle .

Induction of T cell anergy by high concentrations of immunodominant native peptide is accompanied by <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> production and a block in <START:ggp> JNK <END> activity . 
The ability to induce anergy in <START:ana> antigen-specific T cells <END> has potential therapeutic value for altering pathologic immune responses . 
This study was undertaken to further analyze changes in <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production and intracellular signaling during anergy induction using high concentrations of native peptide ligand of <START:ana> tetanus toxoid ( TT ) - and myelin basic protein ( MBP ) -specific human T cell lines <END> . 
The <START:ana> TT-selected T cell line <END> could be rendered unresponsive to its dominant epitope in a dose-dependent manner ( IC50 = 0.03 microg/ml ) . 
The <START:ana> TT-selected line <END> , as well as three T cell clones established from this line , continued to produce <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and significantly increased <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> production when anergy was induced with high concentrations of the immunodominant epitope . 
<START:ggp> JNK <END> enzymatic activity was blocked in <START:ana> anergized T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> MBP <END> -selected line could likewise be rendered unresponsive by incubation with supraoptimal concentrations of immunodominant peptide and anergy induction was accompanied by <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> release . 
Both <START:ana> T cell lines <END> could be anergized by the autopresentation of native peptide since anergy was induced in cultures lacking fresh <START:ana> antigen-presenting cells <END> . 
This study shows that the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> cascade is blocked when anergy is induced to high concentrations of soluble peptide .

Upregulation of <START:ggp> interleukin 6 <END> and <START:ggp> granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptors <END> by <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> C/EBP alpha <END> ) is critical for granulopoiesis . 
Cytokines stimulate granulopoiesis through signaling via receptors whose expression is controlled by lineage-specific <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Previously , we demonstrated that <START:ana> granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) receptor mRNA <END> was undetectable and granulocyte maturation blocked in <START:ggp> CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> C/EBPalpha <END> ) -deficient mice . 
This phenotype is distinct from that of G-CSF receptor-/- mice , suggesting that other genes are likely to be adversely affected by loss of <START:ggp> C/EBPalpha <END> . 
Here we demonstrate loss of <START:ggp> interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) receptor <END> and <START:ggp> IL-6-responsive colony-forming units <END> ( <START:ggp> CFU-IL6 <END> ) in <START:ggp> C/EBPalpha <END> -/- mice . 
The observed failure of granulopoiesis could be rescued by the addition of soluble <START:ggp> IL-6 receptor <END> and <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> or by retroviral transduction of <START:ggp> G-CSF receptors <END> , demonstrating that loss of both of these receptors contributes to the absolute block in granulocyte maturation observed in <START:ana> C/EBPalpha-deficient hematopoietic cells <END> . 
The results of these and other studies suggest that additional <START:ggp> C/EBPalpha target genes <END> , possibly other cytokine receptors , are also important for the block in granulocyte differentiation observed in vivo in <START:ggp> C/EBPalpha <END> -deficient mice . 
Phosphatidylinositides bind to <START:ggp> plasma membrane CD14 <END> and can prevent monocyte activation by bacterial lipopolysaccharide . 
Although bacterial lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) and several other microbial agonists can bind to <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> ( <START:ggp> membrane CD14 <END> ) , a cell-surface receptor found principally on <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> neutrophils <END> , host-derived <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> ligands are poorly defined . 
We report here that phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) , phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate , and other phosphatidylinositides can bind to <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> . 
Phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , another anionic glycerophospholipid , binds to <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> with lower apparent affinity than does PtdIns . 
<START:ggp> LPS-binding protein <END> , a lipid transfer protein found in serum , facilitates both PS -and PtdIns- <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> binding . 
PtdIns binding to <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> can be blocked by <START:ggp> anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies <END> that inhibit LPS <START:ggp> -mCD14 <END> binding , and PtdIns can inhibit both LPS <START:ggp> -mCD14 <END> binding and LPS-induced responses in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
<START:ana> Serum-equilibrated PtdIns also binds to mCD14-expressing cells <END> , raising the possibility that endogenous PtdIns may modulate cellular responses to LPS and other <START:ggp> mCD14 <END> ligands in vivo . 
<START:ggp> Protein kinase C <END> regulates <START:ggp> Fas <END> ( <START:ggp> CD95/APO-1 <END> ) expression . 
<START:ggp> Fas <END> ( <START:ggp> CD95/APO-1 <END> ) is a <START:ggp> transmembrane protein <END> of the <START:ggp> TNF/neuron growth factor receptor family <END> . 
Ligation of <START:ggp> Fas <END> by <START:ggp> specific Abs <END> or <START:ggp> Fas ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> FasL/CD95 ligand <END> ) induces rapid apoptotic cell death in a variety of cell types . 
Despite progress in understanding the death signals transduced from <START:ggp> Fas <END> , very little is known with regard to the mechanisms by which <START:ggp> Fas <END> expression is regulated . 
Using our previously established <START:ana> murine T cell hybridoma model <END> <START:ana> A1.1 <END> , we show that specific <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) inhibitors could block activation-induced <START:ggp> Fas <END> expression and apoptosis . 
The activation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> with PMA or 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol could mimic the <START:ggp> TCR <END> signal by inducing the expression of <START:ggp> Fas <END> but not FasL . 
<START:ggp> PKC <END> -dependent <START:ggp> Fas <END> expression was also observed in several <START:ana> murine and human tumor cell lines <END> . 
Since the inhibition of Ca2+ redistribution by an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization , 8- ( diethylamino ) -octyl-3 , 4 , 5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride , inhibited <START:ggp> TCR-induced FasL <END> but not <START:ggp> Fas <END> , the expression of <START:ggp> Fas <END> appears to be independent of Ca2+ mobilization . 
Significantly , expression of the newly identified <START:ggp> Fas-regulatory gene <END> , <START:ggp> TDAG51 <END> , was found to be dependent upon the activity of <START:ggp> PKC <END> . 
<START:ggp> PKC <END> activation only induced <START:ggp> Fas <END> expression in cells expressing wild-type <START:ggp> TDAG51 <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> Fas <END> expression is likely mediated by <START:ggp> PKC <END> through <START:ggp> TDAG51 <END> . 
Retinoic acid inhibits <START:ggp> CD40 <END> + <START:ggp> interleukin-4 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> IgE <END> production in vitro . 
To elucidate the role of retinoic acid ( RA ) in <START:ggp> anti-CD40 <END> + <START:ggp> interleukin-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) -mediated B-cell activation , the effect of 10 ( -12 ) to 10 ( -6 ) mol/L RA was studied in <START:ggp> anti-CD40 <END> ( 1 microgram/mL ) + <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ( 5 ng/mL ) -mediated proliferation and Ig synthesis by <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) and <START:ana> B cells <END> in healthy donors . 
<START:ggp> Anti-CD40 <END> + <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -mediated proliferation of <START:ana> PBMC <END> and <START:ana> B cells <END> was inhibited by RA in a dose-dependent manner , with maximal inhibition of 62 % +/- 5 % in <START:ana> PBMC <END> and 55 % +/- 4.4 % in <START:ana> B cells <END> by all-trans RA , and 58 % +/- 6.7 % and 51 % +/- 4.7 % , respectively by 13-cis RA . 
<START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis was even more markedly inhibited by RA starting at concentrations of > 10 ( -14 ) mol/L for <START:ana> B cells <END> and > 10 ( -10 ) mol/L for <START:ana> PBMC <END> . 
Maximal inhibition of <START:ggp> IgE <END> production for <START:ana> B cells <END> was at 10 ( -8 ) mol/L for all-trans RA ( 94 % +/- 1.8 % ) and 96 % +/- 3.2 % for 13-cis RA . 
Low concentrations of RA inhibiting <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis ( 10 ( -10 ) mol/L ) affected neither B-cell proliferation nor the production of <START:ggp> IgA <END> , <START:ggp> IgG <END> , and <START:ggp> IgM <END> . 
Elucidation of the mechanism involved in this inhibition of <START:ggp> IgE <END> production shows that epsilon <START:ggp> germline <END> transcription is decreased by RA , whereas production of <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) was not enhanced in the presence of RA . 
To differentiate whether the RA effect was mediated by <START:ggp> RA receptors alpha , beta , and gamma <END> , the expression of the <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR <END> ) was examined by <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase <END> -polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . 
The data show that <START:ana> unstimulated human peripheral B cells <END> express mRNA of the <START:ggp> RA receptor alpha , beta , and gamma <END> . 
Using retinoids with different receptor binding specificity ( CD336 , CD437 , CD2019 , CD367 ) , dose-dependent inhibition of <START:ggp> IgE <END> synthesis was shown by all four derivates , but was most marked by an RA binding the <START:ggp> alpha receptor <END> with high specificity . 
Taken together , this study shows that RA inhibits <START:ggp> IgE <END> production of <START:ana> anti-CD40 + IL-4-stimulated B cells <END> in vitro .

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 <START:ggp> Tax <END> induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> involves activation of the <START:ggp> IkappaB kinase alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> IKKalpha <END> ) and <START:ggp> IKKbeta <END> <START:ggp> cellular kinases <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> corresponds to a <START:ggp> 40-kDa transforming protein <END> from the pathogenic retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) that activates nuclear expression of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> by an unknown mechanism . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> expression promotes N-terminal phosphorylation and degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaB alpha <END> , a principal cytoplasmic inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Our studies now demonstrate that HTLV-1 <START:ggp> Tax <END> activates the recently identified <START:ggp> cellular kinases <END> <START:ggp> IkappaB kinase alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> IKKalpha <END> ) and <START:ggp> IKKbeta <END> , which normally phosphorylate <START:ggp> IkappaB alpha <END> on both of its N-terminal regulatory serines in response to <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) and <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> ) stimulation . 
In contrast , a mutant of <START:ggp> Tax <END> termed <START:ggp> M22 <END> , which does not induce <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , fails to activate either <START:ggp> IKKalpha <END> or <START:ggp> IKKbeta <END> . 
Furthermore , endogenous IKK enzymatic activity was significantly elevated in <START:ana> HTLV-1-infected and Tax-expressing T-cell lines <END> . 
Transfection of kinase-deficient mutants of <START:ggp> IKKalpha <END> and <START:ggp> IKKbeta <END> into either <START:ana> human Jurkat T or 293 cells <END> also inhibits <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> expression induced by <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
Similarly , a <START:ggp> kinase-deficient mutant <END> of <START:ggp> NIK <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-inducing kinase <END> ) , which represents an upstream kinase in the TNF-alpha and IL-1 signaling pathways leading to <START:ggp> IKKalpha <END> and <START:ggp> IKKbeta <END> activation , blocks <START:ggp> Tax <END> induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
However , <START:ggp> plasma membrane-proximal elements <END> in these <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokine <END> pathways are apparently not involved since dominant negative mutants of the <START:ggp> TRAF2 and TRAF6 adaptors <END> , which effectively block signaling through the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic tails <END> of the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> receptors , respectively , do not inhibit <START:ggp> Tax <END> induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
Together , these studies demonstrate that HTLV-1 <START:ggp> Tax <END> exploits a distal part of the <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokine <END> signaling cascade leading to induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
The pathological alteration of this cytokine pathway leading to <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation by <START:ggp> Tax <END> may play a central role in HTLV-1-mediated transformation of <START:ana> human T cells <END> , clinically manifested as the adult T-cell leukemia 
Role of <START:ggp> IKK1 <END> and <START:ggp> IKK2 <END> in lipopolysaccharide signaling in <START:ana> human monocytic cells <END> . 
<START:ana> Mononuclear phagocytes <END> play a major role in immune and inflammatory responses . 
Bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces <START:ana> monocytes <END> to express a variety of genes by activating the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel transcription factor family <END> . 
Recently , we have reported that the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin 1 <END> signaling pathways activate two kinases , <START:ggp> IKK1 <END> and <START:ggp> IKK2 <END> . 
Phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> IkappaB cytoplasmic inhibitors <END> , <START:ggp> IkappaBalpha <END> , <START:ggp> IkappaBbeta <END> , and <START:ggp> IkappaBepsilon <END> , by these kinases triggers proteolytic degradation and the release of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB/Rel proteins <END> into the nucleus . 
At present , the role of the IKKs in LPS signaling has not been investigated . 
Here , we report that LPS induces <START:ggp> IKK <END> activity in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> THP-1 monocytic cells <END> . 
The kinetics of activation of kinase activity in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> are relatively slow with maximal activity observed at 60 min , which coincides with the degradation of <START:ggp> IkappaBs <END> and the nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
In transfection experiments , overexpression of wild type <START:ggp> IKK1 <END> , a <START:ggp> dominant negative mutant IKK1 <END> ( <START:ggp> K44M <END> ) , or <START:ggp> wild type IKK2 <END> did not affect LPS-induced <START:ggp> kappaB <END> -dependent transcription in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
In contrast , a dominant negative mutant of <START:ggp> IKK2 <END> inhibited LPS induction of <START:ggp> kappaB <END> -dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner . 
These results indicate that LPS induction of kappaB-dependent gene expression in <START:ana> human monocytic cells <END> requires activation of <START:ggp> IKK2 <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-7 <END> reconstitutes multiple aspects of <START:ggp> v-Abl <END> -mediated signaling . 
The mechanism by which <START:ana> early lymphoid cells <END> are selectively transformed by <START:ggp> v-Abl <END> is currently unknown . 
Previous studies have shown constitutive activation of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> signaling pathways , as measured by activation of <START:ggp> Janus protein kinase ( JAK ) 1 <END> , <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> , in <START:ana> pre-B cells <END> transformed by <START:ggp> v-Abl <END> . 
To determine whether activation of these cytokine signaling pathways by <START:ggp> v-Abl <END> is important in the cellular events induced by the Abelson murine leukemia virus , the effects of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> on <START:ana> pre-B cells <END> transformed with a <START:ggp> temperature-sensitive v-Abl mutant <END> were examined . 
Whereas <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> had little or no effect , <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> delayed both the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest that occur upon <START:ggp> v-Abl <END> kinase inactivation . 
<START:ggp> IL-7 <END> also delayed the decreases in the levels of <START:ggp> c-Myc <END> , <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> , and <START:ggp> Bcl-xL <END> that occur upon loss of <START:ggp> v-Abl <END> kinase activity . 
<START:ggp> IL-7 <END> did not maintain <START:ggp> v-Abl <END> -mediated differentiation arrest of the <START:ana> pre-B cells <END> , as activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> RAG gene <END> transcription was unaffected by <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> . 
These results identify a potential role for <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> signaling pathways in transformation by <START:ggp> v-Abl <END> while demonstrating that a combination of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> signaling can not substitute for an active <START:ggp> v-Abl <END> kinase in <START:ana> transformed pre-B cells <END> . 
Differential regulation of <START:ggp> coproporphyrinogen oxidase gene <END> between <START:ana> erythroid and nonerythroid cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Coproporphyrinogen oxidase <END> ( <START:ggp> CPO <END> ) catalyzes the sixth step of the <START:ggp> heme <END> biosynthetic pathway . 
To assess the tissue-specific regulation of the <START:ggp> CPO gene promoter <END> , <START:ggp> mouse genomic DNA clones <END> for <START:ggp> CPO <END> were isolated . 
Structural analysis demonstrated that the <START:ggp> mouse CPO gene <END> spans approximately 11 kb and consists of <START:ggp> seven exons <END> , just like its human counterpart . 
Functional analysis of the promoter by transient transfection assays indicated that synergistic action between an <START:ggp> SP-1-like element <END> at -21/-12 , a <START:ggp> GATA site <END> at -59/-54 , and a <START:ggp> novel regulatory element <END> , <START:ggp> CPRE <END> ( - <START:ggp> GGACTACAG <END> - ) at -49/-41 , is essential for the promoter activity in <START:ana> murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells <END> . 
In <START:ana> nonerythroid NIH3T3 cells <END> , however , the <START:ggp> GATA site <END> is not required . 
Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that specific <START:ggp> DNA-protein complexes <END> can be formed with each element , and that there are cell-specific differences in factors , which bind to the <START:ggp> SP-1-like element <END> between <START:ana> MEL and NIH3T3 cells <END> .

<START:ggp> Tumor suppressor proteins <END> as regulators of cell differentiation . 
The products of the <START:ggp> tumor suppressor genes <END> are considered to function as specific inhibitors of tumor cell growth . 
In this communication , we present evidence to show that these proteins inhibit tumor cell proliferation by participating in the activation of tumor cell differentiation . 
The <START:ana> ML-1 human myeloblastic leukemia cells <END> used in this study proliferate when treated with <START:ggp> insulin-like growth factor I <END> and <START:ggp> transferrin <END> but differentiate to <START:ana> monocytes <END> when exposed to <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> or <START:ggp> transforming growth factor beta1 <END> , or to <START:ana> macrophage-like cells <END> when treated with both these <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
Initiation of proliferation but not of differentiation was followed by a 20- to 25-fold increase in the nuclear level of the <START:ggp> DNA polymerase-associated processivity factor PCNA <END> and of the <START:ggp> proliferation-specific transcription factor E2F1 <END> . 
In contrast , induction of differentiation but not of proliferation was followed by a 25- to 30-fold increase in the nuclear level of the <START:ggp> tumor suppressor proteins p53 <END> ( wild type ) , <START:ggp> pRb <END> , and <START:ggp> p130/Rb2 <END> and of the <START:ggp> p53-dependent cyclin kinase inhibitor <END> <START:ggp> p21/Cip1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> p53 <END> and <START:ggp> p21/Cip1 <END> , respectively , inhibit the expression and activation of <START:ggp> PCNA <END> , whereas <START:ggp> p130 <END> and <START:ggp> pRb <END> , respectively , inhibit the expression and activation of <START:ggp> E2F1 <END> . 
As a result , <START:ggp> G1-S-associated DNA <END> and mRNA synthesis is inhibited , growth uncoupled from differentiation , and maturation enabled to proceed . 
Where this function of the <START:ggp> tumor suppressor proteins <END> is impaired , the capacity for differentiation is lost , which leads to the sustained proliferation that is characteristic of the <START:ana> cancer cell <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor <END> activation in lymphokine activated <START:ana> killer cells <END> and <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> from patients receiving <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> immunotherapy . 
Administration of the <START:ggp> cytokine interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) can result in therapeutic benefits for individuals with renal cell carcinoma and melanoma . 
Here we report an analysis of the transcription factor families AP-1 , Sp1 , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , and <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription <END> ( <START:ggp> STAT <END> ) in <START:ana> cancer patients ' lymphocytes <END> before and after <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> immunotherapy , as assessed by a gel-shift assay . 
An in vitro surrogate of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> immunotherapy is the incubation of <START:ana> fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) from healthy individuals in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> for several days , resulting in the production of <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> -activated killer ( LAK ) activity in these cultures . 
One purpose of this study was to describe the profile of transcription factor activation in these different populations , and assess whether the patterns observed correlated with functional differences in these cells . 
Prior to in vivo <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> administration , the typical binding pattern of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in <START:ana> PBMC <END> from patients resembled that seen in fresh <START:ana> PBMC <END> from healthy individuals . 
Over a 3-week course of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> therapy , in most patients the binding patterns of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> proteins changed to resemble those seen in <START:ana> PBMC <END> activated by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in vitro . 
However , the cells obtained from <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -treated patients did not have low-level constitutive expression of <START:ggp> STAT binding factors <END> as did <START:ggp> LAK cells <END> . 
When these patient cells were further stimulated by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in vitro , additional differences in <START:ggp> STAT <END> induction patterns were noted . 
These data provide further information on the molecular events occurring in <START:ana> immune cells <END> generated through in vivo and in vitro administration of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , and further document that there is not a precise congruence between <START:ana> PBMC <END> activated in vivo and in vitro by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
<START:ana> Activated platelets <END> induce <START:ggp> monocyte chemotactic protein-1 <END> secretion and surface expression of <START:ana> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> on <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> [ see comments ] 
BACKGROUND : Platelet/endothelium interaction plays an important role in the pathophysiology of inflammation and atherosclerosis . 
The role of platelets for <START:ggp> monocyte chemotactic protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> ) secretion and surface expression of <START:ana> intercellular adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ) on <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> has been assessed . 
METHODS AND RESULTS : Monolayers of <START:ana> human umbilical vein endothelial cells <END> were incubated with nonstimulated or <START:ana> ADP-activated platelets <END> for 6 hours , and secretion of <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> and surface expression of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> were determined by ELISA and flow cytometry , respectively . 
In the presence of <START:ana> ADP-activated platelets <END> , both <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> secretion and <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> surface expression were significantly increased compared with <START:ana> nonstimulated platelets <END> ( P < 0.02 ) . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and <START:ggp> kappaB <END> -dependent transcriptional activity was enhanced in the presence of <START:ana> activated platelets <END> . 
In addition , <START:ana> ADP-activated platelets <END> induced MCP-1 and ICAM-1 promoter-dependent transcription . 
Liposomal transfection of a double-stranded kappaB phosphorothioate oligonucleotide , but not of the mutated form , inhibited <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> secretion and surface expression of <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> on activated endothelium ( P < 0.05 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : The present study indicates that <START:ana> activated platelets <END> modulate chemotactic ( <START:ggp> MCP-1 <END> ) and adhesive ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ) properties of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> via an <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent mechanism . 
Platelet-induced activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> system might contribute to early inflammatory events in atherogenesis . 
<START:ggp> Retinoid X receptor <END> and <START:ggp> c-cerbA/thyroid hormone receptor <END> regulate erythroid cell growth and differentiation . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear receptors <END> are important regulators of erythroid cell development . 
Here we investigated the impact of <START:ggp> retinoid X receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> RXR <END> ) , <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR <END> ) , and of the <START:ggp> c-erbA/thyroid hormone ( T3 ) receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> c-erbA/TR <END> ) on growth and differentiation of <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> using an in vitro culture system of <START:ana> stem cell factor-dependent erythroid progenitors <END> . 
<START:ggp> RXR <END> , <START:ggp> RAR <END> , and <START:ggp> c-erbA/TR <END> -specific ligands were found to induce <START:ggp> erythroid-specific gene <END> expression and to accelerate erythroid differentiation in culture , with T3 being most effective . 
Furthermore , while ligand-activated <START:ggp> c-erbA/TR <END> accelerated differentiation , unliganded <START:ggp> c-erbA/TR <END> effectively blocked differentiation and supported sustained progenitor growth in culture . 
Thus , <START:ggp> c-erbA/TR <END> appears to act as a binary switch affecting <START:ana> erythroid cell fate <END> : unliganded <START:ggp> c-erbA/TR <END> supports growth while ligand-activated <START:ggp> c-erbA/TR <END> induces differentiation . 
Additionally , to determine the impact of <START:ggp> RXR <END> for erythroid cell development , dominant interfering <START:ggp> mutant RXRs <END> , lacking the transcriptional activator functions <START:ggp> AF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> AF-2 <END> , or <START:ggp> AF-2 <END> only , or the <START:ggp> entire DNA-binding domain <END> , were introduced into <START:ana> erythroid progenitor cells <END> via recombinant retrovirus vectors and analyzed for <START:ggp> RXR <END> -specific effects . 
It was found that expression of <START:ggp> wild-type RXR <END> and of the <START:ggp> RXR mutants <END> devoid of <START:ggp> AF-1 <END> and/or <START:ggp> AF-2 <END> supported a transient outgrowth of <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> . 
In marked contrast , expression of the <START:ggp> dominant interfering deltaDNA-binding domain <END> <START:ggp> RXR <END> , containing a deletion of the <START:ggp> entire DNA-binding domain <END> , was incompatible with erythroid cell growth in vitro , suggesting a pivotal role of <START:ggp> RXR <END> for erythroid cell development . 
<START:ana> Peripheral T lymphocytes <END> from women with breast cancer exhibit abnormal protein expression of <START:ggp> several signaling molecules <END> . 
We examined signaling molecules of <START:ana> peripheral blood T lymphocytes <END> obtained from women with breast cancer . 
In 6 of 14 patients , <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> displayed an impaired ability to translocate <START:ggp> NFeB p65 <END> ( <START:ggp> Rel-A <END> ) following activation by anti-CD3 and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
This observation was made despite normal cytoplasmic levels of the <START:ggp> Rel-A protein <END> . 
We also detected abnormally low levels of the <START:ggp> signaling molecules <END> <START:ggp> T-cell receptor ( TCR ) -zeta <END> , <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> and <START:ggp> p56lck <END> in 4 of 14 breast cancer patients , i.e. , defects in <START:ggp> T-cell signaling molecules <END> . 
<START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> from 6 of the 14 patients also exhibited an increased expression of the dual <START:ggp> specificity phosphatase <END> , <START:ggp> map kinase phosphatase-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> MKP-1 <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> MKP-1 <END> inactivates <START:ggp> MAP kinase <END> and therefore may interfere with the activation of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and <START:ggp> c-fos <END> . 
Abnormalities of I or more <START:ggp> signaling molecules <END> were found in 9 of 14 patients ; however , only 3 patients had <START:ana> T cells <END> that exhibited all 5 defects . 
Our data have implications for the detection of potentially dysfunctional <START:ana> T cells <END> in patients with cancer . 
For example , the analysis of only 1 <START:ggp> signaling molecule <END> may allow patients with significant defects in T-cell signaling to go unnoticed . 
Finally , despite impaired <START:ggp> Rel-A <END> translocation , <START:ana> T cells <END> were capable of transcribing <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
Impairments in the translocation of <START:ggp> Rel-B <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> further suggest that the <START:ggp> NFKB family members <END> <START:ggp> Rel-A <END> , <START:ggp> Rel-B <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> are not required for the transcription of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in the <START:ana> peripheral T lymphocytes <END> of patients with breast cancer . 
Specific glucocorticoid binding at different levels of human motor activity . 
We studied the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> and dissociation constant in <START:ana> isolated human lymphocytes <END> as well as blood concentrations of hormones produced by the hypothalamic-hypophyseal-adrenocortical system in three experimental series : at normal ( 17 subjects ) , decreased ( 10 subjects , a 360-d head-down bed rest ) and increased ( 8 subjects , physical exercise on bicycle ergometer ) levels of motor activity . 
In the first series we found that the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> and dissociation constant did not depend on the season , on the age of subjects nor on cortisol concentrations in blood . 
In the second series we observed the following : at the end of the first month of bed rest the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> and receptor affinity significantly increased ; at the beginning of the third month of bed rest specific glucocorticoid binding significantly decreased and circadian rhythms of adrenocorticotropin and cortisol in blood varied markedly ; at the end of the sixth month of bed rest the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> returned to prebed rest levels and dissociation constant decreased . 
In the third series physical exercises that induced an activation of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal-adrenocortical system ( maximal physical exercises and prolonged submaximal exercises at 70 % of maximal oxygen uptake ) led to a significant increase in the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> without changes of dissociation constant . 
These results indicate that both a decrease and an increase of human motor activity resulted in significant changes of specific glucocorticoid binding which were not influenced by changes of circulating hormone concentrations in blood but by some other factors affected by physical activity . 
The <START:ggp> small GTP-binding protein Rho <END> potentiates <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> transcription in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Rho <END> family of <START:ggp> small GTP-binding proteins <END> is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal structure , gene transcription , specific cell fate development , and transformation . 
We demonstrate in this report that overexpression of an activated form of <START:ggp> Rho <END> enhances <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , but activated <START:ggp> Rho <END> ( <START:ggp> V14Rho <END> ) has little or no effect on <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB enhancer element <END> activities under similar conditions . 
Overexpression of a <START:ggp> V14Rho construct <END> incapable of membrane localization ( <START:ggp> CAAX deleted <END> ) abolishes PMA-induced <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> transcriptional activation . 
The effect of <START:ggp> Rho <END> on <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> is independent of the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase <END> pathway , as a <START:ggp> dominant-negative MEK <END> and a <START:ggp> MEK <END> inhibitor ( PD98059 ) did not affect <START:ggp> Rho <END> -induced <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity . 
<START:ggp> V14Rho <END> binds strongly to <START:ggp> protein kinase Calpha <END> ( <START:ggp> PKCalpha <END> ) in vivo ; however , deletion of the <START:ggp> CAAX site <END> on <START:ggp> V14Rho <END> severely diminished this association . 
Evidence for a role for <START:ggp> PKCalpha <END> as an effector of <START:ggp> Rho <END> was obtained by the observation that coexpression of the <START:ggp> N-terminal domain <END> of <START:ggp> PKCalpha <END> blocked the effects of activated <START:ggp> Rho <END> plus PMA on <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> transcriptional activity . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> Rho <END> potentiates <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> transcription during T-cell activation 
Changes in <START:ggp> PKC isoforms <END> in <START:ana> human alveolar macrophages <END> compared with <START:ana> blood monocytes <END> . 
Alveolar macrophages play an important role in host defense and in other types of inflammatory processes in the lung . 
These cells exhibit many alterations in function compared with their <START:ana> precursor cells <END> , <START:ana> blood monocytes <END> . 
To evaluate a potential mechanism for these differences in function , we evaluated expression of <START:ggp> protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoforms <END> . 
We found an increase in <START:ggp> Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms <END> in monocytes compared with alveolar macrophages . 
We also found differential expression of the <START:ggp> Ca2+-independent isoforms <END> in <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> compared with <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
One consequence of the activation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> can be increased expression of <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase <END> pathways . 
Therefore , we also evaluated activation of the <START:ggp> MAP kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) 2 <END> by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) . 
PMA activated <START:ggp> ERK2 kinase <END> in both <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> ; however , <START:ana> monocytes <END> consistently showed a significantly greater activation of <START:ggp> ERK2 kinase <END> by PMA compared with <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> . 
Another known consequence of the activation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> and subsequent activation of <START:ggp> ERK kinase <END> is activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor activator protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) . 
We evaluated the activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> by PMA in both <START:ana> monocytes <END> and macrophages . 
We found very little detectable activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , as assessed in a gel shift assay , in <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> , whereas <START:ana> monocytes <END> showed a substantial activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> by PMA . 
These studies show that the differential expression of <START:ggp> PKC isoforms <END> in <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> and <START:ana> blood monocytes <END> is associated with important functional alterations in the cells . 
Expression of <START:ggp> gamma-IFN responsive genes <END> in scavenger receptor <START:ana> over-expressing monocytes <END> is associated with xanthomatosis . 
We have recently described an inherited over-expression of the <START:ggp> macrophage scavenger receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> SR <END> ) in <START:ana> blood monocytes <END> from members of a kindred , only two of whom displayed extensive xanthomatosis . 
Using mRNA differential display we demonstrated abnormally high expression of the <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription <END> ( <START:ggp> STAT1alpha <END> ) in <START:ana> monocytes <END> from the <START:ana> proband II-2 <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> gamma-interferon inducible protein 10 <END> ( <START:ggp> IP-10 <END> ) , a <START:ggp> STAT1alpha-responsive gene <END> and mediator of inflammatory response , was also abnormally expressed in the <START:ana> monocytes <END> from <START:ana> II-2 <END> . 
Over-expression of both genes was restricted to <START:ana> monocytes <END> from <START:ana> II-2 <END> and was not observed in <START:ana> monocytes <END> from the clinically unaffected family members , unlike that of <START:ggp> SR <END> . 
Gel retardation assays with <START:ana> THP-1 cell <END> extracts identified <START:ggp> gamma-IFN <END> inducible DNA binding activity to three potential <START:ggp> STATI DNA binding elements <END> in the <START:ggp> human IP-10 promoter region <END> from <START:ggp> nucleotides - 245 to - 188 <END> . 
Taken together these results suggest that gamma-interferon mediated cell activation is responsible for <START:ggp> STAT1alpha <END> -induced transcription of the <START:ggp> IP-10 <END> gene in <START:ana> THP-1 macrophages <END> as well as in <START:ana> monocytes <END> from <START:ana> II-2 <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ana> monocytes <END> from familial hypercholesterolemic ( FH ) subjects , who frequently develop xanthomatosis , revealed a significant number of subjects with elevated STAT1alpha and IP-10 expression . 
Our data suggest that the inflammatory effects of <START:ggp> gamma-IFN <END> signaling could play a role in foam cell formation and xanthomatosis . 
Redox signals and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Accumulating data from a number of laboratories have recently indicated that the response of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> to alterations in the redox homeostasis of cells may play an important role in modulating immune function . 
The activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> has been recognized to regulate a number of genes necessary for normal T cell responses including <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , and several <START:ggp> T cell surface receptors <END> . 
Diminished <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity has been shown to occur in <START:ana> T cells <END> with aging , suggesting that impaired activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> might occur during cellular senescence . 
In addition , aberrancies in <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activity have been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of diseases involving immune or inflammatory processes such as atherosclerosis and HIV-1 infection . 
The role of H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as an integratory secondary messenger for divergent T cell signals has been complicated by the fact that various <START:ana> T cell lines <END> and <START:ana> peripheral blood T cells <END> differ markedly in the levels of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation induced by oxidant stress . 
Additionally , proposed pathways of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation have been based on indirect evidence provided by experiments which used antioxidants to inhibit active <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> formation . 
Further , complete activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> requires at least two signals , one that stimulates an increase in intracellular calcium and one that stimulates enzymatic processes including kinases . 
Similarly , substantial evidence indicates that full activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> requires dual signals . 
The ability of H2O2 or other ROS to induce T cell signals and functional responses by these two mechanisms is reviewed and the specific response of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> to redox changes in <START:ana> T cells <END> is examined . 
Data are also presented to suggest that the redox regulation in <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation may be relevant to immune-related diseases and to aging . 
Uncoupling of nonreceptor <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> from <START:ggp> PLC-gamma1 <END> in an SLP-76-deficient T cell . 
Activation of <START:ggp> nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases <END> ( <START:ggp> PTKs <END> ) is essential for <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) responsiveness ; however , the function of individual <START:ggp> PTK substrates <END> is often uncertain . 
A <START:ana> mutant T cell line <END> was isolated that lacked expression of <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> ( <START:ggp> SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein <END> of 76 kilodaltons ) , a <START:ggp> hematopoietically expressed adaptor protein <END> and <START:ggp> PTK substrate <END> . 
<START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> was not required for <START:ggp> TCR <END> -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of most proteins , but was required for optimal tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of <START:ggp> phospholipase C-gamma1 <END> ( <START:ggp> PLC-gamma1 <END> ) , as well as <START:ggp> Ras <END> pathway activation . 
<START:ggp> TCR <END> -inducible gene expression was dependent on <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> . 
Thus , coupling of <START:ggp> TCR-regulated PTKs <END> to downstream signaling pathways requires <START:ggp> SLP-76 <END> . 
A novel function of <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> proteins in <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> -induced erythroid differentiation of a <START:ana> human leukemia cell line <END> . 
We recently determined that <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> EPO <END> ) activates 3 members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) family , <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> , <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> , and <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> , in the <START:ana> human EPO-dependent cell lines <END> , <START:ana> UT-7 <END> and <START:ana> UT-7/EPO <END> ( Kirito et al , J Biol Chem 272 : 16507 , 1997 ) . 
In addition , we have shown that <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> , but not <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> , is involved in <START:ggp> EPO <END> -induced cellular proliferation . 
In this study , we examined the roles of <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> and <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> in <START:ggp> EPO <END> -induced erythroid differentiation . 
<START:ana> UT-7/GM <END> was used as a model system , because this cell line can differentiate into <START:ana> erythroid-lineage cells <END> with <START:ggp> EPO <END> treatment ( Komatsu et al , Blood 89 : 4021 , 1997 ) . 
We found that <START:ggp> EPO <END> did not activate <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> or <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> in <START:ana> UT-7/GM cells <END> . 
Transfection experiments showed that both <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> and <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> inhibited the induction by <START:ggp> EPO <END> of <START:ana> gamma-globin and erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthetase transcripts <END> , resulting in a reduction of the percentage of <START:ana> hemoglobin-positive cells <END> . 
Dominant negative forms of <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> or <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> promoted the <START:ggp> EPO <END> -induced erythroid differentiation of <START:ana> UT-7/GM cells <END> , even in the presence of <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> , although this cytokine never induced erythroid differentiation of the <START:ana> parent UT-7/GM cells <END> with or without <START:ggp> EPO <END> . 
A cell cycle analysis showed that the constitutive activation of <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> , but not <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> , shortened the period of G0/G1 prolongation caused by <START:ggp> EPO <END> stimulation . 
Taken together , our data suggest that <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> and <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> act as negative regulators in <START:ggp> EPO <END> -induced erythroid differentiation . 
Specifically , <START:ggp> Stat1alpha <END> may activate a <START:ggp> cell cycle-associated gene <END> ( s ) , leading to the entry of cells into the cell cycle . 
Ro 09-2210 exhibits potent anti-proliferative effects on activated <START:ana> T cells <END> by selectively blocking <START:ggp> MKK <END> activity . 
By using high throughput screening of microbial broths , we have identified a compound , designated Ro 09-2210 , which is able to block <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> induced peripheral blood T cell activation with an IC50 = 40 nM . 
Ro 09-2210 was also able to block antigen-induced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion with an IC50 = 30 nM , but was considerably less potent at blocking Ca2+ flux stimulated by <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> treatment . 
To determine the mechanism of action of Ro 09-2210 , we set up a transient expression system in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> using a variety of reporter gene constructs and showed effective inhibition of phorbol ester/ionomycin-induced <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> activation and anti-CD3 induced <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> with IC50 = 7.7 and 10 nM , respectively . 
Ro 09-2210 was also able to inhibit phorbol ester/ionomycin-induced activation of <START:ggp> AP1 <END> with IC50 = < 10 nM . 
We further showed that Ro 09-2210 was unable to inhibit <START:ggp> c-jun <END> induced expression of <START:ggp> AP1-dependent reporter constructs <END> ( IC50 > 500 nM ) , but was able to potently inhibit ras-induced <START:ggp> AP1 <END> activation ( IC50 = 20 nM ) . 
This suggested that Ro 09-2210 was inhibiting an activator of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> which was upstream of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and downstream of <START:ggp> ras <END> signaling . 
To investigate further , we then purified a number of different kinases , including <START:ggp> PKC <END> , <START:ggp> PhK <END> , <START:ggp> ZAP-70 <END> , <START:ggp> ERK <END> , and <START:ggp> MEK 1 <END> ( a <START:ggp> MKK <END> ) , and showed that Ro 09-2210 was a selective inhibitor of <START:ggp> MEK1 <END> in vitro ( IC50 = 59 nM ) . 
Coactivation by <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> : definition of critical regions and synergism with general cofactors . 
Molecular dissection of the B-cell-specific transcription coactivator <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> has revealed distinct regions important , respectively , for recruitment to <START:ggp> immunoglobulin promoters <END> through interaction with <START:ggp> octamer-bound Oct-1 <END> and for subsequent coactivator function . 
Further analysis of general coactivator requirements showed that selective removal of <START:ggp> PC4 <END> from the essential USA fraction severely impairs Oct-1 and OCA-B function in a cell-free system reconstituted with partially purified factors . 
Full activity can be restored by the combined action of recombinant <START:ggp> PC4 <END> and the <START:ggp> PC4 <END> -depleted USA fraction , thus suggesting a joint requirement for <START:ggp> PC4 <END> and another , USA-derived component ( s ) for optimal function of <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> <START:ggp> /OCA-B <END> in the reconstituted system . 
Indeed , <START:ggp> USA-derived PC2 <END> was found to act synergistically with <START:ggp> PC4 <END> in reproducing the function of intact USA in the assay system . 
Consistent with the requirement for <START:ggp> PC4 <END> in the reconstituted system , <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> was found to interact directly with <START:ggp> PC4 <END> . 
Surprisingly , however , removal of <START:ggp> PC4 <END> from the unfractionated nuclear extract has no detrimental effect on <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> / <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> -dependent transcription . 
These results lead to a general model for the synergistic function of activation domains in <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> ( mediated by the combined action of the multiple USA components ) and , further , suggest a functional redundancy in <START:ggp> general coactivators <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> Stat-3 <END> is involved in the induction of apoptosis after ligation of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex class I molecules <END> on <START:ana> human Jurkat T cells <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> Janus tyrosine kinases <END> ( <START:ggp> Jak <END> ) and <START:ggp> Signal transducers and activators of transcription <END> ( <START:ggp> Stat <END> ) after ligation of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex class I <END> ( <START:ggp> MHC-I <END> ) was explored in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
Cross-linking of <START:ggp> MHC-I <END> mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Tyk2 <END> , but not <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> , <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> , and <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> . 
In addition , the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Stat-3 <END> was tyrosine phosphorylated in the cytoplasm and subsequently translocated to the cell nucleus . 
Data obtained by electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggested that the <START:ggp> activated Stat-3 protein <END> associates with the <START:ggp> human serum-inducible element ( hSIE ) DNA-probe <END> derived from the <START:ggp> interferon-gamma activated site <END> ( <START:ggp> GAS <END> ) in the <START:ggp> c-fos promoter <END> , a common DNA sequence for <START:ggp> Stat protein <END> binding . 
An association between <START:ggp> hSIE <END> and <START:ggp> Stat-3 <END> after <START:ggp> MHC-I <END> ligation was directly demonstrated by precipitating <START:ggp> Stat-3 <END> from nuclear extracts with biotinylated <START:ggp> hSIE probe <END> and <START:ggp> avidin <END> -coupled agarose . 
To investigate the function of the activated <START:ggp> Stat-3 <END> , <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> were transiently transfected with a <START:ggp> Stat-3 isoform <END> lacking the <START:ggp> transactivating domain <END> . 
This <START:ggp> dominant-negative acting Stat-3 isoform <END> significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by ligation of <START:ggp> MHC-I <END> . 
In conclusion , our data suggest the involvement of the <START:ggp> Jak/Stat <END> signal pathway in <START:ggp> MHC-I <END> -induced signal transduction in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced growth of <START:ana> CD8+ T cell prolymphocytic leukemia cells <END> mediated by <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> induction and <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor alpha <END> expression . 
The binding of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) to its receptor on normal <START:ana> T cells <END> induces nuclear expression of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> ) , activation of the <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) alpha chain gene <END> , and cell proliferation . 
In the present study , the role of <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> signaling in the growth of <START:ana> CD8+ T cell prolymphocytic leukemia ( T-PLL ) cells <END> has been investigated . 
Flow cytometry revealed that <START:ana> primary leukemia cells <END> from a patient with CD8+ T-PLL expressed <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha and beta chains <END> , and the cells showed a proliferative response and an increase in <START:ggp> IL-2Ralpha <END> expression on culture with exogeneous <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
Northern blot analysis failed to detect <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> , suggesting that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> may act in a paracrine manner in vivo . 
Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays revealed that recombinant <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> increased <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> binding activity in nuclear extracts of the <START:ana> leukemia cells <END> , and Northern blot analysis showed that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> increased the abundance of mRNAs encoding the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> components <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> and <START:ggp> KBF1 <END> in these cells . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 <END> binding analysis demonstrated that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> markedly increased the number of low affinity <START:ggp> IL-2Rs <END> on the <START:ana> leukemia cells <END> , without an effect on the number of <START:ggp> high-affinity IL-2Rs <END> . 
These results show that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> is capable of inducing the nuclear expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> primary CD8+ T-PLL cells <END> , and that this effect is mediated , at least in part , at a pretranslational level 
Dimethyldithiocarbamate inhibits in vitro activation of <START:ana> primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes <END> . 
Dithiocarbamates ( DTC ) , a diverse group of industrial and therapeutic chemicals , have been reported to inhibit , enhance or have no effect on the immune system . 
These apparent inconsistencies reflect the complexity of the DTCs biological activities and are probably due in part to differences in dose , route of exposure , animal species used and/or specific compound tested . 
The studies described herein were undertaken to investigate the immunotoxicity of one member of this family , dimethyldithiocarbamate ( DMDTC ) . 
We demonstrate that 0.1-0.5 microM DMDTC inhibits <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> in <START:ana> primary human CD4+ T cells <END> . 
This inhibition is not accompanied by a loss in viability , and <START:ana> DMDTC-treated T cells <END> retain other active signaling pathways throughout the exposure duration . 
The inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> is apparently permanent as <START:ana> DMDTC-treated T cells <END> did not regain normal <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> activation , even after 72 h in culture . 
DMDTC does not appear to alter <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> directly as pre-incubation of nuclear extracts with DMDTC does not diminish binding activity of this protein . 
We further demonstrate that 0.1-0.5 microM DMDTC inhibits intracellular <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production and decreases surface expression of <START:ggp> CD25 <END> ( the <START:ggp> alpha subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor <END> ) in <START:ana> T cells <END> stimulated with phorbol ester . 
These data demonstrate that DMDTC is a potent immunosuppressive compound in vitro . 
<START:ggp> Human 15-lipoxygenase gene promoter <END> : analysis and identification of <START:ggp> DNA binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> IL-13-induced regulatory factors <END> in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
In order to study the transcriptional control of <START:ggp> 15-LO <END> expression , we have cloned and sequenced the <START:ggp> human 15-LO promoter region <END> . 
The <START:ggp> 15-LO <END> promoter is associated with a CpG island at the <START:ggp> 5'-end <END> of the gene , and sequence analysis reveals putative <START:ggp> Sp1 and Ap2 binding site/s <END> and absence of <START:ggp> TATA or CAAT motifs <END> . 
Transcription is initiated at one major site . 
Using <START:ggp> deletion constructs <END> , we have defined an <START:ggp> active promoter region <END> of 1056 bp . 
Gel-shift assays revealed that <START:ggp> transcriptional factor <END> ( s ) induced only in response to <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> treatment of <START:ana> human peripheral blood monocytes <END> bind to the <START:ggp> 15-LO promoter DNA <END> . 
Two regions , <START:ggp> DP1 <END> ( <START:ggp> -140 to -92 bp <END> ) and <START:ggp> DP2 <END> ( <START:ggp> -353 to -304 bp <END> ) of the promoter were essential for transcription in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> and <START:ana> human peripheral monocytes <END> . 
Hela nuclear extracts contained a <START:ggp> specific nuclear factor ( s ) <END> binding to <START:ggp> 15-LO promoter DNA <END> which are distinct from those derived from <START:ana> IL-13-treated human peripheral monocyte <END> nuclear extracts . 
In addition , fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) results refined the previous localization of <START:ggp> 15-LO <END> to <START:ggp> human chromosome 17p13.3 <END> . 
Ex vivo activation of <START:ana> tumor-draining lymph node T cells <END> reverses defects in <START:ggp> signal transduction molecules <END> . 
The adoptive transfer of tumor-draining lymph node ( LN ) <START:ana> T cells <END> activated ex vivo with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) mediates the regression of the poorly immunogenic murine melanoma D5 . 
The efficacy of the <START:ana> activated LN cells <END> is augmented when the sensitizing tumor is a <START:ana> genetically modified variant <END> ( designated <START:ana> D5G6 <END> ) that secretes <START:ggp> granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor <END> . 
In contrast to <START:ana> anti-CD3/IL-2-activated LN cells <END> , adoptive transfer of freshly isolated <START:ana> tumor-draining LN T cells <END> has no therapeutic activity . 
To determine whether the acquisition of antitumor function during ex vivo activation is associated with modifications in signal transduction capacity , the protein <START:ggp> tyrosine kinases <END> <START:ggp> p56lck <END> and <START:ggp> p59fyn <END> and proteins of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB family <END> were analyzed in <START:ana> tumor-draining LN T cells <END> . 
The levels of <START:ggp> p56lck <END> and <START:ggp> p59fyn <END> were lower in tumor-draining than in <START:ana> normal LN T cells <END> and production of <START:ggp> tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates <END> was markedly depressed following <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> stimulation . 
After 5-day <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> <START:ggp> /IL-2 <END> activation , levels of <START:ggp> p56lck <END> and <START:ggp> p59fyn <END> and protein tyrosine kinase activity increased . 
Interestingly , the levels of <START:ggp> p56lck <END> , <START:ggp> p59fyn <END> , and tyrosine kinase activity were higher in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> derived from LN that drained D5G6 than they were in those from D5 tumors . 
In contrast , the cytoplasmic levels of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> and <START:ggp> Rel A <END> were normal in freshly isolated tumor-draining LN , as was nuclear <START:ggp> kappaB <END> DNA-binding activity induced by <START:ggp> anti-CD3 mAb <END> or phorbol myristate acetate . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> activated LN cells <END> with <START:ana> D5 tumor cells <END> induced the nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> . 
These findings indicate that the recovery of proteins mediating signal transduction through the <START:ggp> T cell receptor/CD3 complex <END> in <START:ana> LN T cells <END> activated ex vivo was associated with the acquisition of antitumor function . 
Suppression of human anti-porcine T-cell immune responses by <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex class II transactivator constructs <END> lacking the amino terminal domain . 
BACKGROUND : The <START:ggp> class II transactivator <END> ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) is a <START:ggp> bi- or multifunctional domain protein <END> that acts as a <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> and plays a critical role in the expression of <START:ggp> MHC class II genes <END> . 
We have previously demonstrated that a mutated form of the <START:ggp> human CIITA gene <END> , coding for a protein lacking the <START:ggp> amino terminal 151 amino acids <END> , acts as a potent dominant-negative suppressor of <START:ggp> HLA class II <END> expression . 
<START:ggp> Porcine MHC class II antigens <END> are potent stimulators of direct T-cell recognition by <START:ana> human CD4+ T cells <END> and are , therefore , likely to play an important role in the rejection responses to transgenic pig donors in clinical xenotransplantation . 
We were , therefore , interested in examining mutated <START:ggp> CIITA constructs <END> for their effect on porcine <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> expression . 
METHODS : Stable transfectants of the <START:ana> porcine vascular endothelial cell line <END> <START:ana> PIEC <END> with mutated <START:ggp> CIITA constructs <END> were tested for <START:ggp> SLA-DR <END> and <START:ggp> SLA-DQ <END> induction by <START:ggp> recombinant porcine interferon-gamma <END> . 
Transient transfectants of the <START:ana> porcine B-cell line L23 <END> with the mutated <START:ggp> CIITA constructs <END> were tested for the suppression of constitutive SLA-DR and SLA-DQ expression . 
T-cell proliferation studies were performed using highly purified <START:ana> human CD4+ T cells <END> . 
RESULTS : In preliminary studies , we demonstrated that transfection of the <START:ana> PIEC line <END> with full-length human <START:ggp> CIITA constructs <END> resulted in strong expression of <START:ggp> SLA-DR <END> and <START:ggp> SLA-DQ <END> antigens , thus establishing the cross-species effectiveness of <START:ggp> human CIITA <END> in the pig . 
The <START:ggp> mutated human CIITA constructs <END> were , therefore , tested in the pig . 
<START:ana> PIEC clones <END> stably transfected with one of these constructs showed up to 99 % suppression of <START:ggp> SLA-DR <END> and <START:ggp> SLA-DQ <END> antigen induction and marked suppression of <START:ana> SLA-DRA mRNA <END> induction . 
Moreover , transient transfection of the <START:ana> porcine B-cell line L23 <END> showed up to 90 % suppression of constitutive SLA-DR and SLA-DQ antigen expression in 5-8 days . 
In functional studies , <START:ana> interferon-gamma-stimulated PIEC clones <END> transfected with this <START:ggp> mutated CIITA <END> construct failed to stimulate purified <START:ana> human CD4+ T lymphocytes <END> . 
CONCLUSION : <START:ggp> Mutated human CIITA constructs <END> are potent suppressors of porcine <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> expression . 
<START:ana> Macrophages <END> in human atheroma contain <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> : <START:ggp> differentiation-dependent peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> ) expression and reduction of <START:ggp> MMP-9 <END> activity through <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> activation in mononuclear phagocytes in vitro . 
<START:ana> Mononuclear phagocytes <END> play an important role in atherosclerosis and its sequela plaque rupture in part by their secretion of <START:ggp> matrix metalloproteinases <END> ( <START:ggp> MMPs <END> ) , including <START:ggp> MMP-9 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> ) , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> in the nuclear receptor superfamily , regulates gene expression in response to various activators , including 15-deoxy-delta12 , 14-prostaglandin J2 and the antidiabetic agent troglitazone . 
The role of <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> in human atherosclerosis is unexplored . 
We report here that <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> in human atherosclerotic lesions ( n = 12 ) express <START:ggp> immunostainable PPARgamma <END> . 
Normal artery specimens ( n = 6 ) reveal <START:ggp> minimal immunoreactive PPARgamma <END> . 
<START:ana> Human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> monocyte-derived macrophages <END> cultured for 6 days in 5 % human serum expressed <START:ana> PPARgamma mRNA <END> and protein by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting , respectively . 
In addition , <START:ana> PPARgamma mRNA <END> expression in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> increased during phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate-induced differentiation . 
Stimulation of <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> with troglitazone or 15-deoxy-delta12 , 14-prostaglandin J2 in human <START:ana> monocyte-derived macrophages <END> inhibited <START:ggp> MMP-9 <END> gelatinolytic activity in a concentration-dependent fashion as revealed by zymography . 
This inhibition correlates with decreased <START:ggp> MMP-9 <END> secretion as determined by Western blotting . 
Thus , <START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> is present in <START:ana> macrophages <END> in human atherosclerotic lesions and may regulate expression and activity of <START:ggp> MMP-9 <END> , an enzyme implicated in plaque rupture . 
<START:ggp> PPARgamma <END> is likely to be an important regulator of monocyte/macrophage function with relevance for human atherosclerotic disease . 
<START:ggp> Erythropoietin <END> induces tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT5A <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT5B <END> in <START:ana> primary cultured human erythroid precursors <END> . 
We examined signaling by <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> in <START:ana> highly purified human colony forming unit-erythroid cells <END> , generated in vitro from <START:ana> CD34 ( + ) cells <END> . 
We found that <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> induces tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> , <START:ggp> STAT5A <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT5B <END> . 
Tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> reaches a peak around 10 minutes after stimulation and is maximum at 5 U/mL of <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> . 
Tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> is accompanied by the translocation of activated <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> to the nucleus as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) using 32Pi-labeled <START:ggp> STAT5 binding site <END> in the <START:ggp> beta-casein promoter <END> . 
Tyrosine phosphorylation <START:ggp> STAT1 <END> or <START:ggp> STAT3 <END> was not detected in <START:ana> human erythroid precursors <END> after stimulation with <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> . 
<START:ggp> Crkl <END> , an <START:ggp> SH2/SH3 adapter protein <END> , becomes coimmunoprecipitated specifically with <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> from <START:ana> erythropoietin-stimulated erythroid cells <END> ; although it was shown to become associated with <START:ggp> c-Cbl <END> in the studies using <START:ana> cell lines <END> . 
Thus , <START:ana> human erythroid precursors <END> can be expanded in vitro in sufficient numbers and purity to allow its usage in signal transduction studies . 
This report sets a basis for further studies on signaling in <START:ana> primary cultured human erythroid precursors <END> , which in turn contribute to our better understanding in the differentiation processes of <START:ana> erythrocytes <END> and their precursors . 
Oxidative stress suppresses <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> activities in <START:ana> stimulated lymphocytes <END> . 
Effects of oxidative stress on stimulation-dependent signal transduction , leading to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression , were studied . 
<START:ana> Purified quiescent human blood T lymphocytes <END> were subjected to : ( i ) acute exposure to hydrogen peroxide ; ( ii ) chronic exposure to hydrogen peroxide ; and ( iii ) acute exposure to ionizing radiation . 
The cells were then stimulated for 6 h . 
DNA-binding activities ( determined by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ) of three <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> : <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , were abolished in the <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> by all three modes of oxidative stress . 
The <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> exhibited lipid peroxidation only upon exposure to the lowest level of hydrogen peroxide used ( 20 microM ) . 
All three modes of oxidative stress induced <START:ggp> catalase <END> activity in the <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
The only exception was hydrogen peroxide at 20 microM , which did not induce <START:ggp> catalase <END> activity . 
We conclude that : ( i ) suppression of specific <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> functions can potentially serve as a marker of exposure to oxidative stress and its effects on <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> ; ( ii ) lipid peroxidation is only detectable in <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> upon exposure to weak oxidative stress which does not induce <START:ggp> catalase <END> activity ; ( iii ) therefore , <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> DNA-binding activities are more sensitive to oxidative stress than lipid peroxidation . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> -dependent regulation of TGF-alpha and TGF-beta1 expression in <START:ana> human eosinophils <END> . 
<START:ggp> TGFs <END> play important roles in wound healing and carcinogenesis . 
We have previously demonstrated that <START:ana> eosinophils <END> infiltrating into different pathologic processes elaborate <START:ggp> TGF-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> TGF-beta1 <END> . 
<START:ana> Eosinophils <END> infiltrating hamster cutaneous wounds were found to express <START:ggp> TGFs <END> sequentially . 
In this study , we examined the biologic mediators that may regulate the expression of <START:ggp> TGF-alpha and -beta1 <END> by <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
<START:ana> Eosinophils <END> were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and cultured in the absence or presence of <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> . 
Cells were analyzed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry . 
Supernatants from these cultures were assayed for secreted <START:ggp> TGF-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> TGF-beta1 <END> using <START:ggp> TGF <END> -specific ELISAs . 
<START:ggp> IL-3 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> independently up-regulated <START:ana> TGF-beta1 mRNA <END> and product expression by <START:ana> eosinophils <END> in all donors . 
Interestingly , <START:ggp> TGF-alpha <END> production by <START:ana> eosinophils <END> was up-regulated by <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> but was down-regulated by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> . 
Consistent with the ability of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> to regulate eosinophil responses , <START:ggp> IL-4 signaling molecules <END> are present in <START:ana> human eosinophils <END> . 
The observation that <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> can differentially regulate the expression of <START:ggp> TGF-alpha <END> and <START:ggp> TGF-beta1 <END> suggests that <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> may serve as a physiologic molecular switch of <START:ggp> TGF <END> expression by the infiltrating <START:ana> eosinophils <END> in wound healing and carcinogenesis . 
MLL and <START:ggp> CALM <END> are fused to <START:ggp> AF10 <END> in morphologically distinct subsets of acute leukemia with <START:ggp> translocation t ( 10 ; 11 ) <END> : both rearrangements are associated with a poor prognosis . 
The <START:ggp> translocation t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p13 ; q14 ) <END> has been observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) as well as acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . 
A recent study showed a <START:ggp> MLL/AF10 fusion <END> in all cases of AML with <START:ggp> t ( 10 ; 11 ) <END> and various breakpoints on <START:ggp> chromosome 11 <END> ranging from <START:ggp> q13 <END> to <START:ggp> q23 <END> . 
We recently cloned <START:ggp> CALM <END> ( <START:ggp> Clathrin Assembly Lymphoid Myeloid leukemia gene <END> ) , the fusion partner of <START:ggp> AF10 <END> at <START:ggp> 11q14 <END> in the <START:ana> monocytic cell line U937 <END> . 
To further define the role of these genes in acute leukemias , 10 cases ( 9 AML and 1 ALL ) with cytogenetically proven <START:ggp> t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p12-14 ; q13-21 ) <END> and well-characterized morphology , immunophenotype , and clinical course were analyzed . 
Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) was performed with 2 <START:ggp> YACs <END> flanking the <START:ggp> CALM region <END> , a <START:ggp> YAC contig <END> of the <START:ggp> MLL region <END> , and a <START:ggp> YAC <END> spanning the <START:ggp> AF10 <END> breakpoint . 
Rearrangement of at least one of these genes was detected in all cases with balanced <START:ggp> t ( 10 ; 11 ) <END> . 
In 4 cases , including 3 AML with immature morphology ( 1 AML-M0 and 2 AML-M1 ) and 1 ALL , the signals of the <START:ggp> CALM YACS <END> were separated in interphase cells , indicating a translocation breakpoint within the <START:ggp> CALM region <END> . 
MLL was rearranged in 3 AML with myelomonocytic differentiation ( 2 AML-M2 and 1 AML-M5 ) , including 1 secondary AML . 
In all 3 cases , a characteristic immunophenotype was identified ( <START:ggp> CD4+ <END> , <START:ggp> CD13 <END> - , CD33+ , CD65s+ ) . 
AF-10 was involved in 5 of 6 evaluable cases , including 1 case without detectable <START:ggp> CALM <END> or MLL rearrangement . 
In 2 complex translocations , none of the three genes was rearranged . 
All cases had a remarkably poor prognosis , with a mean survival of 9.6 +/- 6.6 months . 
For the 7 AML cases that were uniformly treated according to the AMLCG86/92 protocols , disease-free and overall survival was significantly worse than for the overall study group ( P = .03 and P = .01 , respectively ) . 
We conclude that the <START:ggp> t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p13 ; q14 ) <END> indicates <START:ggp> CALM and MLL rearrangements <END> in morphologically distinct subsets of acute leukemia and may be associated with a poor prognosis . 
The role of <START:ggp> E-proteins <END> in B- and T-lymphocyte development . 
Department of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> from <START:ana> hematopoietic stem cells <END> is controlled , in part , by the activity of <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory proteins <END> . 
In particular , one class of <START:ggp> helix-loop-helix proteins <END> , termed <START:ggp> E-proteins <END> , have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression during B-cell development . 
Recent analysis of gene-targeted mice has allowed a direct assessment of the functional roles of <START:ggp> several E-protein family members <END> in hematopoiesis . 
In this review we describe the defects in B- and T- lymphocyte development in mice carrying targeted mutations in the <START:ggp> E-protein genes <END> and discuss our current understanding of the role of these proteins in lymphoid development 
<START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus-transforming protein <END> <START:ggp> latent infection membrane protein 1 <END> activates <START:ggp> transcription factor NF-kappaB <END> through a pathway that includes the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-inducing kinase <END> and the <START:ggp> IkappaB kinases <END> <START:ggp> IKKalpha <END> and <START:ggp> IKKbeta <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein <END> <START:ggp> latent infection membrane protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> ) is a constitutively aggregated <START:ggp> pseudo-tumor necrosis factor receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNFR <END> ) that activates <START:ggp> transcription factor NF-kappaB <END> through two sites in its <START:ggp> C-terminal cytoplasmic domain <END> . 
One site is similar to activated <START:ggp> TNFRII <END> in associating with <START:ggp> TNFR-associated factors <END> <START:ggp> TRAF1 <END> and <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> , and the second site is similar to <START:ggp> TNFRI <END> in associating with the <START:ggp> TNFRI death domain interacting protein <END> <START:ggp> TRADD <END> . 
<START:ggp> TNFRI <END> has been recently shown to activate <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> through association with <START:ggp> TRADD <END> , <START:ggp> RIP <END> , and <START:ggp> TRAF2 <END> ; activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappaB-inducing kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> NIK <END> ) ; activation of the <START:ggp> IkappaB alpha kinases <END> ( <START:ggp> IKKalpha <END> and <START:ggp> IKKbeta <END> ) ; and phosphorylation of <START:ggp> IkappaB alpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> IkappaB alpha <END> phosphorylation on Ser-32 and Ser-36 is followed by its degradation and <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
In this report , we show that <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation by <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> or by each of its <START:ggp> effector sites <END> is mediated by a pathway that includes <START:ggp> NIK <END> , <START:ggp> IKKalpha <END> , and <START:ggp> IKKbeta <END> . 
<START:ggp> Dominant negative mutants <END> of <START:ggp> NIK <END> , <START:ggp> IKKalpha <END> , or <START:ggp> IKKbeta <END> substantially inhibited <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation by <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> or by each of its <START:ggp> effector sites <END> . 
Targeted disruption of the <START:ggp> MyD88 gene <END> results in loss of IL-1- and IL-18-mediated function . 
<START:ggp> MyD88 <END> , originally isolated as a myeloid differentiation <START:ggp> primary response gene <END> , is shown to act as an adaptor in <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> ) signaling by interacting with both the <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor complex <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor-associated kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> IRAK <END> ) . 
Mice generated by gene targeting to lack <START:ggp> MyD88 <END> have defects in T cell proliferation as well as induction of acute phase proteins and <START:ggp> cytokines <END> in response to <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> . 
Increases in <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> production and natural killer cell activity in response to <START:ggp> IL-18 <END> are abrogated . 
In vivo Th1 response is also impaired . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> IL-18 <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> c-Jun N-terminal kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> JNK <END> ) is blocked in <START:ana> MyD88-/- Th1-developing cells <END> . 
Taken together , these results demonstrate that <START:ggp> MyD88 <END> is a critical component in the signaling cascade that is mediated by <START:ggp> IL-1 receptor <END> as well as <START:ggp> IL-18 receptor <END> . 
Ciprofloxacin induces an immunomodulatory stress response in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> . 
Exposure of cells to adverse environmental conditions invokes a genetically programmed series of events resulting in the induction of <START:ggp> specific genes <END> . 
The fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin has recently been reported to upregulate <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) gene induction . 
In the present investigation , the effect of ciprofloxacin at supratherapeutic concentrations on immediate-early ( < 2 h ) gene expression in <START:ana> primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> was studied with Northern blots . 
In addition , transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> metallothionein enhancer and promoter regions <END> and <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> were analyzed by <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase <END> ( <START:ggp> CAT <END> ) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays , respectively . 
The concentration of <START:ana> c-fos , c-jun , c-myc , junB , and fra-1 mRNAs <END> was increased in activated <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> incubated with ciprofloxacin compared to that in untreated controls . 
Ciprofloxacin increased <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity in stimulated lymphocytes transfected with <START:ana> plasmids <END> containing either the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> or <START:ggp> metallothionein enhancer <END> . 
Furthermore , among the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> tested , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity was increased in <START:ana> stimulated purified T helper lymphocytes <END> incubated with ciprofloxacin compared to <START:ana> drug-free controls <END> . 
Taken together , ciprofloxacin increased the levels of <START:ana> immediate-early transcripts <END> , enhanced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> metallothionein <END> promoter induction , and upregulated <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> concentrations in <START:ana> primary lymphocytes <END> , reflecting a program commonly observed in mammalian stress responses . 
A novel <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR <END> ) -selective antagonist inhibits differentiation and apoptosis of <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> : implications of <START:ggp> RARalpha <END> -mediated signals in <START:ana> myeloid leukemic cells <END> . 
Retinoic acid ( RA ) induces <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> to differentiate terminally into <START:ana> mature granulocytes <END> , which subsequently die by apoptosis . 
The biological effects of RA are mediated by two distinct families of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> : <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RARs <END> ) and <START:ggp> retinoid X receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> RXRs <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> RARs <END> and <START:ggp> RXRs <END> form <START:ggp> heterodimers <END> and regulate retinoid-mediated gene expression . 
We have recently developed a novel <START:ggp> RAR <END> -selective antagonist ( ER27191 ) which prevents <START:ggp> RAR <END> activation by retinoids . 
Using this RAR-selective antagonist , and <START:ggp> RXR <END> and <START:ggp> RAR <END> agonist , we demonstrate the <START:ggp> RAR <END> -mediated signaling pathway is important for differentiation and apoptosis of <START:ana> myeloid leukemic cells <END> . 
Simple activation of <START:ggp> RXRs <END> is not sufficient to induce apoptosis of the cells . 
Interestingly , the combination of the RAR-selective antagonist and 9-cis RA resulted in partial differentiation and apoptosis of <START:ana> HL-60 and NB4 cells <END> , whereas the <START:ggp> RAR <END> antagonist completely blocked all-trans RA-induced differentiation and apoptosis of the cells . 
Additional experiments showed that levels of <START:ggp> BCL-2 protein <END> decreased during differentiation of <START:ana> myeloid leukemic cells <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> transduced with a <START:ggp> bcl-2 expression vector <END> showed the same differentiation response to retinoids as did <START:ana> parental HL-60 cells <END> even though apoptosis was inhibited in these <START:ana> bcl-2-transduced cells <END> , suggesting that differentiation and apoptosis are regulated independently in <START:ana> myeloid leukemic cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Thrombopoietin <END> supports in vitro erythroid differentiation via its specific receptor <START:ggp> c-Mpl <END> in a <START:ana> human leukemia cell line <END> . 
<START:ggp> Thrombopoietin <END> ( <START:ggp> TPO <END> ) acts on megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis in vitro and in vivo . 
We isolated a novel subline , <START:ana> UT-7/GMT <END> , from the <START:ana> human leukemia cell line UT-7/GM <END> ( N. Komatsu , et al. , Blood , 89 : 4021-4033 , 1997 ) . 
A small population of <START:ana> UT-7/GM cells <END> positively stained for <START:ggp> hemoglobin <END> ( <START:ggp> Hb <END> ) after a 7-day exposure to <START:ggp> TPO <END> . 
More than 50 % of <START:ana> TPO-treated UT-7/GMT cells <END> positively stained for <START:ggp> Hb <END> . 
Using <START:ana> UT-7/GMT cells <END> , we examined how <START:ggp> TPO <END> promotes hemoglobinization . 
<START:ggp> TPO <END> induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> TPO <END> receptor but not the <START:ggp> erythropoietin ( EPO ) receptor <END> . 
There was no competition between <START:ggp> TPO <END> and <START:ggp> EPO <END> for binding to <START:ggp> EPO receptor <END> . 
These findings suggest that <START:ggp> TPO <END> has a direct effect on hemoglobinization via a specific receptor on <START:ana> UT-7/GMT cells <END> . 
Isoelectric focusing demonstrated that <START:ggp> TPO <END> induced fetal and adult Hb synthesis , whereas <START:ggp> EPO <END> induced embryonic , fetal , and adult Hb synthesis . 
Thus , our data suggest that <START:ggp> TPO <END> has a distinct action on erythropoiesis . 
Role of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> in proliferation and differentiation of definitive <START:ana> erythroid and megakaryocytic cells <END> in vivo . 
To elucidate the contributions of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> to definitive hematopoiesis in vivo , we have examined adult mice that were rendered genetically defective in <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> synthesis ( Takahashi et al , J Biol Chem 272 : 12611 , 1997 ) . 
Because the <START:ggp> GATA-1 gene <END> is located on the <START:ggp> X chromosome <END> , which is randomly inactivated in every cell , heterozygous females can bear either an active wild-type or mutant ( referred to as <START:ggp> GATA-1.05 <END> ) <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> allele , consequently leading to variable anemic severity . 
These heterozygous mutant mice usually developed normally , but they began to die after 5 months . 
These affected animals displayed marked splenomegaly , anemia , and thrombocytopenia . 
<START:ana> Proerythroblasts <END> and <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> massively accumulated in the spleens of the heterozygotes , and we showed that the <START:ggp> neomycin resistance gene <END> ( which is the positive selection marker in <START:ana> ES cells <END> ) was expressed profusely in the abnormally abundant cells generated in the <START:ggp> GATA-1.05 <END> mutant females . 
We also observed hematopoiesis outside of the bone marrow in the affected mutant mice . 
These data suggest that a small number of <START:ana> GATA-1.05 mutant hematopoietic progenitor cells <END> begin to proliferate vigorously during early adulthood , but because the cells are unable to terminally differentiate , this leads to progenitor proliferation in the spleen and consequently death . 
Thus , <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> plays important in vivo roles for directing definitive <START:ana> hematopoietic progenitors <END> to differentiate along both the erythroid and megakaryocytic pathways . 
The <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> heterozygous mutant mouse shows a phenotype that is analogous to human myelodysplastic syndrome and thus may serve as a useful model for this disorder . 
Differential regulation of the <START:ggp> Janus kinase <END> <START:ggp> -STAT <END> pathway and biologic function of <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> in <START:ana> primary human NK and T cells <END> : a comparative study with <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-13 <END> , a cytokine similar to <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , is a regulator of human B cell and monocyte functions . 
Biologic effects of <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> on <START:ana> primary human NK and T cells <END> have not been well defined . 
We demonstrate that , in <START:ana> primary NK cells <END> , <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> , but not <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , may induce low levels of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> secretion . 
When <START:ana> NK cells <END> were costimulated with <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> generally resulted in two types of reactivity : <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> synergized with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> to stimulate <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> production or it modestly inhibited <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> production . 
In both types of donors , the effect of <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> on <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> production was in marked contrast to the strong inhibition seen with <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> in <START:ana> NK cells <END> . 
Additionally , <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> suppresses IL-2-induced NK cytolytic and proliferative activities although less efficiently than <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> . 
In <START:ana> T cells <END> , <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> inhibits anti-CD3 mAb/IL-2- or PHA-mediated IFN-gamma production and enhances cytolytic potential . 
Furthermore , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> , like <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , induces distinct <START:ggp> STAT6-DNA binding complexes <END> and tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> and <START:ggp> Janus kinase 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> ) in NK and <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
We observed that Abs directed against unique domains of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> have differential effects on complexes in <START:ana> T cells <END> but not in <START:ana> NK cells <END> , suggesting different <START:ggp> STAT6 isoforms <END> . 
These findings show that <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> have the ability to regulate NK and T cell activation and that <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> is a potent regulator of <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> and <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> in these cell types . 
The human toll signaling pathway : divergence of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> and <START:ggp> JNK <END> <START:ggp> /SAPK <END> activation upstream of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 <END> ( <START:ggp> TRAF6 <END> ) . 
The human homologue of <START:ggp> Drosophila Toll <END> ( <START:ggp> hToll <END> ) is a recently cloned receptor of the <START:ggp> interleukin 1 receptor ( IL-1R ) superfamily <END> , and has been implicated in the activation of adaptive immunity . 
Signaling by <START:ggp> hToll <END> is shown to occur through sequential recruitment of the <START:ggp> adapter molecule <END> <START:ggp> MyD88 <END> and the <START:ggp> IL-1R-associated kinase <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tumor necrosis factor receptor-activated factor 6 <END> ( <START:ggp> TRAF6 <END> ) and the <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) -inducing kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> NIK <END> ) are both involved in subsequent steps of <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> activation . 
Conversely , a dominant negative version of <START:ggp> TRAF6 <END> failed to block <START:ggp> hToll <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases <END> , thus suggesting an early divergence of the two pathways . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> activation attenuates apoptosis resistance in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Death-inducing ligands <END> ( <START:ggp> DILs <END> ) such as <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> ) or the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin have been shown to activate a <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappaB <END> ( <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> ) -dependent program that may rescue cells from apoptosis induction . 
We demonstrate here that <START:ggp> TRAIL <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand <END> ) , a recently identified <START:ggp> DIL <END> , also activates <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> in lymphoid cell lines in a kinetic similar to <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activity is independent from <START:ggp> FADD <END> , <START:ggp> caspases <END> , and apoptosis induction . 
To study the influence of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activity on apoptosis mediated by <START:ggp> TRAIL <END> , CD95 , <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> , or doxorubicin , <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activation was inhibited using the <START:ggp> proteasome <END> inhibitor N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-norleucinal or transient overexpression of <START:ggp> mutant IkappaBalpha <END> . 
Sensitivity for induction of apoptosis was markedly increased by these treatments in apoptosis sensitive <START:ana> cell lines <END> . 
Moreover , both in cell lines and in primary leukemia cells that are resistant towards induction of apoptosis by <START:ggp> DILs <END> and doxorubicin , antagonization of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activity partially restored apoptosis sensitivity . 
These data suggest that inhibition of <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> activation may provide a molecular approach to increase apoptosis sensitivity in anticancer treatment . 
Loss- and gain-of-function mutations reveal an important role of <START:ggp> BSAP <END> ( <START:ggp> Pax-5 <END> ) at the start and end of B cell differentiation . 
<START:ggp> Pax-5 <END> codes for the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> BSAP <END> which is expressed throughout B cell development except in <START:ana> terminally differentiated plasma cells <END> . 
Gene targeting experiments in the mouse revealed a differential dependency of fetal and adult B-lymphopoiesis on this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> BSAP <END> is required for B-lineage commitment in the fetal liver and for progression beyond an early pro-B cell stage in adult bone marrow . 
The characterization of <START:ana> Pax-5-deficient pro-B cells <END> demonstrated an important role of <START:ggp> BSAP <END> in the regulation of the <START:ggp> CD19 <END> , <START:ggp> mb-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> Ig alpha <END> ) and <START:ggp> N-myc genes <END> as well as in the developmental pathway controlling VH-to-DHJH recombination at the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) locus <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human PAX-5 gene <END> was recently shown to participate together with the <START:ggp> IgH locus <END> in the chromosomal translocation <START:ggp> t ( 9 ; 14 ) ( p13 ; q32 ) <END> . 
This translocation is characteristic of a small subset of non-Hodgkin lymphomas exhibiting plasmacytoid differentiation . 
The <START:ggp> translocated PAX-5 gene <END> is deregulated by the insertion of <START:ggp> IgH regulatory elements <END> into its <START:ggp> 5 ' region <END> , which may contribute to tumorigenesis by interfering with the shut-down of <START:ggp> PAX-5 <END> transcription and thus with the completion of <START:ana> plasma cell <END> differentiation 
Acetylation and modulation of <START:ggp> erythroid Kruppel-like factor <END> ( <START:ggp> EKLF <END> ) activity by interaction with <START:ggp> histone acetyltransferases <END> . 
<START:ggp> Erythroid Kruppel-like factor <END> ( <START:ggp> EKLF <END> ) is a <START:ggp> red cell-specific transcriptional activator <END> that is crucial for consolidating the switch to high levels of adult <START:ggp> beta-globin <END> expression during erythroid ontogeny . 
<START:ggp> EKLF <END> is required for integrity of the chromatin structure at the <START:ggp> beta-like globin locus <END> , and it interacts with a <START:ggp> positive-acting factor <END> in vivo . 
We find that <START:ggp> EKLF <END> is an <START:ggp> acetylated transcription factor <END> , and that it interacts in vivo with <START:ggp> CBP <END> , <START:ggp> p300 <END> , and <START:ggp> P/CAF <END> . 
However , its interactions with these <START:ggp> histone acetyltransferases <END> are not equivalent , as <START:ggp> CBP <END> and <START:ggp> p300 <END> , but not <START:ggp> P/CAF <END> , utilize <START:ggp> EKLF <END> as a substrate for in vitro acetylation within its trans- <START:ggp> activation region <END> . 
The functional effects of these interactions are that <START:ggp> CBP <END> and <START:ggp> p300 <END> , but not <START:ggp> P/CAF <END> , enhance <START:ggp> EKLF <END> 's transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> beta-globin promoter <END> in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> . 
These results establish <START:ggp> EKLF <END> as a <START:ggp> tissue-specific transcription factor <END> that undergoes post-translational acetylation and suggest a mechanism by which <START:ggp> EKLF <END> is able to alter <START:ggp> chromatin <END> structure and induce <START:ggp> beta-globin <END> expression within the <START:ggp> beta-like globin cluster <END> . 
Recognition of <START:ggp> herpes simplex virus type 2 tegument proteins <END> by <START:ana> CD4 T cells <END> infiltrating human genital herpes lesions . 
The local cellular immune response to herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) is important in the control of recurrent HSV infection . 
The antiviral functions of <START:ana> infiltrating CD4-bearing T cells <END> may include cytotoxicity , inhibition of viral growth , <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> secretion , and support of humoral and CD8 responses . 
The antigens recognized by many <START:ana> HSV-specific CD4 T cells <END> localizing to genital HSV-2 lesions are unknown . 
<START:ana> T cells <END> recognizing antigens encoded within map units 0.67 to 0.73 of <START:ggp> HSV DNA <END> are frequently recovered from herpetic lesions . 
Expression cloning with this region of DNA now shows that <START:ggp> tegument protein <END> <START:ggp> VP22 <END> and the <START:ggp> viral dUTPase <END> , encoded by <START:ggp> genes UL49 and UL50 <END> , respectively , are <START:ggp> T-cell antigens <END> . 
Separate <START:ggp> epitopes <END> in <START:ggp> VP22 <END> were defined for <START:ana> T-cell clones <END> from each of three patients . 
Reactivity with the <START:ggp> tegument protein <END> encoded by <START:ggp> UL21 <END> was identified for an additional patient . 
Three new epitopes were identified in <START:ggp> VP16 <END> , a <START:ggp> tegument protein <END> associated with <START:ggp> VP22 <END> . 
Some <START:ana> tegument-specific CD4 T-cell clones <END> exhibited cytotoxic activity against <START:ana> HSV-infected cells <END> . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> herpes simplex tegument proteins <END> are processed for antigen presentation in vivo and are possible candidate compounds for herpes simplex vaccines . 
<START:ggp> Fibrinogen <END> activates <START:ggp> NF-kappa B transcription factors <END> in <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> . 
Adhesion to extracellular matrices is known to modulate leukocyte activation , although the mechanisms are not fully understood . 
<START:ana> Mononuclear phagocytes <END> are exposed to fibrinous provisional matrix throughout migration into inflammatory foci , so this study was undertaken to determine whether fibrinogen triggers activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B transcription factors <END> . 
<START:ana> U937 cells <END> differentiated with PMA in <START:ana> nonadherent culture <END> were shown to express two <START:ggp> fibrinogen-binding integrins <END> , predominately <START:ggp> CD11b/CD18 <END> , and to a lesser extent , <START:ggp> CD11c/CD18 <END> . 
Cells stimulated with <START:ggp> fibrinogen <END> ( 10-100 microg/ml ) /Mn2+ ( 50 microM ) for 2 h were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation , minimal in <START:ana> unstimulated cells <END> , was substantially up-regulated by <START:ggp> fibrinogen <END> . 
<START:ggp> Fibrinogen <END> also caused activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , but not <START:ggp> SP1 <END> or <START:ggp> cAMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) factors <END> . 
Blocking <START:ggp> mAbs <END> against <START:ggp> CD18 <END> and <START:ggp> CD11b <END> abrogated <START:ggp> fibrinogen <END> -induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
To determine the effects on transcriptional regulation , <START:ana> U937 cells <END> were transfected with a plasmid containing the <START:ggp> HIV-1 enhancer <END> ( bearing two <START:ggp> NF-kappa B sites <END> ) coupled to a <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter <END> . 
Cells were subsequently stimulated with 1 ) PMA for 24 h , inducing <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity by 2.6-fold , 2 ) <START:ggp> fibrinogen <END> /Mn2+ for 2 h , inducing <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity by 3.2-fold , or 3 ) costimulation with <START:ggp> fibrinogen <END> and PMA , inducing 5.7-fold the <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity induced by PMA alone . 
We conclude that contact with <START:ggp> fibrinogen-derived proteins <END> may contribute to mononuclear phagocyte activation by signaling through <START:ggp> CD11b/CD18 <END> , resulting in selective activation of <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory factors <END> , including <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
<START:ana> Peripheral blood T cells <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> B cell lines <END> derived from patients with lupus express estrogen receptor transcripts similar to those of <START:ana> normal cells <END> . 
OBJECTIVE : To identify and characterize <START:ana> estrogen receptor ( ER ) transcripts <END> expressed in <START:ana> immune cells <END> of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) and healthy donors . 
METHODS : <START:ana> Peripheral blood monocytes <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> were prepared from patients with SLE ( n = 6 ) and healthy donors ( n = 8 ) . 
<START:ana> T cells <END> were separated into <START:ana> CD4 <END> and <START:ana> CD8 <END> . 
Some <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> were stimulated with estradiol , PMA , and ionomycin . 
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed <START:ana> B cell lines <END> ( n = 7 ) and <START:ana> B cell hybridomas <END> ( n = 2 ) established from patients with SLE and a healthy individual were used as a B cell source . 
These cells were examined for <START:ana> ER mRNA <END> by reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction . 
Amplified <START:ggp> cDNA <END> were sequenced by standard methods . 
RESULTS : In all cells tested , <START:ana> ER mRNA <END> was expressed without prior in vitro stimulation . 
Partial sequences from <START:ggp> exons 1-8 <END> were nearly identical to the published sequence of the <START:ana> human ER mRNA <END> . 
There were no notable differences in the <START:ana> ER transcripts <END> between patients and healthy controls . 
Variant receptor transcripts lacking <START:ggp> exon 5 <END> or <START:ggp> exon 7 <END> , which encodes the hormone binding domain , were identified in the majority of the cells . 
Precise deletion of the exons suggests that they are alternatively spliced transcripts . 
Whether the detected transcripts are translated into functional receptor proteins remains to be determined . 
In vitro stimulation did not affect <START:ana> ER mRNA <END> expression . 
The presence of variants did not correlate with disease activity or medication . 
CONCLUSION : <START:ana> Monocytes <END> , <START:ana> T cells <END> , and <START:ana> B cells <END> in patients express transcripts of the normal <START:ggp> wild type ER <END> and the <START:ggp> hormone binding domain variants <END> in vivo . 
DNA damaging agents induce expression of <START:ggp> Fas ligand <END> and subsequent apoptosis in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> via the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
Apoptosis induced by DNA damage and other stresses can proceed via expression of <START:ggp> Fas ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> FasL <END> ) and ligation of its receptor , Fas ( CD95 ) . 
We report that activation of the two transcription factors NF-kappa B and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> is crucially involved in <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression induced by etoposide , teniposide , and UV irradiation . 
A nondegradable mutant of <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> blocked both <START:ggp> FasL <END> expression and apoptosis induced by DNA damage but not <START:ggp> Fas <END> ligation . 
These stimuli also induced the stress-activated kinase pathway ( <START:ggp> SAPK <END> <START:ggp> /JNK <END> ) , which was required for the maximal induction of apoptosis . 
A 1.2 kb <START:ggp> FasL promoter <END> responded to DNA damage , as well as coexpression with <START:ggp> p65 Rel <END> or <START:ggp> Fos/Jun <END> . 
Mutations in the relevant <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 binding sites <END> eliminated these responses . 
Thus , activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> contributes to stress-induced apoptosis via the expression of <START:ggp> FasL <END> . 
A small , nonpeptidyl mimic of <START:ggp> granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor <END> [ see commetns ] 
A nonpeptidyl small molecule SB 247464 , capable of activating <START:ggp> granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> ) signal transduction pathways , was identified in a high-throughput assay in <START:ana> cultured cells <END> . 
Like <START:ggp> G-CSF <END> , SB 247464 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> multiple signaling proteins <END> and stimulated <START:ana> primary murine bone marrow cells <END> to form <START:ana> granulocytic colonies <END> in vitro . 
It also elevated <START:ana> peripheral blood neutrophil <END> counts in mice . 
The extracellular domain of the <START:ggp> murine G-CSF receptor <END> was required for the activity of SB 247464 , suggesting that the compound acts by <START:ggp> oligomerizing receptor chains <END> . 
The results indicate that a small molecule can activate a receptor that normally binds a relatively large protein ligand . 
Minimal residual disease in acute myelogenous leukemia with <START:ana> PML/RAR alpha or AML1/ETO mRNA <END> and phenotypic analysis of <START:ana> possible T and natural killer cells <END> in bone marrow . 
Here we studied minimal residual disease ( MRD ) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) who have <START:ggp> PML/RAR alpha <END> or <START:ggp> AML1/ETO <END> as well as the phenotypic analysis of <START:ana> lymphocyte subsets <END> involved in antitumor immunity . 
Eight patients in long-term ( LT ; 3 to 15 years ) and 15 patients in short-term ( ST ; up to 3 years ) remission were studied . 
Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT ) assay , the limit of detection was 10 ( -5 ) to 10 ( -6 ) for <START:ana> PML/RAR alpha transcript <END> and 10 ( -4 ) to 10 ( -5 ) for the <START:ana> AML1/ETO transcript <END> . 
Simultaneously , <START:ana> T lymphocyte subsets <END> and <START:ana> NK cells <END> from the peripheral blood ( PB ) and bone marrow ( BM ) were investigated by flow cytometric analysis . 
Four of the eight patients in LT and 7 of the 15 patients in ST remission were MRD-positive . 
Although all MRD-positive patients in LT remission are still until now event-free , 3 of the 7 MRD-positive ( MRD+ ) patients in ST remission soon relapsed . 
The total populations of <START:ggp> CD4 <END> + , <START:ggp> CD8 <END> + and <START:ggp> CD56 <END> + [ possible <START:ana> T-cell <END> and <START:ana> natural killer <END> ( <START:ana> T/NK <END> ) populations ] in the BM of ST patients and MRD+/LT patients were significantly ( p < .01 ) low . 
The <START:ggp> CD8 <END> + <START:ggp> CD28 <END> + population showed the same tendency ( p < .01-.02 ) . 
The <START:ana> T/NK subsets <END> in the BM of MRD-negative ( MRD- ) LT ( MRD-/LT ) patients showed similar numbers of cells as normal volunteers . 
Basically , the total percentage of the <START:ana> CD4+ , CD8+ and CD56+ cell populations <END> in the BM was increased and in the following order : MRD-/LT patients , normal volunteers , MRD+/LT patients and MRD+ or -/ST patients . 
The percentages of the <START:ana> T/NK-cell subsets <END> in the PB were not significantly different among these groups . 
Thus , the difference of the possible <START:ana> T/NK-cell <END> phenotype in the BM may strongly influence clinical and molecular remission . 
These results still remain to be confirmed by further studies of the functional anti-tumor immunity of <START:ana> T/NK cells <END> of AML in remission . 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan can induce <START:ggp> NF-kappaB <END> -dependent activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Tuberculosis has emerged as an epidemic , extended by the large number of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) . 
The major goal of this study was to determine whether the <START:ana> mycobacterial cell <END> wall component mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan ( ManLAM ) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) could activate transcription of HIV-1 in <START:ana> T cells <END> with the use of an in vitro cell culture system . 
These experiments are of prime importance considering that <START:ana> CD4-expressing T lymphocytes <END> represent the major virus reservoir in the peripheral blood of infected individuals . 
Using the <START:ana> 1G5 cell line <END> harbouring the <START:ggp> luciferase reporter gene <END> under the control of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> , it was first found that culture protein filtrates ( CFP ) from M. tuberculosis or purified ManLAM could activate <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR-dependent gene <END> expression unlike similarly prepared CFP extracts devoid of ManLAM . 
The implication of <START:ggp> protein tyrosine kinase ( s ) <END> , <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> and/or <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> was highlighted by the abrogation of the ManLAM-mediated activation of <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR-driven gene <END> expression using herbimycin A and H7 . 
It was also determined , using electrophoresis mobility shift assays , that M. tuberculosis ManLAM led to the nuclear translocation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor NF-kappaB <END> . 
M. tuberculosis ManLAM resulted in clear induction of the <START:ggp> luciferase gene <END> placed under the control of the <START:ggp> wild-type , but not the kappaB-mutated , HIV-1 LTR region <END> . 
Finally , the ManLAM-mediated activation of <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> transcription was found to be independent of the autocrine or paracrine action of <START:ggp> endogenous TNF-alpha <END> . 
The results suggest that M. tuberculosis can upregulate HIV-1 expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> and could thus have the potential to influence the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection . 
<START:ggp> Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat quasispecies <END> differ in basal transcription and <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> recruitment in <START:ana> human glial cells and lymphocytes <END> . 
The generation of genomic diversity during the course of infection has the potential to affect all aspects of HIV-1 replication , including expression of the <START:ggp> proviral genome <END> . 
To gain a better understanding of the impact of <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) sequence diversity on <START:ggp> LTR-directed gene <END> expression in cells of the central nervous system ( CNS ) and immune system , we amplified and cloned <START:ggp> LTRs <END> from <START:ggp> proviral DNA <END> in <START:ana> HIV-1-infected peripheral blood <END> . 
Sequence analysis of nineteen <START:ggp> LTRs <END> cloned from 2 adult and 3 pediatric patients revealed an average of 33 nucleotide changes ( with respect to the sequence of the <START:ggp> LAI LTR <END> ) within the <START:ggp> 455-bp U3 region <END> . 
Transient expression analyses in cells of neuroglial and lymphocytic origin demonstrated that some of these <START:ggp> LTRs <END> had activities which varied significantly from the <START:ggp> LAI LTR <END> in <START:ana> U-373 MG cells <END> ( an <START:ana> astrocytoma cell line <END> ) as well as in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> ( a <START:ana> CD4-positive lymphocyte cell line <END> ) . 
While <START:ggp> LTRs <END> which demonstrated the highest activities in <START:ana> U-373 MG cells <END> also yielded high activities in Jurkat cells , the <START:ggp> LTRs <END> were generally more active in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> when compared to the <START:ggp> LAI LTR <END> . 
Differences in <START:ggp> LTR sequence <END> also resulted in differences in transcription factor recruitment to <START:ggp> cis-acting sites <END> within the <START:ggp> U3 region <END> of the <START:ggp> LTR <END> , as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays . 
In particular , naturally occurring sequence variation impacted <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> binding to an <START:ggp> activating transcription factor/cAMP response element binding ( ATF/CREB ) binding site <END> ( located between the <START:ggp> LEF-1 and distal NF-kappaB transcription factor binding sites <END> ) that we identified in previous studies of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> . 
These findings suggest that <START:ggp> LTR sequence <END> changes can significantly affect basal <START:ggp> LTR <END> function and <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> recruitment , which may , in turn , alter the course of viral replication in cells of CNS and immune system origin . 
<START:ggp> HMG box <END> containing <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> differentiation . 
The identification of the <START:ggp> mammalian sex-determining gene Sry <END> has led to the discovery of a large family of related ( ' <START:ggp> HMG box <END> ' ) <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that control developmental events in yeast , C. elegans , Drosophila and vertebrates . 
In <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> differentiation , several <START:ggp> HMG box proteins <END> play a decisive role . 
<START:ggp> Sox-4 <END> is important for very early B-cell differentiation , while <START:ggp> TCF-1/LEF-1 <END> play a crucial role in early thymocyte development . 
<START:ggp> TCF/LEF proteins <END> have recently been found to constitute a downstream component of the Wingless/Wnt signal transduction pathway . 
In flies , this pathway controls segment polarity ; in Xenopus it controls the definition of the body axis . 
Deregulation of the pathway occurs in several human tumors . 
These insights in the molecular events that are involved in <START:ggp> TCF/LEF <END> function in these organisms may eventually lead to the understanding of the function of these <START:ggp> HMG box proteins <END> in lymphoid development 
Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of <START:ggp> androgen receptor gene <END> mutations in patients with androgen insensitivity syndromes : application for diagnosis , genetic counseling , and therapy . 
Recent studies indicate that mutations in the <START:ggp> androgen receptor gene <END> are associated with androgen insensitivity syndromes , a heterogeneous group of related disorders involving defective sexual differentiation in karyotypic males . 
In this report , we address the possibility of rapid mutational analysis of the <START:ggp> androgen receptor gene <END> for initial diagnosis , genetic counseling , and molecular subclassification of affected patients and their families . 
DNA from <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocytes <END> of six patients from five families with various degrees of androgen insensitivity was studied . 
<START:ggp> Exons 2 to 8 <END> of the <START:ggp> androgen receptor gene <END> were analyzed using a combination of single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing . 
Female family members were also studied to identify heterozygote carriers . 
Point mutations in the <START:ggp> AR gene <END> were identified in all six patients , and all mutations caused amino acid substitutions . 
One patient with incomplete androgen insensitivity was a mosaic for the mutation . 
Four of the five mothers , as well as a young sister of one patient , were carriers of the mutation present in the affected child . 
Our data show that new mutations may occur in the <START:ggp> androgen receptor gene <END> leading to sporadic androgen insensitivity syndrome . 
Molecular genetic characterization of the <START:ggp> variant allele <END> can serve as a primary tool for diagnosis and subsequent therapy , and can provide a basis for distinguishing heterozygous carriers in familial androgen resistance . 
The identification of carriers is of substantial clinical importance for genetic counseling . 
Proliferation index as a prognostic marker in breast cancer . 
BACKGROUND . 
The proliferative activity of tumors has been extensively investigated with different approaches , among which the use of the <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody Ki-67 <END> represents an easy and reliable means of assessing cell proliferation . 
In this study , the proliferative activity of 129 primary breast cancers was investigated , and the results were related to prognosis . 
METHODS . 
Tumor samples , obtained from 129 patients who underwent surgery between January 1987 and December 1988 , were processed for staining by an immunohistochemical procedure ( <START:ggp> avidin-biotin complex <END> ) . 
The median time of observation was 42 months ( range , 31-55 months ) . 
Life-table analysis ( Mantel-Cox ) was used to assess the probability of disease-free survival ( DFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) . 
RESULTS . 
Tumors with high <START:ggp> Ki-67 <END> proliferation indices ( > 20 % ) were associated with a higher 4-year probability of relapse of disease ( 55.3 % versus 79.1 % ; P = 0.003 ) and death ( 71 % versus 95.6 % ; P = 0.00005 ) when compared with tumors with low <START:ggp> Ki-67 <END> values . 
In addition , this proliferative parameter maintained its prognostic significance when the patients were stratified according to lymph node involvement , menopausal status , and <START:ggp> nuclear estrogen receptor <END> content . 
CONCLUSIONS . 
Tumor proliferative activity as evaluated by the <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody Ki-67 <END> seems to be an effective indicator of prognosis in breast cancer for DFS and OS . 
Regulation of the <START:ggp> Ets-related transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> by binding to the <START:ggp> retinoblastoma protein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> retinoblastoma gene product <END> ( <START:ggp> Rb <END> ) is a <START:ggp> nuclear phosphoprotein <END> that regulates cell cycle progression . 
<START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> is a <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor <END> that regulates inducible gene expression during <START:ana> T cell <END> activation . 
In this report , it is demonstrated that <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the <START:ggp> Rb binding sites <END> of several viral <START:ggp> oncoproteins <END> and binds to the pocket region of <START:ggp> Rb <END> both in vitro and in vivo . 
<START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of <START:ggp> Rb <END> and fails to bind to <START:ggp> Rb mutants <END> derived from patients with retinoblastoma . 
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Rb <END> in <START:ana> resting normal human T cells <END> . 
After T cell activation , the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Rb <END> results in the release of <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> , which is correlated temporally with the activation of <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> -mediated transcription . 
Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of <START:ggp> Rb <END> inhibited <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> -dependent transcription during <START:ana> T cell <END> activation . 
These results demonstrate that <START:ggp> Rb <END> interacts specifically with a <START:ggp> lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor <END> . 
This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> production with cell cycle progression in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
<START:ana> Human CD3-CD16+ natural killer cells <END> express the <START:ggp> hGATA-3 T cell transcription factor <END> and an unrearranged <START:ggp> 2.3-kb TcR delta transcript <END> . 
In this study we analyzed the <START:ggp> T cell receptor ( TcR ) delta transcripts <END> expressed by <START:ana> CD3-CD16+ cells <END> and we investigated whether these cells expressed the <START:ggp> hGATA-3 T cell transcription factor <END> and the <START:ggp> recombination-activating gene ( RAG ) -1 <END> . 
Multiple <START:ggp> TcR delta transcripts <END> deriving from an unrearranged <START:ggp> TcR delta gene <END> were detected in both <START:ana> polyclonal and clonal CD3-CD16+ natural killer ( NK ) cell lines <END> . 
Two unrearranged <START:ggp> TcR delta transcripts <END> had a size similar to that of the functional <START:ana> TcR delta mRNA <END> ( 2.3 and 1.3 kb ) found in <START:ana> TcR gamma/delta+ T lymphocytes <END> . 
Sequence analysis of nine different 2.3-kb cDNA clones obtained from NK-derived polyA+ RNA confirmed that they corresponded to an unrearranged <START:ggp> TcR delta gene <END> . 
These cDNA were 2343 bp long and their transcription initiation site was located <START:ggp> 814 bp upstream <END> from the <START:ggp> J delta 1 segment <END> . 
The sequence located upstream of the <START:ggp> J delta 1 segment <END> corresponded to the previously reported germ-line sequence . 
The <START:ggp> J delta 1 segment <END> was correctly spliced to <START:ggp> C delta <END> ; in addition the four C delta exons were found to be already assembled . 
Two polyadenylation sites were present in the <START:ggp> fourth C delta exon <END> . 
However , only that located at the 3 ' end appeared to be utilized in the <START:ggp> 2.3-kb cDNA <END> . 
The expression of <START:ggp> hGATA-3 <END> , a <START:ggp> T cell-specific factor <END> known to be involved in the regulation of the transcription of <START:ggp> TcR delta locus <END> , was analyzed by Northern blot , in cultured <START:ana> NK cell population <END> and clones ( but not in freshly derived cell populations ) . 
All <START:ana> NK clones <END> and cell lines studied were found to express <START:ana> hGATA-3-specific mRNA <END> , suggesting that <START:ggp> hGATA-3 <END> may be involved in the regulation of the unrearranged <START:ggp> TcR delta gene <END> expression in <START:ana> NK cells <END> . 
Finally , no transcription of the <START:ggp> RAG-1 gene <END> could be detected in all <START:ana> NK cell lines <END> or clones analyzed . 
Negative transcriptional regulation of <START:ggp> human interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene <END> by glucocorticoids through interference with <START:ggp> nuclear transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> transcription is affected by several <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> . 
We asked whether dexamethasone ( Dex ) and cyclosporin A ( CsA ) inhibit <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> transcription by interfering with the activity of <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> that bind to the IL-2 promoter . 
Nuclear extracts from <START:ana> primary human T lymphocytes <END> were analyzed by electrophoretic DNA mobility shift assays . 
Both Dex and CsA inhibited the binding of transcription factors <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , but not of <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> and <START:ggp> OCT-1/OAF <END> , to their corresponding sites on the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene promoter <END> . 
To correlate changes in nuclear factor binding in vitro with transcriptional activity in vivo and define the structural requirements for <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> repression , we used transient DNA transfections . 
<START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> were transfected with <START:ggp> plasmids <END> containing either the intact <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> or its <START:ggp> AP-1 , NF-AT , and NF-kB motifs <END> . 
Dex inhibited the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> and the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , but not the <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kB plasmids <END> . 
In contrast , CsA inhibited the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> and the <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , but not the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kB plasmids <END> . 
These results suggest that in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> both Dex and CsA inhibited <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> transcription through interference with <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
We propose that , while maximum inhibition may involve interaction with both <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> is the primary target of Dex . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor kappa B <END> , a mediator of lipopolysaccharide effects . 
Exposure of certain cell types to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) leads to activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) , an <START:ggp> inducible transcription factor <END> . 
One of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> 's unique properties is its posttranslational activation via release of an <START:ggp> inhibitory subunit <END> , called <START:ggp> inhibitor of NF-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> ) , from a sequestered cytoplasmic form . 
This event is also triggered under various other conditions of biomedical importance . 
Other bacterial toxins , <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) , <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> ) , <START:ggp> T cell mitogens <END> , UV light , gamma rays and oxidative stress were reported to induce <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
The activated form of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , which is rapidly taken up into nuclei , initiates transcription from immediate early genes in a wide variety of cell types . 
Most of the target genes for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> are of relevance for the immune response and can be grouped into those encoding <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , <START:ggp> cell surface receptors <END> , <START:ggp> acute phase proteins <END> and <START:ggp> viral genomes <END> , such as that of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) . 
We will discuss recent experimental evidences suggesting that LPS might share a pathway of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation with other inducers of the factor . 
This common pathway may involve reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) as messenger molecules . 
[ The trend of molecular biology study on <START:ana> eosinophils <END> ] 
Recently , many investigators have been interested in the study on <START:ana> eosinophil <END> biology since genes association with <START:ana> eosinophils <END> such as <START:ggp> interleukin-5 <END> or <START:ggp> eosinophil granule proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> EPO <END> , <START:ggp> ECP <END> , <START:ggp> EDN <END> , <START:ggp> MBP <END> , and <START:ggp> CLC <END> ) , were isolated . 
However , the molecular basis for the commitment of progenitors to the <START:ana> eosinophil lineage <END> has not been determined . 
The mechanism by which <START:ggp> eosinophil-specific genes <END> encoding primary and <START:ggp> secondary granule proteins <END> ( e.g . <START:ggp> ECP <END> , <START:ggp> EDN <END> , <START:ggp> EPO <END> , <START:ggp> MBP <END> , and <START:ggp> CLC <END> ) are expressed and regulated during eosinophilopoiesis is also unknown . 
In this paper , I described the characterization of genes encoding <START:ggp> eosinophil granule proteins <END> and the mRNA expression of <START:ggp> GATA-1 binding transcription factor <END> during eosinophil differentiation . 
Characterization of the nuclear and cytoplasmic components of the <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific nuclear factor <END> of <START:ana> activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) complex . 
The <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific transcription complex <END> , <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , is involved in early gene activation in <START:ana> T cells <END> and is assembled from a pre-existing , <START:ggp> T cell restricted cytoplasmic factor <END> and an inducible <START:ggp> ubiquitous <END> <START:ggp> nuclear component <END> within 30 min after activation through the <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> . 
Recent studies have implicated the family of <START:ggp> AP1 factors <END> as components of the <START:ggp> murine NF-AT complex <END> . 
Evidence is provided here that the nuclear component of <START:ggp> human NF-AT <END> contains the <START:ggp> phorbol ester-inducible transcription factor AP1 <END> ( <START:ggp> Jun/Fos <END> ) . 
We further characterize which <START:ggp> AP1 family members <END> can assume this role . 
Antisera to <START:ggp> Fos <END> inhibits <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> DNA binding as does an oligonucleotide containing a <START:ggp> binding site for AP1 <END> . 
Constitutive expression in vivo of <START:ggp> Fos <END> , and to a lesser extent <START:ggp> Fra-1 <END> , eliminates the requirement for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) stimulation , leaving <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> -directed transcription responsive to calcium ionophore alone . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> cJun <END> or <START:ggp> JunD <END> , but not <START:ggp> JunB <END> , also eliminates the requirement for PMA , indicating that many but not all <START:ggp> Jun- and Fos-related proteins <END> functionally activate <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> -dependent transcription in the presence of the cytoplasmic component . 
<START:ggp> NF-AT <END> DNA binding can be reconstituted in vitro using <START:ggp> semi-purified AP1 proteins <END> mixed with cytosol from <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Fos proteins are not needed for this reconstitution , and although <START:ggp> JunB <END> is not functional , it can participate in the <START:ggp> NF-AT DNA binding complex <END> . 
Finally , we have partially purified the cytoplasmic component of NF-AT and show by elution and renaturation from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels that it has a molecular mass between 94 and 116 kDa and may have multiple differentially modified forms . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> mononuclear cells <END> of patients with sepsis . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) hormone-binding activity was studied by a whole-cell method in <START:ana> mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> MNC <END> ) from peripheral blood of 7 patients during the hemodynamic compensatory phase of sepsis . 
4 patients were receiving dopamine , which did not affect the <START:ggp> GR <END> count . 
The patients ' plasma cortisol concentrations were normal or slightly elevated . 
Despite a wide range , the mean <START:ggp> GR <END> count and affinity in <START:ana> MNC <END> from septic patients did not differ from those in normal controls , suggesting that glucocorticoids could still be effective in the hemodynamic compensatory phase of sepsis . 
The impaired <START:ggp> transcription factor AP-1 <END> DNA binding activity in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> derived from subjects with some symptoms of premature aging . 
The study of human disorders known as premature aging syndromes may provide insight into the mechanisms of cellular senescence . 
The main feature of cellular senescence in vitro is cessation of cell proliferation . 
Down syndrome ( DS ) and neuronal ceroid-lypofuscinosis ( NCL ) are clinically characterized by the premature onset of numerous features normally associated with human aging . 
<START:ggp> Phytohemagglutinin <END> stimulated <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> derived from DS subjects showed a statistically significant diminished proliferation capacity in comparison with <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> derived from NCL and healthy individuals . 
We demonstrated , by applying the electrophoretic mobility shift assay , slightly impaired <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> DNA binding activity in <START:ana> NCL lymphocytes <END> and strong in <START:ana> DS ones <END> . 
Our results showed that the same molecular mechanisms of proliferation cessation could exist in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> characterized by replicative senescence and in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> derived from individuals with premature aging syndromes ( Down 
Differential contribution of <START:ggp> herpes simplex virus type 1 gene products <END> and <START:ggp> cellular factors <END> to the activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 provirus . 
We have previously reported that infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) activates expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) provirus in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Activation of the HIV-1 provirus correlated with the activation of binding of <START:ggp> 55- and 85-kDa proteins <END> to the <START:ggp> kappa B enhancer <END> and binding of the <START:ggp> 50-kDa HLP-1 protein <END> to the <START:ggp> LBP-1 sequences <END> of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> . 
Further examination of this system has shown that the inhibition of HSV-1 replication by the antiviral drug acyclovir does not inhibit HSV-1-mediated induction of HIV-1 provirus . 
Surprisingly , the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and HLP-1 binding activities were substantially inhibited in <START:ana> acyclovir-treated cells <END> . 
In the transient-transfection assay , <START:ggp> ICP0 <END> , but not <START:ggp> ICP4 <END> , activated the <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter region <END> and the effect of <START:ggp> ICP0 <END> was greatly enhanced in the presence of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B binding proteins <END> , suggesting that induction of the HIV-1 provirus involves cooperation between the <START:ggp> HSV-1-activated cellular factor <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , and the <START:ggp> virus-encoded transactivator <END> , <START:ggp> ICP0 <END> . 
Transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene <END> by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> is associated with secretion of bioactive <START:ggp> macrophage colony-stimulating factor protein <END> by <START:ana> monocytes <END> and involves activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
<START:ana> Human peripheral blood monocytes <END> ( <START:ana> Mo <END> ) constitutively display the beta-chain of the receptor for <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , whereas expression of the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha-chain <END> is not constitutive but inducible with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
Here we report that binding of <START:ggp> human IL-2 <END> to its binding site leads to transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> macrophage CSF ( M-CSF ) gene <END> in <START:ana> Mo <END> resulting in accumulation of <START:ana> M-CSF mRNA <END> and subsequent release of bioactive <START:ggp> M-CSF protein <END> as demonstrated by ELISA and inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induced release of an activity-stimulating growth of <START:ana> monocyte-type colonies <END> by a neutralizing <START:ggp> anti-M-CSF antibody <END> . 
Transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> M-CSF gene <END> by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> is preceded by enhanced binding activity of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> to its recognition sequence in the 5 ' regulatory enhancer region of the <START:ggp> M-CSF gene <END> . 
Moreover , using a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter ( herpes thymidine kinase ) construct <END> containing the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B consensus sequence <END> , it is shown that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding by an <START:ggp> IL-2-induced monocyte-derived nuclear protein <END> confers reporter gene ( human growth hormone ) activity . 
Taken together , our findings indicate that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induces gene expression of <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> in <START:ana> human blood-derived Mo <END> and provide evidence for involvement of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in transcriptional regulation of this gene . 
Regulation of the <START:ggp> interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 beta ) gene <END> by <START:ggp> mycobacterial components <END> and lipopolysaccharide is mediated by two <START:ggp> nuclear factor-IL6 motifs <END> . 
The cytokines interleukin-1 beta ( <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) are released by <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> in vitro after stimulation with mycobacteria and are considered to mediate pathophysiologic events , including granuloma formation and systemic symptoms . 
We demonstrated that the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall component lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) is a very potent inducer of <START:ggp> IL-1 beta gene <END> expression in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and investigated the mechanism of this effect . 
We localized the LAM- , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - , and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> <START:ggp> -inducible promoter <END> activity to a -131/+15 ( positions -131 to +15 ) DNA fragment of the <START:ggp> IL-1 beta gene <END> by deletion analysis and <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase <END> assay . 
Within this DNA fragment , there were two novel 9-bp motifs ( -90/-82 and -40/-32 ) with high homology to the <START:ggp> nuclear factor-IL6 ( NF-IL6 ) binding site <END> . 
Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the two <START:ggp> NF-IL-6 motifs <END> could be independently activated by LAM , LPS , or <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> and that they acted in an orientation-independent manner . 
DNA mobility shift assay revealed specific binding of <START:ggp> nuclear protein <END> ( s ) from <START:ana> LAM- , LPS- , or TNF-alpha- stimulated THP-1 cells <END> to the NF-IL6 motifs . 
We conclude that the two <START:ggp> NF-IL6 sites <END> mediate induction of <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> in response to the stimuli LAM , LPS , and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> HIV-1 Nef protein <END> inhibits the recruitment of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> DNA-binding activity in <START:ana> human T-cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat <END> , <START:ggp> HIV-1-LTR <END> , contains binding sites for several cellular transcription factors which contribute to <START:ggp> HIV-1 gene <END> expression . 
Our previous studies on the function of the <START:ggp> HIV-1-encoded Nef protein <END> suggested that <START:ggp> Nef <END> may be an inhibitor HIV-1 transcription . 
To determine whether <START:ggp> Nef <END> affects the binding of <START:ggp> cellular factors <END> implicated in HIV-1 regulation , 32P-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the binding sites were incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from <START:ana> Nef-expressing T-cell lines <END> that were not stimulated or were stimulated with <START:ggp> T-cell mitogens <END> . 
We found that <START:ggp> Nef <END> inhibited the recruitment of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> DNA-binding activity in mitogen-stimulated <START:ana> human T-cells <END> . 
Additionally , <START:ana> Nef expressing cells <END> were transiently transfected with a plasmid in which <START:ggp> HIV-1 AP-1 DNA recognition sequences <END> were cloned downstream of the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase <END> ( <START:ggp> CAT <END> ) gene . 
Mitogen-mediated transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> CAT gene <END> in this construct was inhibited in <START:ana> Nef-expressing cells <END> but not in control cells . 
These studies suggest that , by inhibiting <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activation , <START:ggp> Nef <END> may play a role in regulating <START:ggp> HIV-1 gene <END> expression in <START:ana> infected T-cells <END> . 
Regulation of the <START:ggp> beta-globin locus <END> . 
Transcription of the <START:ggp> human beta-globin gene cluster <END> depends upon <START:ggp> upstream regulatory sequences <END> , which are collectively termed the <START:ggp> locus control region <END> . 
Recent studies have provided new insights into how the individual genes of the cluster are regulated through development . 
The crux of transcriptional activation is how the <START:ggp> locus control region <END> communicates with the <START:ggp> gene-proximal regulatory elements <END> . 
Enhancing effect of 17 beta-estradiol on human NK cell activity . 
The in vitro effect of 17 beta-estradiol on NK activity was studied . 
The proliferation and NK activity of <START:ana> YT-N17 <END> ( a <START:ana> human NK-like cell line <END> ) were enhanced by 17 beta-estradiol ( E2 ) , and the enhancement was blocked by tamoxifen ( Tx ) , an antagonist of E2 . 
On the contrary , other steroid hormones such as Tx , progesterone , and testosterone had no effect . 
<START:ana> YT-N17 <END> contained 11.8 fmol/mg protein of <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> ( mean of two independent assays ) , a value which was 5-10-fold higher than that of other <START:ana> hematopoietic cell lines <END> . 
An enhancement of NK activity by E2 was also seen in <START:ana> large granular lymphocytes <END> obtained from normal subjects , and it was again suppressed by Tx . 
These data suggest that E2 is one of the activating factors for <START:ana> NK/LGL cells <END> . 
A <START:ggp> serum response element <END> and a <START:ggp> binding site for NF-Y <END> mediate the serum response of the <START:ggp> human thrombospondin 1 gene <END> . 
The expression of <START:ggp> thrombospondin 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> TSP 1 <END> ) , a member of the <START:ggp> TSP gene family <END> , is rapidly induced by growth factors . 
We tested the ability of <START:ggp> human TSP 1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs <END> to respond to serum in stably transfected NIH-3T3 cells . 
Two transcriptional elements in the <START:ggp> TSP 1 <END> promoter , a distal element at -1280 and a proximal element at -65 , were required for the response of the human TSP 1 gene to serum . 
The distal element contains the 5'-CC ( A + T ) 6GG-3 ' consensus sequence characteristic of a serum-response element ( SRE ) . 
Deletions or mutations in this element reduced the serum response of the <START:ggp> TSP 1 gene <END> by 80-90 % . 
In gel-shift assays , the <START:ggp> -1280 element <END> and the <START:ggp> c-fos SRE cross <END> -competed , whereas their functional and <START:ggp> binding mutants <END> did not . 
The <START:ggp> proximal element <END> contains the sequence 5'-GGCCAATGGG-3 ' , which closely resembles the consensus binding motif for the <START:ggp> CCAAT-binding factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> ( <START:ggp> CBF <END> , <START:ggp> CP1 <END> , <START:ggp> alpha CP1 <END> ) . 
Deletions or mutations in this element also reduced the serum response by 80-90 % . 
Methylation interference analysis of the <START:ggp> -65 region <END> identified a pattern of contacts with <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> resembling that for <START:ggp> NF-Y <END> , and an <START:ggp> NF-Y-binding site <END> and the <START:ggp> proximal TSP 1 element <END> cross-competed in gel-shift assays , whereas their <START:ggp> binding mutants <END> did not . 
Finally , an <START:ggp> abbreviated TSP 1 promoter/5'-flank <END> , containing the <START:ggp> SRE- and NF-Y-binding sites <END> , mediated a serum response that was close in magnitude to that of the <START:ggp> parent promoter <END> . 
We conclude that the serum response of the human <START:ggp> TSP 1 gene <END> requires the coordinated function of an <START:ggp> SRE- and NF-Y-binding site <END> . 
Cell-type-specific transactivation of the <START:ggp> parathyroid hormone-related protein gene promoter <END> by the <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) tax <END> and <START:ggp> HTLV-II tax proteins <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) and HTLV-II Tax proteins <END> are potent <START:ggp> transactivators <END> of viral and cellular gene expression . 
Using <START:ggp> deletion mutants <END> , the downstream <START:ggp> parathyroid hormone-related protein ( PTHrP ) promoter <END> is shown to be responsive to both <START:ggp> HTLV-I and HTLV-II Tax <END> as well as the <START:ggp> AP1/c-jun proto-oncogene <END> . 
Transactivation of <START:ggp> PTHrP <END> by <START:ggp> Tax <END> was seen in <START:ana> T cells <END> but not in <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> or <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
A <START:ggp> carboxy terminal Tax deletion mutant <END> was deficient in transactivation of both the <START:ggp> PTHrP and IL2R alpha promoters <END> but not the <START:ggp> HTLV-I long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) . 
Exogenous provision of <START:ggp> NFkB <END> rescued <START:ggp> IL2R <END> alpha expression but not the <START:ggp> PTHrP promoter <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> HTLV-I Tax <END> , <START:ggp> HTLV-II Tax <END> , and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> transactivate <START:ggp> PTHrP <END> and may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in adult T-cell leukemia . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> Alu sequences <END> in the cell-specific regulation of transcription of the <START:ggp> gamma chain <END> of <START:ggp> Fc <END> and <START:ggp> T cell receptors <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Fc epsilon RI-gamma chains <END> are expressed in a variety of <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> where they play a critical role in signal transduction . 
They are part of the <START:ggp> high affinity IgE receptor <END> in <START:ana> mast cells <END> , <START:ana> basophils <END> , <START:ana> Langerhans cells <END> , and possibly other cells ; a component of the low affinity receptor for <START:ggp> IgG <END> ( <START:ggp> Fc gamma RIIIA <END> or <START:ggp> CD16 <END> ) in natural <START:ana> killer cells <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> ; and part of the <START:ggp> T cell antigen receptor <END> in subsets of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Here we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> gamma chain <END> gene by analyzing the <START:ggp> 2.5-kilobase sequence <END> upstream of the transcription start site . 
This sequence contains a <START:ggp> promoter <END> specific to <START:ana> cells of hematopoietic lineage <END> . 
However , the tissue specificity of this <START:ggp> promoter <END> is only partial because it is active in all of the <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> tested here , regardless of whether they constitutively express Fc epsilon RI- <START:ggp> gamma chain <END> transcripts . 
We have identified two adjacent cis-acting regulatory elements , both of which are part of an Alu repeat . 
The first ( -445/-366 ) is a positive element active in both <START:ana> basophils <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The second ( -365/-264 ) binds to <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> , which appear to be different in <START:ana> basophils <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> , and acts as a negative element in <START:ana> basophils <END> and as a positive one in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Thus , this <START:ggp> Alu repeat <END> ( 90 % identical to <START:ggp> Alu consensus sequences <END> ) has evolved to become both a positive and negative regulator . 
Chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and the human immune system . 
1 . <START:ggp> Blood cell receptors <END> in volunteers with moderately increased body burdens . 
Using <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> ( <START:ggp> mAbs <END> ) and flow cytometry , we studied a variety of <START:ggp> surface receptors <END> on <START:ana> lymphocyte subpopulations <END> of workers with moderately increased body burdens of 2 , 3 , 7 , 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) and of other polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/PCDF ) , expressed here as International-Toxicity Equivalencies ( I-TE ) . 
The hypothesis to be tested was whether or not humans exhibit a similar susceptibility to PCDDs/PCDFs with respect to the <START:ggp> surface receptors <END> found previously to respond to small doses of 2 , 3 , 7 , 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) in Callithrix jacchus . 
These are : <START:ana> helper-inducer ( memory ) T cells <END> ( <START:ana> CD4+CD45R0+CD45RA-CD29highCD11a+ <END> ) , <START:ana> CD20+ B cells <END> , and <START:ana> cytotoxic T cells <END> ( <START:ana> CD8+CD56+/CD57+ <END> ) . 
Furthermore , 68 triple-labellings with <START:ggp> mAbs <END> were performed on the cells of each volunteer to possibly generate further hypotheses . 
It was evaluated whether any of the variables might be used as a biomarker of effects for this class of compounds . 
There were two main goals : ( 1 ) to evaluate whether workers with a moderately increased PCDD/PCDF-body burden [ 25-140 ppt TCDD or 104-522 ppt I-TE in blood fat ] exhibit changes in the <START:ggp> surface receptors <END> of <START:ana> white blood cells <END> , as observed in previous studies in non-human primates , and ( 2 ) to clarify whether persons at the upper range [ 10-23 ppt TCDD or 30-90 ppt I-TE in blood fat ] of the body burden reference values of a not particularly exposed population show detectable deviations in these immunological variables , when compared with persons at the lower and medium range [ 1-3 ppt TCDD or 9-29 ppt I-TE ] of these body burden reference values . 
Regression analysis of our data revealed slight trends for some of the biomarkers ( e.g. CD45R0+ ) . 
With one exception , these were all increases . 
None of the alterations observed are of medical relevance . 
The slight increase in the percentage of <START:ana> CD4+CD45R0+ cells <END> remained significant even after covariant analysis taking age-related changes into account . 
Altogether , the data do not provide any evidence to support an assumption that moderately increased body burdens of PCDDs/PCDFs in adults induce decreases in the cellular components of the human immune system . 
Adult humans certainly are less susceptible to this action of PCDDs/PCDFs than adolescent Callithrix jacchus 
Inhibition of HIV-1 latency reactivation by dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) and an analog of DHEA . 
The initial infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) in most individuals usually results in the establishment of a latent or chronic infection before eventual progression toward acquired immunodeficiency syndrome . 
HIV-1 can also establish a latent or persistent infection in some <START:ana> T cell lines <END> that show minimal constitutive virus expression . 
However , activation of the <START:ana> T cell lines <END> leading to enhanced HIV-1 replication can be induced by <START:ggp> antigens <END> , mitogens , and <START:ggp> cytokines <END> ( <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> [ <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ] , <START:ggp> interleukin 1 <END> , and <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ) . 
Various gene products from other viruses ( HTLV-1 , HSV , EBV , CMV , HBV , and HHV-6 ) can also enhance HIV-1 <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) -driven <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> activity . 
On the basis of these observations , it has been proposed that reactivation of latent HIV-1 harbored in <START:ana> chronically infected T lymphocytes <END> , <START:ana> monocytes <END> , or <START:ana> macrophages <END> plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS . 
So far , there are no drugs or therapy available that can provide protection against HIV-1 latency reactivation . 
<START:ana> ACH-2 <END> , derived from a <START:ana> human T cell line <END> ( <START:ana> CEM <END> ) , is chronically infected with HIV-1 , with low levels of constitutive virus expression . 
<START:ana> ACH-2 <END> can be converted to productive infection by stimulation of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) , mitogen or <START:ggp> cytokines <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) , or infection with HSV . 
Therefore the <START:ana> ACH-2 <END> cell line is a good candidate for studying the effects of drugs on HIV-1 activation . 
Previously , we have reported that DHEA and synthetic analogs of DHEA can be modest inhibitors of HIV-1 IIIB replication in <START:ana> phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Occurrence of a <START:ggp> silencer <END> of the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 gene <END> in naive but not in <START:ana> memory resting T helper lymphocytes <END> . 
In the immune system the first activation of a <START:ana> naive T cell <END> by antigen is a key step in the shaping of the peripheral T cell specificity repertoire and maintenance of self-tolerance . 
In the present study , analysis of the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene <END> activation shows that <START:ana> naive human helper T cells <END> ( <START:ana> cord blood CD4+ T cells <END> , <START:ana> adult CD4+CD45RO- T cells <END> ) regulate <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcription by a mechanism involving both a <START:ggp> silencer <END> and an <START:ggp> activator <END> acting on the <START:ggp> purine-rich IL-2 promoter elements <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT binding sites <END> ) . 
By contrast , memory cells , either in <START:ana> vitro activated helper T cells <END> reverting to a resting state , or <START:ana> CD4+ T ( memory ) clones <END> , or <START:ana> CD4+CD45RO+ T cells <END> isolated ex vivo , no longer have a <START:ggp> silencer <END> . 
Their <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcription seems to be controlled solely by the transition from inactive to active functional state of a <START:ggp> positive transcription factor <END> binding to these promoter elements as well as its cytoplasmic or nuclear location : in <START:ana> resting memory T cells <END> the <START:ggp> activator <END> is located in the cytoplasm and is inactive , whereas in <START:ana> stimulated cells <END> it is functional in promoting transcription and now resides in the nucleus . 
Thus , the regulation of the gene coding for the main <START:ggp> T cell growth factor <END> changes irreversibly after the first encounter of T cells with antigen . 
It is most likely that the presence of a <START:ggp> silencer <END> contributes to the more stringent activation requirements of <START:ana> naive CD4+ T cells <END> . 
Expression of <START:ana> mRNA <END> for the <START:ggp> GATA-binding proteins <END> in <START:ana> human eosinophils <END> and <START:ana> basophils <END> : potential role in gene transcription . 
The expression of the <START:ggp> hematopoietic transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> , and <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> was studied in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> and <START:ana> basophils <END> . 
<START:ana> Eosinophils <END> express <START:ana> mRNA <END> for <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> , and <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> . 
<START:ana> Basophils <END> express <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> and <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> . 
Treatment of <START:ana> HL-60 eosinophilic sublines <END> with either <START:ggp> interleukin-5 <END> or butyric acid increased the expression of <START:ana> GATA-1 mRNA <END> concomitant with the expression of <START:ggp> eosinophil-specific genes <END> , whereas levels of <START:ana> GATA-2 mRNA <END> remained relatively constant . 
The presence of <START:ana> mRNA <END> for these proteins in <START:ana> eosinophils <END> and <START:ana> basophils <END> suggests that gene transcription in these lineages may be regulated by <START:ggp> GATA-binding proteins <END> . 
Oxidoreductive regulation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> . 
Involvement of a cellular reducing catalyst <START:ggp> thioredoxin <END> . 
We have investigated an oxidoreductive regulatory pathway for the DNA binding activity of a <START:ggp> pleiotropic cellular transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> ) , has been investigated by using <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> prepared from the nucleus and the cytosol of the <START:ana> primary human T lymphocytes <END> . 
We show that a cellular reducing catalyst <START:ggp> thioredoxin <END> ( <START:ggp> Trx <END> ) plays a major role in activation of the DNA binding of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> in vitro and stimulation of transcription from the <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> -dependent gene expression . 
We demonstrate evidence suggesting that redox regulation of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> by <START:ggp> Trx <END> might be exerted at a step after dissociation of the inhibitory molecule <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> , a <START:ggp> cytosolic-anchoring protein <END> for <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> . 
To examine the effect of <START:ggp> Trx <END> in intact cells , we performed transient assay with a <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-expressing plasmid <END> under the control of <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) long terminal repeat <END> and an <START:ggp> effector plasmid <END> expressing <START:ggp> human Trx <END> . 
The promoter activity from <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> was greatly augmented by co-transfecting the <START:ggp> Trx-expressing plasmid <END> , whose effect was dependent on the <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> -binding sites . 
These findings have suggested that cysteine residue ( s ) of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> might be involved in the DNA-recognition by <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> and that the redox control mechanism mediated by <START:ggp> Trx <END> might have a regulatory role in the <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> -mediated gene expression . 
These results may also provide a clue to understanding of the molecular process of AIDS pathogenesis and its possible biochemical intervention . 
Synergism between the CD3 antigen- and CD2 antigen-derived signals . 
Exploration at the level of induction of <START:ggp> DNA-binding proteins <END> and characterization of the inhibitory activity of cyclosporine . 
We have demonstrated earlier that the crosslinkage of the <START:ggp> CD3/TCR complex <END> with the <START:ggp> CD2 antigen <END> results in the proliferation of <START:ana> normal human T cells <END> . 
The effect of this synergism was perceptible at the level of induction of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> , a process critical for T cell growth . 
To further understand the molecular and nuclear basis for this synergism , we have explored the induction of <START:ggp> DNA-binding proteins <END> in highly purified <START:ana> normal human T cells <END> signaled via the <START:ggp> CD3 <END> and/or <START:ggp> CD2 proteins <END> . 
The effect of transmembrane signaling of <START:ana> T cells <END> with ionomycin , and/or sn-1 , 2 dioctanoyl glycerol , was also determined . 
The emergence of <START:ggp> nuclear binding proteins <END> was investigated using <START:ggp> interleukin-2 sequence specific oligonucleotide probes <END> in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay . 
Our studies demonstrate for the first time that <START:ggp> CD3 <END> antigen-derived signals and <START:ggp> CD2 antigen <END> -derived signals are synergistic in inducing the emergence of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that bind to the <START:ggp> NF-AT1 , AP-1 , and NF-kB sites <END> located in the <START:ggp> promoter/enhancer region <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> gene . 
Moreover , cyclosporine , at concentrations readily accomplished in clinical practice , was found to inhibit the emergence of these <START:ggp> DNA-binding proteins <END> in <START:ana> normal human T cells <END> signaled via cell surface proteins implicated in antigen-dependent T cell activation and in <START:ana> T cells <END> stimulated by mobilization of cellular calcium and activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> . 
Induced myeloid differentiation of <START:ana> K562 cells <END> with downregulation of <START:ggp> erythroid and megakaryocytic transcription factors <END> : a novel experimental model for hemopoietic lineage restriction . 
The <START:ana> human erythroleukemia cell line K562 <END> can be induced to differentiate along the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages . 
Here we demonstrate that hexamethylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) induced <START:ana> K562 cells <END> to differentiate along a third pathway . 
This was accompanied by downregulation of two <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> normally expressed in <START:ana> erythroid , mast and megakaryocyte lineages <END> . 
Northern analysis demonstrated coordinate downregulation of <START:ggp> alpha globin <END> and <START:ggp> gamma globin <END> in addition to the two lineage-restricted <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> SCL <END> and <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> . 
Proliferation of the <START:ana> K562 cells <END> was also suppressed . 
Clonal assay showed that the suppression was irreversible and appeared analogous to the commitment of <START:ana> murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells <END> to terminal differentiation . 
In contrast to <START:ana> MEL cells <END> , however , <START:ana> K562 cells <END> acquired a macrophage-like morphology and exhibited a complete failure to generate <START:ana> benzidine-positive cells <END> . 
Electron microscopy revealed a marked increase in granules resembling those specific for <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
Surface marker analysis showed that <START:ana> HMBA-induced cells <END> expressed reduced levels of <START:ggp> glycophorin A <END> , <START:ggp> CD5 <END> , <START:ggp> CD7 <END> and <START:ggp> CD11b <END> . 
No upregulation of <START:ggp> megakaryocyte or lymphoid markers <END> occurred . 
Thus the response of <START:ana> K562 cells <END> to HMBA may provide a useful experimental system for studying the molecular mechanisms responsible for downmodulation of lineage-restricted <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> during hemopoietic lineage commitment . 
Activation of <START:ana> primary human T-lymphocytes <END> through <START:ggp> CD2 plus CD28 adhesion molecules <END> induces long-term nuclear expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> highly purified human T-cells <END> via <START:ggp> CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules <END> induces and maintains proliferation for more than 3 weeks . 
This potent <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) -dependent activation does not require <START:ana> monocytes <END> or <START:ana> accessory cells <END> . 
Long-lasting <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> receptivity is associated with high-level expression of the inducible <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor alpha chain ( IL-2R alpha ) gene <END> that is regulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels . 
Increase of <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha gene <END> transcription involves the enhanced binding of the transcription factor <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> to its <START:ggp> consensus sequence <END> in the <START:ggp> 5'-regulatory region <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha gene <END> . 
To dissect the molecular basis for the unusually persistent transcription of the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha gene <END> , we analyzed nuclear <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding to a radiolabeled <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> kappa B-specific oligonucleotide probe during the time course of <START:ggp> CD2 <END> + <START:ggp> CD28 <END> activation . 
Resting T-cell nuclear extracts contained <START:ggp> KBF1/p50 homodimer <END> . 
After stimulation , two new <START:ggp> kappa B-specific complexes <END> were identified as <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> p50-p65 heterodimer <END> and putative <START:ggp> c-Rel homodimer <END> or <START:ggp> c-Rel-p65 heterodimer <END> . 
Both inducible complexes persisted for at least 3 weeks . 
Their relative levels were very similar for the duration of proliferation . 
In parallel , <START:ggp> CD2 <END> + <START:ggp> CD28 <END> activation triggered a significant intracellular thiol decrease , suggesting that oxygen radicals are involved in the signaling pathway of <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> . 
Finally , micromolar amounts of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , an oxygen radical scavenger that efficiently blocked the nuclear appearance of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> , also inhibited <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion , <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> cell surface expression , and T-cell proliferation . 
Together , these results suggest that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> plays an important role in long-term activation of <START:ana> human primary T-lymphocytes <END> via <START:ggp> CD2 <END> + <START:ggp> CD28 <END> . 
Immobilization and recovery of <START:ggp> fusion proteins <END> and <START:ana> B-lymphocyte cells <END> using magnetic separation . 
A new approach to facilitate immobilization and affinity purification of <START:ggp> recombinant proteins <END> and selected <START:ana> human B lymphocytes <END> has been developed . 
Using magnetic beads with attached DNA containing the <START:ggp> Escherichia coli lac operator <END> , <START:ggp> fusion proteins <END> comprising the <START:ggp> DNA-binding lac repressor <END> could be affinity-purified and recovered by gentle elution conditions , such as with a lactose analogue or by enzymatic means using either <START:ggp> deoxyribonuclease <END> ( <START:ggp> DNase <END> ) or <START:ggp> restriction endonucleases <END> . 
The results show for the first time that a <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> can be used for affinity purification of <START:ggp> fusion proteins <END> as exemplified by the specific and gentle recovery of <START:ggp> beta-galactosidase <END> and <START:ggp> alkaline phosphatase <END> from bacterial lysates using immunomagnetic separation . 
The approach was further extended to cell separation by the efficient recovery and elution of <START:ana> human CD37 B lymphocytes <END> from peripheral blood . 
<START:ggp> ras protein <END> activity is essential for <START:ggp> T-cell antigen receptor <END> signal transduction . 
In a <START:ana> Jurkat cell model <END> of T-cell activation an <START:ggp> interleukin-2 promoter/reporter gene construct <END> was activated by <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> agonism in combination with the <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> . 
Antigen receptor signals could be mimicked by suboptimal activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) with phorbol esters in combination with calcium mobilization by an ionophore . 
In cotransfection experiments , oncogenic rats obviated the need for <START:ggp> PKC <END> stimulation but did not replace either the calcium signal or <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> . 
Activated <START:ggp> ras <END> expression also replaced the requirement for <START:ggp> PKC <END> stimulation in activation of the <START:ggp> T-cell transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
A <START:ggp> dominant inhibitory ras mutant <END> specifically blocked antigen receptor agonism , indicating that <START:ggp> ras <END> activity is required for <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> signaling . 
In addition , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> PKC <END> blocked both activated <START:ggp> ras <END> and phorbol ester stimulation , suggesting a role for <START:ggp> ras <END> upstream of <START:ggp> PKC <END> . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> Tat protein <END> of HIV1 in <START:ana> human promonocytic U937 cells <END> . 
Numerous studies have shown that , upon HIV1 infection , <START:ana> human promonocytic U937 cells <END> were induced to differentiate , as indicated , for example , by increased expression of <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> . 
One of the viral proteins involved in this process might be the <START:ggp> Tat protein <END> . 
Indeed , this <START:ggp> viral protein <END> , which is essential for productive infection , has also been shown to display growth-stimulating properties and immunomodulatory activities . 
In order to apprehend the role of the <START:ggp> HIV1 tat gene <END> in inducing the differentiation of <START:ana> HIV1-infected U937 cells <END> , we have successfully introduced this gene into <START:ana> U937 cells <END> by infecting them with retroviral particles transducing <START:ggp> tat <END> . 
The effect of the <START:ggp> Tat protein <END> constitutively expressed by these cells upon their differentiation was then evaluated by looking for the expression of the <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and of the <START:ggp> c-fms proto-oncogenes <END> which are linked to the differentiation of <START:ana> myelomonoblastic cells <END> . 
Northern blot analysis revealed in these cells , an increase in the transcription of these two <START:ggp> proto-oncogenes <END> , and this increase was amplified after treatment with phorbol myristate acetate . 
No such increase was observed in control <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
These results indicate that , among <START:ggp> HIV1 gene products <END> , the <START:ggp> Tat protein <END> appears to trigger monocytic differentiation , and suggests that this <START:ggp> viral protein <END> directs progenitors of the <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage lineage <END> towards a differentiation stage in which production of <START:ggp> viral antigens <END> and virions might be more efficient . 
Analysis of the preexisting and nuclear forms of <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) 3 is an inducible <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> that is essential for transcriptional induction of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> during T cell activation . 
<START:ggp> NF-AT <END> is thought to consist of two components : a <START:ggp> ubiquitous , inducible nuclear component <END> that we have identified as <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun proteins <END> , and a preexisting , <START:ggp> T cell-specific component <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> ) which is the target for the immunosuppressive agents cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 . 
We have previously shown that nuclear extracts from <START:ana> activated T cells <END> form two inducible <START:ggp> NF-AT complexes <END> with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the <START:ggp> distal NF-AT site <END> of the <START:ggp> murine IL-2 promoter <END> , although hypotonic extracts of unstimulated <START:ana> T cells <END> form a single complex containing <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> . 
We show that the ability to detect <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> in a gel shift assay , which is essential for purification and biochemical studies of this protein , is strikingly dependent on the precise sequence of the <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> oligonucleotide used as the labeled probe . 
Moreover we present evidence that the component that forms the faster-migrating ( `` lower '' ) <START:ggp> nuclear NF-AT complex <END> is derived by a calcium-dependent , cyclosporin-sensitive , posttranslational modification of <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> , and that <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> proteins stabilize its interaction with DNA . 
The results are discussed in the context of a model relating the two nuclear <START:ggp> NF-AT complexes <END> to <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> . 
Cell cycle analysis of <START:ggp> E2F <END> in <START:ana> primary human T cells <END> reveals <START:ggp> novel E2F complexes <END> and biochemically distinct forms of free <START:ggp> E2F <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> E2F <END> activates the expression of multiple <START:ggp> genes <END> involved in cell proliferation , such as <START:ggp> c-myc <END> and the <START:ggp> dihydrofolate reductase gene <END> . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> E2F <END> involves its interactions with other <START:ggp> cellular proteins <END> , including the <START:ggp> retinoblastoma protein <END> ( <START:ggp> Rb <END> ) , the <START:ggp> Rb-related protein <END> <START:ggp> p107 <END> , <START:ggp> cyclin A <END> , and <START:ggp> cdk2 <END> . 
We undertook a detailed analysis of <START:ggp> E2F <END> DNA-binding activities and their cell cycle behavior in primary human <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Three <START:ggp> E2F <END> DNA-binding activities were identified in resting ( G0 ) <START:ana> T cells <END> with mobilities in gel shift assays distinct from those of previously defined <START:ggp> E2F <END> complexes . 
One of these activities was found to be a novel , less abundant , Rb- <START:ggp> E2F <END> complex . 
The most prominent <START:ggp> E2F <END> activity in resting <START:ana> T cells <END> ( termed complex X ) was abundant in both G0 and G1 but disappeared as cells entered S phase , suggesting a possible role in negatively regulating <START:ggp> E2F <END> function . 
<START:ggp> Complex X <END> could be dissociated by adenovirus E1A with a requirement for an intact <START:ggp> E1A conserved region 2 <END> . 
However , <START:ggp> X <END> failed to react with a variety of antibodies against <START:ggp> Rb <END> or <START:ggp> p107 <END> , implicating the involvement of an <START:ggp> E1A-binding protein <END> other than <START:ggp> Rb <END> or <START:ggp> p107 <END> . 
In addition to these <START:ggp> novel E2F complexes <END> , three distinct forms of unbound ( free ) <START:ggp> E2F <END> were resolved in gel shift experiments . 
These species showed different cell cycle kinetics . 
UV cross-linking experiments suggested that a distinct <START:ggp> E2F <END> DNA-binding protein is uniquely associated with the <START:ggp> S-phase p107 complex <END> and is not associated with <START:ggp> Rb <END> . 
Together , these results suggest that <START:ggp> E2F <END> consists of multiple , biochemically distinct <START:ggp> DNA-binding proteins <END> which function at different points in the cell cycle . 
Defective translocation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> in <START:ana> multidrug-resistant HL-60 cells <END> confers a reversible loss of phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation . 
Previous studies have demonstrated that <START:ana> human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells <END> differentiate in response to phorbol esters . 
This event is associated with induction of the <START:ggp> c-jun early response gene <END> and appearance of a monocytic phenotype . 
The present studies have examined the effects of vincristine-selected , multidrug resistance on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) -induced HL-60 cell differentiation . 
The results demonstrate that <START:ana> multidrug-resistant HL-60 cells <END> , designated HL-60/vinc , fail to respond to TPA with an increase in <START:ana> c-jun transcripts <END> or other phenotypic characteristics of monocytic differentiation . 
By contrast , treatment of <START:ana> HL-60/vinc cells <END> with okadaic acid , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> serine/threonine protein phosphatases <END> , induces <START:ggp> c-jun <END> transcription , growth arrest , and expression of the <START:ggp> c-fms gene <END> . 
Studies were also performed with an <START:ana> HL-60/vinc revertant <END> ( <START:ana> HL-60/vinc/R <END> ) line that has regained partial sensitivity to vincristine . 
The finding that <START:ana> HL-60/vinc/R cells <END> respond to TPA with induction of a monocytic phenotype , but not <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression , suggests that <START:ggp> c-jun <END> induction is not obligatory for monocytic differentiation . 
Other studies further demonstrate that the <START:ggp> jun-B <END> and <START:ggp> fra-1 <END> <START:ggp> genes <END> are induced by TPA in both <START:ana> HL-60/vinc <END> and <START:ana> HL-60/vinc/R cells <END> , whereas <START:ggp> c-fos <END> expression is attenuated in the HL-60/vinc line . 
Since TPA activates <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) , we examined translocation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> from the cytosol to the membrane fraction . 
Although <START:ana> HL-60 <END> and <START:ana> HL-60/vinc/R cells <END> demonstrated translocation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> activity , this subcellular redistribution was undetectable in <START:ana> HL-60/vinc cells <END> . 
Activity of the <START:ggp> mitogen-activated protein kinase family <END> with associated phosphorylation of <START:ggp> c-Jun Y-peptide <END> was markedly diminished in <START:ana> TPA-treated HL-60/vinc cells <END> , but not in response to okadaic acid . 
Taken together , these findings suggest that vincristine resistance confers insensitivity to TPA-induced differentiation and can include defects in <START:ggp> PKC <END> -mediated signaling events and induction of <START:ggp> jun/fos early response gene <END> expression . 
Molecular basis of a multiple <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> deficiency in a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency . 
We have previously reported that the <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> of a child with severe combined immunodeficiency are defective in the transcription of several <START:ggp> lymphokine genes <END> that include <START:ggp> IL2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL3 <END> , <START:ggp> IL4 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL5 <END> , which encode <START:ggp> interleukins <END> 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> -3 <END> , <START:ggp> -4 <END> , and <START:ggp> -5 <END> ) . 
To determine whether the defect in the patient 's <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> involved a <START:ggp> trans-acting factor <END> common to the affected <START:ggp> lymphokine genes <END> , we examined the ability of <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> from the patient 's <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> to bind response elements present in the <START:ggp> regulatory region <END> of <START:ggp> IL2 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor NF-kB <END> , <START:ggp> activation protein 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) , <START:ggp> OCT-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-IL-2B <END> binding activity were normal . 
In contrast , the binding of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) to its response element in the <START:ggp> IL2 enhancer <END> and to an <START:ggp> NF-AT-like response element <END> present in the <START:ggp> IL4 enhancer <END> was abnormal . 
To ascertain whether the abnormal <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> binding activity was related to an impaired function , we transfected patient and control <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> with constructs containing the reporter gene encoding <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyl transferase <END> ( <START:ggp> CAT <END> ) under the control of the entire <START:ggp> IL2 regulatory region <END> or of multimers of individual <START:ggp> enhancer sequences <END> . 
CAT expression directed by the <START:ggp> IL2 regulatory region <END> or by a multimer of the <START:ggp> NF-AT-binding site <END> was markedly lower in the patient relative to controls . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> CAT gene <END> expression directed by a multimer of the <START:ggp> OCT-1 proximal ( OCT-1p ) -binding site <END> was equivalent in patient and controls . 
These results indicate that an abnormality of/or influencing <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> may underlie the multiple <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> deficiency in this patient . 
FK506 and ciclosporin : molecular probes for studying intracellular signal transduction . 
The immunosuppressants ciclosporin and FK506 block the Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent signal-transduction pathway emanating from the <START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> , thereby inhibiting the activation of <START:ana> helper T cells <END> . 
Using these drugs as probes , chemists and biologists have uncovered several intracellular signalling molecules bridging the generation of second-messenger Ca2+ ions and the transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , among which are <START:ggp> calmodulin <END> , <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> and the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) . 
Hence , Ca2+ binds to <START:ggp> calmodulin <END> , leading to the binding of <START:ggp> calmodulin <END> to <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> ; the activated <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , in turn , may dephosphorylate the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic subunit of NF-AT <END> , resulting in its translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to form a <START:ggp> competent transcriptional activator <END> . 
As described by <START:ggp> Jun <END> Liu , these drugs manifest their effects in an unprecedented fashion . 
They do not directly intercept intracellular signalling molecules . 
Instead , they form tight complexes with two different classes of abundant <START:ggp> cytosolic receptors <END> called <START:ggp> immunophilins <END> upon entering the cell , and consequently inhibit their <START:ggp> peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase <END> activities . 
The two structurally distinct <START:ggp> immunophilin-drug complexes <END> bind to , and inhibit , the <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> activity of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
<START:ggp> p105 <END> and <START:ggp> p98 <END> <START:ggp> precursor proteins <END> play an active role in <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -mediated signal transduction . 
The <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> is composed of two distinct subgroups , proteins that undergo proteolytic processing and contain <START:ggp> SWI6/ankyrin repeats <END> in their <START:ggp> carboxyl termini <END> ( <START:ggp> p105 <END> , <START:ggp> p98 <END> ) , and those without such repeats that do not require processing ( <START:ggp> p65 <END> , <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , <START:ggp> RelB <END> , and <START:ggp> Dorsal <END> ) . 
We demonstrate that the <START:ggp> p105 <END> and <START:ggp> p98 <END> precursors share functional properties with the <START:ggp> I kappa B proteins <END> , which also contain <START:ggp> SWI6/ankyrin repeats <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> p105 <END> and <START:ggp> p98 <END> were found to form stable complexes with other <START:ggp> Rel/NF-kappa B family members <END> , including <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> . 
Association with the precursors is sufficient for cytoplasmic retention of either <START:ggp> p65 <END> or <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , both of which are otherwise nuclear . 
These complexes undergo stimulus-responsive processing to produce active <START:ggp> p50/c-Rel <END> and <START:ggp> p55/c-Rel <END> complexes . 
These observations suggest a second pathway leading to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> induction , in which processing of the precursors rather than phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> plays a major role . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> controls expression of inhibitor <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> : evidence for an inducible autoregulatory pathway . 
The eukaryotic <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) participates in many parts of the genetic program mediating <START:ana> T lymphocyte <END> activation and growth . 
Nuclear expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> occurs after its induced dissociation from its cytoplasmic inhibitor <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
Phorbol ester and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> induction of <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kappa B <END> is associated with both the degradation of performed <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and the activation of <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> alpha gene expression . 
Transfection studies indicate that the <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha gene <END> is specifically induced by the <START:ggp> 65-kilodalton transactivating subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Association of the newly synthesized <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> with <START:ggp> p65 <END> restores intracellular inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA binding activity and prolongs the survival of this labile inhibitor . 
Together , these results show that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> controls the expression of <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> alpha by means of an inducible autoregulatory pathway . 
The <START:ggp> human prointerleukin 1 beta gene <END> requires DNA sequences both proximal and distal to the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> for tissue-specific induction . 
In these studies , we have identified <START:ggp> DNA sequences <END> and specific protein interactions necessary for transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> human prointerleukin 1 beta ( proIL-1 beta ) gene <END> . 
A <START:ggp> cell-type-independent lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -responsive enhancer element <END> located between <START:ggp> -3757 and -2729 bp upstream <END> from the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> ( <START:ggp> cap site <END> ) consisted of at least six discrete subregions which were essential to the maximal induction by LPS in <START:ana> transfected monocytes <END> . 
The enhancer also appeared to mediate phorbol myristate acetate induction in <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> responsiveness in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
Deletion and base substitution mutations along with DNA binding studies demonstrated that the enhancer contained a minimum of three functional <START:ggp> protein binding sequences <END> , two of which appeared to be important for gene induction . 
One of the essential proteins which bound to the enhancer was similar or identical to members of the <START:ggp> C/EBP family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> required for both <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> -and LPS-specific induction of the <START:ggp> IL-6 gene <END> ( i.e. , the <START:ggp> NF-IL6 proteins <END> ) . 
When ligated to the <START:ggp> proIL-1 beta cap site <END> <START:ggp> -proximal region <END> ( located between -131 to +12 ) , both the <START:ggp> proIL-1 beta and the simian virus 40 enhancer elements <END> functioned more efficiently in <START:ana> monocytes <END> than in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , which are not normally competent for <START:ggp> IL-1 beta <END> expression . 
When ligated to the <START:ggp> murine c-fos promoter <END> , however , the <START:ggp> proIL-1 beta enhancer <END> was inducible in <START:ana> phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated HeLa cells <END> , suggesting the existence of a <START:ggp> proIL-1 beta <END> promoter-proximal requirement for tissue specificity . 
<START:ana> Lymphocytes <END> from the site of disease suggest adenovirus is one cause of persistent or recurrent inflammatory arthritis . 
The assessment of synovial lymphocyte reactivity to adenovirus antigen stimulation was undertaken in patients with persistent or recurrent inflammatory arthritis . 
The 3H-thymidine uptake procedure was employed , incorporating multiple <START:ggp> microbiological antigens <END> . 
Five patients were found with repeated maximal responses to <START:ggp> adenovirus antigen <END> ; in one of these <START:ggp> adenovirus nucleotide sequences <END> were present in a synovial biopsy specimen . 
It is concluded that adenovirus may be one cause of persistent or recurrent inflammatory arthritis . 
Expression of <START:ggp> PILOT <END> , a putative <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , requires two signals and is cyclosporin A sensitive in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Few known <START:ggp> genes <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , members of the <START:ggp> IL-8 family <END> , <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ) are induced in <START:ana> T cells <END> only through the combined effect of phorbol myristic acetate ( PMA ) and a Ca ( 2+ ) -ionophore , and expression of only these <START:ggp> genes <END> can be fully suppressed by Cyclosporin A ( CyA ) . 
We have identified a putative <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , designated <START:ggp> PILOT <END> , with an identical dual signal requirement for expression . 
Induction of the <START:ggp> PILOT <END> gene is detectable in human <START:ana> T cells <END> 20 min following activation in the presence of cycloheximide and is fully suppressed by CyA . 
The <START:ggp> PILOT <END> protein has a calculated M ( r ) of 42.6 kDa and contains three <START:ggp> zinc fingers <END> of the <START:ggp> C2H2-type <END> at the <START:ggp> carboxyl-terminus <END> which are highly homologous to the <START:ggp> zinc finger regions <END> of the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> EGR1 <END> , <START:ggp> EGR2 <END> , and <START:ggp> pAT 133 <END> . 
In contrast to <START:ana> T cells <END> , in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> <START:ggp> PILOT <END> gene expression requires only one signal ( PMA ) and is not affected by CyA . 
This observation directly demonstrates the existence of a <START:ggp> Ca2+ signal-dependent regulatory element <END> obligatory for expression of some <START:ggp> genes <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> but not in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
This differential expression model will be valuable in the dissection of the dual signal pathway in <START:ana> T cells <END> and the effects of CyA upon it . 
Antisense oligonucleotides to the <START:ggp> p65 subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> block <START:ggp> CD11b <END> expression and alter adhesion properties of differentiated <START:ana> HL-60 granulocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is a <START:ggp> pleiotropic regulator <END> of a variety of genes implicated in the cellular response to injury . 
This function has been attributed to the coordinated binding of subunits of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> to distinct regions of the <START:ggp> promoter elements <END> of numerous genes , including <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , <START:ggp> growth factor receptors <END> , and <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> . 
Antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to the <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 subunits <END> of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> were used to define the physiologic role of this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> in <START:ana> resting and stimulated granulocytes <END> . 
A reduction in the expression of <START:ggp> p65 <END> was produced by treatment with the phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide . 
This reduction was accompanied by rapid changes in the cellular adhesion of <START:ana> dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 leukemia cells <END> stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) . 
These effects were characterized by a marked reduction in <START:ggp> CD11b <END> <START:ggp> integrin <END> expression on the surface of <START:ana> treated cells <END> . 
Furthermore , the <START:ggp> p65 <END> antisense oligomer effectively abolished an upregulation of <START:ggp> CD11b <END> that was produced by formyl-met-leu-phe and TPA . 
However , the <START:ggp> p65 <END> antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide had no significant effect on the production of reactive oxygen intermediates or on phagocytosis by these cells . 
These findings indicate that antisense oligomers to <START:ggp> p65 <END> can be used to define the role of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in the activation pathways of <START:ana> neutrophils <END> . 
The <START:ggp> p65 subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> regulates <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> by two distinct mechanisms . 
Transcription factor <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> ) is generally localized to the cytoplasm by its inhibitor <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> . 
Overproduced <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> , free from <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , is rapidly degraded . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> p65 <END> increases endogenous <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> protein in both <START:ana> carcinoma and lymphoid cells <END> by two mechanisms : protein stabilization and increased transcription of <START:ana> I kappa B mRNA <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> p65 delta <END> , a naturally occurring splice variant , fails to markedly augment <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> protein levels . 
Both overexpressed <START:ggp> p65 <END> and coexpressed <START:ggp> p50 <END> are cytoplasmic , whereas <START:ggp> p65 delta <END> is partly nuclear , indicating that the <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> induced by <START:ggp> p65 <END> can maintain <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in the cytoplasm . 
Thus , <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> are linked in an autoregulatory loop , ensuring that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is held in the cytoplasm until cells are specifically induced to translocate it to the nucleus . 
Lipopolysaccharide induces phosphorylation of <START:ggp> MAD3 <END> and activation of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> and related <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> proteins in <START:ana> human monocytic THP-1 cells <END> . 
Many effects of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) on gene expression , including that of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> are mediated by activation of kappa B DNA-binding proteins . 
However , the specific members of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factor family <END> involved in the LPS response , and the mechanisms through which LPS-generated signals are transduced remain unclear . 
Here we show that LPS induces nuclear expression of <START:ggp> c-Rel/p50 heterodimers <END> as well as <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) kappa B DNA-binding complexes in <START:ana> human monocytic THP-1 cells <END> . 
Nuclear localization of these proteins occurred concomitantly with a rapid decrease in their cytosolic levels and was independent of <START:ggp> phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C <END> . 
Within 24 h following LPS stimulation there was a striking increase in the levels of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , <START:ggp> p105 <END> , and <START:ggp> p50 <END> in the cytosol . 
The increased levels of these proteins correlated with increases in the amounts of their <START:ana> mRNAs <END> during LPS activation of <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> . 
LPS activation of <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> resulted in phosphorylation of <START:ggp> MAD3 <END> ( an <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> -like protein ) , a rapid increase in <START:ana> MAD3 mRNA <END> , and an increase in <START:ggp> MAD3 <END> protein by 2 h . 
Thus , LPS activation of human <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> results in nuclear expression of <START:ggp> c-Rel/p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) and induces phosphorylation of <START:ggp> MAD3 <END> . 
A <START:ggp> chimeric type II/type I interleukin-1 receptor <END> can mediate <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> induction of gene expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> type I interleukin-1 receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1R <END> ) is capable of transducing a signal resulting in promoter activation in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
This signal transduction is dependent on the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> , which consists of 213 amino acids . 
In contrast to the <START:ggp> type I receptor <END> , the <START:ggp> type II IL-1R <END> has a small <START:ggp> cytoplasmic tail <END> , and it is not clear whether this receptor is a <START:ggp> signal-transducing <END> or a <START:ggp> regulatory molecule <END> . 
Here we report that the <START:ggp> type II IL-1R <END> does not mediate gene activation in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
However , a hybrid receptor composed of the <START:ggp> extracellular and transmembrane regions <END> of the <START:ggp> human type II interleukin-1 <END> fused to the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> of the <START:ggp> human type I IL-1R <END> was capable of transducing a signal across the membrane resulting in a pattern of gene activation identical to that mediated by the <START:ggp> type I IL-1R <END> . 
Our results indicated that the <START:ggp> extracellular domain <END> of the <START:ggp> type II IL-1R <END> was capable of functionally interacting with <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> and transmitting the resulting signal to a <START:ggp> heterologous cytoplasmic domain <END> . 
A mutation of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> in primary cortisol resistance . 
The precise molecular abnormalities that cause primary cortisol resistance have not been completely described . 
In a subject with primary cortisol resistance we have observed <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> hGR <END> ) with a decreased affinity for dexamethasone . 
We hypothesize that a mutation of the <START:ggp> hGR glucocorticoid-binding domain <END> is the cause of cortisol resistance . 
Total RNA isolated from the index subject 's <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> was used to produce first strand <START:ggp> hGR cDNAs <END> , and the entire <START:ggp> hGR cDNA <END> was amplified in segments and sequenced . 
At nucleotide 2 , 317 we identified a homozygous A for G point mutation that predicts an isoleucine ( ATT ) for valine ( GTT ) substitution at amino acid 729 . 
When the <START:ggp> wild-type hGR <END> and <START:ggp> hGR-Ile 729 <END> were expressed in <START:ana> COS-1 cells <END> and assayed for [ 3H ] -Dexamethasone binding , the dissociation constants were 0.799 +/- 0.068 and 1.54 +/- 0.06 nM ( mean +/- SEM ) ( P < 0.01 ) , respectively . 
When the <START:ggp> wild-type hGR <END> and <START:ggp> hGR-Ile 729 <END> were expressed in <START:ana> CV-1 cells <END> that were cotransfected with the <START:ggp> mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat <END> fused to the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) gene <END> , the <START:ggp> hGR-Ile 729 <END> conferred a fourfold decrease in apparent potency on dexamethasone stimulation of <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity . 
The isoleucine for valine substitution at amino acid 729 impairs the function of the <START:ggp> hGR <END> and is the likely cause of primary cortisol resistance in this subject . 
The <START:ggp> transcriptionally active factors <END> mediating the effect of the <START:ggp> HTLV-I Tax transactivator <END> on the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha kappa B enhancer <END> include the product of the <START:ggp> c-rel proto-oncogene <END> . 
The transactivator <START:ggp> HTLV-I Tax <END> activates the <START:ggp> promoter <END> of the gene coding for the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 alpha-chain receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> ) via a <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> that can bind several protein species of the <START:ggp> rel family <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tax1 <END> strongly activates the enhancer activity of this motif , in both <START:ana> epithelial HeLa <END> and lymphoid <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
This activation was not observed in undifferentiated embryocarcinoma F9 cells . 
Overexpression of the <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> Rel proteins <END> in these cells showed that significant activation of the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> was observed only with <START:ggp> Rel <END> and <START:ggp> Rel <END> plus <START:ggp> p65 <END> . 
Moreover , whereas both <START:ggp> Tax <END> and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) are able to efficiently induce the binding of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> to the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha kappa B site <END> , PMA is functionally inactive . 
Using the DNA affinity precipitation assay , we observed that <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> is able to efficiently induce the binding of Rel , whereas PMA is not . 
This established a clear difference between both stimuli , indicating that <START:ggp> Rel <END> is the <START:ggp> functionally active factor <END> . 
We conclude from these results that the functional activity of members of the <START:ggp> rel family <END> is regulated by their interaction with DNA and that <START:ggp> Rel <END> can be a potent transcriptional activator on specific <START:ggp> kappa B sites <END> . 
Transcriptional regulation of <START:ggp> interleukin 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL3 <END> ) in <START:ana> primary human T lymphocytes <END> . 
Role of <START:ggp> AP-1- and octamer-binding proteins <END> in control of <START:ggp> IL3 <END> gene expression . 
We have investigated the molecular and biochemical basis for activation of <START:ggp> interleukin 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL3 <END> ) gene expression in <START:ana> primary human T lymphocytes <END> following CD3 and CD2 receptor stimulation or activation by <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate . 
Using transfection and reporter gene assays specifically designed for <START:ana> primary T lymphocytes <END> in conjunction with gel retardation assays , Western blot analyses and UV cross-linking studies , we found that <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> , <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , and <START:ggp> octamer-binding proteins <END> play a major role in transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> IL3 gene <END> via their interaction with two specific regions contained within the <START:ggp> IL3 5'-flanking sequence <END> . 
Additionally , the region between bases <START:ggp> -107 and -59 <END> of the <START:ggp> IL3 promoter <END> containing putative <START:ggp> AP-2 and Sp1 binding motifs <END> appears necessary for basal level expression of the <START:ggp> IL3 <END> gene . 
The data also indicate that <START:ggp> CD2 <END> receptor activation and <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation augment T cell <START:ggp> IL3 <END> gene expression through the same cis- and trans-activating signals . 
These results should contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of <START:ggp> IL3 <END> gene expression in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> . 
Dimerization of <START:ggp> NF-KB2 <END> with <START:ggp> RelA ( p65 ) <END> regulates DNA binding , transcriptional activation , and inhibition by an <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> MAD-3 <END> ) . 
Inducible expression of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is regulated by a cellular <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is composed of distinct subunits ; five independent genes , <START:ggp> NFKB1 <END> ( <START:ggp> p105 <END> ) , <START:ggp> NFKB2 <END> ( <START:ggp> p100 <END> ) , <START:ggp> RelA ( p65 ) <END> , <START:ggp> c-rel <END> and <START:ggp> relB <END> , that encode related proteins that bind to <START:ggp> kappa B DNA elements <END> have been isolated . 
We have previously found that <START:ggp> NFKB2 ( p49/p52 ) <END> acts in concert with <START:ggp> RelA ( p65 ) <END> to stimulate the <START:ggp> HIV enhancer <END> in Jurkat <START:ana> T-leukemia cells <END> . 
Here we examine the biochemical basis for the transcriptional regulation of HIV by <START:ggp> NFKB2 <END> . 
Using Scatchard analysis , we have determined the dissociation constants of <START:ggp> homodimeric p49 <END> and <START:ggp> heterodimeric p49/p65 <END> for binding to the <START:ggp> HIV kappa B site <END> . 
<START:ggp> p49 <END> has a approximately 18-fold-lower affinity for the HIV <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> ( KD = 69.1 pM ) than does the approximately 50-kDa protein <START:ggp> NFKB1 ( p50 ) <END> derived from <START:ggp> p105 <END> ( KD = 3.9 pM ) . 
In contrast , the affinity of <START:ggp> heterodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) /RelA ( p65 ) <END> for this site is approximately 6-fold higher ( KD = 11.8 pM ) than that of <START:ggp> p49 <END> alone . 
Consistent with these findings , in vitro transcription was stimulated 18-fold by the addition of preformed , <START:ggp> heterodimeric NFKB2 ( p49 ) /RelA ( p65 ) protein <END> . 
Transcriptional activation of the HIV enhancer was also subject to regulation by recently cloned <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> MAD-3 <END> ) . 
Recombinant I kappa B-alpha ( <START:ggp> MAD-3 <END> ) inhibited the DNA binding activity of <START:ggp> p65 <END> , <START:ggp> p49/p65 <END> , and <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> but stimulated the binding of <START:ggp> NFKB2 <END> ( <START:ggp> p49 <END> ) or NFKB1 ( p50 ) . 
Functional activation of an HIV reporter plasmid by <START:ggp> p49/p65 <END> in <START:ana> transiently transfected Jurkat T-leukemia cells <END> was also inhibited by coexpression of <START:ggp> MAD-3 <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
The <START:ggp> c-rel protooncogene product <END> represses <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> p65 <END> -mediated transcriptional activation of the long terminal repeat of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus . 
The <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) and the <START:ggp> 5 ' regulatory region <END> of the gene encoding the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 receptor alpha subunit <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> ) share functional <START:ggp> kappa B enhancer elements <END> involved in the regulation of these inducible transcription units during T-cell activation . 
These <START:ggp> kappa B enhancer elements <END> are recognized by a structurally related family of interactive proteins that includes <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p65 <END> , and the product of the <START:ggp> c-rel protooncogene <END> ( <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> ) . 
Recent biochemical studies have shown that <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> p50 <END> form the prototypical <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> , which is rapidly translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during T-cell activation . 
This intracellular signaling complex potently stimulates kappa B-directed transcription from either the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> or the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha promoter <END> via the strong transactivation domain present in <START:ggp> p65 <END> . 
We now demonstrate that nuclear expression of human <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , which is induced by either phorbol ester or <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> with delayed kinetics relative to <START:ggp> p65 <END> , markedly represses <START:ggp> p65 <END> -mediated activation of these transcription units . 
These inhibitory effects of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> correlate with its DNA-binding activity but not with its ability to heterodimerize with <START:ggp> p50 <END> , suggesting that <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> inhibition involves competition with <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> for occupancy of the kappa B enhancer element . 
Together , these findings suggest that one function of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> is as a physiologic repressor of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> promoters , serving to efficiently counter the strong transcriptional activating effects of <START:ggp> p65 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Ras oncogene <END> transformation of <START:ana> human B lymphoblasts <END> is associated with lymphocyte activation and with a block of differentiation . 
The <START:ggp> p21ras small GTP binding proteins <END> participate in signal transduction from cell surface receptors and affect neoplastic transformation and development in many different cell types . 
In the present study , we examined the relationship between ras transformation and differentiation of <START:ana> human B lymphocytes <END> . 
We show that the constitutive expression of the <START:ggp> T24 Ha-ras oncogene <END> in <START:ana> EBV-immortalized B lymphoblasts <END> was associated with the induction of the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 receptor alpha subunit <END> , with an impaired <START:ggp> immunoglobulin gene <END> expression , altered adhesion properties and increased survival in serum-free medium . 
Since induction of the <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor alpha subunit <END> is a hallmark of <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> activation , we suggest that <START:ggp> p21ras <END> naturally triggers <START:ana> B cell <END> activation . 
The <START:ana> ras-transformed lymphocytes <END> displayed a fully functional <START:ggp> IL-2r <END> , as assessed by <START:ggp> c-fos <END> induction following treatment with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ; nevertheless , they were not growth stimulated by this <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> . 
The decreased expression of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin genes <END> indicates that the <START:ggp> ras oncogene <END> blocks terminal differentiation to <START:ana> plasma cells <END> , possibly by inhibiting the activity of <START:ggp> lymphocyte-specific transcription factors <END> . 
Somewhat unexpectedly , the constitutive <START:ggp> p21ras <END> activity did not cause an increased DNA binding of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> PEA1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP1 <END> ) , <START:ggp> PEA3 <END> , <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> or <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> 
Comparative analysis of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ( <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ) complex in <START:ana> human T and B lymphocytes <END> . 
Nuclear factor of activated T cells ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) is a <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> that binds to sequences in the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter <END> and is thought to be largely responsible for the T cell-specific inducibility of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) showed that specific <START:ggp> NFAT <END> binding activity could also be induced in <START:ana> human B cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> B cell NFAT complex <END> , however , was not functional , since it failed to activate transcription from an <START:ggp> NFAT-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) construct <END> . 
Competition with an <START:ggp> AP-1 motif <END> or with <START:ggp> anti-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> anti-Fos antibodies <END> abolished binding to the <START:ggp> NFAT motif <END> in both <START:ana> T and B cells <END> , indicating that Jun and Fos are critical for <START:ggp> NFAT complex <END> formation in both cell types . 
Purified recombinant <START:ggp> Jun and Fos proteins <END> failed to bind directly to the <START:ggp> NFAT motif <END> . 
However , when combined with unstimulated B or T cell extracts , full-length , but not truncated , Jun/Fos heterodimers were able to form an <START:ggp> NFAT complex <END> , indicating the presence of a <START:ggp> constitutively expressed nuclear factor <END> ( s ) in <START:ana> B and T cells <END> necessary for the formation of the <START:ggp> NFAT complex <END> in both cell types . 
An <START:ggp> NFAT <END> oligonucleotide carrying mutations in the <START:ggp> 5 ' purine-rich part <END> of the <START:ggp> NFAT sequence <END> failed to form a complex and to compete with the wild type motif for <START:ggp> NFAT complex <END> formation in both <START:ana> T and B cells <END> . 
We therefore propose a model whereby a core <START:ggp> NFAT complex <END> consisting of <START:ggp> Jun <END> , <START:ggp> Fos <END> , and a <START:ggp> constitutive nuclear factor <END> is formed in both <START:ana> T and B cells <END> , but an additional factor and/or post-translational modification of a factor , missing in <START:ana> B cells <END> , might be required for transactivation by <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
Differential autoregulation of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> expression in <START:ana> human T- and B-cell lines <END> . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( GR ) expression by its cognate ligand was examined in the <START:ana> glucocorticoid-sensitive human leukemic T-cell line 6TG1.1 <END> and in the <START:ana> human B-cell line IM-9 <END> . 
In contrast to the decrease in <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> seen in <START:ana> IM-9 cells <END> after treatment with 1 microM dexamethasone for 16-18 h , treatment of <START:ana> 6TG1.1 cells <END> resulted in an 8-fold increase in <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> , as determined by Northern blot and <START:ggp> RNase <END> protection analysis , with a corresponding 3- to 4-fold increase in <START:ggp> GR protein <END> . 
Half-maximal induction of <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> and protein in <START:ana> 6TG1.1 cells <END> was observed between 10-100 nM dexamethasone , and inclusion of 1 microM RU 38486 completely blocked the effects of 100 nM dexamethasone , demonstrating that positive autoregulation of <START:ggp> GR <END> expression in <START:ana> 6TG1.1 cells <END> is a receptor-mediated response . 
Positive autoregulation of <START:ggp> GR <END> expression was also observed in <START:ana> glucocorticoid-resistant CEM-C1 cells <END> , which contain functional <START:ggp> GR <END> , but whose growth is unaffected by glucocorticoids . 
Thus , positive autoregulation is neither a consequence nor the sole cause of growth arrest . 
The degree of negative autoregulation in <START:ana> IM-9 cells <END> and positive autoregulation in <START:ana> 6TG1.1 cells <END> was unaffected by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide . 
Measurement of <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> turnover in <START:ana> 6TG1.1 cells <END> treated with actinomycin-D revealed a half-life of 2.5 h , which was unaffected by dexamethasone treatment . 
A similar half-life was determined in <START:ana> IM-9 cells <END> and was also unaffected by steroid treatment . 
These results are consistent with the interpretation that glucocorticoid-mediated autoregulation of GR expression is a tissue-specific primary transcriptional response . 
Induction of <START:ggp> CD8 antigen <END> and suppressor activity by glucocorticoids in a <START:ana> CEM human leukemic cell clone <END> . 
The relationship between glucocorticoid effect and regulation of <START:ggp> cell surface antigens <END> was investigated in two models of <START:ana> leukemic cell lines <END> , <START:ana> CEM C7 <END> denoted ( r+ , ly+ ) and <START:ana> CEM C1 <END> ( r+ , ly- ) . 
The reactivity of <START:ggp> murine monoclonal antibodies <END> , <START:ggp> anti-CD4-FITC <END> , <START:ggp> anti-CD8-FITC <END> , <START:ggp> anti-CD2-FITC <END> and <START:ggp> anti-calla-FITC <END> , were analyzed using flow cytometry . 
The suppressor function was determined using [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation into <START:ana> phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> . 
Dexamethasone treatment of a <START:ana> human leukemic cell clone CEM C7 <END> caused an increase in a subset of cells expressing the <START:ggp> surface antigen CD8 <END> , which is present on suppressor and <START:ana> cytotoxic T-lymphocytes <END> . 
By comparison , there was no modification of the expression of <START:ggp> CD4 antigen <END> , which is expressed at high levels in these cells . 
After two days of treatment with 5 x 10 ( -8 ) M dexamethasone , <START:ana> CEM C7 cells <END> showed a two-fold increase in suppressor activity compared to untreated cells . 
In contrast , there was no regulation by glucocorticoids of either the <START:ggp> CD8 <END> or <START:ggp> CD4 antigens <END> in the <START:ana> leukemic clone CEM C1 <END> . 
Furthermore , no modification of the suppressor function in <START:ana> CEM C1 cells <END> by dexamethasone was observed . 
In the human leukemic cells studied here , the ability to induce <START:ggp> CD8 antigen <END> expression in a <START:ana> CD4+ cells <END> correlates with the ability to induce cell lysis in a <START:ana> glucocorticoid receptor positive cell population <END> . 
Adenovirus E1A inhibits <START:ggp> IFN <END> -induced resistance to cytolysis by <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> . 
Infection of <START:ana> target cells <END> with cytopathic viruses inhibits <START:ggp> IFN <END> induction of cytolytic resistance to NK cell-mediated cytolysis [ <START:ggp> IFN <END> -mediated cytoprotection ( <START:ggp> IFN <END> -MCP ) ] . 
It has been thought that the virally induced inhibition of <START:ggp> IFN <END> -MCP is secondary to the shutdown of cellular macromolecular synthesis that accompanies cytopathic virus infections . 
Group C , adenovirus serotype 5 ( Ad5 ) infection inhibits both <START:ggp> IFN <END> -MCP and <START:ggp> cellular protein <END> synthesis . 
This study determined if the Ad5-induced inhibition of <START:ggp> IFN <END> -MCP was independent of adenovirus ( Ad ) infection and secondary only to the expression of the <START:ggp> Ad early region 1A gene <END> ( <START:ggp> E1A <END> ) . 
To test this hypothesis , 4-h NK cytolysis assays were performed on <START:ana> IFN-gamma-treated human cells <END> infected with an Ad5 <START:ggp> E1A <END> deletion mutant , dl343 , or transfected with the <START:ggp> Ad5 E1A gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> IFN <END> -MCP was not inhibited by infection with dl343 , despite the production of large amounts of both early ( <START:ggp> E1B <END> , <START:ggp> p55 <END> ) and late ( <START:ggp> hexon <END> ) <START:ggp> Ad proteins <END> . 
In contrast to <START:ana> E1A-negative , parental cell lines <END> , <START:ggp> IFN <END> -MCP was blocked in Ad5 <START:ana> E1A-transfected epithelial <END> and <START:ana> fibroblastic cell lines <END> . 
Genetic mapping studies within the <START:ggp> E1A gene <END> demonstrated that expression of only the first exon of <START:ggp> E1A <END> was sufficient to inhibit <START:ggp> IFN <END> -MCP . 
DNA sequence homology of <START:ggp> E1A <END> genes between different Ad groups ( group A , Ad12 ; group C , Ad5 ) is limited almost entirely to three conserved regions located within the first exon of <START:ggp> E1A <END> . 
Because <START:ggp> IFN <END> -MCP was also blocked in <START:ana> Ad12 E1A-transfected cell lines <END> , expression of one or more of the <START:ggp> E1A-conserved regions <END> may be necessary to inhibit <START:ggp> IFN <END> -MCP . 
In summary , the expression of <START:ggp> E1A gene products <END> inhibited <START:ggp> IFN <END> -MCP independently of virus infection . 
<START:ggp> E1A <END> 's inhibition of <START:ggp> IFN <END> -MCP has the net effect of promoting the selective NK cell-mediated clearance of Ad-infected or <START:ana> Ad-transformed human cells <END> . 
A protein of the <START:ggp> AP-1 family <END> is a component of <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> ) is a <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> involved in the induction of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> gene expression . 
The response element for <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> is a sequence localized between <START:ggp> -285/-254 <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-2 regulatory region <END> . 
The composition of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> protein is still not fully elucidated . 
We demonstrate that , in normal human <START:ana> T cells <END> , an <START:ggp> AP-1 protein <END> is a component of the <START:ggp> NF-AT protein complex <END> . 
This was evidenced by the ability of the <START:ggp> AP-1 site <END> to compete with the <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> site for binding to <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> and by the capacity of <START:ggp> immobilized anti-Jun <END> and <START:ggp> anti-Fos <END> antibodies to deplete <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> -binding activity from nuclear extracts of <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
There was no detectable binding of in vitro translated <START:ggp> Jun/Fos heterodimer <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) to the <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> sequence , and the <START:ggp> NF-AT sequence <END> was unable to inhibit the binding of <START:ggp> Jun/Fos <END> to the <START:ggp> AP-1 sequence <END> . 
The presence of an <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> protein in the <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> protein complex may regulate <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> -binding activity through protein-protein interaction . 
Interaction between <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -and <START:ggp> serum response factor <END> -binding elements activates an <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain enhancer <END> specifically in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
We find that a short enhancer element containing the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B binding site <END> from the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain gene <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> ) is preferentially activated in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> enhancer binds <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> poorly and is only weakly activated by the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> alone . 
<START:ggp> Serum response factor <END> ( <START:ggp> SRF <END> ) binds to a site adjacent to the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-2R enhancer <END> , and both sites together have strong transcriptional activity specifically in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Surprisingly , the levels of <START:ggp> SRF <END> constitutively expressed in <START:ana> T cells <END> are consistently higher than in other cell types . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> SRF <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> causes the <START:ggp> IL-2R enhancer <END> to function as well as it does in <START:ana> T cells <END> , suggesting that the high level of <START:ggp> SRF <END> binding in <START:ana> T cells <END> is functionally important . 
Mutual regulation of the <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and its inhibitor , <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> . 
The <START:ggp> NK-kappa B transcription factor complex <END> is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory protein <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> MAD-3 <END> ) . 
Various cellular stimuli relieve this inhibition by mechanisms largely unknown , leading to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> nuclear localization and transactivation of its target genes . 
It is demonstrated here with <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> that different stimuli , including <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate , cause rapid degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> , with concomitant activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , followed by a dramatic increase in <START:ana> I kappa B-alpha mRNA <END> and protein synthesis . 
Transfection studies reveal that the <START:ana> I kappa B-alpha mRNA <END> and the encoded protein are potently induced by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and by homodimers of <START:ggp> p65 <END> and of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> . 
We propose a model in which <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> mutually regulate each other in a cycle : saturating amounts of the inhibitory <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> protein are destroyed upon stimulation , allowing rapid activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Subsequently , <START:ana> I kappa B-alpha mRNA <END> and protein levels are quickly induced by the activated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
This resurgence of <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> protein acts to restore an equilibrium in which <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is again inhibited . 
Replication of type 1 human immunodeficiency viruses containing linker substitution mutations in the <START:ggp> -201 to -130 region <END> of the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> . 
In previous transfection analyses using the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase <END> <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> system , we determined that linker substitution ( LS ) mutations between <START:ggp> -201 and -130 <END> ( relative to the transcription start site ) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) caused moderate decreases in <START:ggp> LTR <END> transcriptional activity in a <START:ana> T-cell line <END> ( S.L.Zeichner , J.Y.H. Kim , and J.C.Alwine , J.Virol.65 : 2436-2444 , 1991 ) . 
In order to confirm the significance of this region in the context of viral replication , we constructed several of these LS mutations ( <START:ggp> -201 to - 184 <END> , <START:ggp> -183 to -166 <END> , <START:ggp> -165 to -148 <END> , and <START:ggp> -148 to -130 <END> ) in proviruses and prepared viral stocks by cocultivation of <START:ana> transfected RD cells <END> with <START:ana> CEMx174 cells <END> . 
In addition , two mutations between <START:ggp> -93 and -76 <END> and between <START:ggp> -75 and -58 <END> were utilized , since they affect the <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) - and Sp1-binding sites <END> and were expected to diminish viral replication . 
Our results suggest that while transfection analyses offer an adequate approximation of the effects of the LS mutations , the analysis of viral replication using a mutant viral stock presents a more accurate picture , which is sometimes at variance with the transfection results . 
Three mutants ( -201/-184 NXS , -165/-148 NXS , and -147/-130 NXS ) had effects on viral replication that were much more severe than the effects predicted from their performance in transfection analyses , and the effects of two LS mutations ( -201/-184 NXS and -183/-166 NXS ) were not predicted by their effects in transfection . 
In addition , we observed cell type-specific permissiveness to replication of some mutant viruses . 
In the cell types tested , the LS mutations indicated an apparent requirement not only for the intact <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> SP1-binding sites <END> but also for several regions between <START:ggp> -201 and -130 <END> not previously associated with viral infectivity . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and erythroid development . 
In summary , we derived an experimental system that allows us to dissect the function of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> in <START:ana> red cell <END> development at a genetic level . 
We have established the essential nature of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> during both primitive and definitive erythropoiesis . 
By ablating the expression of the endogenous <START:ggp> GATA-1 gene <END> , we are in a position to introduce a variety of constructs that harbor subtle modifications in flanking or <START:ggp> protein-coding sequences <END> . 
We can now study regulatory regions and functional domains of the protein in the context of a true erythroid environment , experiments that have not been possible heretofore . 
Although the assay involves the dramatic loss of red cell production , it should be possible to define important regulatory domains that can then be assayed using less stringent systems , such as cell-free extracts for in vitro transcription . 
The ideal situation would be analyses conducted in <START:ana> GATA-1 -erythroid cells <END> . 
However , these cells have been impossible to generate given the requirement of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> for <START:ggp> Epo receptor <END> expression and <START:ana> red cell <END> viability ( C. Simon and S. Orkin , unpublished observations ) . 
It may be possible to produce such cells by first expressing the <START:ggp> Epo receptor <END> under the influence of a constitutive promoter and then targeting the <START:ggp> GATA-1 gene <END> . 
If <START:ana> GATA-1 -red cells <END> were available , the analyses would involve the actual transcription of or chromatin structure surrounding the <START:ggp> globin genes <END> . 
Structure-function studies of the <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> protein could be greatly simplified and a larger number of mutants studied . 
However , the ES cell system can be used as an alternative until <START:ana> targeted erythroleukemia cells <END> become available . 
Other applications involve the introduction of other <START:ggp> GATA-binding protein family members <END> to determine whether they rescue the mutation . 
If they can not , <START:ggp> chimeric proteins <END> can be tested to identify which amino acids distinguish the different family members . 
We feel that these experiments are vital to understanding the function of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> during erythroid ontogeny . 
How does <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> regulate <START:ggp> red cell genes <END> like <START:ggp> globin <END> or the <START:ggp> Epo receptor <END> ? Once we identify the functional domains of the <START:ggp> GATA-binding proteins <END> , we hope to learn what proteins <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> binds to in the basic transcription machinery or in chromatin . 
Is <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> necessary for globin gene switching ? <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> may be modified differently during development so that the locus control region can interact with different <START:ggp> globin promoters <END> . 
We may find that one region of the protein is required for embryonic expression and another for adult <START:ggp> globin gene <END> expression . 
A <START:ggp> human putative lymphocyte G0/G1 switch gene <END> homologous to a <START:ggp> rodent gene <END> encoding a <START:ggp> zinc-binding potential transcription factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> G0S24 <END> is a member of a set of genes ( <START:ggp> putative G0/G1 switch regulatory genes <END> ) that are expressed transiently within 1-2 hr of the addition of <START:ggp> lectin <END> or cycloheximide to <START:ana> human blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
Comparison of a <START:ggp> full-length cDNA sequence <END> with the corresponding genomic sequence reveals an <START:ggp> open reading frame <END> of 326 amino acids , distributed across two <START:ggp> exons <END> . 
Potential <START:ggp> phosphorylation sites <END> include the sequence <START:ggp> PSPTSPT <END> , which resembles an <START:ggp> RNA polymerase II repeat <END> reported to be a target of the <START:ggp> cell cycle control kinase cdc2 <END> . 
Comparison of the derived protein sequence with those of rodent homologs allows classification into three groups . 
Group 1 contains <START:ggp> G0S24 <END> and the <START:ggp> rat and mouse TIS11 genes <END> ( also known as <START:ggp> TTP <END> , <START:ggp> Nup475 <END> , and <START:ggp> Zfp36 <END> ) . 
Members of this group have <START:ggp> three tetraproline repeats <END> . 
Groups 1 and 2 have a <START:ggp> serine-rich region <END> and an `` <START:ggp> arginine element <END> `` ( <START:ggp> RRLPIF <END> ) at the <START:ggp> carboxyl terminus <END> . 
All groups contain <START:ggp> cysteine- and histidine-rich putative zinc finger domains <END> and a <START:ggp> serine-phenylalanine `` SFS '' domain <END> similar to part of the large subunit of <START:ggp> eukaryotic RNA polymerase II <END> . 
Comparison of group 1 <START:ggp> human and mouse genomic sequences <END> shows high conservation in the <START:ggp> 5 ' flank <END> and <START:ggp> exons <END> . 
A CpG island suggests expression in the germ line . 
<START:ggp> G0S24 <END> has potential sites for <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in the <START:ggp> 5 ' flank <END> and <START:ggp> intron <END> ; these include a <START:ggp> serum response element <END> . 
Protein and genomic sequences show similarities with those of a variety of proteins involved in transcription , suggesting that the <START:ggp> G0S24 product <END> has a similar role . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific immunoglobulin mu heavy chain gene enhancer <END> by ETS-domain proteins . 
The <START:ggp> enhancer <END> for the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin mu heavy chain gene <END> ( <START:ggp> IgH <END> ) activates a <START:ggp> heterologous gene <END> at the pre-B cell stage of <START:ana> B lymphocyte <END> differentiation . 
A <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific element <END> , <START:ggp> microB <END> , is necessary for <START:ggp> enhancer <END> function in <START:ana> pre-B cells <END> . 
A <START:ggp> microB binding protein <END> is encoded by the <START:ggp> PU.1/Spi-1 proto-oncogene <END> . 
Another <START:ggp> sequence element <END> , <START:ggp> microA <END> , was identified in the <START:ggp> mu enhancer <END> that binds the product of the <START:ggp> ets-1 proto-oncogene <END> . 
The <START:ggp> microA <END> motif was required for <START:ggp> microB-dependent enhancer <END> activity , which suggests that a <START:ggp> minimal B cell-specific enhancer <END> is composed of both the <START:ggp> PU.1 and Ets-1 binding sites <END> . 
Co-expression of both <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> and <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> in <START:ana> nonlymphoid cells <END> <START:ggp> trans-activated reporter plasmids <END> that contained the minimal <START:ggp> mu enhancer <END> . 
These results implicate two members of the <START:ggp> Ets family <END> in the activation of <START:ggp> IgH gene <END> expression . 
1 , 25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3 and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate synergistically induce <START:ana> monocytic cell <END> differentiation : <START:ggp> FOS <END> and <START:ggp> RB <END> expression . 
1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) interact synergistically to induce monocytic differentiation of <START:ana> U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells <END> . 
Addition of TPA causes an otherwise ineffective dose of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 to induce differentiation . 
The induced differentiation depends on the simultaneous ( vs. sequential ) presence of both agents . 
The kinetics of induced differentiation are consistent with a G1 specific cellular response to initiate the metabolic cascade culminating in cell differentiation . 
The induced differentiation occurs with down-regulation of <START:ggp> c-fos protein <END> and an accompanying up-regulation of <START:ggp> RB protein <END> expression , consistent with a possible need for up-regulated <START:ggp> RB <END> expression to maintain a given differentiated phenotype and suppress <START:ggp> transcriptional activators <END> that might typically be associated with proliferation . 
Ectopic expression of a conditional <START:ggp> GATA-2/estrogen receptor chimera <END> arrests erythroid differentiation in a hormone-dependent manner . 
The <START:ggp> GATA factors <END> are a family of <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory proteins <END> in eukaryotes that share extensive homology in their <START:ggp> DNA-binding domains <END> . 
One enigmatic aspect of <START:ggp> GATA factor <END> expression is that several <START:ggp> GATA proteins <END> , which ostensibly share the same <START:ggp> DNA-binding site <END> specificity , are coexpressed in erythroid cells . 
To elucidate the roles of individual <START:ggp> GATA factors <END> in erythropoiesis , conditional alleles of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> , and <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> were prepared by fusing each of the factors to the <START:ggp> hormone-binding domain <END> of the <START:ggp> human estrogen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) . 
These <START:ggp> GATA/ER chimeric factors <END> were shown to be <START:ggp> hormone-inducible trans-activating proteins <END> in transient transfection assays . 
When stably introduced into <START:ana> primary erythroblasts <END> or <START:ana> conditionally transformed erythroid progenitors cells <END> , exogenous <START:ggp> GATA-2/ER <END> promoted proliferation and inhibited terminal differentiation in an estrogen-dependent manner . 
These phenotypic effects are specifically attributable to the action of ectopically expressed <START:ggp> GATA-2/ER <END> because erythroblasts expressing exogenous <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> are constitutively arrested in differentiation and because <START:ana> erythroid progenitors <END> expressing either <START:ggp> Gal/ER <END> or <START:ggp> GATA-3/ER <END> do not display a hormone-responsive block in differentiation . 
Thus , the <START:ggp> GATA-2 transcription factor <END> appears to play a role in regulating the self-renewal capacity of <START:ana> early erythroid progenitor cells <END> . 
Mice deficient for the <START:ggp> 55 kd tumor necrosis factor receptor <END> are resistant to endotoxic shock , yet succumb to L. monocytogenes infection . 
The multiple biological activities of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF <END> ) are mediated by two distinct <START:ggp> cell surface receptors <END> of <START:ggp> 55 kd <END> ( <START:ggp> TNFRp55 <END> ) and <START:ggp> 75 kd <END> ( <START:ggp> TNFRp75 <END> ) . 
Using gene targeting , we generated a <START:ggp> TNFRp55 <END> -deficient mouse strain . 
Cells from TNFRp55-/-mutant mice lack expression of <START:ggp> TNFRp55 <END> but display normal numbers of <START:ggp> high affinity TNFRp75 molecules <END> . 
<START:ana> Thymocyte <END> development and <START:ana> lymphocyte populations <END> are unaltered , and clonal deletion of potentially <START:ana> self-reactive T cells <END> is not impaired . 
However , <START:ggp> TNF <END> signaling is largely abolished , as judged by the failure of <START:ggp> TNF <END> to induce <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> from <START:ggp> TNFRp55 <END> -deficient mice . 
The loss of <START:ggp> TNFRp55 <END> function renders mice resistant to lethal dosages of either lipopolysaccharides or <START:ggp> S. aureus enterotoxin B <END> . 
In contrast , TNFRp55-deficient mice are severely impaired to clear L. monocytogenes and readily succumb to infection . 
Thus , the <START:ggp> 55 kd TNFR <END> plays a decisive role in the host 's defense against microorganisms and their pathogenic factors . 
Costimulation of <START:ana> peripheral blood T cell <END> activation by <START:ana> human endothelial cells <END> . 
Enhanced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcription correlates with increased <START:ggp> c-fos <END> synthesis and increased <START:ggp> Fos <END> content of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
<START:ana> Endothelial cells <END> ( <START:ana> EC <END> ) act as APC for <START:ana> resting PBL <END> in vitro , and may have important roles in vivo in the pathogenesis of allograft rejection and delayed hypersensitivity . 
We previously reported that <START:ana> human umbilical vein EC <END> provide costimulatory signals to <START:ana> PHA-stimulated PBL <END> via <START:ggp> CD2 : lymphocyte function-associated Ag-3 <END> and an unidentified ligand pair , resulting in a three- to eight-fold enhancement of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production . 
The physiologic relevance of this increase was demonstrated by the proliferative advantage provided by <START:ana> EC <END> to <START:ana> PBL <END> suboptimally stimulated with <START:ggp> mAb OKT3 <END> . 
We now report that <START:ana> EC <END> costimulation causes increased levels of <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> as a result of increased <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcription in <START:ana> PBL <END> . 
We therefore examined the effects of <START:ana> EC <END> on <START:ggp> T cell nuclear factors <END> known to regulate <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcription , including <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and <START:ggp> c-fos-two components <END> of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , and others . 
<START:ana> PBL <END> constitutively express <START:ggp> c-jun transcripts <END> , and the level of <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> is not altered by <START:ggp> PHA <END> activation in the absence or presence of <START:ana> EC <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> is absent from resting <START:ana> T cells <END> and is induced on <START:ggp> PHA <END> activation . 
<START:ana> EC <END> alone do not induce <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> but augment the level of <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> in <START:ana> PHA-activated T cells <END> by 3- to 10-fold . 
This effect is largely independent of the CD2 : lymphocyte function-associated Ag-3 pathway . 
Gel-shift analysis reveals the constitutive presence of nuclear factors in <START:ana> resting PBL <END> that bind to the <START:ggp> proximal AP-1 site <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> and that contain immunoreactive <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> but not <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> protein . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> from <START:ana> PHA-activated cells <END> contains <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> and low levels of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> . 
Strikingly , costimulation with <START:ana> EC <END> results in a dramatic increase ( up to 15-fold ) in the <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> content of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
Levels of other <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> involved in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> regulation were not altered by <START:ana> EC <END> , although <START:ggp> NFAT-DNA complexes <END> migrated at a slightly different mobility . 
In summary , our data suggest that changes in the composition of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> is a key molecular mechanism for increasing <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> transcription and may underlie the phenomenon of costimulation by <START:ana> EC <END> . 
Transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> human zeta 2 globin promoter <END> by the <START:ggp> alpha globin regulatory element <END> ( <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> ) : functional role of specific <START:ggp> nuclear factor-DNA complexes <END> . 
We studied the functional interaction between <START:ggp> human embryonic zeta 2 globin promoter <END> and the <START:ggp> alpha globin regulatory element <END> ( <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> ) located <START:ggp> 40 kb upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> zeta 2 globin gene <END> . 
It was shown by transient expression assay that <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> behaved as an authentic <START:ggp> enhancer <END> for high-level <START:ggp> zeta 2 globin promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> , an erythroid cell line of embryonic and/or fetal origin . 
Although sequences located between -559 and -88 of the <START:ggp> zeta 2 globin gene <END> were dispensable for its expression on <START:ggp> enhancerless plasmids <END> , they were required for the <START:ggp> HS-40 enhancer <END> -mediated activity of the <START:ggp> zeta 2 globin promoter <END> . 
Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that this <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> enhancer- <START:ggp> zeta 2 globin promoter <END> interaction is mediated by the two GATA-1 factor binding motifs located at -230 and -104 , respectively . 
The functional domains of <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> were also mapped . 
Bal 31 deletion mapping data suggested that one GATA-1 motif , one GT motif , and two NF-E2/AP1 motifs together formed the functional core of <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> in the erythroid-specific activation of the <START:ggp> zeta 2 globin promoter <END> . 
Site-directed mutagenesis further demonstrated that the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> function of one of the two NF-E2/AP1 motifs of <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> is mediated through its binding to <START:ggp> NF-E2 <END> but not <START:ggp> AP1 transcription factor <END> . 
Finally , we did genomic footprinting of the <START:ggp> HS-40 enhancer region <END> in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> , <START:ana> adult nucleated erythroblasts <END> , and different <START:ana> nonerythroid cells <END> . 
All sequence motifs within the functional core of <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> , as mapped by transient expression analysis , appeared to bind a <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> ( s ) in living <START:ana> K562 cells <END> but not in <START:ana> nonerythroid cells <END> . 
On the other hand , only one of the apparently <START:ggp> nonfunctional sequence motifs <END> was bound with factors in vivo . 
In comparison to <START:ana> K562 <END> , <START:ana> nucleated erythroblasts <END> from adult human bone marrow exhibited a similar but nonidentical pattern of <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> binding in vivo at the <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> region . 
These data suggest that transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> human embryonic zeta 2 globin gene <END> and the <START:ggp> fetal/adult alpha globin genes <END> is mediated by erythroid cell-specific and <START:ggp> developmental stage-specific nuclear factor-DNA complexes <END> which form at the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> ( <START:ggp> HS-40 <END> ) and the <START:ggp> globin promoters <END> . 
Transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> pyruvate kinase erythroid-specific promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> Mammal pyruvate kinases <END> are encoded by two genes . 
The <START:ggp> L gene <END> produces the <START:ggp> erythroid <END> ( <START:ggp> R-PK <END> ) or the <START:ggp> hepatic ( L-PK ) isozymes <END> by the alternative use of two <START:ggp> promoters <END> . 
We report the characterization of the <START:ggp> cis- and trans-acting elements <END> involved in the tissue-specific activity of the <START:ggp> L gene erythroid promoter <END> . 
A <START:ggp> R-PK DNA fragment <END> extending from -870 to +54 relative to the <START:ggp> cap site <END> confers erythroid specificity to a <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> . 
Within this region , we define a <START:ggp> minimal promoter <END> ( -62 to +54 ) that displays erythroid-specific activity and contains two DNA binding sites . 
One , located at -50 , binds members of the <START:ggp> CCACC/Sp1 family <END> and the other , located at -20 , binds the <START:ggp> erythroid factor GATA-1 <END> . 
Although the -20 <START:ggp> GATA binding site <END> ( AGATAA ) is also a potential <START:ggp> TFIID binding site <END> , it does not bind <START:ggp> TFIID <END> . 
Furthermore , the substitution of this <START:ggp> GATA binding site <END> by a canonical <START:ggp> TFIID binding site <END> suppresses the promoter activity . 
Mutations and deletions of both sites indicate that only the association of <START:ggp> CCACC/Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> GATA binding sites <END> can drive efficient and tissue-specific expression of this <START:ggp> R-PK <END> <START:ggp> minimal promoter <END> . 
Finally , by co-transfection experiments , we study the elements involved in the hGATA-1 transactivation of the <START:ggp> R-PK promoter <END> in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
Protease treatment of nuclear extracts distinguishes between <START:ggp> class II MHC X1 box DNA-binding proteins <END> in <START:ana> wild-type and class II-deficient B cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> X box region <END> is critical for directing the expression of <START:ggp> class II major histocompatibility complex genes <END> in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
Although several <START:ggp> class II promoter-specific DNA binding factors <END> have been described , only the <START:ggp> X box region <END> factor , <START:ggp> RFX <END> , shows a genetic correlation with class II expression , being deficient in some <START:ana> B cell lines <END> derived from patients with class II-deficient congenital immunodeficiency . 
To further evaluate the role of <START:ggp> X box DNA-binding proteins <END> in <START:ggp> class II gene <END> expression , the role of the <START:ggp> X box region <END> was examined in both <START:ana> class II-positive <END> and <START:ana> -negative lymphoid cells <END> . 
In addition to the <START:ana> wild-type B cell line Raji <END> , <START:ana> two class II transcriptional mutant cell lines <END> , <START:ana> SJO <END> and <START:ana> RJ2.2.5 <END> , and <START:ana> Jurkat <END> , a <START:ana> class II negative T cell line <END> , were examined . 
In contrast to <START:ana> wild-type B cells <END> , neither of the <START:ana> class II mutant cell lines <END> could use the <START:ggp> X box region <END> to direct the expression of a transiently transfected <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> , indicating that the X box-dependent transcriptional pathway is defective in these cells . 
The binding activity of the <START:ggp> X1 box DNA-binding protein <END> <START:ggp> RFX <END> was examined and found to be present in <START:ana> wild-type B cells <END> and the mutant <START:ana> RJ2.2.5 <END> but was absent in <START:ana> SJO <END> and <START:ana> Jurkat <END> . 
However , other X1 box-specific activities were detected in all these <START:ana> cell lines <END> . 
To determine whether these different X1 box activities represented distinct <START:ggp> DNA binding proteins <END> or multimeric forms of the same factor ( s ) , <START:ggp> protease <END> treatment of the crude nuclear extracts followed by DNA-binding assays were carried out and demonstrated that B cell extracts contain at least two <START:ggp> X1-specific factors <END> . 
One of these cleaved products ( band 1 pk ) correlates with <START:ggp> RFX <END> activity . 
A similar comparison with protease-treated extracts prepared from <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> demonstrated the presence of the band 1pk activity despite an absence of the native <START:ggp> RFX <END> activity . 
In contrast , protease treatment and analysis of <START:ana> SJO <END> extracts showed no detectable levels of the band 1pk activity . 
These results demonstrate that multiple X1 box-specific DNA-binding activities exist in all <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> , but the presence of an actively binding <START:ggp> RFX <END> species correlates with class II transcription . 
Human immunodeficiency viruses containing <START:ggp> heterologous enhancer/promoters <END> are replication competent and exhibit different lymphocyte tropisms . 
The <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) type 1 long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) contains binding sites for <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) and the constitutively expressed <START:ggp> transcription factor Sp1 <END> , both of which are highly conserved in HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus isolates . 
To delineate the effects of these motifs on the replicative capacity of HIV and to explore the possibility of extending the virus host range , known <START:ggp> heterologous enhancer/promoters <END> were inserted into the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> in place of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> Sp1 binding sites <END> . 
The effects of these substitutions on viral replication in transfected <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> and on HIV infection of <START:ana> human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> or <START:ana> continuous T-leukemia cell lines <END> were evaluated . 
HIVs in which the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Sp1 enhancer <END> plus the <START:ggp> downstream TATA element <END> were replaced with <START:ggp> heterologous enhancer/promoters <END> were also constructed . 
Viruses containing the <START:ggp> human cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer <END> exhibited infectious kinetics similar to that of wild-type HIV in <START:ana> activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> AA2 cells <END> but replicated less efficiently in <START:ana> H9 and CEM cells <END> . 
These studies indicate that <START:ggp> heterologous enhancer elements <END> are capable of restoring <START:ggp> Tat <END> responsiveness to the <START:ggp> HIV LTR <END> in the context of directing <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> expression as well as in the production of infectious progeny virions . 
Tyrosine phosphorylation is a mandatory proximal step in radiation-induced activation of the <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> signaling pathway in <START:ana> human B-lymphocyte precursors <END> [ published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1993 Apr 15 ; 90 ( 8 ) : 3775 ] 
Ionizing radiation triggers a signal in <START:ana> human B-lymphocyte precursors <END> that is intimately linked to an active <START:ggp> protein-tyrosine kinase <END> regulatory pathway . 
We show that in <START:ana> B-lymphocyte precursors <END> , irradiation with gamma-rays leads to ( i ) stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover ; ( ii ) downstream activation by covalent modification of multiple <START:ggp> serine-specific protein kinases <END> , including <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ; and ( iii ) activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> . 
All of the radiation-induced signals were effectively prevented by the <START:ggp> protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A <END> . 
Thus , tyrosine phosphorylation is an important and perhaps mandatory proximal step in the activation of the <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> signaling cascade in <START:ana> human B-lymphocyte precursors <END> . 
Our report expands current knowledge of the radiation-induced signaling cascade by clarifying the chronological sequence of biochemical events that follow irradiation . 
Detection of <START:ggp> adenovirus DNA <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> by polymerase chain reaction assay . 
Adenovirus can establish persistent infections which may reactivate and cause disease in immunocompromised hosts . 
<START:ana> Lymphocytes <END> have been postulated to serve as a site of adenoviral persistence based upon the ability to isolate adenovirus from tonsils and to detect <START:ggp> adenovirus DNA <END> by Southern blot hybridization in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) . 
To test this hypothesis , a more sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay was developed to detect <START:ggp> adenovirus DNA <END> . 
Two sets of <START:ggp> nested primers <END> were designed to conserved sequences in the <START:ggp> adenovirus E1A and hexon genes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> E1A and hexon primers <END> amplified DNA from representative adenoviral serotypes in all six adenoviral groups ( A-F ) . 
Both primers detected a single copy of the <START:ggp> adenovirus type 2 genome <END> but were less sensitive for the group B type 35 . 
None of 33 <START:ana> PBMC <END> specimens from healthy adults and only one of 40 pediatric samples was positive ( at a low level ) for <START:ggp> adenovirus DNA <END> by nested PCR assay . 
In comparison , <START:ana> PBMC <END> from two children with fatal adenoviral infection were both strongly positive for <START:ggp> adenovirus DNA <END> . 
It is concluded that , in contrast to a previous study , <START:ana> PBMC <END> are not a common site of persistent group C adenoviral infection . 
In addition , assay of <START:ana> PBMC <END> by the adenovirus-specific PCR may help detect early invasive disease and warrants further evaluation . 
<START:ggp> Tumor necrosis factor receptor <END> expression and signal transduction in <START:ana> HIV-1-infected cells <END> . 
OBJECTIVE : To examine the inter-relationship between HIV-1 infection and the cell surface receptors for <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha <END> , an immunoregulatory cytokine that can enhance HIV-1 replication . 
DESIGN : Infected <START:ana> promyelocytic <END> and <START:ana> promonocytic cells <END> were examined because they normally express both types of <START:ggp> TNF receptors <END> . 
METHODS : <START:ggp> TNF <END> receptor surface expression was determined by specific <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> recognition and flow cytometry , and signal transduction was detected by gel shift analysis . 
HIV-1 activation and expression was quantitated by <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase <END> assay . 
RESULTS : In the OM-10.1 promyelocytic model of chronic infection , TNF-alpha-induced HIV-1 expression also resulted in a substantial increase in <START:ggp> 75 kd TNF receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TR75 <END> ) expression although <START:ggp> 55 kD TNF receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TR55 <END> ) levels were not dramatically altered . 
A series of <START:ana> uninfected parental HL-60 subclones <END> all reduced <START:ggp> TR75 <END> surface expression in response to <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> treatment . 
Enhanced <START:ggp> TR75 <END> expression on OM-10.1 cells followed the same <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -dose dependency as that observed for HIV-1 production . 
An increase in <START:ggp> TR75 <END> expression was also evident during the peak of an acute HIV-1 infection of <START:ana> HL-60 promyelocytes <END> . 
Although <START:ggp> TR55 <END> expression was unaltered during <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -induced HIV activation , this receptor was still involved in the viral activation process . 
Antibody cross-linking of <START:ggp> TR55 <END> , in the absence of <START:ggp> exogenous TNF-alpha <END> , induced maximal HIV-1 expression , an up-modulation of surface <START:ggp> TR75 <END> , and nuclear <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity in OM-10.1 cultures . 
Surprisingly , this was the case even when an <START:ggp> antagonistic anti-TR55 antibody <END> was used . 
<START:ggp> Anti-TR55 antibody <END> cross-linking in <START:ana> chronically infected U1 promonocytic cultures <END> could only partially substitute for TNF-alpha-induced HIV-1 expression . 
CONCLUSIONS : Our results demonstrated that HIV-1 infection can selectively influence the surface expression of <START:ggp> TNF receptors <END> , potentially influencing its own expression and altering normal <START:ggp> immunoregulatory <END> signal transduction . 
Comparative mapping of <START:ggp> SRY <END> in the great apes . 
Cytogenetic studies of the <START:ggp> primate Y chromosomes <END> have suggested that extensive rearrangements have occurred during evolution of the great apes . 
We have used in situ hybridization to define these rearrangements at the molecular level . 
<START:ggp> pHU-14 <END> , a probe including sequences from the <START:ggp> sex determining gene SRY <END> , hybridizes close to the early replicating pseudoautosomal segment in a telomeric or subtelomeric position of the <START:ggp> Y chromosomes <END> of all great apes . 
The <START:ggp> low copy repeat <END> detected by the probe <START:ggp> Fr35-II <END> is obviously included in Y chromosomal rearrangements during hominid evolution . 
These results , combined with previous studies , suggest that the Y chromosome in great apes has a conserved region including the <START:ggp> pseudoautosomal region <END> and the testis-determining region . 
The rest of the <START:ggp> Y chromosome <END> has undergone several rearrangements in the different great apes . 
Calcium dependent activation of the <START:ggp> NF-AT transcription factor <END> by <START:ggp> p59fyn <END> . 
A <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> under the control of a <START:ggp> T-cell antigen receptor element <END> was activated in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> by antigen receptor triggering or by a combination of phorbol myristate acetate , which activates <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> , and a calcium ionophore . 
Both these signals were necessary for expression of the <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> . 
When co-transfected with a construct capable of overexpressing the <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase <END> <START:ggp> p59fyn <END> , the <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> was activated by <START:ggp> PMA <END> alone . 
Thus <START:ggp> p59fyn <END> could replace the calcium ionophore but not activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> . 
The activation by <START:ggp> p59fyn <END> plus <START:ggp> PMA <END> was blocked by EGTA and by the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A . 
Dependence for the proliferative response to <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> on an established erythroid differentiation program in a <START:ana> human hematopoietic cell line <END> , <START:ana> UT-7 <END> . 
Erythroid differentiation involves the activation of a number of erythroid-specific genes , most of which , including the <START:ggp> globin genes <END> and the <START:ggp> erythropoietin receptor ( Epo-R ) gene <END> , are , at least in part , regulated by the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> . 
In order to understand the relationship , if any , between expression of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , response to Epo and erythroid differentiation , we analyzed the expression of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , <START:ggp> Epo-R <END> and <START:ggp> globin genes <END> in an Epo-dependent human cell line , <START:ana> UT-7 <END> Epo . 
The results were compared to those obtained with the <START:ana> parental granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) -dependent cell line <END> , <START:ana> UT-7 <END> , which has a predominantly megakaryoblastic phenotype and is unable to proliferate continuously in the presence of <START:ggp> Epo <END> . 
<START:ggp> UT-7 Epo <END> and <START:ana> UT-7 <END> expressed similar levels of <START:ana> GATA-1 mRNA <END> and binding activity . 
The two lines also expressed comparable levels of <START:ana> Epo-R mRNA <END> while the number of <START:ggp> Epo <END> -binding sites on <START:ana> UT-7 Epo cells <END> was one-sixth the number of <START:ana> UT-7 cells <END> ( 2400 +/- 3 vs. 13 , 800 +/- 300 ) . 
This difference in the number of binding sites could be due to differences in cell surface ( <START:ana> UT-7 cells <END> are 20 % smaller than the parental <START:ana> UT-7 cells <END> ) or in receptor turnover . 
By Northern analysis , <START:ana> UT-7 cells <END> expressed detectable levels of <START:ggp> beta- and gamma-globin <END> but not <START:ggp> alpha-globin <END> . 
In comparison , <START:ana> UT-7 Epo cells <END> expressed alpha-globin and higher levels of <START:ggp> gamma-globin <END> ( 5-fold ) and <START:ggp> beta-globin <END> ( from barely to clearly detectable ) . 
<START:ggp> Globin chains <END> ( <START:ggp> alpha <END> , <START:ggp> beta <END> and <START:ggp> gamma <END> ) were clearly detectable by affinity chromatography in <START:ggp> UT-7 Epo <END> but not in <START:ana> UT-7 cells <END> . 
The frequency of the cells which expressed <START:ggp> beta- and gamma- globin genes <END> in the two cell populations was measured by immunofluorescence with <START:ggp> beta- and gamma-specific antibodies <END> . 
The number of <START:ana> gamma-positive cells <END> and their fluorescence intensity were higher in <START:ggp> UT-7 Epo <END> than in <START:ana> UT-7 cells <END> ( 0 to 17 % barely positive cells and 23 to 40 % clearly positive cells , respectively ) , indicating that the increase in <START:ana> globin mRNA <END> observed in <START:ggp> UT-7 Epo <END> is due to both an increase of gene expression per cell and an increase in numbers of cells containing <START:ggp> gamma-globin <END> . 
The levels of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , <START:ggp> Epo-R <END> and <START:ana> globin mRNA <END> expressed were not affected by a 24-hour incubation of either cell line with <START:ggp> Epo <END> , <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> or <START:ggp> interleukin-3 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> ) . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS ) 
The <START:ggp> Sp1 transcription factor <END> binds the <START:ggp> CD11b promoter <END> specifically in myeloid cells in vivo and is essential for <START:ggp> myeloid-specific promoter <END> activity . 
The <START:ggp> myeloid integrin CD11b <END> is expressed selectively on the surface of <START:ana> mature macrophages <END> , <START:ana> monocytes <END> , <START:ana> neutrophils <END> , and <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> . 
Lineage-specific expression is controlled at the level of mRNA transcription . 
Recent isolation of the <START:ggp> CD11b promoter <END> shows that 92 base pairs ( bp ) of <START:ggp> 5'-flanking DNA <END> are sufficient to direct myeloid-specific expression of a <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> . 
To characterize regulatory sequences important for promoter activity , we performed linker scanning analysis of the <START:ggp> 92-bp CD11b promoter <END> and demonstrate that a sequence at bp -60 is essential for <START:ggp> CD11b promoter <END> activity . 
We show that this sequence binds the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> in vitro and in vivo . 
In vivo the <START:ggp> Sp1 site <END> is bound only in <START:ana> myeloid ( U937 ) cells <END> , not in <START:ana> cervical carcinoma ( HeLa ) cells <END> . 
In addition , the macrophage <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> PU.1 binds the <START:ggp> CD11b promoter <END> in vitro and in vivo close to the <START:ggp> Sp1 site <END> . 
We propose a model in which binding of a <START:ggp> myeloid-specific factor <END> ( <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> ) allows a general factor ( <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> ) to bind in a tissue-specific fashion thereby contributing to the myeloid-specific expression of <START:ana> CD11b <END> . 
Transcription factor jun-B is target of <START:ana> autoreactive T-cells <END> in IDDM . 
Target antigens defined by <START:ggp> autoantibodies <END> in IDDM include insulin , a putative glycolipid that reacts with <START:ggp> islet cell antibodies <END> , and a <START:ggp> 64 , 000-M ( r ) protein <END> recently identified as <START:ggp> glutamic acid decarboxylase <END> . 
In addition , some IDDM sera that contain <START:ggp> antibodies <END> to <START:ggp> glutamic acid decarboxylase <END> also coprecipitate a <START:ggp> 38 , 000-M ( r ) protein <END> from islets . 
This study used a high titer anti-38 , 000-M ( r ) serum to screen <START:ggp> bacteriophage lambda cDNA <END> expression libraries and identified <START:ana> human islet <END> and <START:ana> placental clones <END> encoding <START:ggp> jun-B <END> , the <START:ggp> nuclear transcription protein <END> , of predicted 38 , 000 M ( r ) . 
<START:ana> Peripheral blood T-cells <END> exhibited significant proliferation in response to a recombinant fragment of <START:ggp> jun-B <END> ( amino acids 1-180 ) in 12 of 17 ( 71 % ) recent-onset IDDM subjects , 8 of 16 ( 50 % ) ICA-positive first-degree relatives of IDDM subjects who were at risk , 3 of 12 ( 25 % ) other autoimmune disease subjects , and 0 of 10 healthy control subjects . 
Proliferation to tetanus toxoid did not differ significantly between the groups . 
Responses to <START:ggp> jun-B <END> were not related to age , sex , or <START:ggp> human leukocyte antigen <END> status . 
Thus , <START:ana> autoreactive T-cells <END> identify a <START:ggp> novel antigen <END> , <START:ggp> p38 jun-B <END> , in IDDM and appear to indicate subjects at risk for the development of clinical disease . 
Stimulation of <START:ggp> interleukin-1 alpha <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin-1 beta <END> production in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> by protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors . 
<START:ggp> Protein phosphatases 1 and 2A <END> are important in regulating cellular functions by controlling the phosphorylation state of their substrates . 
In <START:ana> human monocytes <END> , the inhibitors of these <START:ggp> phosphatases <END> , okadaic acid and calyculin A , were found to increase the mRNA accumulation and cytokine production of <START:ggp> interleukin-1 beta <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin-1 alpha <END> . 
The increased <START:ana> mRNA <END> accumulation was found to be primarily because of the increase in the transcription rate of the <START:ggp> interleukin-1 genes <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ggp> interleukin-1 gene <END> transcription may be caused by the stimulation of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> activities , including those of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , by these <START:ggp> protein phosphatase <END> inhibitors . 
Okadaic acid increased the synthesis of the <START:ggp> interleukin-1 beta <END> precursor and mature forms and their secretion . 
This increased processing and secretion correlated with the stimulation of <START:ana> IL-1 beta convertase mRNA <END> accumulation . 
The stimulation of <START:ggp> interleukin-1 alpha <END> production by okadaic acid was more modest than that of <START:ggp> interleukin-1 beta <END> . 
However , the phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> precursor interleukin-1 alpha cytokine <END> was increased . 
These results show that protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors exert multiple effects on cytokine production in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and suggest that these two <START:ggp> phosphatases <END> play important roles in regulating <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> production . 
The <START:ggp> interleukin 2 CD28-responsive complex <END> contains at least three members of the <START:ggp> NF kappa B family <END> : <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , <START:ggp> p50 <END> , and <START:ggp> p65 <END> . 
Optimal activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> requires at least two signals . 
One signal can be delivered by the <START:ggp> antigen-specific T-cell receptor <END> , and the second signal is provided by the costimulatory molecule ( s ) delivered by the <START:ana> antigen-presenting cell <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD28 <END> is a <START:ggp> T-cell surface molecule <END> and stimulation through this protein plays an important role in delivering the second activation signal . 
In this report , we show that in <START:ana> human peripheral blood T cells <END> , <START:ggp> CD28 <END> -mediated signal transduction involves the <START:ggp> rel family proteins <END> -- <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , <START:ggp> p50 <END> , and <START:ggp> p65 <END> . 
Treatment of <START:ana> peripheral blood T cells <END> with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and <START:ggp> anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody <END> ( <START:ggp> mAb <END> ) results in augmentation of <START:ggp> nuclear c-Rel <END> , <START:ggp> p50 <END> , and <START:ggp> p65 <END> , and this augmentation can occur in the presence of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A . 
It is also shown in this report that , in response to <START:ggp> PMA/anti-CD28 mAb <END> or <START:ggp> anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb <END> , <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> , <START:ggp> p50 <END> , and <START:ggp> p65 <END> are associated with <START:ggp> CD28-responsive element <END> present in the <START:ggp> promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> human interleukin 2 gene <END> . 
The functional significance of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> involvement in the <START:ggp> CD28-responsive complex <END> is demonstrated by transient transfection analysis , where cotransfection of <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> augments the level of expression of a <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene <END> linked to the <START:ggp> CD28-responsive element <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> and <START:ggp> GATA-binding proteins <END> during human hematopoiesis . 
<START:ggp> Tal-1 <END> rearrangements are associated with nearly 30 % of human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia . 
<START:ggp> Tal-1 gene <END> encodes a putative <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> with a <START:ggp> basic helix-loop-helix domain <END> and is known to be predominantly expressed in <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> . 
We investigated the pattern of <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> expression in <START:ana> purified human hematopoietic cells <END> by in situ hybridization and <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase polymerase <END> chain reaction analysis . 
Both methods demonstrated that the <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> gene is expressed in megakaryocytes and erythroblasts as well as in <START:ana> basophilic granulocytes <END> . 
In addition , our results indicate that the <START:ggp> tal-1 1A promoter <END> , which contains two consensus <START:ggp> GATA-binding sites <END> , is active mainly in these lineages . 
Because the <START:ggp> GATA-1 gene <END> is known to transactivate several genes specific for the <START:ana> erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mastocytic/basophilic lineages <END> , we studied <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> expression in these purified <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> . 
We found that <START:ggp> GATA-1 and tal-1 genes <END> are coexpressed in these three lineages . 
Remarkably , the expression of both genes is downmodulated during erythroid and megakaryocytic terminal maturation . 
In <START:ana> immature hematopoietic cells <END> , <START:ggp> tal-1 and GATA-1 genes <END> are coexpressed in <START:ana> committed progenitors cells <END> ( <START:ana> CD34+/CD38 ( 2+ ) <END> ) , whereas they are not detectable in the most <START:ana> primitive cells <END> ( <START:ana> CD34 ( 2+ ) /CD38- <END> ) . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> GATA-2 <END> is strongly expressed in both <START:ana> most primitive and committed progenitors cells <END> , whereas <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> is mostly detected in most primitive ones . 
Altogether our results strongly suggest that <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> modulates the transcription of <START:ggp> tal-1 <END> during the differentiation of the <START:ana> erythroid , megakaryocytic , and basosophilic lineages <END> . 
The lytic transition of Epstein-Barr virus is imitated by <START:ana> recombinant B-cells <END> . 
Lytic transition of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is initiated by distinct immediate early regulators of the viral cycle , in synchronization to temporary , permissive conditions during host cell differentiation . 
We developed eukaryotic vectors suitable to imitate the processes involved in lytic transition in cell culture systems . 
Two stable <START:ana> B cell lines <END> were established : <START:ana> R59Z activator cells <END> were used to induce lytic EBV expression in a constitutive manner by the production of the <START:ggp> BZLF 1 trans-activator <END> ( <START:ggp> Zta <END> ) . 
<START:ana> R7-57 reporter cells <END> , on the other hand , signaled induced activity of the <START:ggp> lytic origin of EBV replication <END> ( <START:ggp> ori Lyt <END> ) . 
Different modes , like chemical induction , lytic superinfection with EBV and single gene trans-activation converted the <START:ggp> recombinant ori Lyt element <END> in <START:ana> R7-57 reporter cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> BZLF 1 <END> , transiently expressed in <START:ana> R7-57 reporter cells <END> , was the only <START:ggp> EBV trans-activator <END> found , sufficient in inducing the viral lytic cycle . 
Basing on these experiments , trans-cellular activation of EBV was tested by cocultivation of <START:ana> BZLF 1-expressing R59Z activator cells <END> with the <START:ana> R7-57 reporter line <END> . 
No lytic effect on the reporter cells could be measured , neither by cocultivation of <START:ana> activator cells <END> nor by coincubation of <START:ggp> BZLF 1 <END> -containing cell lysates . 
Latency breaking activity , however , was transferred from <START:ana> activator <END> to <START:ana> reporter cells <END> when active , exogenous virus was added . 
The cell system described in these experiments provides a tool for the detection of EBV reactivation and demonstrates the potential of the lytic <START:ggp> regulatory gene BZLF 1 <END> 
Costimulation of cAMP and <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> pathways inhibits the <START:ggp> CD3 <END> -dependent T cell activation and leads to a persistent expression of the <START:ggp> AP-1 transcription factor <END> . 
The effects mediated by a combined stimulation of cAMP -and <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) -dependent pathways have been investigated in different cellular systems , and it has been shown that they may complement each other in activating cell proliferation and differentiation . 
In this report , we show that upon the stimulation of both pathways <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> became refractory to activation via the <START:ggp> CD3/T cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TcR <END> ) complex . 
<START:ana> T cells <END> preincubated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and dibutyryl cAMP ( Bt2cAMP ) displayed a deficient proliferative ability in response to <START:ggp> anti-CD3 mAb <END> stimulation , whereas <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> treated individually with either Bt2cAMP or PMA responded comparably to untreated samples . 
We detected an association between the reduced mitogenic response and low expression of both <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) and the <START:ggp> alpha chain <END> ( <START:ggp> CD25 <END> ) of the <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> ) . 
Analysis of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization suggested that the <START:ggp> CD3 <END> / <START:ggp> TcR <END> -dependent signal transduction was impaired in <START:ana> PMA/Bt2cAMP-treated cells <END> . 
Remarkably , we observed that these samples displayed a persistent expression of the <START:ggp> c-fos protooncogene <END> , associated to an increased <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> DNA-binding activity , whereas no variations of <START:ggp> CREB <END> or <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> were detected . 
Neither Bt2cAMP nor PMA individually mediated these sustained effects , which therefore appear as a consequence of the interplay between both metabolic stimuli . 
Altogether , the data provide the evidence that both pathways complement each other in regulating gene expression and , conversely , downregulate the <START:ggp> TcR <END> transduction mechanisms . 
The <START:ggp> lymphotoxin promoter <END> is stimulated by <START:ggp> HTLV-I tax <END> activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> human T-cell lines <END> . 
The <START:ggp> HTLV-I transcriptional activator tax <END> was used to gain insight into the mechanism of <START:ggp> lymphotoxin ( LT ; TNF-beta ) gene <END> induction . 
<START:ana> Tax-expressing cell lines <END> produce <START:ggp> LT <END> biologic activity . 
An <START:ggp> LT promoter ( LT-293 ) CAT construct <END> that contained an <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> was active in the <START:ana> LT-producing C81-66-45 cell line <END> , which contains defective HTLV-I but expresses <START:ggp> tax <END> . 
The observation that a <START:ggp> mutated LT-kappa B construct <END> ( <START:ggp> M1-CAT <END> ) was inactive in <START:ana> C81-66-45 <END> , confirmed the importance of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ggp> LT <END> gene expression . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> was transfected into <START:ana> HTLV-I-negative human T-cell lines <END> . 
<START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> stably expressing <START:ggp> tax <END> contained elevated levels of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> that directly bound to the <START:ggp> LT-kappa B site <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> co-transfected with <START:ggp> reporter constructs <END> into <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> maximally activated <START:ggp> HTLV-I-LTR-CAT <END> and <START:ggp> kappa B-fos-CAT <END> and also activated <START:ggp> LT-293 <END> to a lesser extent . 
In <START:ana> JM T cells <END> , <START:ggp> tax <END> induced <START:ggp> LT-293 <END> activity by two- to four-fold , though there was no induction of <START:ggp> M1-CAT <END> . 
The increase in <START:ggp> LT-293 <END> <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity mirrored the increase in <START:ggp> LT <END> biologic activity seen under these conditions . 
These studies , the first to demonstrate induction of <START:ggp> LT promoter <END> activity over basal levels , indicate that <START:ggp> HTLV-I tax <END> causes low-level activation of both endogenous <START:ggp> LT <END> and the <START:ggp> LT promoter <END> , at least in part through activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
A concatenated form of <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr viral DNA <END> in <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> induced by transfection with <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> . 
The replicative form of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) DNA was studied using two <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> , X50-7 and 6F11 , which are latently infected by Epstein-Barr virus . 
The lytic cycle of EBV infection was induced by transfection of the cells with the <START:ggp> BRLF1/BZLF1 coding region <END> of the <START:ggp> P3HR-1 defective genome <END> . 
We combined two techniques to identify the productive replicative form of <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr viral DNA <END> in the <START:ana> lytic cycle-induced cells <END> . 
Restriction enzyme analysis followed by Southern blot hybridization identified a significant increase in the fused fragment encompassing both ends of <START:ggp> EBV DNA <END> . 
This indicates an increase in either <START:ggp> episomal DNA <END> or <START:ggp> concatameric linear DNA <END> . 
Southern blot analysis of in situ lysing gels revealed that the cellular content of <START:ggp> linear EBV DNA <END> was also increased significantly after the initiation of the viral lytic cycle , while the amount of circular DNA remained approximately constant . 
We propose from these results that the source of the fused fragment encompassing both ends of <START:ggp> EBV DNA <END> is a <START:ggp> concatenated linear EBV DNA molecule <END> , and that such a concatenated molecule most likely represents a replicative form of <START:ggp> EBV DNA <END> in productively infected cells . 
Expression levels of the <START:ggp> thyrotropin receptor gene <END> in autoimmune thyroid disease : coregulation with parameters of thyroid function and inverse relation to <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex classes I and II <END> . 
Using a <START:ggp> human TSH receptor ( TSH-R ) cDNA probe <END> , we investigated <START:ggp> TSH-R <END> transcript levels in 13 human thyroid fragments by Northern blot analysis ; 7 Graves ' disease , 2 Hashimoto 's disease , 3 endemic goiter , and 1 healthy thyroid gland were studied . 
<START:ggp> TSH-R <END> expression levels were variable , but displayed a close correlation to the expression of <START:ggp> thyroid peroxidase <END> ( r = 0.703 ; P < 0.05 ) , <START:ggp> thyroglobulin <END> ( r = 0.817 ; P < 0.01 ) , and the <START:ggp> nuclear oncogene c-fos <END> ( r = 0.935 ; P < 0.001 ) , but not <START:ggp> c-myc <END> . 
Overall , <START:ggp> TSH-R <END> transcript levels were low or absent in those thyroids in which expression of the <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex class I or II <END> ( <START:ggp> MHC I or II <END> ) was high , thus establishing an inverse relation ( <START:ggp> MHC I <END> , r = -0.791 ; P < 0.01 ; <START:ggp> MHC II <END> , r = -0.784 ; P < 0.01 ) . 
In situ hybridization showed that apart from <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , <START:ana> thyroid cells <END> themselves were the source of <START:ggp> MHC II transcripts <END> . 
<START:ggp> gamma-Interferon <END> expression was only detectable in 1 Hashimoto 's goiter . 
Our findings suggest that next to lymphocyte infiltration , active regulatory events in the <START:ana> thyrocyte <END> are responsible for the inverse relation between functional parameters ( <START:ggp> TSH-R <END> , <START:ggp> thyroid peroxidase <END> , <START:ggp> thyroglobulin <END> , and c-fos ) and immunological markers ( <START:ggp> MHC I and II <END> ) . 
Functional antagonism between vitamin D3 and retinoic acid in the regulation of CD14 and CD23 expression during monocytic differentiation of <START:ana> U-937 cells <END> . 
1 , 25 alpha-Dihydroxicholecalciferol ( VitD3 ) and retinoic acid ( RA ) are important regulators of the proliferation and differentiation of several cell types . 
This paper describes how the expression of the <START:ggp> monocyte-macrophage Ag <END> , <START:ggp> CD14 <END> , and the low <START:ggp> affinity Fc receptor <END> for <START:ggp> IgE <END> , <START:ggp> CD23 <END> , were inversely regulated during VitD3 -and RA-induced monocytic differentiation of <START:ana> human U-937 monoblasts <END> . 
PMA induced the expression of both <START:ggp> CD14 <END> and <START:ana> CD23 mRNA <END> and protein . 
Exposure to VitD3 rapidly induced the de novo expression of <START:ana> CD14 mRNA <END> and protein . 
The addition of cycloheximide completely blocked the VitD3 induction of <START:ana> CD14 mRNA <END> expression , indicating that the induction was dependent on ongoing protein synthesis . 
While inducing <START:ggp> CD14 <END> expression , VitD3 concomitantly suppressed the basal , PMA- , and RA-inducible <START:ggp> CD23 <END> expression in a dose-dependent manner . 
In contrast , <START:ana> U-937 cells <END> induced by RA strongly increased their expression of <START:ana> CD23 mRNA <END> and protein , whereas they completely lacked detectable CD14 cell surface or mRNA expression . 
Furthermore , the VitD3 -and the PMA-induced <START:ggp> CD14 <END> expression was inhibited as a temporal consequence of the RA-induced differentiation . 
The results suggest that there exists a functional antagonism between VitD3 and RA that may have important implications for the regulation of certain immune and inflammatory responses through their inverse effects on CD14 and CD23 gene expression . 
Cell-specific bifunctional role of <START:ggp> Jun oncogene family members <END> on <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> -dependent transcription . 
Interaction between <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) - and <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) -mediated signaling is suggested by the ability of the <START:ggp> PKC <END> activating phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) to inhibit <START:ggp> GR <END> -dependent transcription of the mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) . 
Here we report that this interference is cell specific , as TPA augmented dexamethasone-induced transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> MMTV LTR <END> in several <START:ana> T cell lines <END> but was inhibitory in <START:ana> NIH-3T3 fibroblasts <END> . 
TPA-GR synergism was determined to have occurred at the <START:ggp> GR-responsive element <END> ( <START:ggp> GRE <END> ) level by functional analysis of <START:ggp> deletion mutants <END> or <START:ggp> synthetic GRE oligonucleotides <END> driving <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase <END> expression . 
Synergism required an intact <START:ggp> GR DNA-binding domain <END> , whereas <START:ggp> amino- or carboxyl-terminal domains <END> were dispensable . 
The effect was abrogated by the <START:ggp> PKC <END> inhibitor staurosporine , suggesting a role for <START:ggp> PKC <END> . 
Increased <START:ggp> c-jun <END> , <START:ggp> jun-B <END> , and <START:ggp> jun-D <END> expression above basal levels and increased transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> AP-1/TPA responsive elements <END> fused to <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase vectors <END> were observed in <START:ana> T cells <END> treated with TPA alone or in combination with dexamethasone . 
The ability of <START:ggp> Jun proteins <END> to cooperate with <START:ggp> GR <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> has been investigated after transfection of <START:ggp> c-jun , jun-B , or jun-D expression vectors <END> , which augmented <START:ggp> GR <END> -dependent transcription from either <START:ggp> MMTV LTR <END> or <START:ggp> GRE <END> . 
Conversely , <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and <START:ggp> jun-B <END> transfection blunted <START:ggp> GR <END> -dependent transcription in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
The presence of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> had a negative influence on <START:ggp> GR <END> function and correlated with the cell-specific synergistic or antagonistic activity of <START:ggp> Jun <END> with respect to <START:ggp> GR <END> ; high basal expression of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> as well as <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> DNA binding and transcriptional activity were observed in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , but not in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Furthermore overexpression of <START:ggp> exogenous c-fos <END> has an inhibitory effect on <START:ggp> GR <END> -dependent transcription from <START:ggp> GRE <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
We propose that <START:ggp> Jun <END> plays a bifunctional role on <START:ggp> GR <END> -dependent transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> GRE <END> , selecting either synergistic or antagonistic activity depending on the cell-specific microenvironment . 
In this regard , intracellular levels of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> appear to be influential . 
Cell type- and stage-specific expression of the <START:ggp> CD20/B1 antigen <END> correlates with the activity of a diverged octamer DNA motif present in its <START:ggp> promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> CD20 ( B1 ) gene <END> encodes a <START:ggp> B cell-specific protein <END> involved in the regulation of human B cell proliferation and differentiation . 
Studies with <START:ggp> 5 ' deletion CD20 promoter-CAT constructs <END> have previously revealed two regions of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> between bases -186 and -280 and between bases -280 and -454 which contained <START:ggp> positive regulatory elements <END> . 
In this study we identified a <START:ggp> sequence element <END> present in the most proximal region located between bases -214 and -201 , TTCTTCTAATTAA , which is important in the high constitutive expression of <START:ggp> CD20 <END> in mature B cells and the induction of <START:ggp> CD20 <END> in <START:ana> pre-B cells <END> . 
This <START:ggp> sequence element <END> was referred to as the <START:ggp> BAT box <END> and its deletion significantly reduced the activity of a CD20 promoter-CAT construct in B cells . 
Mobility shift assays with various mutant probes and B cell nuclear extracts demonstrated that the core sequence TAAT was essential for binding to this site . 
Cross competition experiments with an octamer sequence from the Ig heavy chain promoter , the <START:ggp> BAT box <END> , and a TA-rich sequence present in the <START:ggp> CD21 promoter <END> revealed that all three sequences bound the same <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> suggesting that the <START:ggp> BAT box binding proteins <END> were <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> . 
Southwestern blotting and UV cross-linking studies confirmed that the <START:ggp> BAT box binding proteins <END> were <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> . 
The affinity of the <START:ggp> BAT box binding proteins <END> for the <START:ggp> BAT box <END> was approximately 25-fold less than for the <START:ggp> octamer sequence <END> and the <START:ggp> BAT box binding proteins <END> dissociated from the <START:ggp> BAT box <END> 10-fold more rapidly than from the <START:ggp> octamer sequence <END> . 
Despite this lower affinity , a trimer of the <START:ggp> BAT box sequence <END> was as efficiently transactivated by an <START:ggp> Oct-2 expression vector <END> as was a trimer of the <START:ggp> octamer sequence <END> in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> BAT box <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> were also implicated in the induction of <START:ggp> CD20 <END> in the <START:ana> pre-B cell line <END> , <START:ana> PB-697 <END> , via phorbol esters . 
The induction of <START:ana> CD20 mRNA <END> was temporally associated with induction of <START:ana> Oct-2 mRNA <END> and a <START:ggp> BAT box-deleted CD20-CAT construct <END> , in contrast to the wild type , was poorly induced by phorbol esters . 
Together these results suggest that the <START:ggp> BAT box binding proteins <END> are important in the B cell specific expression of <START:ggp> CD20 <END> and perhaps <START:ggp> CD21 <END> . 
<START:ana> Human CD4 lymphocytes <END> specifically recognize a peptide representing the fusion region of the <START:ggp> hybrid protein <END> <START:ggp> pml/RAR alpha <END> present in <START:ana> acute promyelocytic leukemia cells <END> . 
Fusion proteins present in <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> frequently contain a new amino acid at the <START:ggp> fusion point <END> . 
We tested whether a peptide ( BCR1/25 ) encompassing the <START:ggp> fusion region <END> of the hybrid molecule <START:ggp> pml/RAR alpha <END> , which is selectively expressed by <START:ana> acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) cells <END> , can be recognized by <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> in vitro . 
<START:ana> CD4+ lymphocytes <END> , at both polyclonal and clonal level , recognized peptide BCR1/25 in an <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> -- restricted fashion on presentation by <START:ana> autologous antigen-presenting cell <END> ( <START:ana> APC <END> ) or by <START:ana> APC <END> expressing the <START:ggp> HLA-DR11 restricting molecule <END> . 
Control peptides corresponding to the normal <START:ggp> pml <END> and <START:ggp> RAR alpha proteins <END> were not recognized . 
One clone ( <START:ana> DEG5 <END> ) also exerted a high and specific cytotoxicity against <START:ana> autologous cells <END> pulsed with BCR1/25 . 
The <START:ana> autologous DE LCL <END> containing a transduced <START:ggp> pml/RAR alpha fusion gene <END> and expressing a bcr1 type of the <START:ggp> pml/RAR alpha <END> hybrid protein induced the proliferation of <START:ana> DE anti-BCR1/25 T cell clones <END> . 
It is concluded that the <START:ggp> bcr1 type-pml/RAR alpha fusion protein <END> of <START:ana> APL <END> contains an antigenic site , absent from the normal parent molecules and recognized by <START:ana> human CD4+ lymphocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> zinc finger transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> is essential for and restricts differentiation along the <START:ana> macrophage lineage <END> . 
We have isolated <START:ggp> cDNA clones <END> of <START:ggp> myeloid differentiation primary response ( MyD ) genes <END> , activated in the absence of de novo protein synthesis following induction for differentiation along either the <START:ana> macrophage <END> or <START:ana> granulocyte lineage <END> in human <START:ana> myeloblastic leukemia HL-60 cells <END> . 
One <START:ggp> cDNA clone <END> of a primary response gene , expressed upon macrophage differentiation , encoded for <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> , a <START:ggp> zinc finger transcription factor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Egr-1 gene <END> was observed to be transcriptionally silent in <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> , but active in <START:ana> U-937 <END> and <START:ana> M1 cells <END> , the latter two being predetermined for macrophage differentiation . 
<START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> antisense oligomers in the culture media blocked macrophage differentiation in both <START:ana> myeloid leukemia cell lines <END> and normal <START:ana> myeloblasts <END> . 
<START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> constitutively expressing an <START:ggp> Egr-1 transgene <END> ( <START:ggp> HL-60Egr-1 <END> ) could be induced for <START:ana> macrophage <END> , but not <START:ana> granulocyte <END> , differentiation . 
These observations indicate that expression of <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> is essential for and restricts differentiation of <START:ana> myeloblasts <END> along the <START:ana> macrophage lineage <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 <END> interacts with an <START:ggp> EBNA2 responsive cis-element <END> of the <START:ggp> terminal protein 1 gene promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus protein EBNA2 <END> acts as a <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> of <START:ggp> cellular and viral genes <END> and plays a crucial role in the immortalization of <START:ana> human primary B-cells <END> by EBV . 
We have shown previously that <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> transactivates the promoters of the <START:ggp> latent membrane antigens <END> <START:ggp> LMP <END> , <START:ggp> TP1 <END> and <START:ggp> TP2 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> TP1 gene <END> was chosen as a model system to study the molecular mechanism of <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> mediated transactivation . 
To identify an <START:ggp> EBNA2 dependent cis-acting element <END> , various <START:ggp> TP1 promoter-reporter gene constructs <END> were transfected in the absence and presence of an <START:ggp> EBNA2 expression vector <END> into the established <START:ana> B-cell line BL41-P3HR1 <END> . 
We were able to delineate an <START:ggp> 81 bp EBNA2 responsive region <END> between -258 and -177 relative to the <START:ggp> TP1 RNA start site <END> . 
The element worked in either orientation and could mediate <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> dependent transactivation on a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed three specific <START:ggp> protein-DNA complexes <END> formed with sequences of the <START:ggp> EBNA2 responsive element <END> . 
Two of these were not cell type specific , but the third was detected only in <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> positive cell extracts . 
Gel-shift analysis in the presence of <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> is a component of the third complex . 
Thus , these experiments demonstrate that <START:ggp> EBNA2 <END> interacts with an <START:ggp> EBNA2 responsive cis-element <END> of the <START:ggp> TP1 promoter <END> 
Minimally modified low density <START:ggp> lipoprotein <END> -induced inflammatory responses in <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> are mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate . 
We have previously shown that <START:ana> minimally oxidized LDL ( MM-LDL ) activated endothelial cells <END> to increase their interaction with <START:ana> monocytes <END> but not <START:ana> neutrophils <END> , inducing monocyte but not neutrophil binding and synthesis of <START:ggp> monocyte chemotactic protein-1 <END> and <START:ggp> monocyte colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> ) . 
In the present studies we have examined the signaling pathways by which this monocyte-specific response is induced . 
Both induction of monocyte binding and mRNA levels for <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> by <START:ggp> MM-LDL <END> were not inhibited in protein kinase C-depleted <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> . 
A number of our studies indicate that cAMP is the second messenger for the effects of <START:ggp> MM-LDL <END> cited above . 
Incubation of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> with <START:ggp> MM-LDL <END> caused a 173 % increase in intracellular cAMP levels . 
Agents which increased cAMP levels , including cholera toxin , pertussis toxin , dibutyryl cAMP , and isoproterenol mimicked the actions of <START:ggp> MM-LDL <END> . 
Agents which elevated cAMP were also shown to activate <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> , suggesting a role for this transcription factor in activation of monocyte-endothelial interactions . 
Although <START:ana> endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule ( ELAM ) mRNA <END> synthesis can be regulated by <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> ELAM <END> was not expressed and <START:ana> ELAM mRNA <END> was only slightly elevated in response to <START:ggp> MM-LDL <END> . 
We present evidence that induction of <START:ana> neutrophil <END> binding by LPS is actually suppressed by agents that elevated cAMP levels . 
<START:ggp> Human T cell transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> stimulates HIV-1 expression . 
A family of transcriptional activating proteins , the <START:ggp> GATA factors <END> , has been shown to bind to a consensus motif through a <START:ggp> highly conserved C4 zinc finger DNA binding domain <END> . 
One member of this multigene family , <START:ggp> GATA-3 <END> , is most abundantly expressed in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , a cellular target for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection and replication . 
In vitro <START:ggp> DNase I <END> footprinting analysis revealed six <START:ggp> hGATA-3 binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> U3 region <END> ( the <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory domain <END> ) of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> . 
Cotransfection of an <START:ggp> hGATA-3 expression plasmid <END> with a <START:ggp> reporter plasmid <END> whose transcription is directed by the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> resulted in 6- to 10-fold stimulation of <START:ggp> LTR <END> -mediated transcription , whereas site specific mutation of these <START:ggp> GATA sites <END> resulted in virtual abrogation of the activation by <START:ggp> hGATA-3 <END> . 
Further , deletion of the <START:ggp> hGATA-3 transcriptional activation domain <END> abolished GATA-dependent HIV-1 trans-activation , showing that the stimulation of viral transcription observed is a direct effect of <START:ggp> cotransfected hGATA-3 <END> . 
Introduction of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 plasmids <END> in which the <START:ggp> GATA sites <END> have been mutated into human <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> also caused a significant reduction in <START:ggp> LTR <END> -mediated transcription at both the basal level and in ( PHA- plus PMA- ) <START:ana> stimulated T cells <END> . 
These observations suggest that in addition to its normal role in <START:ana> T lymphocyte <END> gene regulation , <START:ggp> hGATA-3 <END> may also play a significant role in HIV-1 transcriptional activation . 
Cytokine modulation of HIV expression . 
<START:ggp> Cytokines <END> , the <START:ggp> peptide hormones <END> which control the homeostasis of the immune system and also play a fundamental role in inflammatory and immune mediated reactions , have been involved at multiple levels in the pathogenesis of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . 
Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) has been shown to induce production of several <START:ggp> cytokines <END> both in vitro and in vivo . 
Conversely , several <START:ggp> cytokines <END> modulate the levels of HIV expression in infected cells of both <START:ana> T lymphocytic and mononuclear phagocytic lineage <END> . 
<START:ana> Activated mononuclear cells <END> , particularly <START:ana> B cells <END> which are in a state of chronic activation in HIV infected individuals , release <START:ggp> HIV-inductive cytokines <END> and thus play a potentially important role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection . 
Cloning and functional characterization of <START:ggp> early B-cell factor <END> , a regulator of lymphocyte-specific gene expression . 
<START:ggp> Early B-cell factor <END> ( <START:ggp> EBF <END> ) was identified previously as a tissue-specific and differentiation stage-specific <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> that participates in the regulation of the <START:ggp> pre-B and B lymphocyte-specific mb-1 gene <END> . 
Partial amino acid sequences obtained from purified <START:ggp> EBF <END> were used to isolate <START:ggp> cDNA clones <END> , which by multiple criteria encode <START:ggp> EBF <END> . 
The <START:ggp> recombinant polypeptide <END> formed sequence-specific complexes with the <START:ggp> EBF-binding site <END> in the <START:ggp> mb-1 promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> cDNA <END> hybridized to multiple transcripts in <START:ana> pre-B and B-cell lines <END> , but transcripts were not detected at significant levels in <START:ana> plasmacytoma <END> , <START:ana> T-cell <END> , and <START:ana> nonlymphoid cell lines <END> . 
Expression of recombinant <START:ggp> EBF <END> in <START:ana> transfected nonlymphoid cells <END> strongly activated transcription from reporter plasmids containing functional <START:ggp> EBF-binding sites <END> . 
Analysis of DNA binding by deletion mutants of <START:ggp> EBF <END> identified an <START:ggp> amino-terminal cysteine-rich DNA-binding domain <END> lacking obvious sequence similarity to known <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
DNA-binding assays with cotranslated wild-type and truncated forms of <START:ggp> EBF <END> indicated that the protein interacts with its site as a <START:ggp> homodimer <END> . 
Deletions delineated a <START:ggp> carboxy-terminal dimerization region <END> containing two repeats of 15 amino acids that show similarity with the <START:ggp> dimerization domains <END> of <START:ggp> basic-helix-loop-helix proteins <END> . 
Together , these data suggest that <START:ggp> EBF <END> represents a novel regulator of B lymphocyte-specific gene expression . 
Cell-specific expression of <START:ggp> helix-loop-helix transcription factors <END> encoded by the <START:ggp> E2A gene <END> . 
The <START:ggp> E2A gene <END> encodes <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> of the <START:ggp> helix-loop-helix family <END> that are implicated in cell-specific gene expression as part of <START:ggp> dimeric complexes <END> that interact with <START:ggp> E box enhancer elements <END> . 
It has previously been shown that transcripts of the <START:ggp> E2A gene <END> can be detected in a wide range of cell types . 
We have now examined expression of the <START:ggp> mouse E2A gene <END> at the protein level using polyclonal antisera directed against distinct portions of the <START:ggp> E2A protein <END> to probe blots of cellular extracts . 
A <START:ggp> 73 kDa protein <END> was identified by this analysis : this protein is highly enriched in <START:ana> cell lines of B lymphoid origin <END> as compared to <START:ana> pancreatic beta-cells <END> and <START:ana> fibroblast cells <END> . 
The detection of this protein selectively in extracts of <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> correlates with the presence of the <START:ggp> E box <END> -binding activity <START:ggp> LEF1/BCF1 <END> in these cells ; this binding activity was previously shown to be efficiently recognized by antiserum directed against <START:ggp> E2A gene products <END> . 
Transfection of cells with full length <START:ggp> E2A cDNA <END> leads to appearance of protein co-migrating with the <START:ggp> 73 kDa protein <END> on SDS gel electrophoresis and co-migrating with <START:ggp> LEF1/BCF1 <END> on mobility shift analysis . 
Our results are consistent with the view that the DNA-binding activity <START:ggp> LEF1/BCF1 <END> is a <START:ggp> homodimer of E2A proteins <END> ; the selective appearance of this putative cell-specific transcription factor in <START:ana> B lymphoid cells <END> seems to be attributable , at least in part , to the elevated <START:ggp> E2A protein <END> concentrations in these cells . 
Hypertension in pregnancy . 
Pregnancy-induced hypertension ( PIH ) is a frequent cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality . 
In the present study we focused on the pathophysiology of PIH , mainly on the role of mineralocorticoids , reversed blood pressure patterns , and the resulting necessity of continuous monitoring of the preeclamptic mother . 
Problems of antihypertensive therapy are discussed and the first results of a pilot study with Urapidil are presented . 
To examine the role of mineralocorticoids in the pathophysiology of PIH , we studied plasma aldosterone and 18-hydroxy-corticosterone ( 18-OH-B ) levels in 25 women with PIH and in 25 healthy pregnant women . 
Furthermore , we evaluated the <START:ggp> mineralocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> MR <END> ) count in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> in the 2 groups . 
The MR-count was significantly decreased in the PIH-group . 
The values of plasma aldosterone and 18-OH-B were also low . 
These results can not be explained by receptor down-regulation due to higher level of mineralocorticoids of the zona glomerulosa . 
Perhaps deoxycorticosterone or a hitherto unknown mineralocorticoid is responsible for the hypertension and altered <START:ggp> MR <END> -status . 
The first results of continuous blood pressure measurements with a noninvasive , real-time blood pressure monitor ( Finapres ) are presented . 
The comparison of the obtained values with intraarterial measurements demonstrates a good correlation between the two methods . 
We also report on the first experiences with Urapidil in the treatment of hypertension in severe preeclampsia . 
The data show that hypertension in preeclamptic women can be treated by Urapidil without side effects or reflex-tachycardia . 
Further studies will have to prove if Urapidil is suited for prepartal treatment of PIH as well . 
Suppression of a cellular differentiation program by phorbol esters coincides with inhibition of binding of a <START:ggp> cell-specific transcription factor <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-E2 <END> ) to an <START:ggp> enhancer element <END> required for expression of an <START:ggp> erythroid-specific gene <END> . 
Induction by hemin increases , while induction with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) represses , <START:ggp> erythroid-specific gene <END> expression in the <START:ana> human cell line K562 <END> . 
We analyzed the effects of hemin or TPA induction on the binding and activity of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> at a <START:ggp> regulatory element <END> found within the <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory sequences <END> of many <START:ggp> erythroid-specific genes <END> . 
TPA induction increases the binding of <START:ggp> ubiquitous AP-1 factors <END> to this element . 
TPA induction inhibits the binding of the <START:ggp> lineage limited transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-E2 <END> to this <START:ggp> transcriptional control element <END> . 
Hemin induction of <START:ana> K562 cells <END> does not facilitate the binding of <START:ggp> NF-E2 <END> to its recognition site . 
Hemin induction appears to nonspecifically increase the expression of transiently transfected genes in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
Beyond this nonspecific increase in gene expression , <START:ggp> hemin <END> induction acts to increase the activity of the <START:ggp> lineage limited transcription factor <END> NF-E2 . 
The divergent effects of hemin and TPA on gene expression in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> are mediated , in part , by their contrasting effects on the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-E2 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-3 <END> expression by <START:ana> activated T cells <END> involves an inducible , <START:ggp> T-cell-specific factor <END> and an <START:ggp> octamer binding protein <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-3 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> ) is exclusively expressed by <START:ana> activated T <END> and <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> , a function that is tightly controlled both in a lineage-specific and in a stimulation-dependent manner . 
We have investigated the protein binding characteristics and functional importance of the <START:ggp> ACT-1-activating region <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> promoter . 
This region binds an inducible , <START:ggp> T-cell-specific factor <END> over its <START:ggp> 5 ' end <END> , a site that is necessary for the expression of <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> in the absence of other upstream elements . 
Over its <START:ggp> 3 ' end <END> , it binds a factor that is ubiquitously and constitutively expressed . 
This factor is <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> or an <START:ggp> immunologically related octamer-binding protein <END> , and it plays a role in coordinating the activity of several <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> . 
These characteristics make the <START:ggp> ACT-1 site <END> analogous to the activating <START:ggp> ARRE-1 site <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> . 
Furthermore , and despite a lack of sequence homology , the promoters of <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> share an organizational pattern of regulatory elements that is likely to be important for the T-cell-specific expression of these genes . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-4 <END> inhibits the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of <START:ana> c-jun and c-fos messenger RNA <END> and <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> binding activity in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
We studied the effect of <START:ggp> interleukin-4 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> ) on the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induction of two immediate early genes <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> . 
These genes encode proteins that form the <START:ggp> dimeric complex <END> <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) , which is active as a <START:ggp> transcriptional factor <END> . 
Maximal accumulation of either <START:ana> c-fos and c-jun messenger RNA <END> ( mRNA ) occurred 30 minutes after LPS addition . 
When cells were treated with <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> for 5 hours before LPS activation , both the c-fos and the c-jun mRNA expression was decreased . 
The inhibition of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and c-jun expression by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> in <START:ana> LPS-treated cells <END> was shown to be due to a lower transcription rate of the <START:ggp> c-fos and c-jun genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> did not affect the stability of the <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-jun transcripts <END> . 
Finally , using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , evidence was obtained that <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> inhibits LPS-induced expression of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> protein . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> suppresses the induction of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in <START:ana> human activated monocytes <END> . 
Transient pseudohypoaldosteronism in obstructive renal disease with transient reduction of <START:ggp> lymphocytic aldosterone receptors <END> . 
Results in two affected infants . 
We report two patients with transient pseudohypoaldosteronism due to obstructive renal disease . 
Both patients presented with a salt-losing episode simulating adrenal insufficiency . 
In one patient , transient reduction of <START:ggp> aldosterone receptors <END> could be documented , while in the second patient the clinical and biochemical parameters were consistent with transient pseudohypoaldosteronism . 
<START:ggp> Aldosterone receptors <END> were normal in both patients 
<START:ggp> Aldosterone-specific membrane receptors <END> and rapid non-genomic actions of mineralocorticoids . 
Functional studies in <START:ana> extrarenal , non-epithelial cells <END> such as <START:ana> smooth muscle cells <END> and more recently <START:ana> circulating human lymphocytes <END> have provided increasing evidence that aldosterone produces not only classical genomic effects , but also rapid , non-genomic effects on transmembrane electrolyte movements . 
These involve activation of the <START:ggp> sodium/proton exchanger <END> of the cell membrane at very low , physiological concentrations of aldosterone with an acute onset within 1-2 min . 
A second messenger cascade involved is the inositol 1 , 4 , 5-trisphosphate/calcium pathway which responds over the same rapid time course . 
Such changes clearly can not be explained by genomic mechanisms , which are responsible for later effects than the membrane related rapid responses . 
The mechanisms underlying these rapid effects of aldosterone on electrolytes have been extensively studied in <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> , which thus may represent valuable tools in the delineation of the receptor-effector mechanisms involved . 
The unique characteristics of this new pathway for steroid action include its rapid time course , 10 , 000-fold selectivity for aldosterone over cortisol and the ineffectiveness of spironolactones , classical mineralocorticoid antagonists , as antagonists of the response . 
<START:ggp> Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef protein <END> inhibits <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> induction in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) can establish a persistent and latent infection in <START:ana> CD4+ T lymphocytes <END> ( W.C.Greene , N.Engl.J. Med.324 : 308-317 , 1991 ; S.M.Schnittman , M.C.Psallidopoulos , H.C. Lane , L.Thompson , M.Baseler , F.Massari , C.H.Fox , N.P.Salzman , and A.S.Fauci , Science 245 : 305-308 , 1989 ) . 
Production of HIV-1 from latently infected cells requires host cell activation by <START:ggp> T-cell mitogens <END> ( T.Folks , D.M.Powell , M.M.Lightfoote , S.Benn , M.A. Martin , and A.S.Fauci , Science 231 : 600-602 , 1986 ; D.Zagury , J. Bernard , R.Leonard , R.Cheynier , M.Feldman , P.S.Sarin , and R.C. Gallo , Science 231 : 850-853 , 1986 ) . 
This activation is mediated by the <START:ggp> host transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> [ G.Nabel and D.Baltimore , Nature ( London ) 326 : 711-717 , 1987 ] . 
We report here that the <START:ggp> HIV-1-encoded Nef protein <END> inhibits the induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA-binding activity by <START:ggp> T- cell mitogens <END> . 
However , <START:ggp> Nef <END> does not affect the DNA-binding activity of other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> implicated in HIV-1 regulation , including <START:ggp> SP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> USF <END> , <START:ggp> URS <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
Additionally , <START:ggp> Nef <END> inhibits the induction of HIV-1- and interleukin 2-directed gene expression , and the effect on HIV-1 transcription depends on an intact <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-binding site <END> . 
These results indicate that defective recruitment of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> may underlie <START:ggp> Nef <END> 's negative transcriptional effects on the <START:ggp> HIV-1 and interleukin 2 promoters <END> . 
Further evidence suggests that <START:ggp> Nef <END> inhibits <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> induction by interfering with a signal derived from the <START:ggp> T-cell receptor complex <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> , <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and <START:ggp> jun B <END> in peripheral blood lymphocytes from young and elderly adults . 
The expression of <START:ggp> c-fos , c-jun and jun B proto-oncogenes <END> was studied in <START:ana> phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) activated peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBL <END> ) from young and aged humans . 
Specific <START:ana> mRNAs <END> for <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> were detectable within 30 min after cell activation and reached maximal levels within 2 h . 
Both <START:ana> c-fos and jun B mRNAs <END> decreased to pre-activation levels within 6 h , while <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> remained elevated . 
In <START:ana> PHA-activated PBL <END> , no age-related differences were observed in c-fos or jun B mRNA expression . 
However , <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> levels decreased significantly ( 1.73 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.09 arbitrary units , P < 0.01 , young vs. old ) in <START:ana> PBL <END> from elderly individuals activated with <START:ggp> PHA <END> . 
Because previous work has demonstrated that <START:ana> T cells <END> from elderly individuals may display normal proliferative responses when activated via the <START:ggp> anti-CD2 <END> pathway , c-jun and jun B mRNA expression was also studied in <START:ana> anti-CD2-activated purified T cells <END> . 
No age-related differences were found in the expression of either of these two <START:ggp> proto-oncogenes <END> by anti-CD2 activated T cells . 
These results suggest that the decreased <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production and proliferative response displayed by <START:ana> PHA-activated PBL <END> from elderly adults may be related to age-related changes in <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> expression and in the ratio of c-fos to <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> . 
<START:ggp> Oct2 <END> transactivation from a <START:ggp> remote enhancer position <END> requires a B-cell-restricted activity . 
Previous cotransfection experiments had demonstrated that ectopic expression of the <START:ggp> lymphocyte-specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> could efficiently activate a <START:ggp> promoter <END> containing an octamer motif . 
<START:ggp> Oct2 <END> expression was unable to stimulate a <START:ggp> multimerized octamer enhancer element <END> in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , however . 
We have tested a variety of <START:ggp> Oct2 isoforms <END> generated by alternative splicing for the capability to activate an <START:ggp> octamer enhancer <END> in <START:ana> nonlymphoid cells <END> and a <START:ana> B-cell line <END> . 
Our analyses show that several <START:ggp> Oct2 isoforms <END> can stimulate from a remote position but that this stimulation is restricted to <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
This result indicates the involvement of either a <START:ggp> B-cell-specific cofactor <END> or a specific modification of a <START:ggp> cofactor <END> or the <START:ggp> Oct2 protein <END> in <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> -mediated enhancer activation . 
Mutational analyses indicate that the <START:ggp> carboxy-terminal domain <END> of <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> is critical for enhancer activation . 
Moreover , this domain conferred enhancing activity when fused to the <START:ggp> Oct1 protein <END> , which by itself was unable to stimulate from a remote position . 
The <START:ggp> glutamine-rich activation domain <END> present in the <START:ggp> amino-terminal portion of Oct2 <END> and the <START:ggp> POU domain <END> contribute only marginally to the transactivation function from a distal position . 
The <START:ggp> promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> CD19 gene <END> is a target for the <START:ggp> B-cell-specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> BSAP <END> . 
The <START:ggp> CD19 protein <END> is expressed on the surface of all <START:ana> B-lymphoid cells <END> with the exception of <START:ana> terminally differentiated plasma cells <END> and has been implicated as a signal-transducing receptor in the control of proliferation and differentiation . 
Here we demonstrate complete correlation between the expression pattern of the <START:ggp> CD19 gene <END> and the <START:ggp> B-cell-specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> BSAP <END> in a large panel of <START:ana> B-lymphoid cell lines <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human CD19 gene <END> has been cloned , and several <START:ggp> BSAP-binding sites <END> have been mapped by in vitro protein-DNA binding studies . 
In particular , a <START:ggp> high-affinity BSAP-binding site <END> instead of a <START:ggp> TATA sequence <END> is located in the <START:ggp> -30 promoter region <END> upstream of a cluster of heterogeneous transcription start sites . 
Moreover , this site is occupied by <START:ggp> BSAP <END> in vivo in a <START:ana> CD19-expressing B-cell line <END> but not in <START:ana> plasma <END> or <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
This <START:ggp> high-affinity site <END> has been conserved in the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of both <START:ggp> human and mouse CD19 genes <END> and was furthermore shown to confer B-cell specificity to a beta-globin reporter gene in transient transfection experiments . 
In addition , <START:ggp> BSAP <END> was found to be the only abundant DNA-binding activity of B-cell nuclear extracts that interacts with the <START:ggp> CD19 promoter <END> . 
Together , this evidence strongly implicates <START:ggp> BSAP <END> in the regulation of the <START:ggp> CD19 gene <END> . 
Eicosanoids in breast cancer patients before and after mastectomy . 
In 19 patients with a malignant breast tumor , tumor tissue and blood were taken to determine the eicosanoid profile and <START:ana> platelet <END> aggregation . 
Values were compared with those of patients with benign tumors ( n = 4 ) , or undergoing a mammary reduction ( n = 7 ) . 
Postoperatively , blood was taken as well in order to compare pre- and postoperative values . 
Eicosanoids were measured in <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> and mammary tissue by means of HPLC ; furthermore , TXA2 , 6-keto-PGF1 alpha , and PGE2 were determined by RIA . 
Differences in pre- and postoperative values of cancer patients were seen in plasma RIA values : PGE2 and 6-k-PGF1 alpha were significantly higher preoperatively when compared with postoperatively , however , such differences were seen in the control groups as well . 
Compared to benign tumor or mammary reduction test material the eicosanoid profile of tissue obtained from malignant mammary tumors showed important differences . 
Except for PGF2 alpha , HHT and 15-HETE no detectable quantities of eicosanoids were found in the non-tumor material , whereas in the malignant tumor material substantial quantities of a number of eicosanoid metabolites were present . 
Statistically significant correlations could be established between patient/histopathology data and the results of the <START:ana> platelet <END> aggregation assays , e.g. between menopausal status and ADP aggregation ; <START:ggp> oestrogen receptor <END> ( +/- ) and <START:ggp> collagen <END> and arachidonic acid aggregation , inflammatory cell infiltration score and arachidonic acid aggregation and fibrosis score and ADP aggregation . 
The results show that eicosanoid synthesis in material from mammary cancer patients is different from that in benign mammary tissue . 
The implications , in particular , in relation to future prognosis of the patient , remain obscure . 
Mineralocorticoids and <START:ggp> mineralocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension . 
To examine the role of mineralocorticoids in the pathophysiology of pregnancy-induced hypertension ( PIH ) , we studied plasma aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone levels in 25 women with PIH and 25 normal pregnant women , as controls . 
Furthermore , we evaluated the <START:ggp> mineralocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> MR <END> ) status in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> in the 2 groups . 
<START:ggp> MR <END> count was significantly ( P less than 0.0005 ) decreased in the PIH group ( 148 +/- 9 binding sites/cell ) compared with the control group ( 300 +/- 17 binding sites/cell ; mean +/- SEM ) . 
Plasma aldosterone in women with PIH was 281 +/- 61 pmol/L ; in normal pregnant women it was 697 +/- 172 pmol/L ( P less than 0.025 ) . 
Plasma 18-hydroxycorticosterone was also significantly ( P less than 0.025 ) lower ( PIH , 1071 +/- 149 pmol/L ; controls , 1907 +/- 318 pmol/L ) . 
These values were determined at the onset of clinical symptoms of PIH . 
These results can not be explained by receptor down-regulation due to higher levels of mineralocorticoids in PIH ; a hitherto unknown mineralocorticoid may , thus , be responsible for the hypertension and altered <START:ggp> MR <END> status . 
Structure function analysis of vitamin D analogs with C-ring modifications . 
Analogs of 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 ) with substitutions on C-11 were synthesized . 
Small apolar substitutions ( 11 alpha-methyl , 11 alpha-fluoromethyl ) did not markedly decrease the affinity for the <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> , but larger ( 11 alpha-chloromethyl or 11 alpha- or 11 beta-phenyl ) or more polar substitutions ( 11 alpha-hydroxymethyl , 11 alpha- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ] decreased the affinity to less than 5 % of that of 1 alpha , 25-OH ) 2D3 . 
Their affinity for the <START:ggp> vitamin D-binding protein <END> , however , increased up to 4-fold . 
The biological activity of 11 alpha-methyl-1 alpha , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 closely resembled that of the natural hormone on normal and <START:ana> leukemic cell <END> proliferation and bone resorption , whereas its in vivo effect on calcium metabolism of the rachitic chick was about 50 % of that of 1 alpha , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 . 
The 11 beta-methyl analog had a greater than 10-fold lower activity . 
The differentiating effects of the other C-11 analogs on <START:ana> human promyeloid leukemia cells <END> ( <START:ana> HL-60 <END> ) agreed well with their bone-resorbing activity and receptor affinity , but they demonstrated lower calcemic effects in vivo . 
Large or polar substitutions on C-11 of 1 alpha , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 thus impair the binding of the <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> but increase the affinity to <START:ggp> vitamin D-binding protein <END> . 
The effects of many C-11-substituted 1 alpha , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 analogs on <START:ana> HL-60 <END> cell differentiation exceeded their activity on calcium metabolism . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptor <END> binding in three different cell types in major depressive disorder : lack of evidence of receptor binding defect . 
1 . 
In order to further understand the apparent glucocorticoid resistance in major depressive disorder , circadian variation in cortisol concentration , dexamethasone suppression and glucocorticoid receptor binding in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> , <START:ana> polymorphonuclear leukocytes <END> and <START:ana> cultured skin fibroblasts <END> were measured in rigidly defined major depressive disorder patients and non-depressed psychiatric controls . 
2 . 
<START:ana> Mononuclear leukocytes <END> binding to glucocorticoid correlated significantly with <START:ana> polymorphonuclear leukocytes <END> binding to glucocorticoid , but both determinations failed to differentiate major depressive disorder and control subjects . 
3 . 
Initial and post-dexamethasone in vitro fibroblast binding to glucocorticoid was not different between major depressive disorder and non-depressed control subjects . 
4 . 
The phenomenon of glucocorticoid resistance in major depressive disorder remains unexplained . 
High affinity aldosterone binding to plasma membrane rich fractions from <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> : is there a <START:ggp> membrane receptor <END> for mineralocorticoids ? 
In vitro effects of aldosterone on the intracellular concentrations of sodium , potassium and calcium , cell volume and the <START:ggp> sodium-proton-antiport <END> have been described in intact <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> ( <START:ana> HML <END> ) . 
In the present paper , the binding of a [ 125I ] -labeled aldosterone derivative to plasma membrane rich fractions of <START:ana> HML <END> was studied . 
High affinity binding of the radioligand with an apparent Kd of approximately 0.1 nM was found . 
Aldosterone displaced the tracer at a similar Kd . 
Both canrenone and cortisol were inactive as ligands up to concentrations of 0.1 microM . 
The findings are the first to demonstrate membrane binding sites with a high affinity for aldosterone , but not for cortisol . 
These data are perfectly compatible with major properties of steroidal effects on the <START:ggp> sodium-proton-antiport <END> in <START:ana> HML <END> and thus very likely represent <START:ggp> membrane receptors <END> for aldosterone . 
Natural variants of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> : analysis of <START:ggp> promoters <END> with duplicated <START:ggp> DNA regulatory motifs <END> . 
Sequence variation in the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat ( LTR ) region <END> of HIV-1 was analyzed in viral isolates of 17 infected individuals . 
Two classes of LTR size variants were found . 
One HIV-1 variant was detected containing an additional binding site for the transcription factor Sp1 . 
Another <START:ggp> LTR size variation <END> was observed in four patients in a region just upstream of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B enhancer <END> . 
This variation was the result of a duplication of a <START:ggp> short DNA sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> CTG-motif <END> ) . 
Cell culture experiments demonstrated that the natural variant with four <START:ggp> Sp1 sites <END> had a slightly higher promoter activity and viral replication rate than the <START:ggp> isogenic control LTR <END> with three <START:ggp> Sp1 sites <END> . 
No positive effect of the duplicated <START:ggp> CTG-motif <END> could be detected . 
In order to measure small differences in virus production more accurately , equal amounts of a size variant and the <START:ggp> wild-type plasmid <END> were cotransfected into <START:ana> T-cells <END> . 
The virus with four Sp1 sites did outgrow the three Sp1 virus in 35 days of culture and CTG-monomer virus outcompeted the CTG-dimer virus in 42 days . 
Based on these results we estimate a 5-10 % difference in virus production of the <START:ggp> LTR variants <END> when compared to that of wild-type . 
A <START:ggp> novel B cell-derived coactivator <END> potentiates the activation of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin promoters <END> by <START:ggp> octamer-binding transcription factors <END> . 
A novel B cell-restricted activity , required for high levels of <START:ggp> octamer <END> / <START:ggp> Oct <END> -dependent transcription from an <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) promoter <END> , was detected in an in vitro system consisting of <START:ana> HeLa cell <END> -derived extracts complemented with <START:ggp> fractionated B cell nuclear proteins <END> . 
The factor responsible for this activity was designated <START:ggp> Oct coactivator <END> from <START:ana> B cells <END> ( <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> OCA-B <END> stimulates the transcription from an <START:ggp> IgH promoter <END> in conjunction with either <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> or <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> but shows no significant effect on the <START:ggp> octamer <END> / <START:ggp> Oct <END> -dependent transcription of the <START:ggp> ubiquitously expressed histone H2B promoter <END> and the transcription of <START:ggp> USF- and Sp1-regulated promoters <END> . 
Taken together , our results suggest that <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> is a <START:ggp> tissue- , promoter- , and factor-specific coactivator <END> and that <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> may be a major determinant for B cell-specific activation of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin promoters <END> . 
In light of the evidence showing physical and functional interactions between <START:ggp> Oct factors <END> and <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> , we propose a mechanism of action for <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> and discuss the implications of <START:ggp> OCA-B <END> for the transcriptional regulation of other <START:ggp> tissue-specific promoters <END> . 
<START:ggp> SCL <END> and related <START:ggp> hemopoietic helix-loop-helix transcription factors <END> . 
The <START:ggp> helix-loop-helix ( HLH ) proteins <END> are a family of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that include proteins critical to differentiation and development in species ranging from plants to mammals . 
Five members of this family ( <START:ggp> MYC <END> , <START:ggp> SCL <END> , <START:ggp> TAL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> LYL-1 <END> and <START:ggp> E2A <END> ) are implicated in oncogenic events in human lymphoid tumors because of their consistent involvement in chromosomal translocations . 
Although activated in T cell leukemias , expression of <START:ggp> SCL <END> and <START:ggp> LYL-1 <END> is low or undetectable in <START:ana> normal T cell populations <END> . 
<START:ggp> SCL <END> is expressed in <START:ana> erythroid , megakaryocyte and mast cell populations <END> ( the same cell lineages as <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , a <START:ggp> zinc-finger transcription factor <END> ) . 
In addition , both <START:ggp> SCL <END> and <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> undergo coordinate modulation during chemically induced erythroid differentiation of <START:ana> mouse erythroleukemia cells <END> and are down-modulated during myeloid differentiation of <START:ana> human K562 cells <END> , thus implying a role for <START:ggp> SCL <END> in erythroid differentiation events . 
However , in contrast to <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> , <START:ggp> SCL <END> is expressed in the developing brain . 
Studies of the function of <START:ggp> SCL <END> suggest it is also important in proliferation and self-renewal events in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> . 
Induction of the <START:ggp> POU domain transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> during <START:ana> T-cell <END> activation by cognate antigen . 
<START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> is a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> that binds specifically to <START:ggp> octamer DNA motifs <END> in the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin and interleukin-2 genes <END> . 
All <START:ana> tumor cell lines <END> from the <START:ana> B-cell lineage <END> and a few from the <START:ana> T-cell lineage <END> express <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> . 
To address the role of <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> in the <START:ana> T-cell lineage <END> , we studied the expression of <START:ana> Oct-2 mRNA <END> and protein in <START:ana> nontransformed human and mouse T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> was found in <START:ana> CD4+ and CD8+ T cells <END> prepared from human peripheral blood and in <START:ana> mouse lymph node T cells <END> . 
In a <START:ana> T-cell clone <END> specific for <START:ggp> pigeon cytochrome c <END> in the context of <START:ggp> I-Ek <END> , <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> was induced by antigen stimulation , with the increase in <START:ggp> Oct-2 protein <END> seen first at 3 h after activation and continuing for at least 24 h . 
<START:ana> Oct-2 mRNA <END> induction during antigen-driven <START:ana> T-cell <END> activation was blocked by cyclosporin A , as well as by protein synthesis inhibitors . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> participates in transcriptional regulation during <START:ana> T-cell <END> activation. The relatively delayed kinetics of <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> induction suggests that <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> mediates the changes in gene expression which occur many hours or days following antigen stimulation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptor <END> in patients with lupus nephritis : relationship between receptor levels in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> and effect of glucocorticoid therapy . 
We investigated the clinical significance of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> determination in 20 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) who afterwards developed nephrotic syndrome . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptor <END> concentrations in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> ( <START:ana> MNL <END> ) in these patients were comparable with those in both other patients with SLE and healthy persons . 
Improvement in urinary protein excretion and in disease activity , which was scored according to the SLE Disease Activity Index system of the University of Toronto , closely related to the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> concentrations in <START:ana> MNL <END> isolated from the corresponding patients . 
In summary , <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> determination in patients with lupus nephritis may be a predictive clue for assessing responsiveness to glucocorticoid therapy . 
[ Changes in <START:ggp> plasma interleukin-1 <END> and their possible relationship with the changes in <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> in aged long-distance runner ] 
For the study of the changes in <START:ggp> plasma interleukin-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> ) and their possible relationship with the changes in <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) , <START:ggp> plasma IL-1 <END> and <START:ggp> GR <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocytes <END> in aged long-distance runner were measured simultaneously . 
The activity of <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> was expressed as its ability to stimulate <START:ggp> 3H-TdR <END> incorporation in the <START:ana> thymocytes <END> of C57 mice . 
<START:ggp> GR <END> was determined by whole cell assay with 3H-Dex . 
The results showed that the activity of plasma <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> in aged long-distance runner was 209 % , 223 % and 145 % of the control at 14.7-18.7 , 3.8-7.0 and 1.5-2.6 KD fractions . 
The <START:ggp> GR <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocytes <END> in aged runner was 65 % of the control . 
Possible relationship between the changes in <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> and <START:ggp> GR <END> in aged long-distance runner and its physiological significance are discussed . 
Mineralocorticoid effector mechanism in preeclampsia . 
Mineralocorticoid effector mechanisms were evaluated in 29 patients with preeclampsia and in 25 uncomplicated pregnancies by measurement of plasma aldosterone , levels of <START:ggp> mineralocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> MR <END> ) in <START:ana> mononuclear leucocytes <END> , and subtraction potential difference ( SPD ; rectal minus oral values ) . 
Mean values for plasma aldosterone were not different between the two groups , but significant differences were observed for <START:ggp> MR <END> ( preeclampsia , 81 +/- 44 receptors/cell ; controls , 306 +/- 168 ) and SPD ( preeclampsia , 65 +/- 7 mV ; controls , 12 +/- 5 mV ) . 
In six cases we determined <START:ggp> MR <END> , plasma aldosterone , and SPD in patients with preeclampsia before and 3 months after delivery . 
<START:ggp> MR <END> were reduced before delivery ( 96 +/- 27 receptors/cell ) , and SPD increased ( 64 +/- 8 mV ) , with both parameters normalizing after delivery ( <START:ggp> MR <END> , 242 +/- 79 ; SPD , 14.0 +/- 4 mV ) . 
Aldosterone levels returned to normal nonpregnant values after delivery . 
These data suggest an important role for abnormalities in mineralocorticoid effector mechanisms in the etiology of preeclampsia and could be an useful marker for diagnosis . 
Kinetics of nuclear translocation and turnover of the <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> in <START:ana> human HL60 leukemia cells <END> and <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> -- coincident rise of DNA-relaxing activity in nuclear extracts . 
<START:ggp> High affinity receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) for 1 , 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol ( calcitriol ) are expressed in HL60 human leukemia cells and in low numbers in <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBL <END> ) . 
<START:ana> HL60 cells <END> , expressing some characteristics of <START:ana> promyelocytes <END> , can be induced to monocytoid differentiation by calcitriol . 
Specific nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> [ 3H ] calcitriol/VDR <END> was examined after exposure of <START:ana> whole cells <END> to 10 ( -9 ) M/l calcitriol in the presence and absence of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled ligand and subsequent isolation of nuclei . 
Specific nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> [ 3H ] calcitriol/VDR <END> was found to be time dependent reaching a maximum of approximately 2100 binding sites/nucleus after 3 h of incubation in <START:ana> HL60 cells <END> , whereas a maximum of approximately 310 binding sites/nucleus was found after 3 h in <START:ana> PBL <END> . 
Pulse exposure of <START:ana> HL60 <END> to radiolabeled hormone for 3 h followed by culture in medium without serum and calcitriol lead to nuclear retention of approximately <START:ggp> 1600 radiolabeled VDR <END> by 8 h and approximately 1000 <START:ggp> VDR <END> by 24 h . 
<START:ggp> Radiolabeled VDR <END> disappeared from the nuclear compartment with a halflife of approximately 30 min if cells were cultured with identical concentrations of unlabeled hormone after the pulse ( pulse/chase-experiments ) . 
No difference of <START:ggp> VDR <END> retention in pulse and pulse/chase-experiments was seen in <START:ana> PBL <END> , where <START:ggp> VDR <END> halflife was approximately 30 min . 
No specific translocation into the nuclear compartment was seen when isolated nuclei were incubated in [ 3H ] calcitriol . 
<START:ggp> Radiolabeled hormone/receptor complexes <END> of nuclei isolated from cells exposed for 3 h to radiolabeled hormone -- in contrast to identical experiments with intact cells -- did not disappear from the nuclear compartment upon incubation of nuclei with identical concentrations of the unlabeled compound . 
The activity of <START:ggp> DNA relaxing enzymes <END> ( e.g . <START:ggp> topoisomerases I and II <END> ) in nuclear extracts was measured using a PBR 322-relaxation-assay . 
Enhanced overall enzyme activity was found in nuclear extracts by 1 h after incubation with calcitriol ( final ethanol concentration 0.0001 % v/v ) in <START:ana> HL60 <END> and <START:ana> PBL <END> . 
The enhanced activity disappeared after 2 h in <START:ana> PBL <END> , whereas it was still enhanced by 4 h in <START:ana> HL60 <END> . 
No effect was seen in <START:ana> ethanol treated controls <END> . 
We conclude that a specific nuclear translocation mechanism exists for calcitriol in both cell types examined , most likely due to translocation of <START:ggp> receptor proteins <END> after hormone binding . 
<START:ggp> Translocated hormone/receptor complexes <END> compete for a limited number of specific nuclear binding sites . 
Enhanced activity of <START:ggp> topoisomerases <END> in nuclear extracts upon translocation of <START:ggp> VDR <END> might reflect interaction of both within the nuclear compartment , thus initiating DNA-unwinding , a prerequisite of transcription initiation . 
Influence of estradiol and tamoxifen on susceptibility of <START:ana> human breast cancer cell lines <END> to lysis by <START:ana> lymphokine-activated killer cells <END> . 
The design of combination hormonal and immunotherapeutic protocols for breast cancer patients may be facilitated by analysis of preclinical in vitro model systems . 
<START:ana> Estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ : MCF-7 ) and negative ( ER- : MDA-MB-231 ) human breast cancer cell lines <END> were utilized to evaluate the effects of tamoxifen ( TAM ) and estradiol ( E2 ) on modulation of breast cancer target susceptibility to lysis by <START:ana> lymphokine-activated killer ( LAK ) cells <END> . 
<START:ana> E2-stimulated ER+ cells <END> were more susceptible to lysis by <START:ana> LAK cells <END> than corresponding <START:ana> TAM-treated <END> or <START:ana> control cells <END> , while treatment of <START:ana> ER- cells <END> with either E2 or TAM alone did not alter from control their susceptibility to this immune-mediated lysis . 
All <START:ana> ER+ and ER- cells <END> tested remained sensitive after treatment with TAM to lysis by <START:ana> LAK cells <END> . 
In addition , an <START:ggp> adenocarcinoma reactive human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody <END> ( <START:ggp> ING-1 <END> ) was able to significantly boost in vivo generated LAK cell-mediated lysis of <START:ana> control , E2-treated , and TAM-treated ER+ and ER- cells <END> . 
These in vitro results provide a preclinical rationale for in vivo testing of TAM , <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) , and breast cancer reactive antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity facilitating antibody in patients with refractory or high risk breast cancer . 
The <START:ggp> cellular oncogene <END> <START:ggp> c-myb <END> can interact synergistically with the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus BZLF1 transactivator <END> in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
Regulation of replicative functions in the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) genome <END> is mediated through activation of a <START:ggp> virally encoded transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> Z <END> ( <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> ) . 
We have shown that the <START:ggp> Z gene product <END> , which binds to <START:ggp> AP-1 sites <END> as a homodimer and has sequence similarity to <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , can efficiently activate the <START:ggp> EBV early promoter <END> , <START:ggp> BMRF1 <END> , in certain cell types ( i.e. , <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> ) but not others ( i.e. , <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> ) . 
Here we demonstrate that the <START:ggp> c-myb proto-oncogene product <END> , which is itself a <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> and <START:ggp> transcriptional transactivator <END> , can interact synergistically with <START:ggp> Z <END> in activating the <START:ggp> BMRF1 promoter <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> ( a <START:ana> T-cell line <END> ) or <START:ana> Raji cells <END> ( an <START:ana> EBV-positive B-cell <END> ) , whereas the <START:ggp> c-myb gene product <END> by itself has little effect . 
The <START:ggp> simian virus 40 early promoter <END> is also synergistically activated by the <START:ggp> Z/c-myb combination <END> . 
Synergistic transactivation of the <START:ggp> BMRF1 promoter <END> by the <START:ggp> Z/c-myb combination <END> appears to involve direct binding by the <START:ggp> Z protein <END> but not the <START:ggp> c-myb protein <END> . 
A <START:ggp> 30-bp sequence <END> in the <START:ggp> BMRF1 promoter <END> which contains a <START:ggp> Z binding site <END> ( a <START:ggp> consensus AP-1 site <END> ) is sufficient to transfer high-level lymphoid-specific responsiveness to the <START:ggp> Z/c-myb combination <END> to a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> . 
That the <START:ggp> c-myb oncogene product <END> can interact synergistically with an <START:ggp> EBV-encoded member <END> of the <START:ggp> leucine zipper protein family <END> suggests <START:ggp> c-myb <END> is likely to engage in similar interactions with <START:ggp> cellularly encoded transcription factors <END> . 
Alpha-lipoic acid is a potent inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) results from infection with a human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 
The <START:ggp> long terminal repeat ( LTR ) region <END> of <START:ggp> HIV proviral DNA <END> contains binding sites for <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) , and this <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> appears to regulate HIV activation . 
Recent findings suggest an involvement of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in signal transduction pathways leading to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
The present study was based on reports that antioxidants which eliminate ROS should block the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and subsequently HIV transcription , and thus antioxidants can be used as therapeutic agents for AIDS . 
Incubation of <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> ( 1 x 10 ( 6 ) cells/ml ) with a natural thiol antioxidant , alpha-lipoic acid , prior to the stimulation of cells was found to inhibit <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation induced by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( 25 ng/ml ) or by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( 50 ng/ml ) . 
The inhibitory action of alpha-lipoic acid was found to be very potent as only 4 mM was needed for a complete inhibition , whereas 20 mM was required for N-acetylcysteine . 
These results indicate that alpha-lipoic acid may be effective in AIDS therapeutics . 
<START:ggp> Reticuloendotheliosis virus long terminal repeat elements <END> are efficient <START:ggp> promoters <END> in cells of various species and tissue origin , including <START:ana> human lymphoid cells <END> . 
Promiscuous transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> reticuloendotheliosis virus ( REV ) long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) was detected in transient expression assays using <START:ggp> LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-encoding gene chimeras <END> , and cells of diverse species and tissue type ; levels of expression from two different <START:ggp> REV LTRs <END> correlate with reports of pathogenicity of the respective viruses in vivo . 
REVs do not encode a transactivator targeted to the <START:ggp> viral LTR <END> , and cells infected with Marek 's disease virus , a herpesvirus with an overlapping host range , do not express factors that preferentially enhance expression from REV or <START:ggp> avian sarcoma/leukemia virus LTRs <END> . 
<START:ggp> REV LTRs <END> work efficiently in <START:ana> human lymphoid cells <END> , and are viable alternatives to <START:ggp> promoters <END> commonly used for expression of <START:ggp> cloned genes <END> . 
They may also prove useful in the identification of new , <START:ggp> ubiquitous cellular transcription factors <END> . 
A novel <START:ggp> Ets-related transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> , binds to <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 2 regulatory elements <END> that are required for inducible trans activation in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) and HIV-2 are structurally related retroviruses which both cause AIDS in humans . 
Although both viruses establish latency in quiescent <START:ana> human-peripheral-blood T cells <END> , the asymptomatic phase of HIV-2 infection may be more prolonged than that of HIV-1 . 
The latent phases of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection have been shown to be disrupted by T-cell activation , a process that requires host cell transcription factors . 
In the case of HIV-1 , the transcription factor <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is sufficient for inducible transcriptional activation . 
In contrast , factors in addition to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> are required to activate HIV-2 transcription in <START:ana> infected T cells <END> . 
In this report , we demonstrate that a novel <START:ggp> Ets-related transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> , binds specifically to <START:ggp> two purine-rich motifs <END> in the <START:ggp> HIV-2 enhancer <END> . 
Mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that these <START:ggp> Elf-1 binding sites <END> are required for induction of HIV-2 transcription following T-cell-receptor-mediated T-cell activation . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> is the only factor present in activated T-cell nuclear extracts that binds to these sites in electrophoretic mobility shift assays . 
Thus , <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> is a <START:ggp> novel transcription factor <END> that appears to be required for the T-cell-receptor-mediated trans activation of HIV-2 gene expression . 
These results may explain differences in the clinical spectra of diseases caused by HIV-1 and HIV-2 and may also have implications for the design of therapeutic approaches to HIV-2 infection . 
Okadaic acid is a potent inducer of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , and <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> in <START:ana> human B lymphocytes <END> . 
Treatment of <START:ana> human B lymphocytes <END> with an optimal concentration of okadaic acid , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> phosphatases 1 and 2A <END> , resulted in the induction of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and a marked increase in <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> levels . 
In contrast , no effect on the levels of the <START:ggp> octamer binding proteins <END> , <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> or <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> , were found . 
Since both <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> have been reported to be important in the induction of the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) gene <END> we examined the effects of okadaic acid on <START:ana> TNF-alpha mRNA <END> levels . 
Treatment with okadaic acid resulted in a striking increase in <START:ana> TNF-alpha mRNA <END> transcripts within 1 h of stimulation and large amounts of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> were released into the culture media . 
Although okadaic acid provides a potent inductive signal for <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> it did not induce either B cell proliferation or <START:ggp> immunoglobulin <END> secretion . 
Heterodimerization and transcriptional activation in vitro by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B proteins <END> . 
The <START:ggp> NF-kappa B family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription proteins <END> represents multiple DNA binding , <START:ggp> rel related polypeptides <END> that contribute to regulation of genes involved in immune responsiveness and inflammation , as well as activation of the <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> . 
In this study multiple <START:ggp> NF-kappa B related polypeptides <END> ranging from 85 to 45 kDa were examined for their capacity to interact with the <START:ggp> PRDII regulatory element <END> of <START:ggp> interferon beta <END> and were shown to possess distinct intrinsic DNA binding affinities for this <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> and form <START:ggp> multiple DNA binding homo- and heterodimer complexes <END> in co-renaturation experiments . 
Furthermore , using <START:ggp> DNA templates <END> containing two copies of the <START:ggp> PRDII domain <END> linked to the <START:ggp> rabbit beta globin gene <END> , the purified polypeptides specifically stimulated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> dependent transcription in an in vitro reconstitution assay as heterodimers but not as <START:ggp> p50 homodimers <END> . 
These experiments emphasize the role of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> dimerization as a distinct level of transcriptional control that may permit functional diversification of a limited number of <START:ggp> regulatory proteins <END> . 
<START:ana> c-myc mRNA <END> expression in minor salivary glands of patients with Sjogren 's syndrome . 
<START:ggp> c-myc protooncogene <END> is implicated in the pathogenesis of B cell lymphoid malignancies and high levels of <START:ana> c-myc mRNA <END> expression are observed in <START:ana> activated blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
Sjogren 's syndrome ( SS ) is characterized by <START:ana> lymphocytic infiltrates <END> of exocrine glands , remarkable B cell hyperreactivity and a strong predisposition to B cell neoplasia . 
In this study , <START:ana> c-myc protooncogene mRNA <END> expression in 29 labial minor salivary gland biopsies from patients with primary SS and 15 controls was examined using in situ hybridization histochemistry . 
Two 40mer oligonucleotides from the <START:ggp> 1st and the 2nd exon <END> of the <START:ggp> c-myc gene <END> , labeled with 35S , were used as probes . 
To detect the origin of the cell hybridized with a <START:ggp> c-myc probe <END> , a combined immunochemistry in situ hybridization histochemistry technique was used . 
High <START:ana> c-myc mRNA <END> expression was detected on <START:ana> acinar epithelial cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> c-myc <END> did not correlate with <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> protein expression . 
Stronger <START:ana> c-myc mRNA <END> expression was detected in labial salivary glands of patients with longer disease duration ( p less than or equal to 0.002 ) and more intense <START:ana> T lymphocyte infiltrates <END> ( p less than 0.05 ) although these patients revealed no hypergammaglobulinemia . 
No correlation was observed between <START:ana> c-myc mRNA <END> and B lymphocyte monoclonicity or lymphoma . 
In conclusion , strong <START:ana> c-myc mRNA <END> expression was observed on <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> of labial salivary glands from patients with primary SS . 
Our findings may indicate the presence of a reactivated virus hosted in these cells . 
<START:ggp> Corticosteroid receptors <END> and <START:ana> lymphocyte subsets <END> in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> in aging . 
Plasma cortisol and aldosterone levels and number of related receptors in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> were measured in 49 healthy aged subjects ( 62-97 yr ) and in 21 adult controls ( 21-50 yr ) . 
In all subjects , in addition , <START:ana> lymphocyte subsets <END> were determined as an index of corticosteroid action . 
The mean number of <START:ggp> type I and type II receptors <END> was significantly lower in aged subjects than in controls ( respectively , 198 +/- 96 and 272 +/- 97 <START:ggp> receptors <END> /cell for <START:ggp> type I <END> , and 1 , 794 +/- 803 and 3 , 339 +/- 918 for type <START:ggp> II receptors <END> ) . 
Plasma aldosterone and cortisol and <START:ana> lymphocyte subsets <END> were not different in the two groups . 
All of the parameters were also tested for correlation , and a significant inverse correlation was found between age and <START:ggp> type I <END> and <START:ggp> type II receptors <END> when all subjects were plotted and between aged and <START:ana> CD4 <END> and age and <START:ana> CD4/CD8 <END> in the aged group . 
These data show that aged subjects have reductions of <START:ggp> corticosteroid receptors <END> that are not associated with increase of related steroids and that this situation probably represents a concomitant of the normal aging process . 
T cell-specific negative regulation of transcription of the <START:ggp> human cytokine IL-4 <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-4 <END> secreted by <START:ana> activated T cells <END> is a <START:ggp> pleiotropic cytokine <END> affecting growth and differentiation of diverse cell types such as <START:ana> T cells <END> , <START:ana> B cells <END> , and <START:ana> mast cells <END> . 
We investigated the <START:ggp> upstream regulatory elements <END> of the <START:ggp> human IL-4 promoter <END> . 
A <START:ggp> novel T cell-specific negative regulatory element <END> ( <START:ggp> NRE <END> ) composed of two protein-binding sites were mapped in the 5 ' flanking region of the <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> : -311CTCCCTTCT-303 ( <START:ggp> NRE-I <END> ) and -288CTTTTTGCTT-TGC-300 ( <START:ggp> NRE-II <END> ) . 
A <START:ggp> T cell-specific protein <END> <START:ggp> Neg-1 <END> and a <START:ggp> ubiquitous protein <END> <START:ggp> Neg-2 <END> binding to <START:ggp> NRE-I <END> and <START:ggp> NRE-II <END> , respectively , were identified . 
Furthermore , a <START:ggp> positive regulatory element <END> was found <START:ggp> 45 bp downstream <END> of the <START:ggp> NRE <END> . 
The enhancer activity of the <START:ggp> PRE <END> was completely suppressed when the <START:ggp> NRE <END> was present . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> IL-4 promoter <END> activity is normally down-regulated by an <START:ggp> NRE <END> via repression of the <START:ggp> enhancer positive regulatory element <END> . 
These data may have implications for the stringent control of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> expression in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Interleukin 6-induced differentiation of a <START:ana> human B cell line <END> into <START:ana> IgM-secreting plasma cells <END> is mediated by <START:ggp> c-fos <END> . 
The role of the <START:ggp> protooncogene c-fos <END> in <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) 6 <END> -induced B cell differentiation was assessed . 
Treatment of SKW 6.4 cells with <START:ggp> IL 6 <END> induced a transient and early stimulation of <START:ana> c-fos sense mRNA <END> expression . 
The effect appeared within 30 min and returned to basal levels after 2 h . 
The addition of antisense oligonucleotides to <START:ggp> c-fos <END> significantly inhibited <START:ggp> IL 6 <END> -induced <START:ggp> IgM <END> production by <START:ana> SKW 6.4 cells <END> ( p less than 0.001 ) , whereas control oligonucleotides had no inhibitory effect . 
These results indicate that activation of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> is involved in <START:ggp> IL 6 <END> -induced differentiation of <START:ana> SKW 6.4 cells <END> into <START:ana> IgM-secreting cells <END> . 
Transcriptional regulation during <START:ana> T-cell <END> development : the <START:ggp> alpha TCR gene <END> as a molecular model . 
The regulation of gene expression during <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> differentiation is a complex process involving interactions between <START:ggp> multiple positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements <END> . 
In this article , transcriptional regulation of the <START:ggp> archetypal T-cell-specific gene <END> , <START:ggp> alpha TCR <END> , is discussed . 
Major recent developments , including the identification of novel families of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that regulate multiple <START:ggp> T-cell genes <END> during thymocyte ontogeny and <START:ana> T-cell <END> activation , are described . 
Photoaffinity labeling of <START:ggp> plasma membrane receptors <END> for aldosterone from <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> . 
Non-genomic effects of aldosterone on the <START:ggp> sodium-proton-antiport <END> have been shown in <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> which could be related to a new <START:ggp> aldosterone membrane receptor <END> . 
In the present paper plasma membranes from <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> were covalently photolabeled with a [ 125I ] -aldosterone derivative . 
Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed significant aldosterone binding at a molecular weight of approximately 50000 Dalton which was absent with 1 microM cold aldosterone , but not cortisol in the binding media . 
The presence of the sulfhydryl agent dithiothreitol did not affect results suggesting the absence of <START:ggp> disulfide bridges <END> in the <START:ggp> steroid binding domain <END> of the receptor . 
These data are the first to define the molecular weight of the <START:ggp> membrane receptor <END> for aldosterone . 
Redox status of cells influences constitutive or induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation and <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> activity in <START:ana> human T and monocytic cell lines <END> . 
We have tested the hypothesis that cellular activation events occurring in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> monocytes <END> and mediated through translocation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor NF-kappa B <END> are dependent upon the constitutive redox status of these cells . 
We used phenolic , lipid-soluble , chain-breaking antioxidants ( butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) , nordihydroquairetic acid , or alpha-tocopherol ( vitamin E ) to show that peroxyl radical scavenging in <START:ana> unstimulated and PMA- or TNF-stimulated cells <END> blocks the functions depending on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
BHA was found to suppress not only PMA- or TNF-induced , but also constitutive , HIV-enhancer activity concomitant to an inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity in both <START:ana> lymphoblastoid T <END> ( <START:ana> J.Jhan <END> ) and <START:ana> monocytic ( U937 ) cell lines <END> . 
This was also true for KBF ( p50 homodimer ) binding activity in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
Secretion of <START:ggp> TNF <END> , the product of another <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-dependent gene <END> , was abolished by BHA in <START:ana> PMA-stimulated U937 cells <END> . 
The anti-oxidative effect of BHA was accompanied by an increase in thiol , but not glutathione , content in <START:ana> stimulated and unstimulated T cell <END> , whereas <START:ggp> TNF <END> stimulation itself barely modified the cellular thiol level . 
Oxidative stress obtained by the addition of H2O2 to the culture medium of <START:ana> J.Jhan <END> or <START:ana> U937 cells <END> could not by itself induce <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
These observations suggest that <START:ggp> TNF <END> and <START:ggp> PMA <END> do not lead to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation through induction of changes in the cell redox status . 
Rather , <START:ggp> TNF <END> and <START:ggp> PMA <END> can exert their effect only if cells are in an appropriate redox status , because prior modification toward reduction with BHA treatment prevents this activation . 
It appears that a basal redox equilibrium tending toward oxidation is a prerequisite for full activation of transduction pathways regulating the activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-dependent genes <END> . 
Selection of optimal kappa B/Rel DNA-binding motifs : interaction of both subunits of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> with DNA is required for transcriptional activation . 
Analysis of the <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 subunits <END> of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B transcription factor complex <END> has revealed that both proteins can interact with related DNA sequences through either homo- or heterodimer formation . 
In addition , the product of the <START:ggp> proto-oncogene c-rel <END> can bind to similar DNA motifs by itself or as a heterodimer with <START:ggp> p50 <END> or <START:ggp> p65 <END> . 
However , these studies have used a limited number of known kappa B DNA motifs , and the question of the optimal DNA sequences preferred by each homodimer has not been addressed . 
Using purified recombinant <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p65 <END> , and <START:ggp> c-Rel proteins <END> , optimal DNA-binding motifs were selected from a pool of random oligonucleotides . 
Alignment of the selected sequences allowed us to predict a consensus sequence for binding of the individual <START:ggp> homodimeric Rel-related proteins <END> , and DNA-protein binding analysis of the selected DNA sequences revealed sequence specificity of the proteins . 
Contrary to previous assumptions , we observed that <START:ggp> p65 <END> homodimers can interact with a subset of DNA sequences not recognized by <START:ggp> p50 homodimers <END> . 
Differential binding affinities were also obtained with <START:ggp> p50- and c-Rel-selected sequences <END> . 
Using either a p50- or p65- selected kappa B motif , which displayed differential binding with respect to the other protein , little to no binding was observed with the <START:ggp> heterodimeric NF-kappa B complex <END> . 
Similarly , in transfection experiments in which the <START:ggp> selective kappa B binding sites <END> were used to drive the expression of a <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct <END> , the <START:ggp> p65 -and p50-selected motifs <END> were activated only in the presence of <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> p50/65 <END> ( a <START:ggp> chimeric protein <END> with the <START:ggp> p50 DNA binding domain <END> and <START:ggp> p65 activation domain <END> ) expression vectors , respectively , and neither demonstrated a significant response to stimuli that induce <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity . 
These findings demonstrate that interaction of both subunits of the <START:ggp> heterodimeric NF-kappa B complex <END> with DNA is required for DNA binding and transcriptional activation and suggest that transcriptional activation mediated by the individual <START:ggp> rel-related proteins <END> will differ dramatically , depending on the specific kappa B motifs present . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -dependent induction of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> p50 subunit gene promoter <END> underlies self-perpetuation of human immunodeficiency virus transcription in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> . 
The molecular mechanisms underlying the sustained nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> observed in <START:ana> U937 monocytic cells <END> chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) were studied . 
The activity of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> regulating the synthesis of the <START:ggp> p105 precursor <END> of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p50 subunit <END> was enhanced in these cells . 
Deletions in this <START:ggp> promoter <END> indicated that this upregulation was mediated through the NF-kappa B- but not the <START:ggp> AP-1-binding motif <END> , by bona fide <START:ggp> p50/p65 heterodimers <END> . 
Analysis of cytosolic extracts indicated that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> levels were increased in <START:ana> HIV-infected cells <END> . 
In contrast to the transient <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation induced by phorbol ester , the permanent <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation induced by HIV infection was not dependent on <START:ggp> PKC isoenzymes alpha and beta <END> as shown by the use of a specific inhibitor ( GF 109203X ) . 
These observations indicate that during chronic HIV infection of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> , continuous <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> ) translocation results in p105 promoter upregulation with subsequent cytosolic <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> accumulation , ready for further translocation . 
This HIV-mediated mechanism results in a self-perpetuating loop of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> production . 
Activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> in <START:ana> human blood monocytes <END> . 
We report here that <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) acts on <START:ana> human blood monocytes <END> by enhancing binding activity of the <START:ggp> transcription factor NF-kappa B <END> to its consensus sequence in the 5 ' regulatory enhancer region of the <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor alpha chain <END> ( <START:ggp> p55 <END> ) . 
Similarly , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> activates <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in the <START:ana> human monocytic cell line U 937 <END> , but not in <START:ana> resting human T-cells <END> . 
This effect is detectable within 15 min and peaks 1 h after exposure to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> . 
Enhanced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity is followed by functional activation in that inducibility of the <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor alpha chain <END> is mediated by enhanced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding and that a heterologous promoter containing the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B consensus sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> -291 to -245 <END> ) of the <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor alpha chain gene <END> is activated . 
In addition , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> is capable of increasing transcript levels of the <START:ggp> p50 <END> gene coding for the <START:ggp> p50 subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> transcription factor , whereas mRNA levels of the <START:ggp> p65 <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B gene <END> remained unchanged . 
Studies on the biological activity of triiodothyronine sulfate . 
<START:ana> Hepatic microsomes <END> and <START:ana> isolated hepatocytes <END> in short term culture desulfate T3 sulfate ( T3SO4 ) . 
We , therefore , wished to determine whether T3SO4 could mimic the action of thyroid hormone in vitro . 
T3SO4 had no thyromimetic effect on the activity of <START:ggp> Ca ( 2+ ) -ATPase <END> in human erythrocyte membranes at doses up to 10 , 000 times the maximally effective dose of T3 ( 10 ( -10 ) mol/L ) . 
In <START:ana> GH4C1 pituitary cells <END> , T3SO4 failed to displace [ 125I ] T3 from <START:ggp> nuclear receptors <END> in <START:ana> intact cells <END> or soluble preparations . 
Thus , T3SO4 was not directly thyromimetic in either an isolated human membrane system or a pituitary cell system in which nuclear receptor occupancy correlates with GH synthesis . 
Thyroid hormones inhibit [ 3H ] glycosaminoglycan synthesis by <START:ana> cultured human dermal fibroblasts <END> , and T3SO4 displayed about 0.5 % the activity of T3 at 72 h . 
<START:ana> Human fibroblasts <END> contained roughly the same level of microsomal <START:ggp> p-nitrophenyl sulfatase <END> activity as that previously observed in <START:ana> hepatic microsomes <END> . 
Propylthiouracil ( 50 mumol/L ) did not affect the action of T3SO4 , suggesting that deiodination was not important for this activity of T3SO4 . 
Thus , it appears T3SO4 has no intrinsic biological activity , but , under certain circumstances , may be reactivated by desulfation . 
Human T cell activation through the <START:ggp> activation-inducer molecule/CD69 <END> enhances the activity of <START:ggp> transcription factor AP-1 <END> . 
The induction of the <START:ggp> AP-1 transcription factor <END> has been ascribed to the early events leading to T cell differentiation and activation . 
We have studied the regulation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity in <START:ana> human peripheral blood T lymphocytes <END> stimulated through the activation inducer molecule ( AIM ) / <START:ggp> CD69 <END> activation pathway . 
Phorbol esters are required to induce <START:ggp> AIM/CD69 <END> cell-surface expression as well as for triggering the proliferation of <START:ana> T cells <END> in conjunction with <START:ggp> anti-AIM mAb <END> . 
Mobility shift assays showed that addition of <START:ggp> anti-AIM mAb <END> to <START:ana> PMA-treated T lymphocytes <END> markedly enhanced the binding activity of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> to its cognate sequence , the <START:ggp> phorbol ester response element <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> anti-AIM mAb <END> did not induce any change in the binding activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> whose activity is also regulated by <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> . 
The increase in <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -binding activity was accompanied by the marked stimulation of the transcription of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> but not that of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> . 
Blockade of the <START:ggp> DNA-binding complexes <END> with an <START:ggp> anti-Fos mAb <END> demonstrated a direct participation of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> in the <START:ggp> AP-1 complexes <END> induced by <START:ggp> anti-AIM mAb <END> . 
Most of the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity could be eliminated when the <START:ggp> anti-AIM mAb <END> was added to the culture medium in the presence of cycloheximide , suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is crucial for the induction of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -binding activity . 
These data provide the evidence that activation of <START:ana> human peripheral blood T cells <END> through the AIM activation pathway regulate the activity of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
Therefore , this pathway appears as a crucial step in the initiation of early T cell activation events . 
Gangliosides suppress <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> production in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Both <START:ana> normal and malignant cells <END> contain gangliosides as important cell membrane constituents that , after being shed , may influence cells of the immune system . 
We have studied the impact of gangliosides on the expression of <START:ggp> TNF <END> in <START:ana> blood monocytes <END> and in the <START:ana> monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 <END> . 
Although under standard culture conditions , bovine brain gangliosides ( 100 micrograms/ml ) suppressed LPS-stimulated <START:ggp> TNF <END> production 5-fold in <START:ana> PBMC <END> and 10-fold in <START:ana> Mono Mac 6 cells <END> , suppression was more efficient under serum-free conditions . 
Looking at highly purified gangliosides , GD3 , GD1a , GM3 , GM2 , and GM1 were all effective in reducing <START:ggp> TNF <END> production in <START:ana> PBMC <END> , and in <START:ana> Mono Mac 6 <END> by factor 10 to 50 . 
The suppressive activity was lost in molecules , lacking the sugar moiety or the lipid moiety . 
Gangliosides appear to act at an early step of activation in that <START:ana> TNF transcripts <END> were reduced and the mobilization of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> was blocked . 
Furthermore , in time kinetics , gangliosides were effective for up to 30 min after addition of LPS , but not thereafter . 
However , the expression of the <START:ggp> CD14 Ag <END> , a <START:ggp> receptor molecule <END> for <START:ggp> LPS-LPS binding protein complexes <END> , was unaffected by gangliosides . 
Finally , when using Staphylococcus aureus or <START:ggp> platelet activating factor <END> as a stimulus , gangliosides were able to suppress <START:ggp> TNF <END> production in <START:ana> Mono Mac 6 cells <END> by factor 5 to 10 , as well . 
On the other hand , phorbol ester-induced production of O2- was similar in cells treated with and without gangliosides . 
Taken together , our data demonstrate that <START:ggp> TNF <END> gene expression in <START:ana> monocytes <END> induced by different types of stimuli can be blocked by gangliosides at an early step of signal transduction . 
A novel <START:ggp> mitogen-inducible gene product <END> related to <START:ggp> p50/p105-NF-kappa B <END> participates in transactivation through a <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> . 
A <START:ggp> Rel-related , mitogen-inducible , kappa B-binding protein <END> has been cloned as an <START:ggp> immediate-early activation gene <END> of <START:ana> human peripheral blood T cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> cDNA <END> has an <START:ggp> open reading frame <END> of <START:ggp> 900 amino acids <END> capable of encoding a <START:ggp> 97-kDa protein <END> . 
This protein is most similar to the 105-kDa precursor polypeptide of <START:ggp> p50-NF-kappa B <END> . 
Like the 105-kDa precursor , it contains an <START:ggp> amino-terminal Rel-related domain <END> of about 300 amino acids and a <START:ggp> carboxy-terminal domain <END> containing six <START:ggp> full cell cycle <END> or <START:ggp> ankyrin repeats <END> . 
In <START:ggp> vitro-translated proteins <END> , truncated downstream of the <START:ggp> Rel domain <END> and excluding the repeats , bind <START:ggp> kappa B sites <END> . 
We refer to the <START:ggp> kappa B-binding , truncated protein <END> as <START:ggp> p50B <END> by analogy with <START:ggp> p50-NF-kappa B <END> and to the full-length protein as <START:ggp> p97 <END> . 
<START:ggp> p50B <END> is able to form <START:ggp> heteromeric kappa B-binding complexes <END> with <START:ggp> RelB <END> , as well as with <START:ggp> p65 <END> and <START:ggp> p50 <END> , the two subunits of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Transient-transfection experiments in <START:ana> embryonal carcinoma cells <END> demonstrate a functional cooperation between <START:ggp> p50B <END> and <START:ggp> RelB <END> or <START:ggp> p65 <END> in transactivation of a <START:ggp> reporter plasmid <END> dependent on a <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> . 
The data imply the existence of a complex family of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-like transcription factors <END> . 
Surrogate <START:ggp> thyroglobulin receptors <END> and T cell proliferation in Hashimoto 's thyroiditis . 
<START:ggp> Immunoglobulin molecules <END> on the surface of a <START:ana> B lymphocyte <END> are the endogenous `` receptors '' to which specific antigens bind . 
Studies in mice have shown that a <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> , conjugated with palmitate to provide a lipid tail , can be inserted into the cell membrane to provide a `` surrogate '' antigen receptor . 
We have investigated whether a <START:ggp> palmitate conjugate <END> of a <START:ggp> human monoclonal antibody <END> specific for <START:ggp> thyroglobulin <END> ( <START:ggp> TG <END> ) could function as a <START:ggp> surrogate TG receptor <END> on <START:ana> blood mononuclear cells <END> separated into fractions enriched for <START:ana> T cells <END> or depleted of <START:ana> T cells <END> ( <START:ana> non-T cells <END> ) . 
Using flow cytometry , we detected <START:ggp> surrogate TG receptors <END> on <START:ana> non-T ( but not on T ) cells <END> from 11 of 11 individuals studied ( 5 Hashimoto patients and 6 control donors ) . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> endogenous TG receptors <END> could only be detected on <START:ana> non-T cells <END> from 1 of 3 Hashimoto patients and from 0 of 4 control donors . 
Because of the efficient binding of <START:ggp> TG <END> by <START:ggp> surrogate receptors <END> on <START:ana> non-T cells <END> , we assessed the ability of such cells to present <START:ggp> TG <END> to <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Proliferation in response to <START:ggp> TG <END> was observed in <START:ana> T cells <END> from only 1 of 5 Hashimoto patients . 
This low frequency of response was no different from that previously detected using cultures of <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> autologous dendritic cells <END> . 
Therefore , the successful generation of <START:ggp> surrogate receptors <END> on <START:ana> non-T cells <END> is not associated with more efficient <START:ggp> TG <END> presentation of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Furthermore , the significance of the present study is that the <START:ana> T cells <END> , not the <START:ana> antigen-presenting cells <END> , are likely to be the limiting element in the T cell proliferative response to <START:ggp> TG <END> and other <START:ggp> thyroid autoantigens <END> . 
Targeted degradation of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , but not <START:ggp> v-Fos <END> , by a <START:ggp> phosphorylation-dependent signal <END> on <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> . 
The <START:ggp> proto-oncogene products <END> <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> heterodimerize through their <START:ggp> leucine zippers <END> to form the <START:ggp> AP-1 transcription factor <END> . 
The transcriptional activity of the heterodimer is regulated by signal-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events . 
The stability of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> was found to also be controlled by intracellular signal transduction . 
In transient expression and in vitro degradation experiments , the stability of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> was decreased when the protein was dimerized with <START:ggp> phosphorylated c-Jun <END> . 
<START:ggp> c-Jun <END> protein isolated from <START:ana> phorbol ester-induced cells <END> did not target <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> for degradation , which suggests that <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> is transiently stabilized after stimulation of cell growth . 
<START:ggp> v-Fos protein <END> , the retroviral counterpart of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , was not susceptible to degradation targeted by <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> . 
The regulation of the <START:ggp> human tumor necrosis factor alpha promoter region <END> in <START:ana> macrophage <END> , <START:ana> T cell <END> , and <START:ana> B cell lines <END> . 
The <START:ggp> 1311-base pair human tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha promoter region <END> was fused to the <START:ggp> luciferase ( Luc ) reporter gene <END> and studied in a transient transfection system in three <START:ana> TNF producing cell lines <END> , the <START:ana> U937 macrophage cell line <END> , the <START:ana> MLA 144 T cell line <END> , and the <START:ana> 729-6 B cell line <END> . 
This full length promoter construct can be induced by phorbol 13-myristate acetate ( PMA ) in each of these cell types . 
Analysis of a series of <START:ggp> 5'-truncations <END> showed several peaks of basal and PMA induced activity suggesting the presence of several <START:ggp> positive <END> and negative regulatory elements . 
A <START:ggp> PMA responsive element <END> was localized to a region between <START:ggp> -95 and -36 bp <END> relative to the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> . 
Within this region , single <START:ggp> AP-2- and AP-1- like consensus sequences <END> were noted . 
These <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 sites <END> were each modified with a double point mutation . 
A modest ( 20-50 % ) reduction in <START:ggp> TNF promoter <END> activity was observed with the <START:ggp> AP-2 site mutation <END> . 
However , mutation of the <START:ggp> AP-1 site <END> markedly diminished both the basal and PMA-activated promoter activity . 
Also co-transfections of the <START:ggp> wild-type promoter construct <END> with an <START:ggp> AP-1/c-jun expression vector <END> resulted in augmented basal and PMA-induced promoter activity . 
Stable expression of <START:ggp> transdominant Rev protein <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> inhibits human immunodeficiency virus replication . 
The human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) <START:ggp> Rev protein <END> is essential for viral structural protein expression ( <START:ggp> Gag <END> , <START:ggp> Pol <END> , and <START:ggp> Env <END> ) and , hence , for viral replication . 
In transient transfection assays , mutant forms of <START:ggp> Rev <END> have been identified that inhibit wild-type <START:ggp> Rev <END> activity and therefore suppress viral replication . 
To determine whether such <START:ggp> transdominant Rev proteins <END> could provide long-term protection against HIV infection without affecting T cell function , <START:ana> T leukemia cell lines <END> were stably transduced with a <START:ggp> retroviral vector <END> encoding a transdominant mutant of the <START:ggp> Rev protein <END> , <START:ggp> M10 <END> . 
While all the <START:ana> M10-expressing cell lines <END> remained infectable by HIV-1 , these same cells failed to support a productive replication cycle when infected with a cloned isolate of HIV-1 . 
In addition , two out of three <START:ana> M10-expressing CEM clones <END> were also resistant to highly productive infection by a heterogeneous HIV-1 pool . 
Expression of <START:ggp> M10 <END> did not affect induction of HIV transcription mediated by the <START:ggp> kappa B regulatory element <END> or <START:ggp> Tat <END> . 
Importantly , constitutive expression of <START:ggp> Rev M10 <END> did not alter the secretion of <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> in response to mitogen stimulation of <START:ana> EL-4 <END> and <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
The inhibition of HIV infection in cells stably expressing a <START:ggp> transdominant Rev protein <END> , in the absence of any deleterious effect on T cell function , suggests that such a strategy could provide a therapeutic effect in the <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients . 
Simple derivation of TFIID-dependent <START:ggp> RNA polymerase II <END> transcription systems from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and other organisms , and factors required for transcriptional activation . 
Resolution of whole cell extract through two chromatographic steps yields a single protein fraction requiring only the addition of <START:ggp> TFIID <END> for the initiation of transcription at <START:ggp> RNA polymerase II promoters <END> . 
This approach allows the convenient generation of <START:ggp> RNA polymerase II <END> transcription systems from Saccharomyces cerevisiae , <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> , and Schizosaccharomyces pombe . 
<START:ggp> TFIIDs <END> from all three organisms are interchangeable among all three systems . 
The S. cerevisiae and Sch. pombe systems support effects of <START:ggp> acidic activator proteins <END> , provided a further protein fraction from S. cerevisiae is supplied . 
This further fraction is distinct from the mediator of transcriptional activation described previously and represents a second component in addition to <START:ggp> general initiation factors <END> that may facilitate a response to <START:ggp> acidic activators <END> . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression during induction of monocytic differentiation by okadaic acid . 
The present work has examined the effects of okadaic acid , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases <END> , on the regulation of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression during monocytic differentiation of <START:ana> U-937 leukemia cells <END> . 
The results demonstrate that okadaic acid treatment is associated with induction of a differentiated monocyte phenotype characterized by : ( a ) growth arrest ; ( b ) increases in <START:ggp> Mac-1 cell surface antigen <END> expression ; ( c ) down-regulation of <START:ggp> c-myc transcripts <END> ; and ( d ) induction of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor gene <END> expression . 
This induction of monocytic differentiation was associated with transient increases in <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> levels , which were maximal at 6 h . 
Similar effects were obtained for the <START:ggp> c-fos gene <END> . 
Run-on analysis demonstrated detectable levels of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> transcription in <START:ana> U-937 cells <END> and that this rate is increased approximately 40-fold following okadaic acid exposure . 
<START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> levels were superinduced in cells treated with both okadaic acid and cycloheximide , whereas inhibition of protein synthesis had little , if any , effect on okadaic acid-induced <START:ggp> c-jun <END> transcription . 
The half-life of <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> was similar ( 45-50 min ) in both untreated and <START:ana> okadaic acid-induced cells <END> . 
In contrast , treatment with both okadaic acid and cycloheximide was associated with stabilization ( t 1/2 = 90 min ) of <START:ggp> c-jun transcripts <END> . 
Taken together , these findings indicate that the induction of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> transcription by okadaic acid is controlled primarily by a transcriptional mechanism . 
Since previous studies have demonstrated that the <START:ggp> c-jun gene <END> is autoinduced by <START:ggp> Jun/AP-1 <END> , we also studied transcription of <START:ggp> c-jun promoter ( positions -132/+170 ) -reporter gene constructs <END> with and without a mutated <START:ggp> AP-1 element <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Mitogen stimulation of T-cells increases <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> protein levels , AP-1 binding and AP-1 transcriptional activity . 
We have analysed the effect of mitogenic lectins on <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> protein levels as well as on activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) binding and enhancer activity in Jurkat T-cells . 
Both <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> protein levels were increased after Con A and PHA stimulation . 
Since T-cell stimulation increases both intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP levels and activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) , the possible involvement of these intracellular messengers in <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> induction was tested . 
PMA , which directly activates PKC , mimicked the effect of the lectins on c-Fos and <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> , but elevation of either intracellular Ca2+ or cAMP levels had little or no effect . 
The mitogen-induced increase of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> immunoreactivity was inhibited by H-7 , a kinase inhibitor with relatively high specificity for PKC , and less efficiently by H-8 , a structurally related kinase inhibitor less active on PKC , but more active on cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases . 
Con A stimulation was found to increase both binding of AP-1 to the AP-1 consensus sequence , TRE , and AP-1 enhancer activity , in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
PMA was also found to increase the AP-1 enhancer activity , whereas elevation of Ca2+ or cAMP had only minor effects . 
We conclude that stimulation with mitogenic lectins is sufficient to increase both <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> protein levels , AP-1 binding and AP-1 enhancer activity in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> and that they act via mechanisms that could involve the activation of PKC . 
An 11-base-pair DNA sequence motif apparently unique to the <START:ggp> human interleukin 4 gene <END> confers responsiveness to T-cell activation signals . 
We have identified a <START:ggp> DNA segment <END> that confers responsiveness to antigen stimulation signals on the <START:ggp> human interleukin ( IL ) 4 gene <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human IL-4 gene <END> , of 10 kilobases , is composed of four <START:ggp> exons <END> and three <START:ggp> introns <END> . 
A <START:ggp> cis-acting element <END> ( <START:ggp> P sequence <END> ) resides in the <START:ggp> 5 ' upstream region <END> ; no additional <START:ggp> DNA segments <END> with enhancer activity were identified in the <START:ggp> human IL-4 gene <END> . 
For further mapping purposes , a <START:ggp> fusion promoter <END> was constructed with the <START:ggp> granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor basic promoter <END> containing <START:ggp> 60 base pairs of sequence <END> upstream from the <START:ggp> cap site <END> of the <START:ggp> mouse granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene <END> and various lengths of the <START:ggp> 5 ' upstream sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> . 
The <START:ggp> P sequence <END> was located between positions -79 and -69 relative to the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> of the <START:ggp> human IL-4 gene <END> , and this location was confirmed by base-substitution mutations . 
The plasmids carrying multiple copies of the <START:ggp> P sequence <END> showed higher responsiveness to the stimulation . 
The <START:ggp> binding protein <END> ( s ) that recognize the <START:ggp> P sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> were identified by DNA-mobility-shift assays . 
The binding of <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> ( a <START:ggp> DNA binding protein <END> that specifically recognizes the <START:ggp> P sequence <END> ) to the <START:ggp> P sequence <END> was abolished when oligonucleotides carrying base substitutions were used , indicating that the <START:ggp> NF ( P ) <END> interaction is sequence-specific and that binding specificity of the protein paralleled the sequence requirements for <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> expression in vivo . 
The <START:ggp> P sequence <END> does not share homology with the <START:ggp> 5 ' upstream sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> , even though surrounding sequences of the <START:ggp> IL-4 gene <END> share high homology with the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> . 
We conclude that a different set of <START:ggp> proteins <END> recognize <START:ggp> IL-2 and IL-4 genes <END> . 
Leukotriene B4 stimulates c-fos and c-jun gene transcription and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding activity in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
We have examined the effect of leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) , a potent lipid <START:ggp> proinflammatory mediator <END> , on the expression of the <START:ggp> proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos <END> . 
In addition , we looked at the modulation of <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> binding specifically to the <START:ggp> AP-1 element <END> after LTB4 stimulation . 
LTB4 increased the expression of the <START:ggp> c-fos gene <END> in a time- and concentration-dependent manner . 
The <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> , which is constitutively expressed in <START:ana> human peripheral-blood monocytes <END> at relatively high levels , was also slightly augmented by LTB4 , although to a much lower extent than <START:ggp> c-fos <END> . 
The kinetics of expression of the two genes were also slightly different , with <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> reaching a peak at 15 min after stimulation and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> at 30 min . 
Both messages rapidly declined thereafter . 
Stability of the <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> was not affected by LTB4 , as assessed after actinomycin D treatment . 
Nuclear transcription studies in vitro showed that LTB4 increased the transcription of the <START:ggp> c-fos gene <END> 7-fold and the <START:ggp> c-jun gene <END> 1.4-fold . 
<START:ana> Resting monocytes <END> contained <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> binding to the <START:ggp> AP-1 element <END> , but stimulation of <START:ana> monocytes <END> with LTB4 induced greater <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -binding activity of <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> . 
These results indicate that LTB4 may regulate the production of different <START:ggp> cytokines <END> by modulating the yield and/or the function of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> such as <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> -binding <START:ggp> proto-oncogene products <END> . 
Modulation of normal erythroid differentiation by the endogenous thyroid hormone and <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptors <END> : a possible target for <START:ggp> v-erbA oncogene <END> action . 
The <START:ggp> v-erbA oncogene <END> , a mutated version of the <START:ggp> thyroid hormone receptor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> c-erbA/TR-alpha <END> ) , inhibits erythroid differentiation and constitutively represses transcription of certain <START:ggp> erythrocyte genes <END> , suggesting a normal function of the <START:ggp> proto-oncogene c-erbA <END> in erythropoiesis . 
Here we demonstrate that the endogenous <START:ggp> thyroid hormone receptor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> c-erbA/TR-alpha <END> ) and the closely related <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> RAR-alpha <END> ) play a role in the regulation of normal erythroid differentiation . 
Retinoic acid ( RA ) distinctly modulated the erythroid differentiation program of <START:ana> normal erythroid progenitors <END> and erythroblasts reversibly transformed by a conditional <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase oncogene <END> . 
When added pulsewise to <START:ana> immature cells <END> , differentiation was accelerated while more <START:ana> mature cells <END> underwent premature cell death . 
Thyroid hormone ( T3 ) alone caused similar but weaker effects . 
Interestingly , T3 strongly enhanced the action of RA , suggesting cooperative action of the two receptors in modulating erythroid differentiation . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> human RAR-alpha <END> in <START:ana> receptor-negative erythroblasts <END> conferred RA-induced regulation of differentiation to the otherwise <START:ana> unresponsive cells <END> , thus showing that the <START:ggp> RAR-alpha <END> is essential for the RA effect . 
Likewise , enhanced expression of <START:ggp> exogenous c-erbA/TR-alpha <END> in <START:ana> erythroblasts <END> rendered them susceptible to modulation of differentiation by T3 , suggesting a similar function of both receptors . 
Activation of <START:ggp> lymphokine genes <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> : role of <START:ggp> cis-acting DNA elements <END> that respond to T cell activation signals . 
Activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> is initiated by the recognition of antigen on <START:ana> antigen presenting cells <END> to exert the effector functions in immune and inflammatory responses . 
Two types of <START:ana> helper T cell ( Th ) clones <END> ( <START:ana> Th1 <END> and <START:ana> Th2 <END> ) are defined on the basis of different patterns of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> ( <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> ) secretion . 
They determine the outcome of an antigenic response toward humoral or cell-mediated immunity . 
Although <START:ggp> lymphokine genes <END> are coordinately regulated upon antigen stimulation , they are regulated by the mechanisms common to all as well as those which are unique to each gene . 
For most <START:ggp> lymphokine genes <END> , a combination of phorbol esters ( phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate , PMA ) and calcium ionophores ( A23187 ) is required for their maximal induction . 
Yet phorbol ester alone or calcium ionophore alone produce several <START:ggp> lymphokines <END> . 
The production of the <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) is completely dependent on the two signals . 
We have previously found a <START:ggp> cis-acting region <END> spanning the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter region <END> ( positions -95 to +27 ) that confers inducibility to <START:ggp> reporter genes <END> in transient transfection assays . 
Further analysis identified three elements required for efficient induction , referred to as <START:ggp> GM2 <END> , <START:ggp> GC-box <END> and <START:ggp> conserved lymphokine element <END> ( <START:ggp> CLE0 <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> GM2 <END> defines a <START:ggp> binding site <END> for protein ( s ) whose binding is inducible by PMA . 
One protein , <START:ggp> NF-GM2 <END> is similar to the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> . 
<START:ggp> GC-box <END> is a <START:ggp> binding site <END> for <START:ggp> constitutively bound proteins <END> . 
CLEO defines a <START:ggp> binding site <END> for protein ( s ) whose optimum binding is stimulated by PMA and A23187 . 
<START:ggp> Viral trans-activators <END> such as <START:ggp> Tax <END> ( human T cell leukemia virus-1 , HTLV-1 ) and <START:ggp> E2 <END> ( bovine papilloma virus , BPV ) proteins are other agents which activate <START:ggp> lymphokine gene <END> expression by bypassing <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) mediated signaling . 
The trans-activation domain of <START:ggp> E2 <END> and <START:ggp> Tax <END> is interchangeable although they have no obvious sequence homology between them . 
The <START:ggp> viral trans-activators <END> appear to target specific <START:ggp> DNA binding protein <END> such as <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> to <START:ggp> cis-acting DNA site <END> and promote <START:ggp> lymphokine gene <END> expression without <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated stimulation . 
Mutations in the <START:ggp> Pit-1 gene <END> in children with combined pituitary hormone deficiency . 
<START:ggp> Pit-1 <END> is a <START:ggp> pituitary-specific transcription factor <END> that binds to and transactivates <START:ggp> promoters <END> of <START:ggp> growth hormone and prolactin genes <END> . 
In three unrelated Japanese children with combined pituitary hormone deficiency , we identified three point mutations in the <START:ggp> Pit-1 gene <END> , <START:ggp> Pro24Leu <END> , <START:ggp> Arg143Gln <END> , and <START:ggp> Arg271Trp <END> , located on the <START:ggp> major transactivation region <END> , <START:ggp> POU-specific domain <END> , and <START:ggp> POU-homeodomain <END> , respectively . 
Activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> and elevation of cAMP interact synergistically to raise <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity in Jurkat cells . 
We have earlier found that in Jurkat cells activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) enhances the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) accumulation induced by adenosine receptor stimulation or activation of <START:ggp> Gs <END> . 
Here we have therefore examined the effect of the phorbol ester PMA ( phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ) which stimulates <START:ggp> PKC <END> and a combination of the <START:ggp> adenosine receptor <END> agonist NECA ( 5'- ( N-ethyl ) -carboxamido adenosine ) and forskolin to raise cAMP , on the levels of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> and on the binding and transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> activator protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) . 
PMA treatment caused a concentration- and time-dependent increase in both c-Fos and Jun immunoreactivity in contrast to cAMP elevation that had only a slight effect . 
Both PMA and the combination of NECA and forskolin acted together either to increase ( <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> ) or decrease ( <START:ggp> Jun <END> ) protein levels as well as increasing <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> binding , as judged by gel-shift assay , and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> transcriptional activity . 
Furthermore there was a clear-cut synergy between the <START:ggp> PKC <END> stimulator and the cAMP elevating agents . 
The results demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> and elevation of cAMP leads to an enhanced <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> transcriptional activity in a <START:ana> T-leukemia cell line <END> , suggesting that the previously observed interaction between the parallel signal transduction pathways may have functional consequences at the level of gene transcription . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody <END> -induced T-cell proliferation by dexamethasone , isoproterenol , or prostaglandin E2 either alone or in combination . 
1 . 
The purpose of these studies was to investigate the modulation of the proliferation of <START:ana> human T cells <END> obtained from peripheral blood by dexamethasone ( DEX ) , isoproterenol ( ISO ) , and prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) . 
The former two substances interact with <START:ana> T cells <END> via the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid and beta-adrenergic receptors <END> respectively . 
When occupied by their natural ligands , glucocorticosteroids and catecholamines , these receptors have a role in modulating T-cell function during stress . 
During the inflammatory response increased levels of PGE2 bind to their receptors on <START:ana> T cells <END> and thus alter responsiveness . 
Proliferation of <START:ana> T cells <END> was induced by immobilized <START:ggp> anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody <END> ( <START:ggp> mAb <END> ) in the presence or absence of an additional costimulatory signal delivered by <START:ggp> anti-CD28 mAb <END> . 
2 . 
Various physiologic concentrations of DEX , ISO , or PGE2 were added at the time of initiation of the cultures and subsequent proliferation of the unstimulated <START:ana> T cells <END> was determined . 
The results demonstrate that physiologic concentrations of all three of these agents inhibit the <START:ggp> anti-CD3 mAb <END> -induced proliferation of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
3 . 
Although DEX and PGE2 were equipotent in suppressing T-cell proliferation , ISO was much less effective . 
4 . 
Because concomitant elevations in the peripheral levels of these substances may occur , experiments were performed to determine the T-cell inhibitory effects of DEX together with either PGE2 or ISO . 
Synergistic suppression of T-cell proliferation was observed when various concentrations of DEX and PGE2 , but not DEX and ISO , were added to cultures . 
This synergistic suppression could not be explained by an increase in cAMP accumulation in <START:ana> T cells <END> stimulated with DEX and PGE2 . 
5 . 
Finally , the addition of <START:ggp> anti-CD28 mAb <END> to <START:ana> anti-CD3 mAb-stimulated T cells <END> overcame much of the suppression of proliferation induced by PGE2 or ISO but less so than that induced by DEX . 
In vivo footprint analysis of the <START:ggp> HLA-DRA gene promoter <END> : cell-specific interaction at the <START:ggp> octamer site <END> and up-regulation of X box binding by <START:ggp> interferon gamma <END> . 
Analysis of the <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex class II gene promoter <END> <START:ggp> DRA <END> has previously identified at least five <START:ggp> cis-acting regions <END> required for maximal expression . 
We have examined the <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> for protein-DNA interactions in the <START:ana> intact cell <END> , which may mediate transcriptional activation . 
Using in vivo genomic footprinting we identified interactions in <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> at the <START:ggp> octamer site <END> and the <START:ggp> Y , X1 , and X2 boxes <END> . 
<START:ana> Class II antigen expressing T-cell lines <END> maintained contacts identical to <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> , while <START:ana> class II-negative T-cell lines <END> exhibited no interactions . 
In <START:ana> lymphoid cell lines <END> , the <START:ggp> octamer site <END> is occupied and required for maximal expression . 
This is most likely due to the presence of the <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific OTF-2 factor <END> . 
In contrast , the <START:ana> class II-positive nonlymphoid glioblastoma cell line <END> does not exhibit interactions at the <START:ggp> octamer site <END> despite the presence of the <START:ggp> ubiquitous OTF-1 factor <END> and an <START:ggp> open binding site <END> . 
Thus , the <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> discriminates against <START:ggp> OTF-1 <END> activation at the level of DNA binding in the <START:ana> glioblastoma line <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interferon gamma <END> induces class II expression in this <START:ana> glioblastoma cell line <END> and , in parallel , up-regulates X1 and X2 box protein-DNA interactions , while all other interactions remain unchanged . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> interferon gamma <END> functions on a <START:ggp> poised promoter <END> by altering weak , nonproductive interactions at the <START:ggp> X boxes <END> to strong interactions . 
These findings provide direct in vivo evidence to strongly suggest that the modulation of <START:ggp> X1 <END> and <START:ggp> X2 <END> interactions is an important constituent of the <START:ggp> interferon gamma <END> induction pathway . 
Estrogen binding sites in <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> and effects of danazol on their sites in vitro . 
1 . 
This study was designed to investigate the presence of estrogen type I ( high affinity , low capacity ) and type II ( low affinity , high capacity ) binding sites in human <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> and the effects of danazol on these sites . 
2 . 
These two types of estrogen binding sites existed in <START:ana> human peripheral blood monocytes <END> . 
3 . 
Danazol bound to these sites in high concentration ( 10 ( -6 ) M , clinical serum concentration during danazol therapy ) and decreased the number of both sites .

It is suggested that danazol has an anti-estrogenic action to the monocytes through the competition and suppression of estrogen binding sites as seen in the estrogen target organ . 
A microtitre assay system for <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> : decreased receptor concentration in myocardial infarction . 
A major difficulty in determination of glucocorticoid receptor sites is the very complicated assay procedure . 
Therefore , we describe a microtitre assay system for <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> which is a whole-cell competitive binding radioassay using [ 3H ] -dexamethasone as radioligand . 
This modification of a previously described protocol simplifies and reduces laboratory work and allows assay reproducibility to be controlled more reliably . 
Thus enabled to perform the test on multiple <START:ana> blood samples <END> in parallel , we investigated cardiac infarction patients over a 12-day period to test if <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> binding is altered in this 'stressful ' disease . 
On the first day of the disease , <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> capacity was significantly decreased without alteration of the receptor-ligand affinity , whereas on days 4 and 12 the number of receptor sites was normal again . 
This result fits well into the general observation of stress-induced down-regulation of immune responses . 
<START:ggp> SRC-related proto-oncogenes <END> and <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in primary <START:ana> human T cells <END> : modulation by cyclosporin A and FK506 . 
Activation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> induces transcription of <START:ggp> genes <END> encoding for <START:ggp> lymphokines <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene <END> expression is controlled transcriptionally by the cooperative activity of specific <START:ggp> trans-activating factors <END> that bind to the <START:ggp> IL-2 enhancer <END> . 
Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 inhibit the production of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> at the level of gene transcription . 
A member of the <START:ggp> src gene family <END> , the <START:ggp> lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase <END> , <START:ggp> p56lck <END> , has been implicated in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production . 
CsA was found not to inhibit <START:ggp> lck <END> gene expression , nor the activity of the <START:ggp> lck gene <END> product . 
However , CsA and FK506 inhibit the appearance of DNA binding activity of factors that bind to the <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 sites <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-2 enhancer <END> . 
Since the induction of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> is induced by the same stimuli that stimulate <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production , these results indicate that the immunosuppressant action of CsA and FK506 is exerted at the level of these <START:ggp> trans-activating factors <END> . 
The <START:ggp> AP-1 site <END> at <START:ggp> -150 bp <END> , but not the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> , is likely to represent the major target of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> in the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 promoter <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> T cells <END> with antigen results in activation of several <START:ggp> kinases <END> , including <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) , that may mediate the later induction of activation-related genes . 
We have examined the potential role of <START:ggp> PKC <END> in induction of the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> stimulated through the <START:ggp> T cell receptor/CD3 complex <END> . 
We have previously shown that prolonged treatment of the untransformed <START:ana> T cell clone Ar-5 <END> with phorbol esters results in downmodulation of the <START:ggp> alpha and beta isozymes <END> of <START:ggp> PKC <END> , and abrogates induction of <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> and <START:ggp> protein <END> . 
Here we show that phorbol ester treatment also abolishes induction of <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase <END> activity in <START:ana> Ar-5 cells <END> transfected with a <START:ggp> plasmid <END> containing the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> linked to this <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> . 
The <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> contains <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> including <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> , <START:ggp> Oct <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , which are all potentially sensitive to activation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> . 
We show that induction of a trimer of the <START:ggp> NFAT and Oct sites <END> is not sensitive to phorbol ester treatment , and that mutations in the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B site <END> have no effect on inducibility of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> . 
In contrast , mutations in the <START:ggp> AP-1 site <END> located at <START:ggp> -150 bp <END> almost completely abrogate induction of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> , and appearance of an <START:ggp> inducible nuclear factor <END> binding to this site is sensitive to <START:ggp> PKC <END> depletion . 
Moreover , cotransfections with c-fos and c-jun expression plasmids markedly enhance induction of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> in <START:ana> minimally stimulated T cells <END> . 
Our results indicate that the <START:ggp> AP-1 site <END> at <START:ggp> -150 bp <END> represents a major , if not the only , site of <START:ggp> PKC <END> responsiveness in the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> . 
[ Effect of antihypertensive therapy with captopril on <START:ggp> gluco- and mineralocorticoid receptors <END> of <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> in hypertensive patients of various age ] 
Binding of 3H-dexamethasone and 3H-aldosterone by <START:ggp> peripheral lymphocyte receptors <END> was investigated in healthy persons and hypertensive patients before and after 2-week captopril treatment . 
The number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid binding sites <END> was increased in hypertensives vs normotensives . 
The treatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril led to activation of hormone-receptor interactions . 
There was a more marked rise of the number of <START:ggp> receptors <END> in middle-aged ( 44-55 years ) hypertensives vs elderly ( 61-80 years ) subjects after captopril treatment . 
The use of <START:ana> interferon-gamma-treated U937 cells <END> in chemiluminescence assays to detect <START:ggp> red cell , platelet and granulocyte antibodies <END> of potential clinical significance . 
The chemiluminescent ( CL ) response of <START:ana> interferon-gamma-treated U937 ( IFN-U937 ) cells <END> to sensitized target cells has been used to detect <START:ggp> red cell <END> , <START:ggp> platelet <END> and <START:ggp> granulocyte antibodies <END> . 
A clone of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> was selected which expressed <START:ggp> Fc receptor I <END> ( <START:ggp> Fc gamma RI <END> ) and which , after incubation with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> for 72 h , was capable of generating high levels of lucigenin-enhanced CL . 
The CL responses of <START:ana> IFN-U937 cells <END> and <START:ana> peripheral blood human monocytes <END> to <START:ana> sensitized red cells <END> , <START:ana> platelets <END> or <START:ana> granulocytes <END> were then compared . 
Assays using <START:ana> monocytes <END> or <START:ana> IFN-U937 cells <END> were of comparable sensitivity for detection of <START:ggp> antibodies <END> against all three types of target cell . 
In addition , the use of <START:ana> IFN-U937 cells <END> reduced interassay variation and simplified assay performance . 
The potential clinical usefulness of these CL assays was suggested by the ability of both <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> IFN-U937 cells <END> to respond to <START:ana> red cells <END> , <START:ana> platelets <END> or <START:ana> granulocytes <END> sensitized with sera from pregnant women whose babies had either haemolytic disease of the newborn ( HDN ) , alloimmune thrombocytopenia or alloimmune neutropenia respectively . 
In addition , <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> IFN-U937 cells <END> both responded to <START:ana> red cells <END> sensitized with <START:ggp> antibodies <END> against a variety of specificities of assumed ( although not documented ) clinical significance for blood transfusion recipients . 
In contrast , <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> IFN-U937 cells <END> responded only weakly to <START:ana> red cells <END> sensitized with either <START:ggp> anti-D <END> in sera from mothers of babies unaffected by HDN , or with antisera containing <START:ggp> high titre antibodies <END> with specificities not normally associated with significantly reduced <START:ana> red cell <END> survival . 
Ablation of transplanted HTLV-I Tax-transformed tumors in mice by antisense inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> [ published erratum appears in Science 1993 Mar 12 ; 259 ( 5101 ) : 1523 ] 
Mice transgenic for the <START:ggp> human T cell leukemia virus ( HTLV-I ) Tax gene <END> develop fibroblastic tumors that express <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-inducible early genes <END> . 
In vitro inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides ( ODNs ) inhibited growth of these <START:ana> culture-adapted Tax-transformed fibroblasts <END> as well as an <START:ana> HTLV-I-transformed human lymphocyte line <END> . 
In contrast , antisense inhibition of <START:ggp> Tax <END> itself had no apparent effect on cell growth . 
Mice treated with antisense to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ODNs showed rapid regression of transplanted fibrosarcomas . 
This suggests that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> expression may be necessary for the maintenance of the malignant phenotype and provides a therapeutic approach for HTLV-I-associated disease . 
<START:ggp> Membrane receptors <END> for aldosterone : a novel pathway for mineralocorticoid action . 
Rapid nongenomic in vitro effects of aldosterone on intracellular electrolytes , cell volume , and <START:ggp> Na ( + ) -H+ antiport <END> have been found in <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> ( <START:ana> HML <END> ) . 
Binding of 125I-labeled aldosterone to plasma membranes of <START:ana> HML <END> shares important features with these functional data . 
This includes a very low apparent dissociation constant ( Kd ) of 0.1 nM for both aldosterone and the effect on the <START:ggp> Na ( + ) -H ( + ) -antiport <END> , a high turnover rate , and the almost exclusive binding selectivity for aldosterone . 
Dexamethasone , RU 26988 , corticosterone , ouabain , amiloride , and 18-hydroxyprogesterone were inactive as ligands . 
Deoxycorticosterone acetate had an intermediate activity with an apparent Kd of 100 nM . 
These findings are the first to demonstrate membrane binding of aldosterone being compatible with major aspects of its nongenomic effects . 
Leukotriene B4 transcriptionally activates <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> expression involving <START:ggp> NK-chi B <END> and <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> . 
Leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) is a notable participant in inflammation and chemotaxis . 
It is , however , still unclear whether LTB4 acts in this regard directly or indirectly by stimulating the release of chemotactic and <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> . 
Here we report that LTB4 induces synthesis of <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) -6 <END> by <START:ana> human blood monocytes <END> through transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> IL-6 gene <END> . 
We furthermore demonstrate that this process involves activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-chi B <END> and , to a lesser extent , of <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> , while the activity of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , shown to otherwise confer <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> inducibility , appeared to be unaffected by LTB4 . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> NF-chi B <END> and <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> in induction of <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> transcription by monocytes was demonstrated using deleted forms of the <START:ggp> IL-6 promoter <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> IL-6 promoter <END> by LTB4 was not only associated with accumulation of the respective transcripts but resulted in synthesis of functional <START:ggp> IL-6 protein <END> as well . 
In addition , LTB4 mediated transactivation of a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter construct <END> containing the <START:ggp> NF-chi B <END> or the <START:ggp> NF-IL6 enhancer <END> , but not the <START:ggp> AP-1 enhancer <END> . 
The signaling events mediating this effect appeared to involve the release of H2O2 , since LTB4 failed to induce <START:ggp> NF-chi B <END> or <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> in the presence of the scavenger of H2O2 , N-acetyl-L-cysteine . 
<START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> : a repressor of <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> death . 
The genes and mechanisms that control programmed cell death are currently the subject of intense study . 
The <START:ggp> bcl-2 gene <END> , a repressor of <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> death , is perhaps the best understood of the programmed cell death associated genes . 
Here , Stanley Korsmeyer provides a brief overview of <START:ggp> bcl-2 <END> , concentrating on its roles in B- and T-cell development and in oncogenesis . 
Cytoplasmic domain heterogeneity and functions of <START:ggp> IgG Fc receptors <END> in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> and macrophages express closely related <START:ggp> immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) Fc receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> Fc gamma RII <END> ) that differ only in the structures of their <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domains <END> . 
Because of cell type-specific alternative messenger RNA splicing , <START:ggp> B-cell Fc gamma RII <END> contains an insertion of 47 amino acids that participates in determining receptor function in these cells . 
Transfection of an <START:ana> Fc gamma RII-negative B-cell line <END> with complementary DNA 's encoding the two splice products and various receptor mutants indicated that the insertion was responsible for preventing both <START:ggp> Fc gamma RII <END> -mediated endocytosis and <START:ggp> Fc gamma RII <END> -mediated antigen presentation . 
The insertion was not required for <START:ggp> Fc gamma RII <END> to modulate <START:ggp> surface immunoglobulin <END> -triggered B-cell activation . 
Instead , regulation of activation involved a region of the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic domain <END> common to both the <START:ggp> lymphocyte and macrophage receptor isoforms <END> . 
In contrast , the insertion did contribute to the formation of caps in response to receptor cross-linking , consistent with suggestions that the lymphocyte but not macrophage form of the receptor can associate with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton . 
[ Age-related changes in <START:ggp> glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> of healthy persons and patients with hypertension ] 
It has been found that the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> of the peripheral blood of healthy elderly subjects increases , while the number of mineralocorticoid receptors decreases . 
The mechanisms of hormone-receptor interactions in hypertension are activated : the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid binding sites <END> grows in hypertensive patients . 
Still a more essential rise in the number of receptors is observed in mid-age hypertensive patients than in elderly ones . 
The mechanism of action of cyclosporin A and FK506 . 
CsA and FK506 are powerful suppressors of the immune system , most notably of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
They act at a point in activation that lies between receptor ligation and the transcription of <START:ggp> early genes <END> . 
Here , Stuart Schreiber and Gerald Crabtree review recent findings that indicate CsA and FK506 operate as prodrugs : they bind <START:ggp> endogenous intracellular receptors <END> , the <START:ggp> immunophilins <END> , and the resulting complex targets the <START:ggp> protein phosphatase , <END> <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , to exert the immunosuppressive effect . 
Induction of monocytic differentiation and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -like activities by human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection of <START:ana> myelomonoblastic cells <END> . 
The effects of human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection on cellular differentiation and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA binding activity have been investigated in a new model of myeloid differentiation . 
<START:ana> PLB-985 cells <END> represent a <START:ana> bipotential myelomonoblastic cell population <END> capable of either granulocytic or monocytic differentiation after induction with appropriate inducers . 
By virtue of the presence of <START:ggp> CD4 <END> on the cell surface , <START:ana> PLB-985 cells <END> were chronically infected with HIV-1 strain IIIB . 
<START:ana> PLB-IIIB cells <END> clearly possessed a more monocytic phenotype than the <START:ana> parental myeloblasts <END> , as determined by differential staining , increased expression of the <START:ggp> myeloid-specific surface markers <END> , and transcription of the <START:ggp> c-fms proto-oncogene <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity was inducible by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> and phorbol myristate acetate in <START:ana> PLB-985 <END> . 
However , in <START:ana> PLB-IIIB cells <END> , constitutive expression of a novel <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> was detected , composed of proteins ranging between 70 and 110 kD . 
These proteins interacted specifically with the <START:ggp> symmetric NF-kappa B site <END> from the <START:ggp> interferon beta ( IFN-beta ) promoter <END> . 
Mutations affecting the <START:ggp> 5 ' guanine residues <END> of the <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> were unable to compete for these <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-related proteins <END> . 
Inducibility of endogenous <START:ana> IFN-beta and IFN-alpha RNA <END> was also increased in <START:ana> PLB-IIIB cells <END> . 
These studies indicate that HIV-1 infection of <START:ana> myelomonoblastic cells <END> may select for a more mature monocytic phenotype and that unique subunit associations of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B DNA binding proteins <END> may contribute to differential <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -mediated gene expression . 
Cortisol receptor resistance : the variability of its clinical presentation and response to treatment . 
Primary ( partial ) <START:ggp> cortisol receptor <END> resistance was previously reported in a total of 7 patients and 14 asymptomatic family members . 
Its occurrence is considered to be extremely rare . 
In the present study we report on 6 patients ( 2 males and 4 females ) with the syndrome . 
The first male patient presented with mild hypertension . 
Hydrochlorothiazide therapy resulted in life-threatening hypokalemia . 
The second male patient had slight hypertension without hypokalemia . 
All four female patients presented between the age of 20-30 yr with acne , hirsutism , and irregular menstruations . 
Low dose dexamethasone therapy ( 1-1.5 mg/day ) was of clinical benefit in these patients . 
All patients showed insufficient suppression of serum cortisol concentrations in the overnight 1-mg dexamethasone test . 
The diurnal rhythm of ACTH and cortisol was intact , albeit at an elevated level . 
There was a normal increase in ACTH , cortisol , and GH ( except in one obese patient ) in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia , while cortisol production was elevated in three patients . 
Circulating adrenal androgen levels were increased in all patients . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> were investigated in a whole cell dexamethasone binding assay in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> . 
In the first male patient , the number of receptors was very low , while the affinity was lower than that in controls . 
A lowered affinity to dexamethasone was found in one female patient , while a lowered number of receptors was found in three patients . 
In the second male patient , no abnormalities were found . 
As a bioassay for glucocorticoid action we also measured dexamethasone suppressibility of mitogen-stimulated incorporation of [ 3H ] thymidine in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> . 
In the male patient with normal receptor status , dexamethasone suppressibility of [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation was significantly lower than that in healthy controls with respect to both maximal suppression and IC50 . 
Partial cortisol receptor resistance might be less rare than previously thought . 
In the six patients presented , at least three different forms can be recognized . 
Therapy with dexamethasone was successful in female patients with acne and hirsutism , as the secondary increase in the production of adrenal androgens was effectively controlled . 
The development of functionally responsive <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The work reviewed in this article separates T cell development into four phases . 
First is an expansion phase prior to <START:ggp> TCR <END> rearrangement , which appears to be correlated with programming of at least some response genes for inducibility . 
This phase can occur to some extent outside of the thymus . 
However , the profound T cell deficit of nude mice indicates that the thymus is by far the most potent site for inducing the expansion per se , even if other sites can induce some response acquisition . 
Second is a controlled phase of <START:ggp> TCR gene <END> rearrangement . 
The details of the regulatory mechanism that selects particular <START:ggp> loci <END> for rearrangement are still not known . 
It seems that the rearrangement of the <START:ggp> TCR gamma loci <END> in the <START:ana> gamma delta lineage <END> may not always take place at a developmental stage strictly equivalent to the rearrangement of <START:ggp> TCR beta <END> in the <START:ana> alpha beta lineage <END> , and it is not clear just how early the two lineages diverge . 
In the <START:ana> TCR alpha beta lineage , <END> however , the final gene rearrangement events are accompanied by rapid proliferation and an interruption in cellular response gene inducibility . 
The loss of conventional responsiveness is probably caused by alterations at the level of signaling , and may be a manifestation of the physiological state that is a precondition for selection . 
Third is the complex process of selection . 
Whereas <START:ana> peripheral T cells <END> can undergo forms of positive selection ( by antigen-driven clonal expansion ) and negative selection ( by abortive stimulation leading to anergy or death ) , neither is exactly the same phenomenon that occurs in the thymic cortex . 
Negative selection in the cortex appears to be a suicidal inversion of antigen responsiveness : instead of turning on <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression , the <START:ana> activated cell <END> destroys its own <START:ggp> chromatin <END> . 
The genes that need to be induced for this response are not yet identified , but it is unquestionably a form of activation . 
It is interesting that in humans and rats , <START:ana> cortical thymocytes <END> undergoing negative selection can still induce <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> expression and even be rescued in vitro , if <START:ggp> exogenous IL-2 <END> is provided . 
Perhaps <START:ana> murine thymocytes <END> are denied this form of rescue because they shut off <START:ggp> IL-2R beta chain <END> expression at an earlier stage or because they may be uncommonly <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> deficient ( cf. Sentman et al. , 1991 ; Strasser et al. , 1991 ) . 
Even so , <START:ana> medullary thymocytes <END> remain at least partially susceptible to negative selection even as they continue to mature . 
<START:ggp> I kappa B/MAD-3 <END> masks the nuclear localization signal of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 <END> and requires the <START:ggp> transactivation domain <END> to inhibit <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 <END> DNA binding . 
The active nuclear form of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B transcription factor complex <END> is composed of two <START:ggp> DNA binding subunits <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p50 <END> , both of which share extensive N-terminal sequence homology with the <START:ggp> v-rel oncogene product <END> . 
The <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 subunit <END> provides the transactivation activity in this complex and serves as an intracellular receptor for a cytoplasmic inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , termed I kappa B . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p50 <END> alone fails to stimulate kappa B-directed transcription , and based on prior in vitro studies , is not directly regulated by <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> . 
To investigate the molecular basis for the critical regulatory interaction between <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B/MAD-3 <END> , a series of <START:ggp> human NF-kappa B p65 mutants <END> was identified that functionally segregated DNA binding , <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> -mediated inhibition , and <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> -induced nuclear exclusion of this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
Results from in vivo expression studies performed with these <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 mutants <END> revealed the following : 1 ) <START:ggp> I kappa B/MAD-3 <END> completely inhibits <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 <END> -dependent transcriptional activation mediated through the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 kappa B enhancer <END> in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> , 2 ) the binding of <START:ggp> I kappa B/MAD-3 <END> to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 <END> is sufficient to retarget <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 <END> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , 3 ) selective deletion of the functional nuclear localization signal present in the <START:ggp> Rel homology domain <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 <END> disrupts its ability to engage <START:ggp> I kappa B/MAD-3 <END> , and 4 ) the unique <START:ggp> C-terminus <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 <END> attenuates its own nuclear localization and contains sequences that are required for <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> -mediated inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 <END> DNA binding activity . 
Together , these findings suggest that the nuclear localization signal and <START:ggp> transactivation domain <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 <END> constitute a bipartite system that is critically involved in the inhibitory function of <START:ggp> I kappa B/MAD-3 <END> . 
Unexpectedly , our in vivo studies also demonstrate that <START:ggp> I kappa B/MAD-3 <END> binds directly to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p50 <END> . 
This interaction is functional as it leads to retargeting of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p50 <END> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm . 
However , no loss of DNA binding activity is observed , presumably reflecting the unique <START:ggp> C-terminal domain <END> that is distinct from that present in <START:ggp> NF-kappa B p65 <END> . 
Characterization of a new tissue-specific <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> binding to the <START:ggp> simian virus 40 enhancer TC-II ( NF-kappa B ) element <END> . 
We have biochemically and functionally characterized a new <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> NP-TCII <END> , which is present in nuclei from <START:ana> unstimulated T and B lymphocytes <END> but is not found in <START:ana> nonhematopoietic cells <END> . 
This factor has a DNA-binding specificity similar to that of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> but is unrelated to this or other <START:ggp> Rel proteins <END> by functional and biochemical criteria . 
It can also be distinguished from other previously described <START:ggp> lymphocyte-specific DNA-binding proteins <END> . 
The <START:ggp> candidate oncoprotein Bcl-3 <END> is an antagonist of <START:ggp> p50/NF-kappa B <END> -mediated inhibition . 
The <START:ggp> candidate oncogene bcl-3 <END> was discovered as a translocation into the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin alpha-locus <END> in some cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemias . 
The <START:ggp> protein Bcl-3 <END> contains seven so-called <START:ggp> ankyrin repeats <END> . 
Similar <START:ggp> repeat motifs <END> are found in a number of <START:ggp> diverse regulatory proteins <END> but the motifs of <START:ggp> Bcl-3 <END> are most closely related to those found in <START:ggp> I kappa B proteins <END> in which the <START:ggp> ankyrin repeat <END> domain is thought to be directly involved in inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity . 
No biological function has yet been described for <START:ggp> Bcl-3 <END> , but it was noted recently that <START:ggp> Bcl-3 <END> interferes with DNA-binding of the <START:ggp> p50 subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in vitro . 
Here we demonstrate that <START:ggp> Bcl-3 <END> can aid <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> -dependent transcription in vivo by counteracting the inhibitory effects of <START:ggp> p50/NF-kappa B homodimers <END> . 
<START:ggp> Bcl-3 <END> may therefore aid activation of select <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-regulated genes <END> , including those of the human immunodeficiency virus . 
[ Mechanism of action of steroid hormones. I. Estrogens ] 
The steroid hormone are very versatile molecules : although they are related among them by their chemical structure , they have very diverse functions and including antagonic . 
Their action mechanism is not completely cleared . 
The estrogens participate in the regulation of practically all the reproductive and sexual events of the female , although the intracellular actions by which they take place are not well known and the proposed models do not adequately satisfy the questions . 
Currently it is accepted the existence of a <START:ggp> cytoplasmic and/or nuclear receptor <END> , without explaining satisfactorily how the hormones come to the nucleus . 
The endocrine events that are rapidly expressed ( seconds ) are due to a possible interaction with cellular membrane . 
The purpose of this review is to analyze and concilliate the reported data on the mechanism of action of estrogens . 
Reduced susceptibility to HIV-1 infection of <START:ana> ethyl-methanesulfonate-treated CEM subclones <END> correlates with a blockade in their <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> signaling pathway . 
We have described the isolation of chemically induced <START:ana> CEM subclones <END> that express <START:ggp> CD4 receptors <END> and bind soluble <START:ggp> gp120 <END> , yet show a markedly reduced susceptibility to infection with HIV-1 . 
Two subclones were found to have an abnormal response to the <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) activator PMA . 
PMA treatment induced <START:ggp> CD3 and CD25 ( IL-2R ) receptors <END> on the parental line and on other <START:ana> ethyl-methanesulfonate-derived subclones <END> , but not on these two mutants . 
Direct assays of <START:ggp> PKC <END> activity were conducted . 
Total cellular <START:ggp> PKC <END> enzymatic activity was found to be normal in these subclones . 
PMA-induced <START:ggp> CD4 <END> down-modulation occurred normally . 
In addition , activation of <START:ggp> c-raf kinase <END> was normal . 
Since <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> contains two functional <START:ggp> nuclear factor kB ( NF-kB ) regulatory elements <END> , we studied the ability of PMA to induce <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> binding activity by different assays . 
<START:ggp> Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase <END> ( <START:ggp> CAT <END> ) assays using the <START:ggp> HIV-1 ( -139 ) long terminal repeat-CAT construct <END> showed no PMA induction of <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity in these subclones ( unlike the parental line and other subclones ) . 
Okadaic acid , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> phosphatases 1 and 2A <END> , did not overcome the defect in these subclones . 
Gel retardation assays , using a 32P-probe containing the HIV-1 <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> probe and nuclear extracts from <START:ana> PMA-treated cells <END> , showed significantly reduced induction of <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kB binding proteins <END> in these two subclones compared with <START:ggp> wild type CEM <END> and a control subclone . 
Deoxycholate treatment of cytoplasmic extracts from these subclones released much reduced <START:ggp> NF-kB binding proteins <END> from their cytoplasmic pools . 
Thus , reduced levels of <START:ggp> PKC <END> -induced nuclear <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> activity in two T cell subclones did not affect their normal cell growth , but correlated with a pronounced reduction in their susceptibility to HIV-1 infection . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor <END> of <START:ana> activated T cells <END> contains <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> . 
The <START:ggp> nuclear factor NF-AT <END> ( ref. 1 ) is induced in <START:ana> T cells <END> stimulated through the <START:ggp> T-cell receptor/CD3 complex <END> , and is required for <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene <END> induction . 
Although <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> has not been cloned or purified , there is evidence that it is a major target for immunosuppression by cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 ( refs 2-7 ) . 
<START:ggp> NF-AT <END> induction may require two activation-dependent events : the CsA-sensitive translocation of a pre-existing component and the CsA-resistant synthesis of a <START:ggp> nuclear component <END> . 
Here we report that the newly synthesized <START:ggp> nuclear component <END> of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> is the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
We show that the inducible nuclear form of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> contains <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> proteins . 
Furthermore , we identify a <START:ggp> pre-existing NF-AT-binding factor <END> that is present in hypotonic extracts of <START:ana> unstimulated T cells <END> . 
On the basis of binding , reconstitution and cotransfection experiments , we propose that activation of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> occurs in at least two stages : a CsA-sensitive stage involving modification and/or translocation of the pre-existing <START:ggp> NF-AT complex <END> , and a CsA-insensitive stage involving the addition of newly synthesized <START:ggp> Fos <END> or <START:ggp> Fos/Jun proteins <END> to the <START:ggp> pre-existing complex <END> . 
A <START:ggp> lymphoid cell-specific nuclear factor <END> containing <START:ggp> c-Rel-like proteins <END> preferentially interacts with <START:ggp> interleukin-6 kappa B-related motifs <END> whose activities are repressed in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> proto-oncoprotein c-Rel <END> is a member of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B transcription factor family <END> , which includes the <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 subunits <END> of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> . 
We show here that <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> binds to <START:ggp> kappa B sites <END> as <START:ggp> homodimers <END> as well as <START:ggp> heterodimers <END> with <START:ggp> p50 <END> . 
These <START:ggp> homodimers <END> and <START:ggp> heterodimers <END> show distinct DNA-binding specificities and affinities for various <START:ggp> kappa B motifs <END> . 
In particular , the <START:ggp> c-Rel homodimer <END> has a high affinity for <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ) and <START:ggp> beta interferon kappa B sites <END> . 
In spite of its association with <START:ggp> p50 <END> in vitro , however , we found a <START:ggp> lymphoid cell-specific nuclear factor <END> in vivo that contains <START:ggp> c-Rel <END> but not <START:ggp> p50 epitopes <END> ; this factor , termed <START:ggp> IL-6 kappa B binding factor II <END> , appears to contain the <START:ggp> c-Rel homodimer <END> and preferentially recognizes several <START:ggp> IL-6 kappa B-related kappa B motifs <END> . 
Although it has been previously shown that the <START:ggp> IL-6 kappa B motif <END> functions as a potent <START:ggp> IL-1/tumor necrosis factor-responsive element <END> in <START:ana> nonlymphoid cells <END> , its activity was found to be repressed in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> such as a <START:ana> Jurkat T-cell line <END> . 
We also present evidence that <START:ggp> IL-6 kappa B binding factor II <END> functions as a repressor specific for <START:ggp> IL-6 kappa B-related kappa B motifs <END> in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
Cortisol resistance in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome . 
This study concerns 9 iv drug abusers with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) who developed hypercortisolism without the clinical signs or metabolic consequences of hypercortisolism . 
All patients were characterized by an Addisonian picture ( weakness , weight loss , hypotension , hyponatremia , and intense mucocutaneous melanosis ) . 
An acquired form of peripheral resistance to glucocorticoids was suspected . 
We , therefore , examined <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> characteristics on <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> by measuring [ 3H ] dexamethasone binding and the effect of dexamethasone on [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation , which is one of the effects of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> activation . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptor <END> density was increased in AIDS patients with an Addisonian picture ( group 1 ; 16.2 +/- 9.4 fmol/million cells ) compared to values in 12 AIDS patients without an Addisonian picture ( group 2 ; 6.05 +/- 2.6 fmol/million cells ; P less than 0.01 ) and sex- and age-matched controls ( 3.15 +/- 2.3 fmol/million cells ; P less than 0.01 ) . 
The affinity of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( Kd ) was strikingly decreased ( 9.36 +/- 3.44 nM in group 1 ; 3.2 +/- 1.5 nM in group 2 ; 2.0 +/- 0.8 nM in controls ; P less than 0.01 ) . 
[ 3H ] Thymidine incorporation was decreased dose-dependently by dexamethasone in controls and patients ; the effect was significantly blunted ( P less than 0.05 ) in group 1 patients , which suggests that activation of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> is impaired as a result of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> abnormality . 
In conclusion , AIDS patients with hypercortisolism and clinical features of peripheral resistance to glucocorticoids are characterized by <START:ggp> abnormal glucocorticoid receptors <END> on <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
Resistance to glucocorticoids implies a complex change in immune-endocrine function , which may be important in the course of immunodeficiency syndrome . 
A novel primer extension method to detect the number of CAG repeats in the <START:ggp> androgen receptor gene <END> in families with X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy . 
X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) , an adult-onset form of motor neuron disease , was recently reported to be caused by amplification of the CAG repeats in the <START:ggp> androgen receptor gene <END> . 
We report here a simple and rapid strategy to detect the precise number of the CAGs . 
After the <START:ggp> DNA fragment <END> containing the <START:ggp> CAG repeats <END> is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction , a primer extension is carried out ; the extension of the <START:ggp> end-labelled reverse primer <END> adjacent to <START:ggp> 3 ' end <END> of <START:ggp> CAG repeats <END> stops at the first T after <START:ggp> CAG repeats <END> with the incorporation of dideoxy ATP in the reaction mixture . 
The resultant <START:ggp> primer products <END> are analysed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography . 
This method could be quite useful to detect not only <START:ggp> CAG repeats <END> in SBMA but also other <START:ggp> polymorphic dinucleotide <END> and <START:ggp> trinucleotide repeats <END> . 
Cellular immune and cytokine pathways resulting in <START:ggp> tissue factor <END> expression and relevance to septic shock . 
Cells of monocyte lineage serve as <START:ana> effector cells <END> in the cellular immune response . 
In addition , they respond to LPS and cytokines with activation and expression of <START:ggp> inflammatory effector gene products <END> similar to those elicited by the antigen driven response . 
The response to antigen proceeds at the <START:ana> T helper cell <END> level through two independent forms of cellular collaboration , contact and <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> . 
We review the control of expression of the <START:ggp> Tissue Factor ( TF ) gene <END> and the function of the <START:ggp> TF protein <END> . 
The enhanced initiation of transcription of the TF gene appears to require engagement of a 56 bp <START:ggp> LPS Response Element <END> , an enhancer that is engaged by both <START:ggp> AP-1 type heterodimeric complexes <END> as well as <START:ggp> NF kappa B like heterodimeric complexes <END> . 
Dissociation of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> from <START:ggp> Ig kappa B <END> by cytokine and LPS stimulation , and possibly <START:ana> activated T cells <END> , may represent a common pathway to induction of the <START:ggp> TF and other inflammatory genes <END> . 
Enhancement of expression of <START:ggp> TF <END> is observed upon adhesion of Mo to <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> and extracellular matrix proteins , as well as upon engagement of <START:ggp> leukocyte integrins <END> . 
The biological effects that follow from expression of <START:ggp> TF <END> by vascular cells have been resolved by analysis of function aided by the use of <START:ggp> recombinant full length TF <END> and <START:ggp> truncated surface domain <END> of <START:ggp> TF <END> . 
The rules of assembly of the cognate ligands of <START:ggp> TF <END> , namely the <START:ggp> zymogen plasma factors VII <END> and the <START:ggp> serine protease factor VIIa <END> , with the <START:ggp> soluble surface domain <END> of <START:ggp> TF <END> in free solution , in the presence of phospholipid surfaces and cell surface and of the <START:ggp> anchored TF molecule <END> have been described . 
It is evident that assembly of the <START:ggp> surface domain <END> of <START:ggp> TF <END> with <START:ggp> VIIa <END> to form the binary <START:ggp> TF.VIIa complex <END> induces a significant increase in the Kcat of the <START:ggp> catalytic domain <END> of <START:ggp> VIIa <END> for small peptidyl substrates and more profoundly for <START:ggp> protein substrate <END> . 
This provides substantial evidence for an allosteric effect on the catalytic cleft of <START:ggp> VIIa <END> that is imparted by binding to <START:ggp> TF <END> , its cognate catalytic <START:ggp> cofactor <END> . 
It is also evident that the <START:ggp> TF.VIIa complex <END> is proteolytically active and can activate the <START:ggp> zymogen plasma factor X <END> to the <START:ggp> serine protease Xa <END> in free solution , inferring that extended substrate recognition by induced structural loci of the <START:ggp> TF.VIIa complex <END> are created from either or both proteins to constitute a <START:ggp> new recognition structure <END> . 
It is also evident that association of <START:ggp> X <END> with charged phospholipid surfaces enhances the proteolytic activation of this <START:ggp> zymogen <END> by increasing recognition and susceptibility of the sessile peptide bond deduced from the markedly decreased Km and increased Kcat . 
Phorbol ester reduces <START:ggp> constitutive nuclear NF kappa B <END> and inhibits HIV-1 production in <START:ana> mature human monocytic cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> is a potent mediator of specific gene expression in human monocytes and has been shown to play a role in transcription of the HIV-1 genome in promonocytic leukemias . 
There is little information available on the response of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> to <START:ggp> cytokines <END> in <START:ana> normal human monocytes <END> . 
We have used a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide derived from <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) long terminal repeat <END> , which contains a tandem repeat of the <START:ggp> NF kappa B binding sequence <END> , as a probe in a gel retardation assay to study this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
Using this assay , we have detected <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> in extracts of nuclei from <START:ana> normal human monocytes <END> . 
Treatment of <START:ana> normal monocytes <END> with 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) for 4-24 h caused the complete disappearance of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> from nuclear extracts of monocytes . 
A similar result was obtained with the <START:ana> mature monocytic leukemia cell line <END> <START:ana> THP-1 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> constitutive transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> SP1 <END> was unaffected by addition of TPA . 
The disappearance of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> from the nucleus was concentration dependent between 10 and 50 ng/ml of phorbol ester . 
In THP-1 cells , TPA also induced a new , <START:ggp> faster-migrating NF kappa B species <END> not induced in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine , but not cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor HA-1004 , also dramatically reduced constitutive levels of <START:ggp> nuclear NF kappa B <END> . 
Finally , TPA addition to <START:ana> monocytes <END> infected with HIV-1 inhibited HIV-1 replication , as determined by <START:ggp> reverse transcriptase <END> assays , in a concentration-dependent manner . 
These results are in striking contrast to the increase in nuclear <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> and HIV-1 replication induced by phorbol esters in <START:ana> promonocytic leukemia cells U937 <END> and <START:ana> HL-60 <END> , and emphasize the importance of studying <START:ggp> cytokine <END> regulation of HIV-1 in <START:ana> normal monocytes <END> . 
A mechanism for the antiinflammatory effects of corticosteroids : the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> regulates leukocyte adhesion to <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> and expression of <START:ggp> endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 <END> and <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule 1 <END> . 
Corticosteroids are the preeminent antiinflammatory agents although the molecular mechanisms that impart their efficacy have not been defined . 
The endothelium plays a critical role in inflammation by directing <START:ana> circulating leukocytes <END> into extravascular tissues by expressing <START:ggp> adhesive molecules <END> for <START:ana> leukocytes <END> [ e.g. , <START:ggp> endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ELAM-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> intercellular adhesion molecule 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ) ] . 
We therefore determined whether corticosteroids suppress inflammation by inhibiting endothelial expression of <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> for <START:ana> neutrophils <END> ( <START:ana> polymorphonuclear leukocytes <END> ) . 
Preincubation of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> with endotoxin [ lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , 1 microgram/ml ] led to a 4-fold increase in subsequent adherence of <START:ana> polymorphonuclear leukocytes <END> ( P < 0.0001 , n = 10 ) to <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> , an increase that was markedly attenuated when <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> were treated with dexamethasone ( IC50 < 1 nM , P < 0.0001 , n = 6 or 7 ) during preincubation with LPS . 
Moreover , the <START:ggp> steroid receptor <END> agonist cortisol ( 10 microM ) , but not its inactive metabolite tetrahydrocortisol ( 10 microM ) , diminished LPS-induced endothelial cell adhesiveness . 
Further evidence that the action of dexamethasone was mediated through ligation of <START:ggp> corticosteroid receptors <END> [ <START:ggp> human glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> hGRs <END> ) ] was provided by experiments utilizing the steroid antagonist RU-486 . 
RU-486 ( 10 microM ) , which prevents translocation of ligated <START:ggp> hGR <END> to the nucleus by inhibiting dissociation of <START:ggp> hGR <END> from heat shock protein 90 , completely aborted the effect of dexamethasone on adhesiveness of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> ( P < 0.0005 , n = 3 ) . 
Treatment of <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> with LPS ( 1 microgram/ml ) stimulated transcription of <START:ggp> ELAM-1 <END> , as shown by Northern blot analysis , and expression of <START:ggp> membrane-associated ELAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> , as shown by quantitative immunofluorescence ( both P < 0.001 , n = 9 ) . 
Dexamethasone markedly inhibited LPS-stimulated accumulation of mRNA for <START:ggp> ELAM-1 <END> and expression of <START:ggp> ELAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ( IC50 < 10 nM , both P < 0.001 , n = 4-9 ) ; inhibition of expression by dexamethasone was reversed by RU-486 ( both P < 0.005 , n = 4-6 ) . 
As in the adhesion studies , cortisol but not tetrahydrocortisol inhibited expression of <START:ggp> ELAM-1 <END> and <START:ggp> ICAM-1 <END> ( both P < 0.005 , n = 3 or 4 ) . 
In contrast , sodium salicylate ( 1 mM ) inhibited neither adhesion nor expression of these <START:ggp> adhesion molecules <END> . 
These studies suggest that antagonism by dexamethasone of <START:ggp> endotoxin <END> -induced inflammation is a specific instance of the general biological principle that the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> is a hormone-dependent regulator of transcription . 
<START:ggp> Pax-5 <END> encodes the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> BSAP <END> and is expressed in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> , the developing CNS , and adult testis . 
<START:ggp> BSAP <END> has been identified previously as a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> that is expressed at early , but not late , stages of B-cell differentiation . 
Biochemical purification and cDNA cloning has now revealed that <START:ggp> BSAP <END> belongs to the family of <START:ggp> paired domain proteins <END> . 
<START:ggp> BSAP <END> is encoded by the <START:ggp> Pax-5 gene <END> and has been highly conserved between human and mouse . 
An intact paired domain was shown to be both necessary and sufficient for DNA binding of <START:ggp> BSAP <END> . 
Binding studies with several <START:ggp> BSAP recognition sequences <END> demonstrated that the sequence specificity of <START:ggp> BSAP <END> differs from that of the distantly related <START:ggp> paired domain protein Pax-1 <END> . 
During embryogenesis , the <START:ggp> BSAP gene <END> is transiently expressed in the mesencephalon and spinal cord with a spatial and temporal expression pattern that is distinct from that of other <START:ggp> Pax genes <END> in the developing central nervous system ( CNS ) . 
Later , the expression of the <START:ggp> BSAP gene <END> shifts to the fetal liver where it correlates with the onset of B lymphopoiesis . 
<START:ggp> BSAP <END> expression persists in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> and is also seen in the testis of the adult mouse . 
All of this evidence indicates that the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> BSAP <END> may not only play an important role in B-cell differentiation but also in neural development and spermatogenesis . 
Cell cycle-dependent initiation and lineage-dependent abrogation of <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> expression in <START:ana> pure differentiating hematopoietic progenitors <END> . 
The programmed activation/repression of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in early hematopoietic differentiation has not yet been explored . 
The <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> is required for normal erythroid development and regulates <START:ggp> erythroid-expressed genes <END> in <START:ana> maturing erythroblasts <END> . 
We analyzed <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> expression in early human adult hematopoiesis by using an in vitro system in which `` pure '' <START:ana> early hematopoietic progenitors <END> are induced to gradual and synchronized differentiation selectively along the erythroid or granulocyte-macrophage pathway by differential treatment with hematopoietic growth factors . 
The <START:ggp> GATA-1 gene <END> , though virtually silent in <START:ana> quiescent progenitors <END> , is activated after entrance into the cell cycle upon stimulation with hematopoietic growth factors . 
Subsequently , increasing expression along the erythroid pathway contrasts with an abrupt downregulation in the <START:ana> granulocyte-macrophage lineage <END> . 
These results suggest a microenvironment-directed , two-step model for <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> expression in <START:ana> differentiating hematopoietic progenitors <END> that involves ( i ) cycle-dependent initiation and ( ii ) lineage-dependent maintenance or suppression . 
Hypothetically , on/off switches of <START:ggp> lineage-restricted transactivators <END> may underlie the binary fate decisions of <START:ana> hematopoietic progenitors <END> . 
Specific <START:ggp> NF-kappa B subunits <END> act in concert with <START:ggp> Tat <END> to stimulate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is a <START:ggp> protein complex <END> which functions in concert with the <START:ggp> tat-I gene product <END> to stimulate human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) transcription . 
To determine whether specific members of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B family <END> contribute to this effect , we have examined the abilities of different <START:ggp> NF-kappa B subunits <END> to act with <START:ggp> Tat-I <END> to stimulate transcription of HIV in <START:ana> Jurkat T-leukemia cells <END> . 
We have found that the <START:ggp> p49 ( 100 ) DNA binding subunit <END> , together with <START:ggp> p65 <END> , can act in concert with <START:ggp> Tat-I <END> to stimulate the expression of <START:ggp> HIV-CAT plasmid <END> . 
Little effect was observed with <START:ggp> 50-kDa forms <END> of <START:ggp> p105 <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> or <START:ggp> rel <END> , in combination with <START:ggp> p65 <END> or <START:ggp> full-length c-rel <END> , which do not stimulate the <START:ggp> HIV enhancer <END> in these cells . 
These findings suggest that the combination of <START:ggp> p49 ( 100 ) <END> and <START:ggp> p65 <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> can act in concert with the <START:ggp> tat-I gene product <END> to stimulate the synthesis of <START:ana> HIV RNA <END> . 
Stable expression of <START:ggp> HB24 <END> , a <START:ggp> diverged human homeobox gene <END> , in T lymphocytes induces genes involved in T cell activation and growth . 
A <START:ggp> diverged homeobox gene <END> , <START:ggp> HB24 <END> , which is known to be induced following lymphocyte activation , was introduced into <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> under the control of a <START:ggp> constitutive promoter <END> . 
Stable transfectants of <START:ggp> HB24 <END> were established that expressed high levels of <START:ana> HB24 mRNA <END> and possessed an altered phenotype suggestive of <START:ana> activated T cells <END> . 
A number of genes known to be induced following T cell activation and associated with cell growth were increased in the <START:ana> transfectants <END> , including <START:ggp> c-fos <END> , <START:ggp> c-myc <END> , <START:ggp> c-myb <END> , <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> , <START:ggp> lck <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> ) . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> expression by transient transfection of <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha promoter constructs <END> into the <START:ana> HB24 transfectants <END> revealed constitutive expression ( about 60 % of <START:ana> phytohemagglutinin- and phorbol ester-activated Jurkat cells <END> ) that was dependent on the <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha promoter <END> . 
Furthermore , as a consequence of the increased <START:ana> HB24 mRNA <END> levels , the <START:ana> Jurkat HB24 transfectants <END> proliferated more rapidly than <START:ana> control cell lines <END> . 
Thus , stable expression of <START:ggp> HB24 <END> confers an activation phenotype on a <START:ana> human T cell line <END> , implicating this gene as an important <START:ggp> transcriptional factor <END> during T cell activation and growth . 
Functional interaction between the two <START:ggp> zinc finger domains <END> of the <START:ggp> v-erb A oncoprotein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> v-erb A oncogene <END> of avian erythroblastosis virus is a mutated and virally transduced copy of a <START:ggp> host cell gene <END> encoding a <START:ggp> thyroid hormone receptor <END> . 
The protein expressed by the <START:ggp> v-erb A oncogene <END> binds to DNA and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of both the <START:ggp> thyroid hormone receptor <END> and the closely related <START:ggp> retinoic acid receptor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> v-erb A protein <END> has sustained two amino acid alterations within its <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> relative to that of <START:ggp> c-erb A <END> , one of which , at serine 61 , is known to be important for <START:ggp> v-erb A <END> function in the <START:ana> neoplastic cell <END> . 
We report here that the second alteration , at threonine 78 , also plays an important , although more indirect , role : alteration of the sequence at threonine 78 such that it resembles that of <START:ggp> c-erb A <END> can act as an intragenic suppressor and can partially restore function to a <START:ggp> v-erb A protein <END> rendered defective due to a mutation at <START:ggp> position 61 <END> . 
Threonine 78 lies within the <START:ggp> D-box <END> of the <START:ggp> v-erb A protein <END> , a region thought to mediate receptor-receptor dimerizations , and is not in physical proximity to the serine at <START:ggp> position 61 <END> . 
It therefore appears that an indirect interaction occurs between these two sites and that this interaction is crucial for <START:ggp> v-erb A <END> function . 
<START:ggp> cis-acting sequences <END> required for inducible <START:ggp> interleukin-2 enhancer <END> function bind a novel <START:ggp> Ets-related protein <END> , <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> . 
The recent definition of a consensus <START:ggp> DNA binding sequence <END> for the <START:ggp> Ets family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> has allowed the identification of potential <START:ggp> Ets binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> promoters <END> and <START:ggp> enhancers <END> of many <START:ggp> inducible T-cell genes <END> . 
In the studies described in this report , we have identified two potential <START:ggp> Ets binding sites <END> , EBS1 and <START:ggp> EBS2 <END> , which are conserved in both the <START:ggp> human and murine interleukin-2 enhancers <END> . 
Within the <START:ggp> human enhancer <END> , these two sites are located within the previously defined <START:ggp> DNase I <END> footprints , <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NFIL-2B <END> , respectively . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift and methylation interference analyses demonstrated that EBS1 and <START:ggp> EBS2 <END> are essential for the formation of the <START:ggp> NFAT-1 and NFIL-2B nuclear protein complexes <END> . 
Furthermore , in vitro mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that inducible <START:ggp> interleukin-2 enhancer <END> function requires the presence of either EBS1 or <START:ggp> EBS2 <END> . 
Two well-characterized <START:ggp> Ets family members <END> , <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Ets-2 <END> , are reciprocally expressed during T-cell activation . 
Surprisingly , however , neither of these proteins bound in vitro to EBS1 or <START:ggp> EBS2 <END> . 
We therefore screened a <START:ggp> T-cell cDNA <END> library under low-stringency conditions with a probe from the <START:ggp> DNA binding domain <END> of <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> and isolated a <START:ggp> novel Ets family member <END> , <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> contains a <START:ggp> DNA binding domain <END> that is nearly identical to that of <START:ggp> E74 <END> , the <START:ggp> ecdysone-inducible Drosophila transcription factor <END> required for metamorphosis ( hence the name <START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> , for <START:ggp> E74-like factor 1 <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> Elf-1 <END> bound specifically to both EBS1 and <START:ggp> EBS2 <END> in electrophoretic mobility shift assays . 
It also bound to the <START:ggp> purine-rich CD3R element <END> from the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 2 long terminal repeat <END> , which is required for inducible virus expression in response to signalling through the <START:ggp> T-cell receptor <END> . 
Taken together , these results demonstrate that <START:ggp> multiple Ets family members <END> with apparently distinct DNA binding specificities regulate differential gene expression in <START:ana> resting and activated T cells <END> . 
Binding of <START:ggp> erythroid and non-erythroid nuclear proteins <END> to the <START:ggp> silencer <END> of the <START:ggp> human epsilon-globin-encoding gene <END> . 
To clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the developmental control of <START:ggp> hemoglobin-encoding genes <END> we have been studying the expression of these <START:ggp> genes <END> in <START:ana> human cells <END> in continuous culture . 
We have previously reported the presence of a <START:ggp> transcriptional control element <END> with the properties of a <START:ggp> silencer <END> extending from <START:ggp> -392 to -177 bp <END> relative to the <START:ggp> cap site <END> of the <START:ggp> human epsilon-globin-encoding gene <END> [ Cao et al. , Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 86 ( 1989 ) 5306-5309 ] . 
We also showed that this <START:ggp> silencer <END> has stronger inhibitory activity in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , as compared to <START:ana> K562 human erythroleukemia cells <END> . 
Using <START:ggp> deletion mutants <END> and cis-cloned synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides in transient expression assays , nucleotide sequences responsible for this effect have now been further delimited to 44 bp located from <START:ggp> -294 to -251 bp <END> . 
Gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays and <START:ggp> DNaseI <END> footprinting assays demonstrate that these negative regulatory sequences are recognized differently by proteins present in nuclear extracts obtained from <START:ana> HeLa <END> and <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
Two binding proteins are detected in K562 nuclear extracts , while only one is found in extracts from <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
Possible mechanisms by which these proteins may regulate transcription of the <START:ggp> epsilon-globin-encoding gene <END> in <START:ana> erythroid and non-erythroid cells <END> are discussed . 
Calcitriol : a hematolymphopoietrope ? [ editorial ] 
A MEDLINE search of the English-language literature was conducted using the indexing terms 'immunology , calcitriol and vitamin D ' to identify studies indicating a role for calcitriol as a primary immunomodulator . 
Sixty-six papers published between January 1956 and June 1991 were identified . 
Forty-five of these reports are cited in this review . 
The data strongly suggest an endocrine , autocrine and/or paracrine role for calcitriol in immune regulation . 
No unifying hypothesis has yet emerged explaining this collection of data . 
This paper provides a brief review of immune properties currently attributed to calcitriol . 
Transcription of the <START:ggp> hypersensitive site HS2 enhancer <END> in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> . 
In the <START:ggp> human genome <END> , the <START:ggp> erythroid-specific hypersensitive site HS2 enhancer <END> regulates the transcription of the <START:ggp> downstream beta-like globin genes <END> <START:ggp> 10-50 kilobases <END> away . 
The mechanism of <START:ggp> HS2 enhancer <END> function is not known . 
The present study employs RNA protection assays to analyze the transcriptional status of the <START:ggp> HS2 enhancer <END> in <START:ggp> transfected recombinant chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) plasmids <END> . 
In <START:ana> erythroid K562 cells <END> in which the <START:ggp> HS2 enhancer <END> is active , the <START:ggp> HS2 sequence <END> directs the synthesis of long enhancer transcripts that are initiated apparently from within the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> and elongated through the intervening DNA into the <START:ggp> cis-linked CAT gene <END> . 
In <START:ana> nonerythroid HL-60 cells <END> in which the <START:ggp> HS2 enhancer <END> is inactive , <START:ana> long enhancer transcripts <END> are not detectable . 
Splitting the <START:ggp> HS2 enhancer <END> between two <START:ggp> tandem Ap1 sites <END> abolishes the synthesis of a group of <START:ana> long enhancer transcripts <END> and results in loss of enhancer function and transcriptional silencing of the cis-linked CAT gene . 
In directing the synthesis of <START:ana> RNA <END> through the intervening <START:ggp> DNA <END> and the gene by a tracking and transcription mechanism , the <START:ggp> HS2 enhancer <END> may ( i ) open up the <START:ggp> chromatin structure <END> of a <START:ggp> gene domain <END> and ( ii ) deliver <START:ggp> enhancer binding proteins <END> to the promoter sequence where they may stimulate the transcription of the gene at the <START:ggp> cap site <END> . 
Characterization of a <START:ggp> novel T lymphocyte protein <END> which binds to a site related to <START:ggp> steroid/thyroid hormone receptor response elements <END> in the <START:ggp> negative regulatory sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat <END> . 
We have previously identified a <START:ggp> T lymphocyte protein <END> which binds to a site within the <START:ggp> LTR <END> of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) and exerts an inhibitory effect on virus gene expression . 
The <START:ggp> palindromic site <END> ( <START:ggp> site B <END> ) recognized by this protein is related to the <START:ggp> palindromic binding sites <END> of members of the <START:ggp> steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family <END> . 
Here we characterize the <START:ggp> T cell protein <END> binding to this site as a 100 kD protein which is most abundant in <START:ana> T cells <END> and which binds to <START:ggp> site B <END> as a <START:ggp> 200 kD complex <END> . 
This protein is distinct from other members of the <START:ggp> steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family <END> including the <START:ggp> COUP protein <END> which has a closely related DNA binding specificity . 
<START:ggp> TAR <END> -independent transactivation by <START:ggp> Tat <END> in cells derived from the CNS : a novel mechanism of HIV-1 gene regulation . 
The <START:ggp> Tat protein <END> of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is essential for productive infection and is a potential target for antiviral therapy . 
<START:ggp> Tat <END> , a potent activator of HIV-1 gene expression , serves to greatly increase the rate of transcription directed by the <START:ggp> viral promoter <END> . 
This induction , which seems to be an important component in the progression of acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , may be due to increased transcriptional initiation , increased transcriptional elongation , or a combination of these processes . 
Much attention has been focused on the interaction of <START:ggp> Tat <END> with a specific <START:ana> RNA target <END> termed <START:ana> TAR <END> ( <START:ana> transactivation responsive <END> ) which is present in the leader sequence of all <START:ana> HIV-1 mRNAs <END> . 
This interaction is believed to be an important component of the mechanism of transactivation . 
In this report we demonstrate that in certain <START:ana> CNS-derived cells <END> <START:ggp> Tat <END> is capable of activating HIV-1 through a <START:ggp> TAR <END> -independent pathway . 
A <START:ggp> Tat-responsive element <END> is found upstream within the <START:ggp> viral promoter <END> that in <START:ana> glial-derived cell lines <END> allows transactivation in the absence of <START:ana> TAR <END> . 
Deletion mapping and <START:ggp> hybrid promoter constructs <END> demonstrate that the newly identified <START:ggp> Tat-responsive element <END> corresponds to a sequence within the <START:ggp> viral long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) previously identified as the <START:ggp> HIV-1 enhancer <END> , or <START:ggp> NF-kappa B domain <END> . 
DNA band-shift analysis reveals <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity in glial cells that differs from that present in <START:ana> T lymphoid cells <END> . 
Further , we observe that <START:ggp> TAR-deleted mutants <END> of HIV-1 demonstrate normal late gene expression in <START:ana> glial cells <END> as evidenced by syncytia formation and production of <START:ggp> viral p24 antigen <END> .

<START:ggp> Transcription factor AP-2 <END> activates gene expression of HTLV-I . 
The <START:ggp> HTLV-I LTR <END> contains three conserved <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> known as <START:ggp> 21 base pair repeats <END> which are required for stimulation of gene expression by the <START:ggp> transactivator protein <END> <START:ggp> tax <END> . 
Mutagenesis indicates that the <START:ggp> 21 bp repeats <END> can be subdivided into three motifs , A , B and C , each of which influences the level of <START:ggp> tax <END> activation . 
The <START:ggp> A site <END> in the <START:ggp> 21 bp repeat <END> has strong homology with previously described <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for the <START:ggp> transcription factor AP-2 <END> . 
We demonstrated that <START:ana> AP-2 mRNA <END> was present in <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> and that cellular factors from both non-transformed and transformed <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> specifically bound to the <START:ggp> consensus motif <END> for <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> in each 21 bp . 
To determine the role of <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> in the regulation of the <START:ggp> HTLV-I LTR <END> gene expression , we used an <START:ggp> AP-2 cDNA <END> in DNA binding and transient expression assays . 
Gel retardation and methylation interference studies revealed that <START:ggp> bacterially produced AP-2 <END> bound specifically and with high affinity to all three <START:ggp> 21 bp repeats <END> , and that it required the <START:ggp> core sequence <END> AGGC for specific binding . 
Binding of <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> prevented the subsequent binding of members of the <START:ggp> CREB/ATF family <END> to an <START:ggp> adjacent regulatory motif <END> in the <START:ggp> 21 bp repeat <END> . 
Transfection of an <START:ggp> AP-2 expression construct <END> into <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> activated gene expression from the <START:ggp> HTLV-I LTR <END> . 
At least two <START:ggp> 21 bp repeats <END> were required for high levels of <START:ggp> AP-2 <END> activation and mutagenesis of the <START:ggp> AP-2 consensus binding sequences <END> in the <START:ggp> 21 bp repeats <END> eliminate this activation . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Activation of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer <END> is not dependent on <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> . 
The function of a <START:ggp> putative NFAT-1 site <END> in the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer <END> has been analyzed . 
Activation by the <START:ggp> T-cell antigen receptor <END> is minimal in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> and is mediated by the <START:ggp> kappa B sites <END> . 
The <START:ggp> putative NFAT-1 region <END> is not required for the response to <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> or to <START:ggp> mitogens <END> in <START:ana> T-cell <END> , <START:ana> B-cell <END> , or <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage leukemia lines <END> , nor is it a <START:ggp> cis-acting negative regulatory element <END> . 
The <START:ggp> B cell-specific nuclear factor <END> <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> positively regulates transcription of the <START:ggp> human class II transplantation gene <END> , <START:ggp> DRA <END> . 
The promoter of the <START:ggp> major histocompatibility class II gene <END> <START:ggp> DRA <END> contains an <START:ggp> octamer element <END> ( ATTTGCAT ) that is required for efficient <START:ggp> DRA <END> expression in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Several <START:ggp> DNA-binding proteins <END> are known to bind this sequence . 
The best characterized are the <START:ggp> B cell-specific OTF-2 <END> and the ubiquitous <START:ggp> OTF-1 <END> . 
This report directly demonstrates that <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> but not <START:ggp> OTF-1 <END> regulates the <START:ggp> DRA gene <END> . 
In vitro transcription analysis using protein fractions enriched for the octamer-binding protein <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> demonstrate a positive functional role for <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> in <START:ggp> DRA gene <END> transcription . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> OTF-1 <END> -enriched protein fractions did not affect <START:ggp> DRA gene <END> transcription although it functionally enhanced the transcription of another gene . 
<START:ggp> Recombinant OTF-2 protein <END> produced by in vitro transcription/translation could also enhance <START:ggp> DRA gene <END> transcription in vitro . 
In vivo transient transfection studies utilizing an <START:ggp> OTF-2 expression vector <END> resulted in similar findings : that <START:ggp> OTF-2 protein <END> enhanced <START:ggp> DRA gene <END> transcription , and that this effect requires an intact <START:ggp> octamer element <END> . 
Together these results constitute the first direct evidence of a positive role for the <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific octamer-binding factor <END> in DRA gene transcription . 
<START:ggp> Interferon-gamma <END> potentiates the antiviral activity and the expression of <START:ggp> interferon-stimulated genes <END> induced by <START:ana> interferon-alpha in U937 cells <END> . 
Binding of <START:ggp> type I interferon ( IFN-alpha/beta ) to specific receptors <END> results in the rapid transcriptional activation , independent of protein synthesis , of <START:ggp> IFN-alpha-stimulated genes <END> ( <START:ggp> ISGs <END> ) in <START:ana> human fibroblasts <END> and <START:ana> HeLa <END> and <START:ana> Daudi cell lines <END> . 
The binding of <START:ggp> ISGF3 <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 <END> ) to the conserved <START:ggp> IFN-stimulated response element <END> ( <START:ggp> ISRE <END> ) results in transcriptional activation . 
This factor is composed of a <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> ISGF3 gamma <END> ) , which normally is present in the cytoplasm , and other <START:ggp> IFN-alpha-activated proteins <END> which preexist as <START:ggp> latent cytoplasmic precursors <END> ( <START:ggp> ISGF3 alpha <END> ) . 
We have found that ISG expression in the <START:ana> monocytic U937 cell line <END> differs from most <START:ana> cell lines <END> previously examined . 
<START:ana> U937 cells <END> express both <START:ggp> type I and type II IFN receptors <END> , but only <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> is capable of inducing antiviral protection in these cells . 
Pretreatment with <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> potentiates the <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> -induced protection , but <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> alone does not have any antiviral activity . 
<START:ana> ISG15 mRNA <END> accumulation in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> is not detectable before 6 h of <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> treatment , peaks at 24 h , and requires protein synthesis . 
Although <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> alone does not induce ISG expression , <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> pretreatment markedly increases and hastens ISG expression and transcriptional induction . 
Nuclear extracts assayed for the presence of <START:ggp> ISRE binding factors <END> by electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that <START:ggp> ISGF3 <END> is induced by <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> within 6 h from undetectable basal levels in untreated <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> ISGF3 alpha <END> , the latent component of <START:ggp> ISGF3 <END> , occurs rapidly . 
However , the increase in <START:ggp> ISGF3 <END> activity ultimately correlates with the accumulation of <START:ggp> ISGF3 gamma <END> induced by <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> or <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Single point estimation of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> of normal subjects and of children under long term glucocorticoid treatment . 
A single point assay of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) in human <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> based on the measurement of specific dexamethasone binding has been developed and compared with a common multi-point Scatchard analysis . 
The assay conditions-concentration of the ligand 20 nmol/l , incubation time 2 h and the cell count 2-6 mil . 
cells/tube in the assay volume 0.25 ml were found to be optimal . 
An attempt was also undertaken to use a cell harvester for the separation of cells from unbound ligand . 
Though specifically bound dexamethasone measured by whole-cell assay and that using cell harvester correlated well , almost by one order lower values obtained with the latter method render it non-applicable for receptor quantitation . 
The results from 9 healthy volunteers ( average <START:ggp> GR <END> concentration 7131 +/- 1256 sites/cell ) correlated excellently with those obtained by the Scatchard analysis . 
The single point assay has been also applied for determination of GH in 10 children treated with large doses of prednisone . 
The average values from healthy volunteers did not differ significantly from those found in these children , though much broader range was found in patients . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptor <END> and inhibition of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake by glucocorticoids in <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocytes <END> from normal humans : correlation between receptor level and hormone effect in vitro . 
We have measured the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> concentration in <START:ana> mononuclear <END> and <START:ana> polymorphonuclear leukocytes <END> , both of which were isolated from peripheral blood from ten healthy male volunteers . 
In parallel , the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake was assayed in the corresponding <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> levels in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> correlated with those in <START:ana> polymorphonuclear leukocytes <END> , and there was a linear relationship between the cellular <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> levels and glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of the uptake of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> . 
When <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> were incubated in the presence of 8-bromo-cAMP , cellular <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> levels increased and a more pronounced inhibitory effect of dexamethasone was observed on the transport of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose . 
We conclude that the cellular <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> levels in <START:ana> peripheral blood leukocytes <END> reflect in vitro responsiveness to glucocorticoids in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> from healthy males , and that the individual responsiveness may alter upon changes in the cellular levels of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor <END> activation and functional stimulation of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Activation of expression of <START:ggp> genes <END> encoding <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> : <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and formation of <START:ggp> AP1 transcriptional complex <END> in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> was investigated . 
It was found that lipopolysaccharide induced strongly both <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression as well as <START:ggp> AP1 <END> formation . 
<START:ggp> Interferon gamma <END> activated strongly <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and weakly <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and <START:ggp> AP1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tumor necrosis factor <END> induced slightly <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and had almost no effect on <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and <START:ggp> AP1 <END> . 
The data suggest that differences in functional responses elicited in <START:ana> monocytes <END> by all three <START:ggp> factors <END> may be dependent on different routes on nuclear signalling employed by the <START:ggp> factors <END> . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> interleukin-1 beta <END> production by glucocorticoids in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> : the mechanism of action depends on the activation signal . 
Glucocorticoids are known to downregulate <START:ggp> interleukin-1 beta <END> production in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> by two different mechanims : direct inhibition of the gene transcription and destabilization of the preformed <START:ana> interleukin-1 beta mRNA <END> . 
Now we have examined the effect of the nature of the monocyte activating signal on these two inhibitory mechanims . 
When <START:ana> human monocytes <END> were preincubated with dexamethasone for 1 hour and then stimulated either with bacterial lipopolysaccharide or phorbol myristate , it was found that dexamethasone inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced <START:ggp> interleukin-1 beta <END> protein production , but the phorbol myristate-induced production was increased 3-10 fold . 
This difference was also seen at the mRNA level . 
When dexamethasone was added to the cultures 3 hours after the stimulators , it clearly decreased the <START:ana> interleukin-1 beta mRNA <END> levels regardless of the stimulator used ( although the effect was clearly weaker on the <START:ana> PMA-induced mRNA <END> ) . 
Thus these data suggest that the phorbol myristate-induced signal ( prolonged <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> activation ? ) can not be inhibited by prior incubation with dexamethasone and it also protects the <START:ana> induced mRNA <END> for the degradative action of dexamethasone . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear transcription factors <END> that bind to elements of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> . 
Induction requirements in <START:ana> primary human T cells <END> . 
Prior studies have identified several elements that contribute to the activity of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> in the stimulated <START:ana> T cell line <END> , <START:ana> Jurkat <END> . 
The sites and their corresponding nuclear binding factors include : <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> AP-3 <END> , <START:ggp> OCT-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
The latter `` <START:ggp> nuclear factor for activated T cells <END> `` likely contributes to the tissue specificity of <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> expression . 
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we have studied these <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in <START:ana> primary T cells <END> from human blood to verify their presence in a physiologic setting and to identify the signals that stimulate factor activity . 
All factors are induced in the nuclei of <START:ana> T cells <END> upon activation with <START:ggp> mitogens <END> but not with <START:ggp> exogenous IL-2 growth factor <END> . 
However , the signaling requirements and sensitivity to protein synthesis inhibitors differ considerably . 
Only the activities for <START:ggp> NF-AT and AP-1 sites <END> require two signals for optimal induction , i.e. , PMA plus either <START:ggp> lectin <END> or <START:ggp> antibody <END> to the <START:ggp> CD3 <END> or <START:ggp> CD28 surface molecules <END> . 
Other factors are induced by <START:ggp> lectin <END> , <START:ggp> antibody <END> , and/or PMA alone . 
After appropriate stimulation , both <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> are peculiarly sensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin . 
Our data correlate the activity of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> and <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> in gel shift assays with the two signals requirements for <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> expression . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity in <START:ana> T cells <END> stably expressing the <START:ggp> Tax protein <END> of human T cell lymphotropic virus type I . 
The effect of constitutive <START:ggp> Tax <END> expression on the interaction of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> with its <START:ggp> recognition sequence <END> and on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -dependent gene expression was examined in <START:ana> T lymphoid Jurkat cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> 19D <END> and <START:ana> 9J <END> ) stably transformed with a <START:ggp> Tax expression vector <END> . 
<START:ana> Tax expressing T cell lines <END> contained a constitutive level of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity , detectable by mobility shift assay and uv cross-linking using a <START:ggp> palindromic NF-kappa B probe <END> homologous to the <START:ggp> interferon beta PRDII site <END> . 
In Jurkat and NC2.10 induction with phorbol esters resulted in the appearance of new <START:ggp> DNA binding proteins <END> of <START:ggp> 85 , 75 , and 54 kDa <END> , whereas in <START:ana> Tax expressing cells <END> the <START:ggp> 85-kDa protein <END> and a <START:ggp> 92-kDa DNA binding protein <END> were constitutively induced . 
Expression of <START:ggp> Tax protein <END> in <START:ana> 19D <END> and <START:ana> 9J <END> resulted in transcription of the <START:ggp> endogenous NF-kappa B-dependent granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor gene <END> and increased basal level expression of transfected <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-regulated promoters <END> . 
Nonetheless transcription of both the endogenous and the transfected gene was inducible by PMA treatment . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> expression in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> may alter the stoichiometry of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> DNA binding proteins <END> and thus change the expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-regulated promoters <END> . 
A <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-GM2 <END> that interacts with a <START:ggp> regulatory region <END> of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> essential for its induction in responses to T-cell activation : purification from human <START:ana> T-cell leukemia line Jurkat cells <END> and similarity to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> by antigen , <START:ggp> lectin <END> , or a combination of phorbol-12-myristate acetate ( PMA ) and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) leads to the induction of genes for a set of <START:ggp> lymphokines <END> , including <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) . 
We demonstrated in earlier studies that the <START:ggp> upstream region <END> of the <START:ggp> mouse GM-CSF promoter <END> at positions between <START:ggp> -95 and -73 <END> is essential for transcriptional activation in response to PMA/A23187 . 
This region contains two <START:ggp> DNA-binding motifs <END> , <START:ggp> GM2 <END> and <START:ggp> GC-box <END> . 
The <START:ggp> GM2 sequence <END> ( GGTAGTTCCC ) is recognized by an <START:ggp> inducible factor NF-GM2 <END> ; the other ( CCGCCC ) by <START:ggp> constitutive factors <END> <START:ggp> A1 <END> , <START:ggp> A2 <END> , and <START:ggp> B <END> . 
To elucidate the mechanism of <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> gene activation , we have purified the <START:ggp> inducible factor NF-GM2 <END> from the nuclear extract of stimulated <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> on the basis of specific DNA-binding activity . 
The purified <START:ggp> NF-GM2 <END> consists of 50 ( <START:ggp> p50 <END> ) and 65 kDa ( <START:ggp> p65 <END> ) polypeptides and has a binding activity specific for both the <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> and <START:ggp> immunoglobulin kappa ( GGAAAGTCCC ) enhancers <END> . 
Electrophoretically purified <START:ggp> p50 <END> alone can form a <START:ggp> protein-DNA complex <END> , but in the mixture , <START:ggp> p50 <END> associates preferentially with <START:ggp> p65 <END> to form the <START:ggp> NF-GM2 complex <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> p65 <END> gave per se , with low affinity , a <START:ggp> protein-DNA complex <END> that migrated more slowly than native <START:ggp> NF-GM2 complex <END> . 
Furthermore , an antiserum against <START:ggp> KBF1 <END> ( identical to <START:ggp> 50 kDa NF-kappa B protein <END> ) reacted with the <START:ggp> p50 <END> of <START:ggp> NF-GM2 <END> , indicating that the <START:ggp> NF-GM2 polypeptide <END> can not be immunologically differentiated from the <START:ggp> 50 kDa subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
The purified <START:ggp> NF-GM2 <END> activated in vitro transcription from the <START:ggp> kappa B enhancer <END> , while it failed to stimulate transcription from the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> harboring the GM2 sequence . 
This suggests that the activation mechanism of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> through the <START:ggp> GM2/GC-box sequence <END> is different from that of genes carrying the <START:ggp> kappa B enhancer <END> alone . 
Characterization of an <START:ggp> immediate-early gene <END> induced in <START:ana> adherent monocytes <END> that encodes <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> -like activity . 
We have cloned a group of <START:ggp> cDNAs <END> representing <START:ana> mRNAs <END> that are rapidly induced following adherence of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
One of the induced transcripts ( <START:ana> MAD-3 <END> ) encodes a protein of 317 amino acids with one domain containing <START:ggp> five tandem repeats <END> of the <START:ggp> cdc10/ankyrin motif <END> , which is 60 % similar ( 46 % identical ) to the <START:ggp> ankyrin repeat region <END> of the precursor of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/KBF1 p50 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> C-terminus <END> has a putative <START:ggp> protein kinase C phosphorylation site <END> . 
In vitro translated <START:ggp> MAD-3 protein <END> was found to specifically inhibit the DNA-binding activity of the <START:ggp> p50/p65 NF-kappa B complex <END> but not that of the <START:ggp> p50/p50 KBF1 factor <END> or of other <START:ggp> DNA-binding proteins <END> . 
The <START:ggp> MAD-3 cDNA <END> encodes an <START:ggp> I kappa B-like protein <END> that is likely to be involved in regulation of transcriptional responses to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , including adhesion-dependent pathways of monocyte activation . 
Cortivazol mediated induction of <START:ana> glucocorticoid receptor messenger ribonucleic acid <END> in <START:ana> wild-type <END> and <START:ana> dexamethasone-resistant human leukemic ( CEM ) cells <END> . 
Cortivazol is a phenylpyrazolo glucocorticoid of high potency and unusual structure . 
In both <START:ana> wild-type <END> and highly <START:ana> dexamethasone ( dex ) -resistant clones <END> of the <START:ana> human leukemic cell line CEM <END> , exposure to cortivazol leads to cell death . 
It has been shown recently that in <START:ana> wild-type CEM cells <END> but not in a <START:ana> dex-resistant , glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) -defective clone <END> <START:ana> ICR-27 TK-3 <END> , dex induces <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> . 
To test the hypothesis that cortivazol acts in <START:ana> dex-resistant cells <END> by making use of the residual <START:ggp> GR <END> found there , wild-type and <START:ana> dex-resistant clones <END> were treated with various concentrations of cortivazol and induction of <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> was studied . 
Cortivazol significantly induced <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> in the <START:ana> normal CEM-C7 <END> as well as in two classes of <START:ana> dex-resistant clones <END> , although the <START:ana> dex-resistant clones <END> needed at least 10 times more cortivazol than the <START:ana> normal cells <END> for significant <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> induction . 
Increased levels of <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> were noticed as early as 3 h after treatment . 
A general correlation between induction of <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> and lysis of the normal and <START:ana> dex-resistant cells <END> was found . 
Positive induction of <START:ana> GR mRNA <END> might be one of the earliest crucial steps in the lysis of <START:ana> normal and dex-resistant CEM cells <END> , or might serve as a marker for the process . 
However , the lysis pathway in the <START:ana> dex-resistant cells <END> is defective in that <START:ana> dex-resistant clones <END> needed significantly more cortivazol than the <START:ana> normal cells <END> for lysis of the cells . 
<START:ggp> HIV enhancer <END> activity perpetuated by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> induction on infection of <START:ana> monocytes <END> [ see comments ] 
Permissiveness to replication of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) differs in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
In <START:ana> T cells <END> , HIV transcription is poorly detected in vivo . 
Cloned , normal <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> show very little , if any , basal activity of the <START:ggp> HIV enhancer <END> and low nuclear expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , a <START:ggp> potent transcriptional activator <END> of the <START:ggp> HIV enhancer <END> . 
In contrast , fixed tissue <START:ana> macrophages <END> express detectable <START:ggp> HIV proteins <END> , indicating permanent virus transcription . 
One explanation for the perpetuation of virus infection in <START:ana> macrophages <END> could be sustained nuclear <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> expression . 
However , the <START:ana> U937 monocytic cell line <END> , which is fully permissive to HIV replication , is known to express only low levels of <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kappa B <END> . 
We show here that chronic HIV infection results in both induction of a <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> with antigenic properties indistinguishable from those of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and permanently increased <START:ggp> HIV enhancer <END> activity . 
This phenomenon , which is independent of <START:ggp> tumour necrosis factor <END> , is associated with HIV replication , and is thus likely to explain at least in part the perpetuation of HIV infection in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Isolation of a <START:ggp> rel-related human cDNA <END> that potentially encodes the <START:ggp> 65-kD subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> [ published erratum appears in Science 1991 Oct 4 ; 254 ( 5028 ) : 11 ] 
A <START:ggp> DNA probe <END> that spanned a domain conserved among the <START:ggp> proto-oncogene c-rel <END> , the <START:ggp> Drosophila morphogen dorsal <END> , and the <START:ggp> p50 DNA binding subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was generated from <START:ggp> Jurkat T cell complementary DNA <END> with the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and degenerate oligonucleotides . 
This probe was used to identify a <START:ggp> rel-related complementary DNA <END> that hybridized to a <START:ana> 2.6-kilobase messenger RNA <END> present in <START:ana> human T and B lymphocytes <END> . 
In vitro transcription and translation of the <START:ggp> complementary DNA <END> resulted in the synthesis of a protein with an apparent molecular size of <START:ggp> 65 kilodaltons <END> ( kD ) . 
The translated protein showed weak DNA binding with a specificity for the kappa B binding motif . 
This <START:ggp> protein-DNA complex <END> comigrated with the complex obtained with the <START:ggp> purified human p65 NF-kappa B subunit <END> and binding was inhibited by <START:ggp> I kappa B-alpha <END> and -beta proteins . 
In addition , the <START:ggp> 65-kD protein <END> associated with the <START:ggp> p50 subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and the <START:ggp> kappa B probe <END> to form a complex with the same electrophoretic mobility as the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-DNA complex <END> . 
Therefore the <START:ggp> rel-related 65-kD protein <END> may represent the <START:ggp> p65 subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> active NF-kappa B transcription factor complex <END> . 
The <START:ana> human myelomonocytic cell line U-937 <END> as a model for studying alterations in steroid-induced monokine gene expression : marked enhancement of <START:ana> lipopolysaccharide-stimulated interleukin-1 beta messenger RNA <END> levels by 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 . 
The active metabolite of vitamin D , 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 ] , is a potent regulator of human monocyte/macrophage function in vitro . 
To establish a model for 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 regulation of human monocyte monokine synthesis , three <START:ana> human cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> U-937 <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 <END> , and <START:ana> HL-60 <END> ) were examined for : 1 ) the presence of functional 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 receptors ; 2 ) the accumulation of <START:ana> interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 beta ) mRNA <END> and <START:ggp> IL-1 beta protein <END> in response to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ; and 3 ) the regulation of this response by 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 . 
All three cell lines expressed vitamin D receptor and had increased levels of <START:ana> IL-1 beta mRNA <END> in response to LPS . 
Preincubation of cells with 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 augmented <START:ana> IL-1 beta mRNA <END> levels only in <START:ana> U-937 <END> and <START:ana> HL-60 <END> cells . 
From these data , and taking into consideration their state of differentiation and relative ease of culture , <START:ana> U-937 <END> was chosen over <START:ana> HL-60 <END> and <START:ana> THP-1 <END> as the cell line we further characterized . 
In <START:ana> U-937 cells <END> , optimum time and dose of pretreatment with 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 were determined to be 12-24 h at a receptor saturating concentration of 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 ( 10 nM ) . 
Preincubation of cells with 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 had no effect on the time course of <START:ana> IL-1 beta mRNA <END> appearance in response to LPS . 
However , exposure of <START:ana> U-937 cells <END> to 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 increased by 200 % the level of <START:ana> IL-1 beta mRNA <END> detected and decreased by three orders of magnitude the concentration of LPS required to achieve steady state mRNA levels equivalent to those observed in <START:ana> U-937 cells <END> not preincubated with the hormone.2+o 
Regulation of <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> expression by <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> : role of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> and <START:ggp> transcription factor NF kappa B <END> . 
<START:ggp> Macrophage-colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> ) , also referred to as <START:ggp> CSF-1 <END> , regulates the survival , growth , differentiation and functional activity of <START:ana> monocytes <END> by binding to a single class of <START:ggp> high-affinity cell surface receptors <END> , known to be the product of the <START:ggp> c-fms protooncogene <END> . 
The detection of both M-CSF and c-fms expression by cells of the <START:ana> monocyte lineage <END> has suggested that <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> may act by an autocrine mechanism . 
Interestingly , it has been shown that <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> can induce the expression of its own gene . 
Although sensitivity to <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> can be modulated by regulation of receptor expression and function , <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> responsiveness is largely determined at a postreceptor level . 
To date , little is known about the intracellular pathway of <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> signal transduction . 
We have therefore investigated the changes in <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) activity upon exposure of <START:ana> monocytes <END> to <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> . 
We show that <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> activates and translocates <START:ggp> PKC <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> PKC <END> by the isoquinoline derivative H7 abolishes induction of <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> by <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> . 
Furthermore , activation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> was pertussis-toxin-sensitive and was associated with the detection of an <START:ggp> NF kappa B protein <END> in nuclear extracts of <START:ana> M-CSF-induced blood monocytes <END> but not in <START:ana> monocytes <END> exposed to medium treatment only . 
The results suggest that <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> induction of <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> involves <START:ggp> G proteins <END> , <START:ggp> PKC <END> and <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> . 
<START:ggp> Clone pAT 133 <END> identifies a gene that encodes another human member of a class of <START:ggp> growth factor-induced genes <END> with almost identical <START:ggp> zinc-finger domains <END> . 
We report the structure and regulation of a gene represented by <START:ggp> clone pAT 133 <END> , which is induced upon transition from a resting state ( G0 ) through the early phase of the cell cycle ( G1 ) . 
The <START:ggp> pAT 133 gene <END> is immediately induced , with <START:ggp> FOS <END> -like kinetics , in <START:ana> human T cells <END> and in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
Primary structure analysis showed that the encoded protein contains three <START:ggp> tandem zinc-finger sequences <END> of the type <START:ggp> Cys2-Xaa12-His2 <END> . 
This <START:ggp> zinc-finger region <END> , which is thought to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner , is similar ( greater than 80 % on the amino acid level ) to two previously described <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> pAT 225/EGR1 <END> and pAT <START:ggp> 591/EGR2 <END> . 
Except for the conserved <START:ggp> zinc-finger domains <END> , the <START:ggp> amino acid sequences <END> of the three proteins are distinct . 
This structural similarity suggests that the <START:ggp> pAT 133 gene <END> encodes a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> with a specific biological function . 
Comparing the regulation of these related <START:ggp> zinc-finger-encoding genes <END> showed coordinate induction upon mitogenic stimulation of <START:ana> resting T lymphocytes <END> and of <START:ana> resting fibroblasts <END> . 
However , upon transition from a proliferating ( G1 ) to a resting state of the cell cycle the three genes were differently regulated . 
In <START:ana> human histiocytic U937 cells mRNA <END> of clone pAT 133 was constitutively expressed , whereas <START:ana> mRNA <END> of <START:ggp> pAT 225/EGR1 <END> was induced upon induction of terminal differentiation . 
In contrast mRNA representing pAT <START:ggp> 591/EGR2 <END> was not expressed in these cells . 
This difference in gene regulation suggests distinct biological roles in the control of cell proliferation for the respective proteins . 
<START:ggp> v-erbA <END> overexpression is required to extinguish <START:ggp> c-erbA <END> function in <START:ana> erythroid cell <END> differentiation and regulation of the <START:ggp> erbA target gene <END> <START:ggp> CAII <END> . 
The <START:ggp> v-erbA oncoprotein <END> represents a retrovirus-transduced oncogenic version of the <START:ggp> thyroid hormone ( T3/T4 ) receptor <END> <START:ggp> c-erbA ( type alpha ) <END> . 
It contributes to virus-induced erythroleukemia by efficiently arresting differentiation of <START:ana> red cell progenitors <END> and by suppressing transcription of <START:ggp> erythrocyte-specific genes <END> . 
Here , we show that <START:ggp> v-erbA <END> and <START:ggp> c-erbA <END> bind directly to sequences within the <START:ggp> promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> erythrocyte-specific carbonic anhydrase II <END> ( <START:ggp> CAII <END> ) , a gene whose transcription is efficiently suppressed by <START:ggp> v-erbA <END> . 
This <START:ggp> erbA-binding site <END> confers thyroid hormone responsiveness to a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> in transient expression experiments and is a target for efficient down-regulation of <START:ggp> CAII <END> transcription by the <START:ggp> v-erbA oncoprotein <END> . 
In <START:ana> stably transformed erythroblasts <END> coexpressing the <START:ggp> v-erbA oncoprotein <END> and the <START:ggp> c-erbA/T3 receptor <END> at an approximately equimolar ratio , <START:ggp> c-erbA <END> activity is dominant over <START:ggp> v-erbA <END> . 
T3 efficiently induced erythroid differentiation in these cells , thus overcoming the <START:ggp> v-erbA <END> -mediated differentiation arrest . 
Likewise , T3 activated <START:ggp> CAII <END> transcription as well as transient expression of a <START:ggp> T3-responsive reporter gene <END> containing the <START:ggp> CAII-specific erbA-binding site <END> . 
The <START:ggp> c-erbA <END> -dependent activation of this <START:ggp> CAII reporter construct <END> could only be suppressed by very high amounts of <START:ggp> v-erbA <END> . 
Our results suggest that overexpression of <START:ggp> v-erbA <END> is required for its function as an <START:ggp> oncoprotein <END> . 
<START:ggp> Anti-CD2 receptor antibodies <END> activate the <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> CD2 T lymphocyte glycoprotein surface molecule <END> mediates both cell to cell adhesion and T cell activation , two processes that are involved in the spread of HIV infection . 
Treatment of <START:ana> chronically HIV-infected PBMC <END> with <START:ggp> anti-CD2 mAb <END> has been shown to induce the expression of infectious virus from these cultures . 
In this study we investigated the mechanisms whereby <START:ggp> anti-CD2 antibodies <END> stimulate viral production . 
We demonstrate that treatment of transiently transfected <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> with <START:ggp> anti-CD2 antibodies <END> results in activation of the <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> CAT <END> assays using mutated <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat-CAT constructs <END> and gel shift assays demonstrate that this activation is dependent on the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B enhancer <END> . 
These studies suggest that interaction of <START:ggp> CD2 <END> with its natural ligand , <START:ggp> LFA-3 <END> , may play a role in regulation of HIV expression . 
Reactive oxygen intermediates as apparently widely used messengers in the activation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B transcription factor <END> and HIV-1 . 
Hydrogen peroxide and oxygen radicals are agents commonly produced during inflammatory processes . 
In this study , we show that micromolar concentrations of H2O2 can induce the expression and replication of HIV-1 in a <START:ana> human T cell line <END> . 
The effect is mediated by the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> which is potently and rapidly activated by an H2O2 treatment of cells from its <START:ggp> inactive cytoplasmic form <END> . 
N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a well characterized antioxidant which counteracts the effects of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) in living cells , prevented the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by H2O2 . 
NAC and other thiol compounds also blocked the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by cycloheximide , <START:ana> double-stranded RNA <END> , calcium ionophore , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , active phorbol ester , <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> , lipopolysaccharide and <START:ggp> lectin <END> . 
This suggests that diverse agents thought to activate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by distinct intracellular pathways might all act through a common mechanism involving the synthesis of ROI . 
ROI appear to serve as messengers mediating directly or indirectly the release of the <START:ggp> inhibitory subunit <END> <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> from <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> belonging to the <START:ggp> rel/NF-kappa B family <END> by a <START:ggp> transdominant negative mutant <END> . 
The <START:ggp> KBF1 factor <END> , which binds to the <START:ggp> enhancer A <END> located in the <START:ggp> promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> mouse MHC class I gene <END> <START:ggp> H-2Kb <END> , is indistinguishable from the <START:ggp> p50 DNA binding subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> transcription factor NF-kappa B <END> , which regulates a series of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses . 
The <START:ggp> KBF1/p50 factor <END> binds as a <START:ggp> homodimer <END> but can also form <START:ggp> heterodimers <END> with the products of other members of the same family , like the <START:ggp> c-rel and v-rel ( proto ) oncogenes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> dimerization domain <END> of <START:ggp> KBF1/p50 <END> is contained <START:ggp> between amino acids 201 and 367 <END> . 
A mutant of <START:ggp> KBF1/p50 <END> ( <START:ggp> delta SP <END> ) , unable to bind to DNA but able to form homo- or <START:ggp> heterodimers <END> , has been constructed . 
This protein reduces or abolishes in vitro the DNA binding activity of <START:ggp> wild-type proteins <END> of the same family ( <START:ggp> KBF1/p50 <END> , <START:ggp> c- and v-rel <END> ) . 
This mutant also functions in vivo as a <START:ggp> trans-acting dominant negative regulator <END> : the transcriptional inducibility of the <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> ( which contains two potential <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding sites ) by phorbol ester ( PMA ) is inhibited when it is co-transfected into <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> with the <START:ggp> delta SP <END> mutant . 
Similarly the basal as well as <START:ggp> TNF <END> or IL1-induced activity of the <START:ggp> MHC class I H-2Kb promoter <END> can be inhibited by this mutant in two different <START:ana> cell lines <END> . 
These results constitute the first formal demonstration that these genes are regulated by members of the <START:ggp> rel/NF-kappa B family <END> . 
Tissue-specific expression of the <START:ggp> platelet GPIIb gene <END> . 
One of the major objectives in the study of thrombogenesis is to determine the mechanisms by which a <START:ana> hematopoietic progenitor <END> is activated and committed to the <START:ana> megakaryocytic lineage <END> . 
Recent development of <START:ana> primary cultures <END> of <START:ana> human megakaryocytes <END> and the molecular cloning of genes that are specific to this lineage offer the possibility of getting some insights into the genetic mechanisms that control megakaryocytopoiesis . 
One gene of interest is the <START:ggp> glycoprotein IIb ( GPIIb ) gene <END> ; <START:ggp> GPIIb <END> , the <START:ggp> alpha subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> platelet cytoadhesin GPIIb-IIIa <END> , is produced in <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> at an early stage of the differentiation , whereas the other subunit of this complex , <START:ggp> GPIIIa <END> , is expressed in other cells . 
For these reasons , the <START:ggp> 5'-flanking region <END> of the <START:ggp> GPIIb gene <END> was used to identify the regions that interact with <START:ggp> DNA-binding nuclear factors <END> . 
A fragment extending from <START:ggp> -643 to +33 <END> is capable of controlling the tissue-specific expression of the <START:ggp> CAT gene <END> in transfection experiments . 
Within this region , we have identified several sequences that are implicated in DNA protein interactions as shown in <START:ggp> DNAse I <END> footprints and gel mobility shift assays . 
One region , centered at -54 , is similar to a <START:ggp> nuclear factor E1-binding site <END> , and a region located at position -233 contains a <START:ggp> CCAAT motif <END> . 
Two domains centered at positions -345 and -540 , respectively , bind proteins that are present in <START:ana> megakaryocytic cells <END> and <START:ana> nonrelated cells <END> as well . 
Finally , two other domains , located at positions -460 and -510 , interact with proteins that are only present in <START:ana> megakaryocytic cells <END> . 
In addition , deletion of the region containing these two domains results in a significant decrease of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> activity . 
It is very likely that these domains bind <START:ggp> megakaryocyte-specific nuclear proteins <END> acting as <START:ggp> positive transcription factors <END> . 
Lymphocyte <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> binding during depression and after clinical recovery . 
<START:ggp> Lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor <END> binding parameters were studied in 15 severely depressed patients during depression and after clinical recovery , and in 15 healthy controls . 
There was no difference in <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> number or affinity between depressed patients and recovered or control subjects . 
Afternoon ACTH and cortisol concentrations did not differ significantly between the three groups . 
No relationship could be established between <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> binding and antidepressant medication . 
These data support the view of an impaired ligand-induced plasticity of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> regulation rather than the hypothesis of decreased <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> numbers during depression . 
Every enhancer works with every <START:ggp> promoter <END> for all the combinations tested : could new regulatory pathways evolve by enhancer shuffling ? 
The <START:ggp> promoters <END> and <START:ggp> enhancers <END> of cell type-specific genes are often conserved in evolution , and hence one might expect that a given <START:ggp> enhancer <END> has evolved to work best with its own <START:ggp> promoter <END> . 
While this expectation may be realized in some cases , we have not found evidence for it . 
A total of 27 combinations of different <START:ggp> promoters <END> and <START:ggp> enhancers <END> were tested by transfection into <START:ana> cultured cells <END> . 
We found that the relative efficiency of the <START:ggp> enhancers <END> is approximately the same , irrespective of the type of <START:ggp> promoter <END> used , i.e. , there was no strong preference for any given enhancer/ <START:ggp> promoter <END> combination . 
Notably , we do not see particularly strong transcription when the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin kappa enhancer <END> ( or the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer <END> ) is used to activate a kappa gene <START:ggp> promoter <END> . 
We propose that a generally permissive enhancer/ <START:ggp> promoter <END> interaction is of evolutionary benefit for higher eukaryotes : by enhancer shuffling , genes could be easily brought under a new type of inducibility/cell type specificity . 
Towards a molecular understanding of T-cell differentiation . 
Lymphoid differentiation is one of the best studied examples of mammalian development . 
Here Hans Clevers and Michael Owen describe how the cloning of the genes that encode <START:ggp> T-cell-specific membrane proteins <END> allows the identification of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that control the expression of these <START:ggp> T-cell genes <END> . 
Such <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> play a key role in the development of the mature T-cell phenotype by functioning as 'master regulators of T-cell differentiation' . 
A study on the circadian rhythm of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
Circadian rhythm in <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) was studied in the <START:ana> rat liver <END> and <START:ana> human peripheral leukocytes <END> . 
For rats exposed to a natural environmental photic cycle or a 12L : 12D artificial light regime , peak values of <START:ggp> hepatic GR <END> were detected between 23 : 00 and 02 : 00 h . 
Except for a 4-hour advancement of the peak , a similar circadian rhythm of <START:ggp> hepatic GR <END> was detected in rats reared under a reversed lighting regimen ( 12D : 12L ; lights on between 18 : 30 and 06 : 30 h ) . 
In <START:ana> human leukocytes <END> , the peak value of <START:ggp> GR <END> was found to parallel that of plasma cortisol with high and low values detected at 04 : 00-08 : 00 h and 23 : 00-24 : 00 h , respectively . 
In patients suffering from Cushing 's syndrome , the circadian rhythm of plasma cortisol either disappeared or was inverted while that of <START:ggp> GR <END> did not significantly deviate from the normal subjects . 
For apoplexic patients with lesions localized to the base of the brain as indicated by computerized tomography , the diurnal variation of <START:ggp> GR <END> was abolished . 
Conversely , diurnal rhythmicity persisted in apoplexy patients whose lesions were in the cerebral cortex . 
Thus , we postulated that the circadian modification of <START:ggp> GR <END> was independent of the diurnal fluctuations in plasma cortisol level or the circadian variations in environmental lighting and that the rhythmicity might be regulated by the 'circadian pacemaker ' located in the human basal brain . 
These diurnal variations in <START:ggp> GR <END> might serve to coordinate the reactivity of the <START:ana> target cells <END> to cortisol because the diurnal rhythms of a <START:ggp> GR <END> -mediated response , the fractional inhibition of chemotactic migration rate of <START:ana> polymorphonuclear leukocytes <END> by cortisol , were found to be synchronous with those of <START:ggp> GR <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor <END> requirements for <START:ana> U2 snRNA <END> -encoding gene activation in <START:ana> B lymphoid cells <END> . 
Transcription of a human <START:ggp> U2 small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) -encoding gene <END> in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> requires a <START:ggp> distal enhancer element <END> , which is composed of one <START:ggp> octamer motif <END> ( <START:ggp> Oct <END> ) and three <START:ggp> Sp 1-binding sites <END> . 
To study the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> requirement in <START:ana> B-cells <END> , different <START:ggp> U2 enhancer constructions <END> were transfected into the <START:ana> lymphoid cell line <END> , <START:ana> BJA-B <END> . 
The results showed that the activation of U2 snRNA transcription in <START:ana> B-cells <END> also requires an enhancer comprising both the <START:ggp> Oct <END> and at least one <START:ggp> Sp 1-binding site <END> . 
Deletion of all the <START:ggp> Sp 1-binding sites <END> from the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> reduces transcription by 80-90 % in HeLa , as well as in <START:ana> BJA-B cells <END> , whereas the removal of the <START:ggp> octamer-binding site <END> reduces transcription to levels below detection in both cell types . 
Enhancers containing a single <START:ggp> Oct <END> have , nevertheless , the capacity to partially activate <START:ana> U2 snRNA <END> transcription in both <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , in which only OTF-1 is expressed , and in <START:ana> BJA-B cells <END> in which <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> is the predominantly expressed <START:ggp> octamer-binding factor <END> . 
The most likely interpretation of our results is that both the ubiquitous <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> OTF-1 <END> , and the <START:ggp> B-cell-specific transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> , can activate <START:ana> U2 snRNA <END> transcription . 
The results also revealed a similar functional cooperation between the transcription factors which bind to the <START:ggp> Oct <END> and the adjacent <START:ggp> Sp 1-binding site <END> in <START:ana> BJA-B cells <END> , as has been observed in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , since a template which contains a weak binding site for <START:ggp> OTFs <END> expresses wild-type levels of <START:ana> U2 snRNA <END> in both cell types when the weak <START:ggp> octamer-binding site <END> is combined with a <START:ggp> Sp 1-binding site <END> . 
One base pair change abolishes the T cell-restricted activity of a <START:ggp> kB-like proto-enhancer element <END> from the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 promoter <END> . 
The inducible , <START:ggp> T cell-specific enhancers <END> of <START:ggp> murine and human Interleukin 2 ( Il-2 ) genes <END> contain the <START:ggp> kB-like sequence <END> GGGATTTCACC as an <START:ggp> essential cis-acting enhancer motif <END> . 
When cloned in multiple copies this so-called <START:ggp> TCEd <END> ( <START:ggp> distal T cell element <END> ) acts as an inducible <START:ggp> proto-enhancer element <END> in <START:ana> E14 T lymphoma cells <END> , but not in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
In extracts of induced , <START:ana> Il-2 secreting El4 cells <END> three individual <START:ggp> protein factors <END> bind to <START:ggp> TCEd DNA <END> . 
The binding of the most prominent factor , named <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> T cell factor 1 <END> ) , is correlated with the proto-enhancer activity of TCEd . 
<START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> consists of two polypeptides of about 50 kD and 105 kD ; the former seems to be related to the <START:ggp> 50 kD polypeptide <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> . 
<START:ggp> Purified NF-kB <END> is also able to bind to the <START:ggp> TCEd <END> , but <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> binds stronger than <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> to <START:ggp> TCEd <END> DNA . 
The conversion of the <START:ggp> TCEd <END> to a <START:ggp> 'perfect ' NF-kB binding site <END> leads to a tighter binding of <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> to <START:ggp> TCEd DNA <END> and , as a functional consequence , to the activity of the <START:ggp> 'converted ' TCEd motifs <END> in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
Thus , the substitution of the underlined A residue to a C within the <START:ggp> GGGATTTCACC motif <END> abolishes its T cell-restricted activity and leads to its functioning in both <START:ana> El4 cells <END> and <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
These results indicate that lymphocyte-specific factors binding to the <START:ggp> TCEd <END> are involved in the control of T cell specific-transcription of the <START:ggp> Il-2 gene <END> . 
An <START:ggp> erythroid specific enhancer <END> upstream to the gene encoding the <START:ggp> cell-type specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> is expressed in a subset of <START:ana> hemopoietic cells <END> , where it mediates the cell-type specific expression of several genes . 
We have cloned the mouse and human <START:ggp> GATA-1 genes <END> . 
A region upstream to the first exon , and highly conserved between mouse and man , acts as an erythroid specific enhancer in transient assays , if linked to the <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> or to the SV40 promoter . 
The activity of the enhancer is almost completely dependent on the integrity of a <START:ggp> dimeric GATA-1 binding site <END> . 
Demonstration of a <START:ggp> 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-responsive protein <END> in <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> : immunologic crossreactivity and inverse regulation with the <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> . 
Using Western blot analysis with a <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> recognizing a <START:ggp> 17-amino acid epitope <END> of the <START:ggp> 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ] receptor <END> , we have detected two <START:ggp> crossreacting proteins <END> in <START:ana> activated normal human lymphocytes <END> . 
The smaller of the two proteins ( <START:ggp> 50 kDa <END> ) was indistinguishable from the classical <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor <END> and , similar to the classical <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor <END> , was upregulated in a dose-dependent fashion by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . 
The larger crossreacting protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of 80 kDa , was localized in the cell cytosol , and appeared to be specific for <START:ana> activated lymphocytes <END> since it was not detected in several other <START:ana> human cells <END> including <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
More strikingly , the <START:ggp> 80-kDa protein <END> was downregulated in a dose-dependent fashion by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ; this effect was independent of the mode of lymphocyte activation and specific for the 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 metabolite of vitamin D3 . 
However , two potent immunosuppressive agents , glucocorticoids and cyclosporin A , also inhibited the <START:ggp> 80-kDa protein <END> . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> human mononuclear cells <END> : effects of glucocorticoid treatment , Cushing 's disease and ketoconazole . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GcR <END> ) were determined by a whole cell assay in <START:ana> human mononulear leukocytes <END> ( <START:ana> hMNL <END> ) from control subjects , patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy for systemic diseases and Cushing 's disease patients with or without ketoconazole therapy . 
Prolonged corticosteroid treatment resulted in down-regulation of <START:ggp> GcR <END> , while the mean level of <START:ggp> GcR <END> in Cushing 's disease was normal . 
In this group , however , receptor levels and morning plasma cortisol values showed a negative correlation , indicating a subtle down-regulatory effect . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> GcR <END> were unaltered after these patients received ketoconazole , in spite of a marked reduction in morning plasma cortisol and urinary free cortisol . 
We also observed that ketoconazole was a weak competitor of <START:ggp> GcR <END> in <START:ana> intact cells <END> , although it significantly inhibited [ 3H ] dexamethasone binding in cytosolic preparations from rat tissues . 
The results suggested that <START:ggp> GcR <END> in <START:ana> hMNL <END> are down-regulated by synthetic steroids given in vivo , but they showed very mild down-regulation in hypercortisolemic patients suffering from Cushing 's disease . 
Finally , we did not observed either up-regulation or antagonism of <START:ggp> GcR <END> by ketoconazole treatment , at the time that cortisol levels of patients with Cushing 's disease were reduced . 
This indicates that the beneficial effects of ketoconazole in Cushing 's disease are due to adrenal cortisol suppression and not to interaction with <START:ggp> GcR <END> of <START:ana> target cells <END> , and that the process of <START:ggp> GcR <END> regulation in <START:ana> hMNL <END> is a complex phenomenon awaiting further elucidation . 
<START:ggp> HTLV-1 Tax <END> induces expression of various <START:ggp> immediate early serum responsive genes <END> . 
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is an etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) . 
We showed here by mobility-shift assay that <START:ana> T-cell lines <END> transformed with the virus contained high levels of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activities . 
Consistent with this result , these cell lines expressed increased levels of <START:ana> mRNAs <END> encoding the <START:ggp> AP-1 proteins <END> , <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , <START:ggp> Fra-1 <END> , <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> , <START:ggp> JunB <END> , and <START:ggp> JunD <END> . 
Previously , transcription of the <START:ggp> c-fos gene <END> has been reported to be transactivated by the <START:ggp> viral transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> . 
By using the <START:ana> human T-cell line <END> ( <START:ana> JPX-9 <END> ) , in which expression of the <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> is inducible , we showed that expression of <START:ana> mRNAs <END> for <START:ggp> Fra-1 <END> , <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> , and <START:ggp> JunD <END> was also transactivated by <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> activated expression of two other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> having <START:ggp> zinc finger motifs <END> , <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Egr-2 <END> , in the same cells . 
The <START:ggp> Tax1-inducible transcription factors <END> identified here are encoded by the members of <START:ggp> immediate early genes <END> under the control of growth signals . 
Thus , <START:ggp> Tax1 <END> was suggested to replace growth signals , at least in part , by this mechanism . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptor <END> characteristics in <START:ana> monocytes <END> of patients with corticosteroid-resistant bronchial asthma . 
The mechanism of corticosteroid resistance in bronchial asthma has been studied by determining the rank order of potency for different corticosteroids in inhibiting the generation of a 3 kD molecule from <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> isolated from corticosteroid-sensitive ( CS ) and corticosteroid-resistant ( CR ) asthmatic subjects , which augments leukotriene B4 ( <START:ggp> LTB4 <END> ) generation by <START:ana> human neutrophils <END> ( <START:ana> PMN <END> ) stimulated by calcium ionophore . 
In addition , binding studies with ( 3H ) dexamethasone have been performed to determine the dissociation constant ( Kd ) and receptor numbers ( Ro ) in the <START:ana> monocytes <END> of these two groups of subjects . 
The concentration of corticosteroid producing 50 % inhibition ( IC50 ) was 600 nM , 70 nM , and 0.5 nM for hydrocortisone , methylprednisolone , and dexamethasone , respectively , in <START:ana> monocytes <END> from CS individuals . 
There was only weak inhibition of the generation of enhancing activity by the corticosteroids in the CR asthmatic individuals . 
The dexamethasone Kd was 2.45 +/- 0.58 nM ( mean +/- SEM , n = 6 ) in the CS group and 1.6 +/- 0.35 nM ( mean +/- SEM , n = 6 ) in the CR group of patients ( p = 0.14 ) . 
The Ro in the CS group was 3 , 605 +/- 984 binding sites per nucleus ( mean +/- SEM , n = 6 ) and 4 , 757 +/- 692 binding sites per nucleus ( mean +/- SEM , n = 6 ) in the CR group ( p = 0.23 ) . 
These findings indicate that corticosteroid resistance in bronchial asthma can not be explained by abnormalities in corticosteroid receptor characteristics . 
<START:ggp> Vitamin D receptor <END> expression in <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> . 
Signal requirements and characterization by western blots and DNA sequencing . 
The signals controlling the expression of the <START:ggp> receptor protein <END> for 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in normal <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> and the relationship of this protein to the <START:ggp> classical vitamin D receptor <END> were examined . 
<START:ana> Lymphocytes <END> activated with the <START:ggp> OKT3 antibody <END> to the <START:ggp> T-cell antigen receptor <END> expressed fewer binding sites as compared to <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> that were activated by the polyclonal activator <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> ( <START:ggp> PHA <END> ) . 
However , combination of <START:ggp> OKT3 <END> and phorbol myristate acetate produced a concentration of binding sites similar to the <START:ana> PHA-activated cells <END> . 
The receptor from <START:ggp> OKT3 <END> and <START:ggp> OKT3 <END> + phorbol myristate acetate <START:ana> -activated lymphocytes <END> exhibited decreased binding to DNA-cellulose compared to <START:ana> PHA-activated lymphocytes <END> . 
In <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> activated either by <START:ggp> PHA <END> or <START:ggp> OKT3 <END> ( but not in <START:ana> resting cells <END> ) , a <START:ggp> 50-kDa species <END> cross-reacting with a <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> against the <START:ggp> intestinal vitamin D receptor <END> was detected . 
Finally , RNA from <START:ana> activated lymphocytes <END> was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers flanking the <START:ggp> 196 base pair long region <END> encoding the <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> of the <START:ggp> human intestinal receptor <END> . 
The amplified product showed an <START:ggp> identical nucleotide sequence <END> to the <START:ggp> DNA-binding domain <END> of the <START:ggp> human intestinal receptor <END> . 
These findings suggest that expression of the <START:ggp> 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 receptor <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> is triggered by distinct and contingent signals , and that the protein and the <START:ana> mRNA <END> encoding it are identical to the <START:ggp> classical vitamin D receptor <END> . 
Comparison of constitutive and inducible transcriptional enhancement mediated by <START:ggp> kappa B-related sequences <END> : modulation of activity in <START:ana> B cells <END> by <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type I tax gene <END> . 
The <START:ggp> kappa B sequence <END> ( GGGACTTTCC ) binds a factor , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , that is constitutively found in its functional , DNA binding form only in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
A factor with apparently indistinguishable sequence specificity can be induced in many other cell types , where it is used to regulate inducible gene expression . 
For example , <START:ggp> kappa B-related sequences <END> have been shown to be important for the transcription of a few inducible genes , such as the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain gene <END> and the <START:ggp> beta-interferon gene <END> . 
However , these genes are not constitutively active in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> , suggesting that other regulatory mechanisms must play a role in determining the patterns of expression . 
We have investigated the constitutive and inducible transcriptional activity mediated by five <START:ggp> kappa B-related sequence elements <END> in two different cell types . 
We show that in <START:ana> S194 plasma cells <END> the activity of each element correlates well with the relative affinity of <START:ggp> B-cell-derived NF-kappa B <END> for that element . 
This leads to significantly lower transcription enhancement by sites derived from the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 receptor <END> or <START:ggp> T-cell receptor genes <END> in <START:ana> S194 cells <END> . 
However , in either <START:ana> EL-4 ( T ) cells <END> or <START:ana> S194 cells <END> , both lower-affinity sites can be significantly induced by the <START:ggp> tax gene product <END> of human T-cell leukemia virus type I , showing that <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity can be modulated even in a <START:ana> B-cell line <END> that constitutively expresses this factor . 
Specific depletion of the <START:ana> B-cell population <END> induced by aberrant expression of <START:ggp> human interferon regulatory factor 1 gene <END> in transgenic mice . 
<START:ggp> Interferons <END> ( <START:ggp> IFNs <END> ) are well known both as <START:ggp> antiviral proteins <END> and as potent regulators of cell growth and differentiation . 
In fact , <START:ggp> IFNs <END> inhibit growth of various <START:ana> normal <END> and <START:ana> transformed cell types <END> . 
Previously , a <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> , <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> interferon regulatory factor 1 <END> ) , which binds to <START:ggp> type I IFN <END> and some <START:ggp> IFN-inducible gene promoters <END> , was identified and cloned . 
Since the <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> gene is both virus and <START:ggp> IFN <END> inducible , an intriguing issue is raised as to whether the <START:ggp> IRF-1 gene <END> is functioning in <START:ggp> IFN <END> -mediated regulation of cell growth and differentiation . 
In this study , we generated transgenic mice carrying the <START:ggp> human IRF-1 gene <END> linked to the <START:ggp> human immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer <END> . 
In the transgenic mice , all the lymphoid tissues examined showed a dramatic reduction in the number of <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> B cells <END> ) . 
Preparation and analysis of <START:ana> bone marrow cells <END> from the chimeric mice indicated that the bone marrow is the effective site for specific depletion of the <START:ana> B-cell population <END> . 
In fact , <START:ana> transgenic bone marrow cells <END> cocultured with a <START:ana> bone marrow-derived stromal cell line <END> revealed an altered <START:ana> B-cell <END> maturation pattern . 
Characterization of a <START:ggp> cofactor <END> that regulates dimerization of a <START:ggp> mammalian homeodomain protein <END> . 
Dimerization among <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> has become a recurrent theme in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression . 
<START:ggp> Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> HNF-1 alpha <END> ) is a <START:ggp> homeodomain-containing protein <END> that functions as a <START:ggp> dimer <END> . 
A <START:ggp> dimerization cofactor <END> of <START:ggp> HNF-1 alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> DCoH <END> ) was identified that displayed a restricted tissue distribution and did not bind to DNA , but , rather , selectively stabilized <START:ggp> HNF-1 alpha dimers <END> . 
The formation of a stable <START:ggp> tetrameric DCoH-HNF-1 alpha complex <END> , which required the <START:ggp> dimerization domain <END> of <START:ggp> HNF-1 alpha <END> , did not change the DNA binding characteristics of <START:ggp> HNF-1 alpha <END> , but enhanced its transcriptional activity . 
However , <START:ggp> DCoH <END> did not confer transcriptional activation to the <START:ggp> GAL4 DNA binding domain <END> . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> DCoH <END> regulates formation of transcriptionally active <START:ggp> tetrameric complexes <END> and may contribute to the developmental specificity of the <START:ggp> complex <END> . 
Glucocorticoid resistance in chronic asthma . 
Glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics , <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> characteristics , and inhibition of <START:ana> peripheral blood T cell <END> proliferation by glucocorticoids in vitro . 
A total of 37 chronic , severe , nonsmoking asthmatic patients with documented reversible airways obstruction were classified as glucocorticoid-sensitive or -resistant on the basis of changes in FEV1 , FVC , and peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) after oral prednisolone . 
The resistant patients showed no significant improvements in airflow limitation . 
<START:ggp> Phytohemagglutinin <END> ( <START:ggp> PHA <END> ) -induced proliferation of <START:ana> peripheral blood T lymphocytes <END> from the sensitive but not the resistant asthmatic patients was significantly ( p less than 0.01 ) inhibited by dexamethasone ( 10 ( -7 ) mol/L ) , reflecting a shift of the dose-response curve . 
When all the asthmatic patients were analyzed together , there was a significant correlation between the degree of sensitivity of <START:ana> T cells <END> to dexamethasone and the clinical responsiveness to prednisolone ( p less than 0.01 ) . 
No differences were observed between six of the sensitive and resistant patients in the clearance of plasma prednisolone derived from orally administered prednisone . 
<START:ggp> Peripheral blood mononuclear cell glucocorticoid receptors <END> were also characterized in five sensitive and seven resistant patients . 
The numbers and binding affinities of these <START:ggp> receptors <END> could not account for the observed difference in the susceptibility of these cells to functional inhibition by dexamethasone in vitro . 
These results suggest that clinical glucocorticoid resistance in chronic asthma does not reflect abnormal glucocorticoid clearance but may be due at least partly to a relative insensitivity of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> to glucocorticoids . 
This lack of sensitivity is unexplained but is not attributable to abnormalities of <START:ggp> cellular glucocorticoid receptors <END> . 
Inhibition of phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation by dexamethasone is associated with down-regulation of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) . 
Previous studies have shown that treatment of <START:ana> human myeloid leukemia cells <END> with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) is associated with induction of monocytic differentiation and expression of the <START:ggp> c-jun and c-fos early response genes <END> . 
The present work demonstrates that the glucocorticoid dexamethasone inhibits TPA-induced increases in c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels in <START:ana> U-937 leukemia cells <END> . 
These findings were associated with a block in appearance of the <START:ana> monocytic phenotype <END> , including inhibition of TPA-induced increases in <START:ana> lamin A , lamin C , and vimentin transcripts <END> . 
Other studies have demonstrated that TPA-induced monocytic differentiation and expression of the <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and <START:ggp> c-fos genes <END> in <START:ana> myeloid leukemia cells <END> are regulated by <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) . 
The finding that dexamethasone has no effect on TPA-induced activation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> suggests that this glucocorticoid inhibits signals downstream or parallel to this <START:ggp> enzyme <END> . 
Nuclear run-on assays demonstrate that : ( 1 ) induction of c-jun and c-fos expression by TPA is regulated by transcriptional mechanisms , ( 2 ) TPA-induced expression of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and <START:ggp> c-fos <END> does not require protein synthesis , and ( 3 ) TPA-induced expression of both genes is inhibited at the transcriptional level by dexamethasone . 
To further define the effects of dexamethasone at the molecular level , we prepared a series of deleted <START:ggp> c-jun promoter fragments <END> linked to the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene <END> . 
Increases in <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity during transient expression of these constructs in <START:ana> TPA-treated U-937 cells <END> could be assigned to the region ( -97 to -20 ) of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> that contains the <START:ggp> AP-1 binding site <END> . 
This induction of <START:ggp> CAT <END> activity was sensitive to dexamethasone . 
These findings suggest that dexamethasone down-regulates TPA-induced transcription of the <START:ggp> c-jun <END> gene during monocytic differentiation by inhibiting activation of the <START:ggp> AP-1 site <END> . 
<START:ana> Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA <END> accumulation in <START:ana> human myelomonocytic cell lines <END> . 
Role of transcriptional regulation by <START:ggp> DNA sequence motifs <END> and mRNA stabilization . 
The <START:ggp> cytokine <END> <START:ggp> TNF <END> mediates many of the pathologic signs of cachexia , inflammation , and sepsis . 
The current work describes the regulation of <START:ggp> TNF <END> in <START:ana> human myelomonocytic cell lines <END> after PMA stimulation . 
The <START:ana> cell lines <END> exhibit a low level of constitutive <START:ana> TNF mRNA <END> expression . 
Within 2 to 4 h of PMA exposure , steady state levels of <START:ana> TNF mRNA <END> are markedly elevated in all <START:ana> myelomonocytic cell lines <END> studied . 
This rise is due to increased mRNA stability , which increased by almost twofold , and to an overall increase in transcription , which rises by more than sixfold . 
At the level of the <START:ggp> genomic TNF gene <END> , a <START:ggp> DNase I hypersensitive site <END> is detected within the <START:ggp> TNF promoter <END> between -200 to -100 bp relative to the <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> . 
Although absent in <START:ana> nonexpressing erythroleukemia cell lines <END> , the <START:ggp> DNase I site <END> is present in <START:ana> uninduced myelomonocytic cell lines <END> and is not changed after PMA induction . 
The PMA induction of <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> correlated well with <START:ggp> TNF <END> gene induction ; expression of genes encoding other proteins in the <START:ggp> AP-1 complex <END> ( <START:ggp> junB <END> and <START:ggp> junD <END> ) were also induced by PMA . 
The nuclear extracts from resting and <START:ana> induced ML-1 cells <END> contain proteins binding specifically to the <START:ggp> AP-1 , AP-2 , and NF kappa B sequence <END> located within the <START:ggp> TNF promoter <END> . 
PMA induction increases the level of a number of <START:ggp> specific binding complexes <END> relative to the <START:ana> resting cells <END> . 
The regulatory mechanisms of the <START:ggp> human and murine TNF genes <END> are discussed . 
Enhancement of human immunodeficiency virus 1 replication in <START:ana> monocytes <END> by 1 , 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol . 
Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) expression and replication are under tight regulatory control . 
We demonstrate that 1 , 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [ 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 ] enhances the replication of monocyte- and lymphocyte-tropic strains of HIV-1 up to 10 , 000-fold in <START:ana> monocyte cell lines <END> , <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> , and <START:ana> unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 is therefore one of the most potent regulators of HIV-1 replication described to date . 
Precursors of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 enhance HIV-1 replication in proportion to their affinity for the <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 intracellular receptor <END> , suggesting that 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 influences HIV-1 replication by mechanisms involving this receptor . 
These studies may have important implications for the design of effective therapy of HIV-1 infection . 
<START:ggp> Transforming growth factor-beta <END> suppresses <START:ggp> human B lymphocyte Ig <END> production by inhibiting synthesis and the switch from the <START:ana> membrane form <END> to the <START:ana> secreted form <END> of <START:ana> Ig mRNA <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transforming growth factor-beta <END> ( <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> ) inhibits <START:ana> B cell <END> <START:ggp> Ig <END> secretion and reduces <START:ana> B cell <END> membrane <START:ggp> Ig <END> expression . 
The addition of <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> to <START:ana> human B lymphocyte cultures <END> stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> completely inhibited <START:ana> B cell <END> <START:ggp> Ig <END> secretion ( greater than 90 % ) and decreased <START:ana> B cell <END> surface IgM , IgD , kappa L chain , and lambda L chain expression . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> had only minimal effects on two other <START:ggp> B cell membrane proteins <END> , <START:ggp> HLA-DR <END> and <START:ggp> CD20 <END> . 
Internal labeling with [ 35S ] methionine and immunoprecipitation with <START:ggp> anti-IgM <END> , <START:ggp> anti-kappa <END> , and <START:ggp> anti-lambda antibodies <END> revealed a striking reduction in <START:ggp> kappa L chain <END> in the presence of <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> . 
A less pronounced reduction in <START:ggp> lambda L chain <END> and <START:ggp> microH chain <END> was also noted . 
Northern blot analysis of RNA purified from <START:ana> B cells <END> treated with <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> for varying time intervals revealed a significant decrease in steady state kappa and lambda L chain mRNA levels . 
Furthermore , a significant decrease in the switch from the <START:ana> membrane forms <END> of <START:ana> mu <END> and <START:ana> gamma <END> to their respective <START:ana> secreted forms <END> was noted in the presence of <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> . 
Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrated decreased transcription of <START:ggp> kappa L chain <END> . 
The effects of <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> on two <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory factors <END> , <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> and <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) kappa B <END> , known to be important in <START:ggp> Ig <END> gene transcription were examined . 
<START:ana> Oct-2 mRNA <END> levels and both <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B proteins <END> in nuclear extracts were not altered by treatment with <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> . 
In contrast , levels of the <START:ggp> transcriptional factor AP-1 <END> , which is not known to be important in <START:ana> B cell <END> <START:ggp> Ig <END> production , were reduced by <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> . 
These findings demonstrate that <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> decreases B lymphocyte <START:ggp> Ig <END> secretion by inhibiting the synthesis of <START:ana> Ig mRNA <END> and inhibiting the switch from the <START:ana> membrane form <END> to the <START:ana> secreted forms <END> of <START:ana> mu and gamma mRNA <END> . 
The mechanism by which <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> inhibits Ig chain synthesis is unclear although it does not involve inhibition of the binding of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> or <START:ggp> Oct-2 <END> to their respective target sequences . 
<START:ggp> Murine and human T-lymphocyte GATA-3 factors <END> mediate transcription through a <START:ggp> cis-regulatory element <END> within the <START:ggp> human T-cell receptor delta gene enhancer <END> . 
A family of <START:ggp> transcriptional activators <END> has recently been identified in chickens ; these <START:ggp> transcriptional activators <END> recognize a common <START:ggp> consensus motif <END> ( <START:ggp> WGATAR <END> ) through a conserved <START:ggp> C4 zinc finger DNA-binding domain <END> . 
One of the members of this multigene family , <START:ggp> cGATA-3 <END> , is most abundantly expressed in the <START:ana> T-lymphocyte cell lineage <END> . 
Analysis of <START:ggp> human and murine GATA-3 factors <END> shows a striking degree of amino acid sequence identity and similar patterns of tissue specificity of expression in these three organisms . 
The <START:ggp> murine and human factors <END> are abundantly expressed in a variety of <START:ana> human and murine T-cell lines <END> and can activate transcription through a <START:ggp> tissue-specific GATA-binding site <END> identified within the <START:ggp> human T-cell receptor delta gene enhancer <END> . 
We infer that the <START:ggp> murine and human GATA-3 proteins <END> play a central and highly conserved role in vertebrate T-cell-specific transcriptional regulation . 
Processing of the precursor of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by the <START:ggp> HIV-1 protease <END> during acute infection . 
Transcription of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) genome <END> is regulated in part by <START:ggp> cellular factors <END> and is stimulated by activation of <START:ana> latently infected T cells <END> . 
T-cell activation also correlates with the induction of the factor <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> which binds to two adjacent sites in the <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> . 
This factor consists of two <START:ggp> DNA-binding subunits <END> of relative molecular mass 50 , 000 ( 50K ) associated with two <START:ggp> 65K subunits <END> . 
It is located in the nucleus in <START:ana> mature B cells <END> , but is present in other cell types as an <START:ggp> inactive cytoplasmic complex <END> . 
External stimuli , including those that activate <START:ana> T cells <END> , result in nuclear translocation of active <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
The cloning of the <START:ggp> complementary DNA <END> for the <START:ggp> 50K subunit <END> helped to identify an exclusively <START:ggp> cytoplasmic 105K precursor <END> ( <START:ggp> p105 <END> ) ( V.B. , P.K. and A.I. , manuscript submitted ) . 
The expression of active <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> might therefore also be regulated by the extent of processing of <START:ggp> p105 <END> . 
Because HIV-1 requires active <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> for efficient transcription , we tested the effect of HIV-1 infection on the processing of the <START:ggp> human 105K precursor <END> . 
We show here that the HIV-1 protease can process <START:ggp> p105 <END> and increases levels of active <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kappa B complex <END> . 
<START:ana> 1 , 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor RNA <END> : expression in <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> . 
1 , 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ] induces differentiation and inhibits proliferation of <START:ana> myeloid leukemic cells <END> from various lines and patients ; these effects are probably mediated through the <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor <END> . 
Little is known of expression of <START:ana> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor RNA <END> in <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> . 
We examined the expression and modulation of expression of <START:ana> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor RNA <END> in various <START:ana> proliferating and nonproliferating hematopoietic cells <END> . 
Constitutive expression of <START:ana> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor RNA <END> was detected in various kinds of <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> , including macrophages and activated <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , as well as in cell lines <START:ana> KG-1 <END> ( <START:ana> myeloblasts <END> ) , <START:ana> HL-60 <END> ( <START:ana> promyelocytes <END> ) , <START:ana> ML-3 <END> ( <START:ana> myelomonoblasts <END> ) , <START:ana> U937 <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 <END> ( <START:ana> monoblasts <END> ) , <START:ana> K562 <END> ( <START:ana> erythroblasts <END> ) , and <START:ana> S-LB1 <END> ( <START:ana> HTLV-1-transfected T lymphocytes <END> ) . 
<START:ana> Receptor transcripts <END> were 4.6 kilobases ( kb ) , and no variant sizes were observed . 
All cell lines examined in this group also expressed <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptors <END> . 
Most <START:ana> B lymphocyte lines <END> expressed negligible levels of <START:ana> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor RNA <END> and protein ; however ; analysis of a <START:ana> lymphoid/myeloid somatic hybrid <END> suggested that suppression of expression of <START:ana> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor RNA <END> in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> may be a dominant characteristic . 
<START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> were cultured with 10 ( -7 ) mol/L 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 for 24 to 72 hours , and levels of expression of <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor <END> and its RNA were examined . 
Levels of RNA coding for the <START:ggp> receptor <END> were not modulated by exposure to high levels of ligand . 
Levels of occupied <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor protein <END> increased in these <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> ; but the total number of <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptors <END> decreased about 50 % at 24 hours and returned toward normal at 72 hours . 
Steady-state levels of <START:ana> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor RNA <END> were not affected by terminal differentiation of <START:ana> HL-60 <END> toward either <START:ana> granulocytes <END> or <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
Nondividing <START:ana> macrophages <END> from normal individuals also expressed <START:ana> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor RNA <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ana> nondividing peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> from normal individuals did not express <START:ana> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor RNA <END> ; with stimulation of proliferation of these cells , accumulation of <START:ana> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor RNA <END> increased markedly . 
Half-life ( t1/2 ) of <START:ana> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor RNA <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> was short ( 1 hour ) as determined by measuring decay of the message after addition of actinomycin D . 
Consistent with this short t1/2 , accumulation of <START:ana> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor RNA <END> increased in cells as their protein synthesis was inhibited . 
Further studies are required to understand the physiologic role of <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptors <END> in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> and <START:ana> proliferating T lymphocytes <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> c-jun , jun B and jun D proto-oncogenes <END> in <START:ana> human peripheral-blood granulocytes <END> . 
We have found that <START:ana> purified human peripheral-blood granulocytes <END> express constitutively significant levels of <START:ggp> proto-oncogenes <END> <START:ana> c-jun , jun B and jun D mRNA <END> . 
Upon functional activation of <START:ana> granulocytes <END> by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , the levels of <START:ana> c-jun , jun B and jun D transcripts <END> were increased . 
The three <START:ggp> jun genes <END> showed a similar time course in their induction by PMA , maximal mRNA levels being reached after 60 min of induction . 
These results suggest that expression of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> , <START:ggp> jun B <END> and <START:ggp> jun D genes <END> might be involved in <START:ana> terminal granulocyte <END> differentiation or in regulating <START:ana> granulocyte <END> functionality . 
The <START:ggp> 29-kDa proteins <END> phosphorylated in <START:ana> thrombin-activated human platelets <END> are forms of the <START:ggp> estrogen receptor-related 27-kDa heat shock protein <END> . 
<START:ggp> Thrombin <END> plays a critical role in platelet activation , hemostasis , and thrombosis . 
Cellular activation by thrombin leads to the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> multiple proteins <END> , most of which are unidentified . 
We have characterized several <START:ggp> 29-kDa proteins <END> that are rapidly phosphorylated following exposure of <START:ana> intact human platelets <END> to <START:ggp> thrombin <END> . 
A <START:ggp> murine monoclonal antibody <END> raised to an <START:ggp> unidentified estrogen receptor-related 29-kDa protein <END> selectively recognized these proteins as well as a more basic , <START:ggp> unphosphorylated 27-kDa protein <END> . 
Cellular activation by <START:ggp> thrombin <END> led to a marked shift in the proportion of protein from the <START:ggp> 27-kDa unphosphorylated form <END> to the <START:ggp> 29-kDa phosphoprotein species <END> . 
Using this antibody , we isolated and sequenced a human <START:ggp> cDNA clone <END> encoding a protein that was identical to the <START:ggp> mammalian 27-kDa heat shock protein <END> ( <START:ggp> HSP27 <END> ) , a protein of uncertain function that is known to be phosphorylated to several forms and to be transcriptionally induced by estrogen . 
The <START:ggp> 29-kDa proteins <END> were confirmed to be phosphorylated forms of <START:ggp> HSP27 <END> by immunoprecipitation studies . 
Thus , the `` estrogen receptor-related protein '' is <START:ggp> HSP27 <END> , and the three major <START:ggp> 29-kDa proteins <END> phosphorylated in <START:ana> thrombin-activated platelets <END> are forms of <START:ggp> HSP27 <END> . 
These data suggest a role for <START:ggp> HSP27 <END> in the signal transduction events of <START:ana> platelet <END> activation . 
Isolation of a candidate repressor/activator , <START:ggp> NF-E1 <END> ( <START:ggp> YY-1 <END> , <START:ggp> delta <END> ) , that binds to the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin kappa 3 ' enhancer <END> and the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy-chain mu E1 site <END> . 
We have determined that the developmental control of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin kappa 3 ' enhancer <END> ( <START:ggp> kappa E3 ' <END> ) activity is the result of the combined influence of <START:ggp> positive- and negative-acting elements <END> . 
We show that a central core in the <START:ggp> kappa E3 ' enhancer <END> is active at the pre-B-cell stage but is repressed by <START:ggp> flanking negative-acting elements <END> . 
The <START:ggp> negative-acting sequences <END> repress enhancer activity in a position- and orientation-independent manner at the pre-B-cell stage . 
We have isolated a <START:ggp> human cDNA clone <END> encoding a <START:ggp> zinc finger protein <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-E1 <END> ) that binds to the <START:ggp> negative-acting segment <END> of the <START:ggp> kappa E3 ' enhancer <END> . 
This protein also binds to the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer mu E1 site <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-E1 <END> is encoded by the same gene as the <START:ggp> YY-1 protein <END> , which binds to the <START:ggp> adeno-associated virus P5 promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-E1 <END> is also the <START:ggp> human homologue <END> of the <START:ggp> mouse delta protein <END> , which binds to <START:ggp> ribosomal protein gene promoters <END> . 
The predicted amino acid sequence of this protein contains features characteristic of <START:ggp> transcriptional activators <END> as well as <START:ggp> transcriptional repressors <END> . 
Cotransfection studies with this <START:ggp> cDNA <END> indicate that it can repress <START:ggp> basal promoter <END> activity . 
The apparent dual function of this protein is discussed . 
A <START:ggp> human putative lymphocyte G0/G1 switch gene <END> containing a <START:ggp> CpG-rich island <END> encodes a <START:ggp> small basic protein <END> with the potential to be phosphorylated . 
Genes actively involved in the <START:ggp> G0/G1 switch <END> ( <START:ana> G0S genes <END> ) may be differentially expressed during the <START:ggp> lectin <END> -induced switch of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> from the G0 to the G1 phases of the cell cycle . 
This paper presents studies of <START:ggp> G0S2 <END> , a member of a set of putative <START:ana> G0S genes <END> , for which <START:ggp> cDNAs <END> were cloned and selected on the basis of differential cDNA hybridization . 
<START:ana> G0S2 mRNA <END> increases transiently within 1-2 hr of the addition of <START:ggp> lectin <END> or cycloheximide to <START:ana> cultured blood mononuclear cells <END> . 
Comparison of a <START:ggp> nearly full-length cDNA sequence <END> with the corresponding <START:ggp> genomic sequence <END> reveals one small intron and an <START:ggp> open reading frame <END> in the second <START:ggp> exon <END> . 
The derived <START:ggp> 103-amino-acid basic protein <END> has two potential <START:ggp> alpha-helical domains <END> separated by a <START:ggp> hydrophobic region <END> with the potential to generate turns and assume a beta-sheet conformation . 
Consistent with involvement in the <START:ggp> G0/G1 switch <END> , the protein contains potential sites for phosphorylation by <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> and <START:ggp> casein kinase II <END> . 
The gene contains a <START:ggp> CpG-rich island <END> suggesting expression in the germ line . 
An <START:ggp> upstream segment <END> contains <START:ggp> tandem dinucleotide repeats <END> <START:ggp> ( CT ) 19/ ( CA ) 16 <END> . 
There is a suitably located <START:ggp> TATA box <END> , but potential sites for <START:ggp> CCAAT-box binding factors <END> are far upstream , embedded in a <START:ggp> 42-nucleotide repeat element <END> . 
Potential sites for <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> AP1 <END> , <START:ggp> AP2 <END> , and <START:ggp> AP3 <END> are consistent with rapid transcriptional activation in response to inducing agents . 
<START:ggp> USF-related transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> HIV-TF1 <END> , stimulates transcription of human immunodeficiency virus-1 . 
The <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> HIV-TF1 <END> , which binds to a region about <START:ggp> 60 bp upstream <END> from the enhancer of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 ( HIV-1 ) , was purified from <START:ana> human B cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> HIV-TF1 <END> had a molecular weight of 39 , 000 . 
Binding of <START:ggp> HIV-TF1 <END> to the <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) activated transcription from the <START:ggp> HIV promoter <END> in vitro . 
The <START:ggp> HIV-TF1-binding site <END> in <START:ggp> HIV LTR <END> was similar to the site recognized by <START:ggp> upstream stimulatory factor <END> ( <START:ggp> USF <END> ) in the <START:ggp> adenovirus major late promoter <END> . 
DNA-binding properties of <START:ggp> HIV-TF1 <END> suggested that <START:ggp> HIV-TF1 <END> might be identical or related to <START:ggp> USF <END> . 
Interestingly , treatment of purified <START:ggp> HIV-TF1 <END> by <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> greatly reduced its DNA-binding activity , suggesting that phosphorylation of <START:ggp> HIV-TF1 <END> was essential for DNA binding . 
The disruption of <START:ggp> HIV-TF1-binding site <END> induced a 60 % decrease in the level of transcription from the <START:ggp> HIV promoter <END> in vivo . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> HIV-TF1 <END> is involved in transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 . 
Severe 5-fluorouracil toxicity secondary to <START:ggp> dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase <END> deficiency . 
A potentially more common pharmacogenetic syndrome . 
This study describes the inheritance of a defect in pyrimidine catabolism and its association with drug-induced toxicity in a patient receiving 5-fluorouracil ( FUra ) as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast carcinoma . 
The study population included the affected patient ( proband ) , nine of her blood relatives , and seven healthy volunteers . 
The activity of <START:ggp> dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase <END> ( <START:ggp> DPD <END> ) , the initial <START:ggp> enzyme <END> of pyrimidine ( and FUra ) catabolism , in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> was measured in each subject by a specific radiometric assay using FUra as the substrate . 
The proband had no detectable <START:ggp> DPD <END> activity . 
When enzyme levels in the proband and relatives were compared with that in controls , an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance was demonstrated . 
This is the third patient with severe FUra toxicity secondary to an alteration in pyrimidine catabolism and the second from our clinic population suggesting that the frequency of this genetic defect may be greater than previously thought . 
Monitoring <START:ggp> DPD <END> activity may be important in the management of patients experiencing severe toxicity secondary to FUra chemotherapy . 
Transactivation of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus promoter <END> by human herpesvirus 6 ( HHV-6 ) strains GS and Z-29 in <START:ana> primary human T lymphocytes <END> and identification of <START:ggp> transactivating HHV-6 ( GS ) gene fragments <END> . 
Human herpesvirus 6 ( HHV-6 ) can activate the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) promoter <END> and accelerate cytopathic effects in <START:ana> HIV-infected human T cells <END> . 
This study examines the regions of the <START:ggp> HIV promoter <END> required for HHV-6 transactivation in a heterogeneous population of <START:ana> primary human T lymphocytes <END> with or without antigenic stimulation . 
Two different strains of HHV-6 , GS and Z29 , transactivated the <START:ggp> HIV promoter <END> . 
The GS strain transactivated the <START:ggp> promoter <END> in both stimulated and resting <START:ana> T cells <END> , while the Z29 strain increased <START:ggp> HIV promoter <END> activity only in <START:ana> stimulated T cells <END> . 
Three DNA clones containing <START:ggp> HHV-6 ( GS ) genomic fragments <END> transactivated the <START:ggp> HIV promoter <END> in <START:ana> cotransfected T cells <END> . 
A <START:ggp> 21.4-kb DNA clone <END> , <START:ggp> pZVB70 <END> , showed the highest transactivating ability , while two other <START:ggp> DNA fragments <END> , <START:ggp> pZVB10 <END> ( 6.2 kb ) and <START:ggp> pZVH14 <END> ( 8.7 kb ) , showed lower activity . 
One of these clones , <START:ggp> pZVH14 <END> , activated the <START:ggp> HIV promoter construct <END> containing a mutation in the <START:ggp> NF kappa B site <END> . 
However , this <START:ggp> mutated NF kappa B promoter <END> was not transactivated during HHV-6 ( GS ) infection or after cotransfection with <START:ggp> pZVB70 <END> or <START:ggp> pZVB10 <END> . 
These data indicate that the <START:ggp> NF kappa B sites <END> of the <START:ggp> HIV promoter <END> are essential for its transactivation during HHV-6 ( GS ) infection . 
By increasing <START:ggp> HIV promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> primary T lymphocytes <END> , HHV-6 may consequently increase HIV replication , leading to an increase in the cytopathic effect on <START:ana> coinfected human T cells <END> . 
Inhibition of HIV-1 replication and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity by cysteine and cysteine derivatives . 
<START:ggp> HIV-1 proviral DNA <END> contains two <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
HIV-1-infected individuals have , on average , abnormally high levels of <START:ggp> tumour necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> ) and abnormally low plasma cysteine levels . 
We therefore investigated the effects of cysteine and related thiols on HIV-1 replication and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> expression . 
The experiments in this report show that cysteine or N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) raise the intracellular glutathione ( GSH ) level and inhibit HIV-1 replication in persistently infected <START:ana> Molt-4 <END> and <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
However , inhibition of HIV-1 replication appears not to be directly correlated with GSH levels . 
Cysteine and NAC also inhibit <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase <END> ( <START:ggp> CAT <END> ) gene expression under control of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> binding sites <END> in <START:ana> uninfected cells <END> . 
This suggests that the cysteine deficiency in HIV-1-infected individuals may cause an over-expression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-dependent genes <END> and enhance HIV-1 replication . 
NAC may be considered for the treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals . 
A <START:ggp> thymus-specific member <END> of the <START:ggp> HMG protein family <END> regulates the <START:ggp> human T cell receptor C alpha enhancer <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human T cell-specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha <END> plays a key role in the tissue-specific activation of the <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) C alpha enhancer and binds to <START:ggp> pyrimidine-rich elements <END> ( 5'-PyCTTTG-3 ' ) present in a variety of other <START:ggp> T cell-specific control regions <END> . 
Using amino acid sequence information derived from the <START:ggp> DNA affinity-purified protein <END> , we have now isolated <START:ggp> cDNA clones <END> encoding <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha <END> . 
The <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha cDNA <END> contains a single <START:ggp> 68-amino-acid domain <END> that is homologous to a region conserved among <START:ggp> high-mobility group <END> ( <START:ggp> HMG <END> ) and <START:ggp> nonhistone chromosomal proteins <END> . 
Expression of <START:ggp> full-length <END> and <START:ggp> mutant cDNA clones <END> in bacteria reveal that the <START:ggp> single HMG motif <END> , which is predicted to contain two extended <START:ggp> alpha-helical segments <END> , is sufficient to direct the sequence-specific binding of <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha <END> to DNA . 
Northern blot experiments demonstrate further that <START:ana> TCF-1 alpha mRNA <END> is highly tissue specific , found primarily in the <START:ana> thymus or T cell lines <END> . 
The <START:ana> immature CEM T cell line <END> expresses relatively low levels of <START:ana> TCF-1 alpha mRNA <END> , which are increased upon activation of these cells by phorbol esters . 
Interestingly , the cloned <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha protein <END> is a potent <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> of the <START:ggp> human TCR alpha enhancer <END> in <START:ana> nonlymphoid cell lines <END> , whereas the activity of the <START:ggp> endogenous protein <END> in <START:ana> T cell lines <END> is strongly dependent on an additional <START:ana> T cell-specific protein <END> that interacts with the core enhancer . 
<START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha <END> is currently unique among the newly emerging family of <START:ggp> DNA-binding regulatory proteins <END> that share the <START:ggp> HMG motif <END> in that it is a <START:ggp> highly tissue-specific RNA polymerase II <END> <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
A novel HIV-1 isolate containing alterations affecting the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B element <END> . 
Three molecular clones of HIV-1 , derived from a single isolate ( AL1 ) , exhibited distinct replicative and cytopathic properties during propagation in a <START:ana> human T cell line <END> . 
The phenotypic differences observed were attributable , in large part , to changes affecting the <START:ggp> viral LTR <END> . 
Nucleotide sequence and PCR analyses demonstrated the presence of novel duplications or deletions involving the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B motif <END> . 
These changes in the <START:ggp> enhancer element <END> were identified in the original AL1 virus stock . 
Subcloning of the <START:ggp> variant NF-kappa B segments <END> into <START:ggp> LTR-driven CAT expression vectors <END> confirmed a correlation between promoter activity and replicative/cytopathic capacity . 
Multiple <START:ggp> Oct2 isoforms <END> are generated by alternative splicing . 
The interaction of the <START:ggp> Oct2 transcription factor <END> with the <START:ggp> cognate octamer motif <END> ATGCAAAT is a critical determinant of the lymphoid-specific expression of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin genes <END> . 
Ectopic expression of <START:ggp> cloned Oct2 cDNA <END> was shown to be sufficient to reconstitute at least some aspects of this regulation in <START:ana> non-lymphoid cells <END> . 
We describe the isolation and characterization of <START:ggp> multiple cDNAs <END> encoding <START:ggp> mouse Oct2 <END> from a <START:ana> mature B-cell line <END> and we show that a variety of isoforms of this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> is generated from a single gene by an alternative splicing mechanism . 
All the <START:ggp> isoforms <END> retain the previously characterized POU-domain and are therefore able to bind to the <START:ggp> octamer motif <END> . 
Different amounts of the various <START:ggp> isoforms <END> are present within the same <START:ana> B-cell <END> regardless of the developmental stage of <START:ana> B-cell <END> differentiation and at least some of the <START:ggp> isoforms <END> are conserved between mouse and humans . 
In cotransfection experiments we show that all the <START:ggp> isoforms <END> are able to activate an <START:ggp> octamer <END> containing <START:ggp> promoter element <END> in fibroblasts revealing an unexpected functional redundancy . 
Finally , we show that one of the <START:ggp> isoforms <END> encodes the previously described <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific Oct2B protein <END> which has been suggested to be involved in the function of the <START:ggp> octamer motif <END> in the context of the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) enhancer <END> . 
[ Regulation of intracellular cholesterol synthesis in hypercholesterolemia by glucocorticoids ] 
The rate of endogenous cholesterol synthesis in <START:ana> blood lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> skin fibroblasts <END> from patients with type IIa hyperlipidemia was found to be increased in comparison with healthy donors . 
The cells of hyperlipidemic patients had lowered levels of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> concomitantly with a partial loss of their sensitivity to glucocorticoids . 
In <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> from patients with hereditary hypercholesteremia of homozygous type the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> did not exceed 10 % of their content in <START:ana> normal cells <END> . 
The decrease of the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in patients with type IIa hyperlipidemia seems to be a compensatory response of cells culminating in activation of endogenous cholesterol synthesis . 
Negative regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression in monocytes : role of the <START:ggp> 65-kDa <END> plus <START:ggp> 50-kDa NF-kappa B dimer <END> . 
Although monocytic cells can provide a reservoir for viral production in vivo , their regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) transcription can be either latent , restricted , or productive . 
These differences in gene expression have not been molecularly defined . 
In <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> with restricted HIV expression , there is an absence of <START:ggp> DNA-protein binding complex <END> formation with the <START:ggp> HIV-1 promoter-enhancer <END> associated with markedly less <START:ana> viral RNA <END> production . 
This absence of binding was localized to the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B region <END> of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 enhancer <END> ; the <START:ggp> 65-kDa plus 50-kDa NF-kappa B heterodimer <END> was preferentially lost . 
Adding purified <START:ggp> NF-kappa B protein <END> to nuclear extracts from cells with restricted expression overcomes this lack of binding . 
In addition , treatment of these nuclear extracts with sodium deoxycholate restored their ability to form the <START:ggp> heterodimer <END> , suggesting the presence of an inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity . 
Furthermore , treatment of nuclear extracts from these cells that had restricted expression with lipopolysaccharide increased viral production and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity . 
Antiserum specific for <START:ggp> NF-kappa B binding proteins <END> , but not c-rel-specific antiserum , disrupted <START:ggp> heterodimer complex <END> formation . 
Thus , both <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-binding complexes <END> are needed for optimal viral transcription . 
Binding of the <START:ggp> 65-kDa <END> plus <START:ggp> 50-kDa heterodimer <END> to the <START:ggp> HIV-1 enhancer <END> can be negatively regulated in <START:ana> monocytes <END> , providing one mechanism restricting <START:ggp> HIV-1 gene <END> expression . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> normal leukocytes <END> : effects of age , gender , season , and plasma cortisol concentrations . 
We measured <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> ( <START:ana> MNL <END> ) isolated from peripheral blood of 145 apparently healthy volunteers ( 86 men and 59 women ) . 
An age-related decrease in the number of <START:ggp> GR <END> was suggested between subjects younger than 20 years and elderly subjects ; there was no apparent seasonal variation in <START:ggp> GR <END> . 
Gender difference in the number of <START:ggp> GR <END> was not significant , although women showed slightly fewer <START:ggp> GR <END> . 
Eight patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis were examined to determine whether the number of <START:ggp> GR <END> in <START:ana> MNL <END> could be down-regulated by their cognate ligands . 
The number of <START:ggp> GR <END> in <START:ana> MNL <END> from these patients was significantly decreased one month after the initiation of prednisolone therapy . 
However , in normal subjects , the <START:ggp> GR <END> in <START:ana> MNL <END> did not demonstrate circadian variation , in contrast to concentrations of plasma cortisol . 
Synergism between two distinct elements of the <START:ggp> HTLV-I enhancer <END> during activation by the <START:ggp> trans-activator <END> of HTLV-I . 
We have conducted functional studies of the <START:ggp> enhancer elements <END> of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) using the <START:ana> human T-cell lines <END> <START:ana> Jurkat <END> and <START:ana> MOLT 4 <END> , which are negative for HTLV-I , and MT-2 and TL-Mor , which carry the proviral genome of HTLV-I . 
Two distinct elements have been implicated in function of the <START:ggp> HTLV-I enhancer <END> . 
One is the <START:ggp> 21-base-pair ( bp ) core element <END> that is responsible for trans-activation by the HTLV-I <START:ggp> trans-activator <END> <START:ggp> p40tax <END> and that has the ability to bind to <START:ggp> cyclic-AMP responsive element binding factor ( CREB ) -like factor <END> ( s ) . 
The other is a region interposed between the <START:ggp> 21-bp elements <END> . 
In this study we demonstrate that a subfragment ( C26 ) in the region between the <START:ggp> 21-bp elements <END> is involved in trans-activation by <START:ggp> p40tax <END> , possibly through binding to an <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-like nuclear factor <END> or factors . 
Formation of the <START:ggp> protein-DNA complex <END> with the <START:ggp> C26 subfragment <END> was positively affected by <START:ggp> p40tax <END> . 
The <START:ggp> C26 element <END> conferred partial responsiveness to <START:ggp> p40tax <END> when linked to one copy of the <START:ggp> 21-bp element <END> that , by itself , showed little activation in response to <START:ggp> p40tax <END> . 
However , the <START:ggp> C26 element <END> alone , even when repeated , could not be activated by <START:ggp> p40tax <END> , unlike other <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-binding elements <END> . 
In contrast , the <START:ggp> C26 element <END> itself was profoundly activated upon stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate . 
These findings therefore suggest that the <START:ggp> HTLV-I enhancer <END> contains <START:ggp> multiple functional elements <END> , including binding sites for at least <START:ggp> CREB- and NF-kappa B-like factors <END> , which synergistically cooperate in activation of the <START:ggp> HTLV-I enhancer <END> in response to <START:ggp> p40tax <END> . 
Our results also demonstrate that TPA-dependent activation of the <START:ggp> HTLV-I enhancer <END> may be mediated through the <START:ggp> C26 element <END> . 
Human <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> gene regulation in phorbol ester <START:ana> stimulated T and B cell lines <END> . 
The minimal region of the <START:ggp> human tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) gene promoter <END> necessary for its transcriptional induction by phorbol esters ( PMA ) in <START:ana> human T and B lymphocyte cell lines <END> has been localized between <START:ggp> -52 and +89 nucleotides <END> ( nt ) relative to the gene 's <START:ggp> transcriptional start site <END> . 
Comparison of these sequences to those required to mediate virus or lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induction of the gene reveal significant differences , and thus , the sequence requirements for PMA induction are distinct from those that mediate induction by virus or LPS . 
Although three sites in the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha promoter <END> ( kappa 1 , kappa 2 , and kappa 3 ) specifically bind the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in lymphoid nuclear extracts , <START:ana> TNF-alpha mRNA <END> induction by PMA does not correlate with <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activities displayed by different <START:ana> T and B cell lines <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> kappa 1-kappa 3 <END> can each be deleted from the <START:ggp> TNF-alpha promoter <END> with little effect on the gene 's inducibility by PMA . 
Therefore , <START:ana> TNF-alpha mRNA <END> induction by PMA , like its induction by virus and LPS , is not primarily mediated by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , but rather is mediated through other sequences and <START:ggp> protein factors <END> . 
Surprisingly , multimers of kappa 1-kappa 3 can confer PMA inducibility on a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> in a <START:ana> B ( Raji ) , but not a T ( HUT78 ) cell line <END> . 
However they are not functional on a truncated <START:ggp> TNF-alpha promoter <END> , indicating that promoter context and cell type specificity influence the PMA inducible function of these <START:ggp> NF-kappa B binding sites <END> . 
Differentiation-associated expression of the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus BZLF1 transactivator protein <END> in oral hairy leukoplakia . 
The <START:ggp> BZLF1 protein <END> of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a key <START:ggp> immediate-early protein <END> which has been shown to disrupt virus latency in <START:ana> EBV-infected B cells <END> . 
We have generated a <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> , <START:ggp> BZ1 <END> , to <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> which reacts in immunohistology , immunoblotting , and immunoprecipitation and which recognizes both the <START:ggp> active , dimeric form <END> and the <START:ggp> inactive , monomeric form <END> of the protein . 
Biopsies of oral hairy leukoplakia , an AIDS-associated lesion characterized by high-level EBV replication , were examined by immunohistochemistry using the <START:ggp> BZ1 <END> <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> . 
A differentiation-associated pattern of <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> expression was observed , <START:ggp> BZ1 <END> reacting with nuclei of the upper spinous layer of the lesion . 
This finding suggests that the <START:ggp> BZLF1 promoter <END> may be regulated by the degree of squamous differentiation . 
A comparison of in situ hybridization to <START:ggp> EBV DNA <END> and <START:ggp> viral capsid antigen <END> staining with <START:ggp> BZ1 <END> reactivity suggested that <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> expression precedes rampant virus replication . 
The inability to detect EBV in the lower epithelial layers of oral hairy leukoplakia raises questions concerning the nature of EBV latency and persistence in stratified squamous epithelium . 
[ Changes in levels of <START:ggp> leucocytic estrogen receptor <END> in patients with menopausal type II diabetes and its significance ] 
The number of <START:ggp> estrogen receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) in <START:ana> human peripheral leucocytes <END> in 12 women with menopausal type II diabetes was measured with radio-ligand binding method . 
The results were compared with those of 12 menopausal women without diabetes and 12 normal women of childbearing age . 
It was found that the number of <START:ggp> ER <END> in the patients was significantly decreased . 
Our data indicate that decrease of <START:ggp> ER <END> level in <START:ana> leukocytes <END> may be related to the pathogenesis of type II diabetes in menopausal period . 
Lymphocyte <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> number in posttraumatic stress disorder . 
OBJECTIVE : The authors ' objective was to investigate the possibility that <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> changes may be involved in the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis in posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . 
METHOD : They measured the number of <START:ggp> lymphocyte cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors <END> and plasma cortisol concentrations in 15 consecutively admitted male combat Vietnam veterans with PTSD and in a normal comparison group of 11 subjects . 
RESULTS : Both the patients and the normal comparison subjects showed a morning-to-afternoon decline in <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> concentrations , paralleling the normal diurnal decline in cortisol levels . 
The number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> was 63 % greater in the morning and 26 % greater in the afternoon in the patients with PTSD than in the normal subjects . 
No group differences in cortisol levels were observed , nor were <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> number and cortisol levels correlated . 
The number of <START:ggp> morning glucocorticoid receptors <END> was positively correlated with symptoms of PTSD and anxiety . 
CONCLUSIONS : These results provide further evidence for a dysregulation of the HPA axis in PTSD . 
The finding that patients with PTSD had a substantially greater number of <START:ggp> lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptors <END> than normal comparison subjects is consistent with the authors ' previous observations of low 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion in subjects with PTSD . 
Furthermore , the receptor changes observed are opposite of those reported in major depressive disorder . 
The present data , along with other findings of HPA abnormalities in PTSD , support the possibility of a greater negative feedback sensitivity at one or more levels of the HPA axis . 
Induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> during monocyte differentiation is associated with activation of HIV-gene expression . 
Cells of the <START:ana> monocyte-macrophage lineage <END> are important targets of HIV infection . 
We report here that the phenotypic differentiation of <START:ana> monocyte cell lines <END> induced by phorbol esters or <START:ggp> tumour necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> ) is associated with expression of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) . 
In parallel with such differentiation , HIV transcription , monitored using an <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat reporter gene construct <END> , is activated in such cells under the influence of enhanced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> expression . 
Also , in a <START:ana> promonocyte cell line <END> chronically infected with HIV , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> expression and HIV transcription were enhanced on stimulation with phorbol ester or <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> . 
Thus , stimulation of <START:ana> monocyte cell lines <END> by phorbol esters or <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> induces cell differentiation and activates HIV transcription . 
Such a process may have fundamental implications in AIDS pathogenesis in vivo and may be important in disease progression induced by opportunistic infections directly or indirectly involving <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
Demonstration of <START:ggp> estrogen and progesterone receptors <END> as well as <START:ggp> Ki-67 and p-145 antigens <END> in <START:ana> single tumor cells <END> from blood and pleural effusions using a slide assay . 
We describe a slide assay that allows the demonstration of <START:ggp> antigens <END> localized in the nucleus from <START:ana> isolated white blood cells <END> as well as from <START:ana> single tumor cells <END> derived from malignant effusions . 
With the antibodies <START:ggp> Ki-67 <END> and <START:ggp> anti-p-145 <END> an increased rate of nuclear and nucleolar staining resulted in cells from highly malignant lymphomas . 
An almost identical reaction was obtained when <START:ana> tumor cells <END> from malignant effusions were tested . 
Cells isolated from the blood of patients with leukemic spread of lymphomas of low malignancy yielded a weak staining comparable to that of <START:ana> normal mesothelial cells <END> from non-tumorous cavity fluids . 
The detection of <START:ggp> estrogen <END> and <START:ggp> progesterone receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> and <START:ggp> PR <END> ) localized in the cell nucleus can be achieved by the same assay . 
The reaction is enhanced by incubation of the <START:ana> tumor cells <END> for 30 min at 37 degrees C prior to fixation . 
Pleural effusions from 20 patients with breast cancer were tested . 
<START:ggp> ER <END> was positive in 13 and <START:ggp> PR <END> was positive in 12 of the 20 samples . 
In 5 cases there was a divergent reaction with <START:ggp> ER <END> and <START:ggp> PR <END> antibody . 
The <START:ggp> hormone receptors <END> of the primary tumor were known in 15 ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) and 14 ( <START:ggp> PR <END> ) patients , respectively . 
In each cohort there was only one case with a negative reaction of the primary tumor and a positive reaction with the isolated <START:ana> tumor cells <END> from the pleural effusions . 
These results indicate that the demonstration of <START:ggp> hormone receptor proteins <END> in cells from malignant effusions is possible and that there is a correlation with the status of the primary site of cancer . 
Constitutive activation of <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> in <START:ana> human thymocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kB <END> is a <START:ggp> eukaryotic transcription regulatory factor <END> . 
In <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> T cell lines <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> is bound to a <START:ggp> cytoplasmic proteic inhibitor <END> , the <START:ggp> IkB <END> . 
Treatment of <START:ana> T cells <END> with mitogens ( phorbol esters ) or <START:ggp> cytokines <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> ) induces <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> nuclear translocation and the subsequent expression of <START:ggp> NF-kB dependent T cell genes <END> . 
Here we examined the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> in <START:ana> human T cell thymic progenitors <END> . 
We report differences in ( Ca2+ ) i requirement for <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> activation in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> as compared to mature <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Furthermore , our results indicated that <START:ana> thymocytes <END> have a <START:ggp> constitutively active form <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> , suggesting that they are activated in vivo . 
<START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> , a <START:ggp> T cell-specific transcription factor <END> of the <START:ggp> HMG box family <END> , interacts with <START:ggp> sequence motifs <END> in the <START:ggp> TCR beta and TCR delta enhancers <END> . 
We have recently identified and cloned <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> , a <START:ggp> T cell-specific transcription factor <END> with specificity for the AACAAAG motif in the CD3 epsilon enhancer and for the <START:ggp> TTCAAAG motif <END> in the <START:ggp> TCR alpha enhancer <END> . 
<START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> belongs to the family of <START:ggp> transcription-regulating proteins <END> which share a region of homology termed the <START:ggp> HMG-box <END> . 
Here , we show by gel retardation analysis that <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> specifically recognizes the <START:ggp> T beta 5 element <END> of the <START:ggp> TCR beta enhancer <END> and the <START:ggp> T delta 7 element <END> of the <START:ggp> TCR delta enhancer <END> . 
Comparison of the sequences of all <START:ggp> elements <END> recognized by <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> defines a <START:ggp> consensus motif <END> <START:ggp> A/T A/T C A A/G A G <END> . 
These observations imply that <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> is involved in the control of several <START:ggp> T cell-specific genes <END> and might thus play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of the <START:ana> mature T cell phenotype <END> . 
[ Regulatory effect of <START:ggp> insulin <END> on <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> in <START:ana> human peripheral leukocytes <END> ] 
The regulatory effect of <START:ggp> insulin <END> on the specific binding power of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) of <START:ana> human leukocytes <END> was assessed by the <START:ggp> unoccupied receptor sites <END> capable of combining with [ 3H ] labelled dexamethasone measured at 3 and 24 h after incubation with various concentrations of <START:ggp> insulin <END> added to the medium . 
After 3 h incubation the specific binding power with [ 3H ] Dex was decreased by 23.3 +/- 10.0 , 32.2 +/- 13.2 and 54.3 +/- 9.2 % ( P greater than 0.05 , P greater than 0.05 and P less than 0.01 as compared with the control value of 100 in the absence of <START:ggp> insulin <END> ) respectively in the presence of 20 mU/L ( physiological testing concentration ) , 200 mU/L ( physiological upper limit ) and 2 , 000 mU/L ( pharmacological concentration ) <START:ggp> insulin <END> in the incubation medium . 
After 24 h incubation the decrease of these values increased respectively to 43.5 +/- 19.0 , 56.1 +/- 20.7 and 80.2 +/- 15.5 ( P less than 0.05 , P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.01 compared with control ) . 
Thus the inhibitory effect of <START:ggp> insulin <END> on the <START:ggp> GR <END> binding power is both dose- and time-dependent , which strongly suggests that <START:ggp> GR <END> is tonically controlled by <START:ggp> insulin <END> concentration change under physiological conditions . 
The effect of toremifene therapy on <START:ggp> serum immunoglobulin <END> levels in breast cancer . 
Estrogens and anti-estrogens enhance the number of <START:ana> immunoglobulin ( Ig ) -secreting cells <END> in <START:ana> pokeweed mitogen ( PWM ) -stimulated lymphocyte cultures <END> . 
<START:ana> Lymphocytes <END> from patients who have received anti-estrogen therapy show similar enhancement of <START:ana> Ig-secreting cells <END> after <START:ggp> PWM <END> stimulation . 
In this study the effect of anti-estrogen ( toremifene ) therapy on <START:ggp> serum immunoglobulin <END> ( <START:ggp> IgA <END> , <START:ggp> IgM <END> , <START:ggp> IgG <END> ) levels in breast cancer patients was investigated . 
Serum Ig levels were followed up to two years after or during the therapy . 
An unexpected finding was that the Ig levels decreased during the follow-up period . 
This decrease was seen in patients who responded to the therapy as well as in those who did not . 
<START:ggp> Human erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase <END> : <START:ggp> promoter <END> analysis and identification of an <START:ggp> iron-responsive element <END> in the <START:ana> mRNA <END> . 
<START:ggp> 5-Aminolevulinate synthase <END> ( <START:ggp> ALAS <END> ) catalyzes the first step of the <START:ggp> heme <END> biosynthetic pathway . 
<START:ggp> cDNA clones <END> for the <START:ggp> human erythroid ALAS isozyme <END> were isolated from a fetal liver library . 
It can be deduced that the <START:ggp> erythroid ALAS precursor protein <END> has a molecular weight of 64.6 kd , and is similar in size to the previously isolated <START:ggp> human housekeeping ALAS precursor <END> of molecular weight 70.6 kd . 
The mature mitochondrial forms of the erythroid and <START:ggp> housekeeping ALAS isozymes <END> are predicted to have molecular weights of 59.5 kd and 64.6 kd , respectively . 
The two <START:ggp> isozymes <END> show little amino acid identity in their <START:ggp> N-terminal signal sequences <END> but have considerable sequence identity in the <START:ggp> C-terminal two-thirds <END> of their proteins . 
An analysis of the <START:ggp> immediate promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> human erythroid ALAS gene <END> revealed several putative <START:ggp> erythroid-specific cis-acting elements <END> including both a <START:ggp> GATA-1 <END> and an <START:ggp> NF-E2 binding site <END> . 
An <START:ana> iron-responsive element ( IRE ) motif <END> has been identified in the 5'-untranslated region of the <START:ana> human erythroid ALAS mRNA <END> , but is not present in the <START:ana> housekeeping ALAS mRNA <END> . 
Gel retardation experiments established that this <START:ana> IRE motif <END> formed a <START:ggp> protein - RNA complex <END> with cytosolic extracts from <START:ana> human K562 cells <END> and this binding was strongly competed with <START:ana> IRE transcripts <END> from <START:ana> ferritin or transferrin receptor mRNAs <END> . 
A transcript of the <START:ggp> ALAS IRE <END> , mutated in the conserved loop of the <START:ggp> IRE <END> , did not readily form this <START:ggp> protein - RNA complex <END> . 
These results suggest that the <START:ana> IRE motif <END> in the <START:ana> ALAS mRNA <END> is functional and imply that translation of the <START:ana> mRNA <END> is controlled by cellular iron availability during erythropoiesis . 
Regulation of jun and fos gene expression in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> by the <START:ggp> macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> ) is required for the growth and differentiation of <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> . 
However , the signaling events responsible for these effects remain unclear . 
The present studies have examined the effects of <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> on potential signaling pathways involving expression of the <START:ggp> jun and fos early response genes <END> . 
Low levels of <START:ggp> c-jun transcripts <END> were detectable in <START:ana> resting human peripheral blood monocytes <END> . 
Treatment of these cells with 10 ( 3 ) units/ml <START:ggp> human recombinant M-CSF <END> was associated with rapid and transient increases in <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> levels . 
Nuclear run-on assays and mRNA stability studies demonstrated that <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> regulates <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression by both an increase in transcription rate and a prolongation in the half-life of <START:ana> c-jun transcripts <END> . 
<START:ggp> M-CSF <END> treatment was also associated with a rapid induction of the <START:ggp> jun-B gene <END> , although expression of this gene was prolonged compared to that of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> . 
We further demonstrate that <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> increases <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> levels in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> through control at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels . 
Maximal induction of the <START:ggp> c-fos gene <END> was followed by that for the <START:ggp> fos-B gene <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> -induced expression of the <START:ggp> fos-related gene <END> , <START:ggp> fra-1 <END> , was delayed compared to that for both <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> fos-B <END> . 
Taken together , the results indicate that <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> treatment is associated with differential activation of multiple members of the <START:ggp> jun/fos family <END> and that expression of these genes could contribute to nuclear signaling mechanisms that regulate a specific program of monocyte differentiation . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> in systemic lupus erythematosus . 
Glucocorticosteroids remain the major treatment modality for systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , but their mechanism of action is unclear . 
Over the past decade it has become clear that <START:ggp> glucocorticosteroid receptors <END> play a significant role in the mechanism of glucocorticosteroid action . 
We studied <START:ggp> glucocorticosteroid receptor <END> density and affinity on <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> by the glucocorticosteroid binding assay in 33 patients with SLE who had taken no glucocorticosteroid for the previous 6 months and in 32 healthy controls . 
Patients ' disease activity was measured by the SLE Disease Activity Index ( SLEDAI ) . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticosteroid receptors <END> on <START:ana> leukocytes <END> of patients with SLE were significantly higher than in healthy controls ( 4419 +/- 306 vs 3369 +/- 196 , p less than 0.005 ) . 
The binding affinity was not different between patients and controls . 
There was no correlation between <START:ggp> glucocorticosteroid receptor <END> number and SLE disease activity . 
<START:ggp> Kappa B binding proteins <END> are constitutively expressed in an <START:ana> IL-2 autocrine human T cell line <END> . 
The <START:ggp> IL-2 and the IL-2-R alpha genes <END> are both expressed transiently in <START:ana> normal T lymphocytes <END> after Ag or mitogen activation . 
In contrast , the <START:ana> human T cell line <END> , <START:ana> IARC 301 <END> , expresses these two genes constitutively and we have previously demonstrated that its growth depends on the autocrine production of this <START:ggp> T cell growth factor <END> and <START:ggp> high affinity IL-2R <END> . 
To dissect the molecular basis for the unusual persistent expression of the <START:ggp> IL-2 and IL-2-R alpha genes <END> in these <START:ana> IARC 301 <END> <START:ana> T cells <END> , we have analyzed the interactions of <START:ggp> constitutively expressed nuclear proteins <END> with the <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking regions <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 and IL-2-R alpha genes <END> using both <START:ggp> DNase I <END> footprinting and gel retardation techniques . 
We have found that a region in both genes ( -276 to -250 for <START:ggp> IL-2-R alpha <END> and -203 to -183 for <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) , which corresponds to a <START:ggp> kappa B enhancer element , <END> is specifically protected by <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> from <START:ana> IARC 301 <END> . 
In agreement with this finding , both the <START:ggp> IL-2 and IL-2-R alpha promoters <END> are active in transient transfection assays in <START:ana> IARC 301 cells <END> . 
In contrast , mutation of the <START:ggp> kappa B enhancer <END> results in markedly attenuated activities of both <START:ggp> promoters <END> . 
Two proteins binding the <START:ggp> kappa B sequence <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> KBF1 <END> , are constitutively expressed in <START:ana> IARC 301 <END> nuclei and induced by PMA and <START:ggp> PHA <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat <END> . 
They bind to the <START:ggp> kappa B motifs <END> with different relative affinities that may reflect their different contribution in the expression of various <START:ggp> promoters <END> . 
HIV1 infection of <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> promotes induction or translocation of <START:ggp> NF-KB-related factors <END> . 
In 1991 , we demonstrated , using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , that 3 different factors ( termed <START:ggp> B1 <END> , <START:ggp> B2 <END> and <START:ggp> B3 <END> ) with affinity for the <START:ggp> KB-enhancer target sequence <END> were specifically detected in nuclear extracts from <START:ana> HIV1-infected monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
The <START:ggp> B2 factor <END> was induced in the nuclei of these cells only upon HIV1 infection . 
The <START:ggp> B3 factor <END> was only slightly evident in nuclei of <START:ana> uninfected cells <END> but was readily detectable in nuclei of <START:ana> infected monocytes <END> . 
Its expression remained very low in nuclei of <START:ana> HIV1-infected macrophages <END> . 
In this paper , we demonstrate that the <START:ggp> B2 factor <END> is expressed in the cytosol of <START:ana> monocytes <END> and <START:ana> macrophages <END> as a <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> , indicating that it is not associated with an inhibitor ( IKB ) . 
This factor remained clustered in the cytosol and was translocated to the nuclei only after HIV1 infection . 
The <START:ggp> B3 factor <END> is detected in the cytosol only when cells are HIV1-infected . 
The role of HIV1 infection in the expression and the translocation of these factors is discussed . 
Identification and cloning of <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> , a <START:ggp> T lymphocyte-specific transcription factor <END> containing a <START:ggp> sequence-specific HMG box <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD3 <END> -epsilon expression is controlled by a <START:ggp> downstream T lymphocyte-specific enhancer element <END> . 
We report the identification of a <START:ggp> T cell-specific transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> , binding to this element . 
The <START:ggp> multimerized recognition motif <END> of <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> constituted a T cell-specific enhancer . 
Subsequent cloning of <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> identified three <START:ggp> splice alternatives <END> . 
<START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> contained a single <START:ggp> DNA-binding HMG box <END> most closely related to similar boxes in the <START:ggp> putative mammalian sex-determining gene <END> <START:ggp> SRY <END> and in the <START:ggp> Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mc mating type gene <END> . 
<START:ana> TCF-1 mRNA <END> was expressed uniquely in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Upon cotransfection into <START:ana> non-T cells <END> , <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> could transactivate through its cognate motif . 
These results identify <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> as a <START:ggp> T cell-specific transcription factor <END> , which might play a role in the establishment of the <START:ana> mature T cell phenotype <END> . 
Identification of <START:ggp> transcriptional suppressor proteins <END> that bind to the <START:ggp> negative regulatory element <END> of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 . 
Two different proteins which independently bound to neighboring sequences within the <START:ggp> negative regulatory element <END> ( <START:ggp> NRE <END> ) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) were detected in the nuclear extract of a <START:ana> virus-infected human T cell line <END> . 
One of the factors bound to a <START:ggp> novel dyad symmetrical sequence <END> . 
This sequence is well conserved in various HIV-1 isolates and partial homology was found with the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> of the <START:ggp> human retinoblastoma gene <END> . 
Similar DNA binding activity was detected in a variety of <START:ana> virus-uninfected human T cell lines <END> and <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> by means of a gel mobility shift assay . 
The other factor bound to a <START:ggp> putative AP-1 recognition sequence <END> predicted for the HIV-1 <START:ggp> NRE <END> . 
However , this factor did not bind to a typical <START:ggp> AP-1 site <END> . 
The insertion of multiple copies of the <START:ggp> binding site <END> for the former or latter factor into a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> reduced the promoter activity to one-tenth or one-third , respectively . 
Thus , each factor may function as a <START:ggp> novel negative regulator <END> of transcription . 
<START:ggp> Protein kinase C <END> activation and <START:ggp> protooncogene <END> expression in differentiation/retrodifferentiation of <START:ana> human U-937 leukemia cells <END> . 
<START:ana> Human U-937 leukemia cells <END> differentiate along the <START:ana> monocytic lineage <END> following 3-day exposures to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) . 
This induction of differentiation is accompanied by adherence and loss of proliferation , as well as expression/repression of <START:ggp> differentiation-associated genes <END> . 
Long term culture of <START:ana> TPA-differentiated U-937 cells <END> in the absence of phorbol ester for 32-36 days resulted in a process of retrodifferentiation . 
The retrodifferentiated cells detached from the substrate and reinitiated proliferation . 
Other cellular parameters , such as glycosidase activities , <START:ggp> cytokine <END> release , and filament expression , returned to levels similar to that observed in <START:ana> uninduced cells <END> . 
Treatment of <START:ana> U-937 cells <END> with TPA resulted in a rapid translocation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) from the cytosol to cell membrane fractions within 2-8 min . 
Increased levels of membrane-associated <START:ggp> PKC <END> activity persisted until 17-29 days . 
However , longer periods of incubation were associated with a return to the distribution of <START:ggp> PKC <END> in control cells . 
Activation of <START:ggp> PKC <END> has been implicated in the regulation of certain <START:ggp> immediate early response genes <END> , and in the present studies , TPA rapidly induced <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-jun gene expression <END> . 
Levels of <START:ana> c-fos and c-jun transcripts <END> remained elevated during periods of <START:ggp> PKC <END> activation and also returned to levels observed in control cells by 30-36 days , when the cells entered retrodifferentiation . 
Staurosporine , a nonspecific inhibitor of <START:ggp> PKC <END> , partially blocked TPA-induced adherence and growth inhibition and concomitantly prevented TPA-induced c-fos and c-jun gene expression . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
<START:ggp> Kappa B-specific DNA binding proteins <END> are differentially inhibited by enhancer mutations and biological oxidation . 
<START:ggp> Kappa B ( kappa B ) enhancer binding proteins <END> isolated from the nuclei of activated <START:ana> human T cells <END> produce two distinct <START:ggp> nucleoprotein complexes <END> when incubated with the <START:ggp> kappa B element <END> from the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor-alpha ( IL-2R alpha ) gene <END> . 
These two <START:ggp> DNA-protein complexes <END> are composed of at least four host proteins ( <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p55 <END> , <START:ggp> p75 <END> , <START:ggp> p85 <END> ) , each of which shares structural similarity with the <START:ggp> v-rel oncogene product <END> . 
Nuclear expression of these proteins is induced with distinctly biphasic kinetics following phorbol ester activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> p55/p75 early <END> and <START:ggp> p50/p85 late <END> ) . 
DNA-protein crosslinking studies have revealed that the more rapidly migrating <START:ggp> B2 complex <END> contains both <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p55 <END> while the more slowly migrating <START:ggp> B1 complex <END> is composed of <START:ggp> p50 <END> , <START:ggp> p55 <END> , <START:ggp> p75 <END> , and <START:ggp> p85 <END> . 
Site-directed mutagenesis of the <START:ggp> wild-type IL-2R alpha kappa B enhancer <END> ( GGGGAATCTCCC ) has revealed that the binding of p50 and <START:ggp> p55 <END> ( <START:ggp> B2 complex <END> ) is particularly sensitive to alteration of the <START:ggp> 5 ' triplet <END> of deoxyguanosine residues . 
In contrast , formation of the <START:ggp> B1 complex <END> , reflecting the binding of <START:ggp> p75 <END> and <START:ggp> p85 <END> , critically depends upon the more 3 ' sequences of this <START:ggp> enhancer element <END> . 
DNA binding by all four of these <START:ggp> Rel-related factors <END> is blocked by selective chemical modification of lysine and arginine residues , suggesting that both of these basic amino acids are required for binding to the <START:ggp> kappa B element <END> . 
Similarly , covalent modification of free sulfhydryl groups with diamide ( reversible ) or N-ethylmaleimide ( irreversible ) results in a complete loss of DNA binding activity . 
In contrast , mild oxidation with <START:ggp> glucose oxidase <END> selectively inhibits <START:ggp> p75 <END> and <START:ggp> p85 <END> binding while not blocking <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p55 <END> interactions . 
These findings suggest that reduced cysteine thiols play an important role in the DNA binding activity of this family of <START:ggp> Rel-related transcription factors <END> . 
[ Changes in leucocytic <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> levels in patients with climacteric syndrome and therapeutic effect of liuwei dihuang pills ] 
The numbers of <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) in <START:ana> human peripheral leucocytes <END> in 22 women with climacteric syndrome were measured by radioligand method . 
The results were compared with those of 12 normal child-bearing-age women . 
It wat found that the contents of <START:ggp> leucocytic ER <END> in climacteric syndrome patients were significantly lower than normal child-bearing-age women . 
The authors used a Chinese prescription -- Liuwei Dihuang Pills ( LDP ) to treat the patients for 2 months . 
The numbers of <START:ggp> leucocytic ER <END> were significantly increased after treatment . 
The data indicate that decrease of <START:ggp> ER <END> levels in cell may involve in the pathogenesis of climacteric syndrome . 
LDP not only increases plasma estradiol levels , but also increases the leucocytic <START:ggp> ER <END> levels . 
This may be the basis of the therapeutic effect on the disease . 
Evaluation of the role of ligand and thermal activation of specific DNA binding by <START:ggp> in vitro synthesized human glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
We have used a DNA-binding/immunoprecipitation assay to analyze the capacity of <START:ggp> human glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> hGR <END> ) , generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates , to bind DNA . 
<START:ggp> In vitro translated hGR <END> was indistinguishable from <START:ggp> native hGR <END> , as determined by migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels , sedimentation on sucrose density gradients , and reactivity with <START:ggp> antipeptide antibodies <END> generated against <START:ggp> hGR <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> cell-free synthesized hGR <END> was capable of specific binding to <START:ggp> glucocorticoid response element ( GRE ) -containing DNA fragments <END> . 
Using this assay system , we have evaluated the contributions of ligand binding and heat activation to DNA binding by these <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> . 
<START:ggp> In vitro translated hGR <END> was capable of selective DNA binding even in the absence of glucocorticoid . 
Treatment with dexamethasone or the antiglucocorticoid RU486 had no additional effect on the DNA-binding capacity when receptor preparations were maintained at 0 C ( no activation ) . 
In contrast , addition of either ligand or antagonist in combination with a heat activation step promoted DNA binding by approximately 3-fold over that of heat-activated <START:ggp> unliganded receptors <END> . 
Agonist ( dexamethasone ) was slightly more effective in supporting specific DNA binding than antagonist ( RU486 ) . 
DNA binding by <START:ggp> in vitro synthesized GR <END> was blocked by the addition of sodium molybdate to the receptor preparations before steroid addition and thermal activation . 
Addition of KCl resulted in less DNA binding either due to blockage of DNA- <START:ggp> receptor complex <END> formation or disruption of the complexes . 
The specificity of DNA binding by <START:ggp> cell-free synthesized hGR <END> was analyzed further by examining the abilities of <START:ggp> various DNAs <END> to compete for binding to a naturally occurring <START:ggp> GRE <END> found in the <START:ggp> mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat <END> . 
Oligonucleotides containing the <START:ggp> consensus GRE <END> were the most efficient competitors , and fragments containing <START:ggp> regulatory sequences <END> from <START:ggp> glucocorticoid-repressible genes <END> were somewhat competitive , whereas single stranded oligonucleotides were unable to compete for <START:ggp> mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat <END> DNA binding , except when competitor was present at extremely high concentrations . 
Together these studies indicate that <START:ggp> hGR <END> synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates displays many of the same properties , including <START:ggp> GRE <END> -specific DNA binding , observed for <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> present in cytosolic extracts of <START:ana> mammalian cells <END> and tissues . 
Similarities between the effects of dexamethasone and RU486 suggest that the antiglucocorticoid properties of RU486 do not occur at the level of specific DNA binding . 
Expression of <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptors <END> on <START:ana> alveolar lymphocytes <END> from patients with pulmonary granulomatous diseases . 
1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 is known to be produced at sites of granulomatous reactions . 
In order to characterize the cell types that are targets for this immunoregulatory hormone , we have evaluated the expression of <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptors <END> on <START:ana> peripheral blood T-lymphocytes <END> and those recovered from the lung by bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with pulmonary granulomatous diseases ( tuberculosis and sarcoidosis ) and from normal control subjects using combined autoradiographic and immunohistochemical techniques . 
Lavage T-lymphocytes from patients with tuberculosis or with sarcoidosis , but not those from normal control subjects , expressed <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptors <END> as demonstrated by binding of [ 3H ] 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 , which was inhibited by the presence of excess unlabeled 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 , but not by the presence of unlabeled 25 ( OH ) D3 ( <START:ana> receptor-positive lymphocytes <END> : sarcoidosis , 20 +/- 12 % ; tuberculosis , 31 +/- 17 % ) . 
In contrast , <START:ana> blood lymphocytes <END> from patients with granulomatous diseases did not express detectable <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptors <END> . 
The percentage of <START:ana> lavage T-lymphocytes <END> expressing <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptors <END> was significantly greater for patients with tuberculosis presenting with isolated hilar adenopathy than for patients with pulmonary infiltrates and/or cavities . 
<START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptors <END> were expressed to a greater extent on <START:ana> CD8+ T-lymphocytes <END> than on <START:ana> CD4+ T-lymphocytes <END> in sarcoidosis , whereas a greater proportion of <START:ana> CD4+ <END> than of <START:ana> CD8+ T-lymphocytes <END> from patients with tuberculosis were receptor-positive . 
These findings support the conclusion that the interaction of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 with its receptor on <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> may play an important role in the regulation of granulomatous reactions , but because these receptors are expressed on different <START:ana> lymphocyte populations <END> , the net effect of this potent <START:ggp> immunoregulatory molecule <END> is likely different in sarcoidosis and tuberculosis . 
Role for the <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 <END> in <START:ggp> viral promoter <END> switching during initial stages of infection . 
During latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection of <START:ana> human B lymphocytes <END> , <START:ggp> six viral nuclear antigen <END> ( <START:ggp> EBNAs <END> ) are expressed from <START:ana> long primary transcripts <END> by means of <START:ana> alternative splicing <END> and <START:ana> alternative polyadenylylation sites <END> . 
These transcripts initiate from one of two <START:ggp> promoters <END> , <START:ggp> Cp <END> or Wp , that function in a mutually exclusive fashion . 
Wp is exclusively utilized during the initial stages of infection of <START:ana> primary B lymphocytes <END> , followed by a switch to <START:ggp> Cp <END> usage . 
These studies have been extended to show that ( i ) a mutant EBV strain lacking the gene encoding <START:ggp> EBNA 2 <END> fails to switch from Wp to <START:ggp> Cp <END> usage in <START:ana> primary B lymphocytes <END> , although the virus contains a functional <START:ggp> Cp <END> ; ( ii ) a region from <START:ggp> -429 to -245 base pairs <END> upstream of <START:ggp> Cp <END> is essential for <START:ggp> Cp <END> activity in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> , but only in the context of <START:ggp> upstream and downstream sequences <END> ; ( iii ) this region contains an <START:ggp> EBNA 2-dependent enhancer <END> ; and ( iv ) <START:ggp> DNase I <END> protection employing nuclear extracts from <START:ana> B and T lymphocytes <END> revealed a <START:ggp> B-cell-specific footprint <END> in the region of the <START:ggp> EBNA 2-dependent enhancer <END> . 
These results support a model for <START:ggp> viral promoter <END> switching during the initial stages of infection in which Wp activity leads to the expression of <START:ggp> EBNA 2 <END> , followed by activation of <START:ggp> Cp <END> through the <START:ggp> EBNA 2-dependent enhancer <END> . 
Immune response of <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> to <START:ggp> HBx-antigen <END> of hepatitis B virus . 
The <START:ggp> hepatitis B virus genome <END> encodes a <START:ggp> transcriptional transactivator protein <END> designated <START:ggp> HBxAg <END> . 
We have investigated whether this antigen is a target structure for <START:ana> human T-lymphocytes <END> . 
Using <START:ggp> recombinant HBxAg protein <END> , we found <START:ggp> HBxAg <END> -specific stimulation of <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> in patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection ( 6 of 6 ) and chronic hepatitis B virus infection ( 6 of 17 ) but not in healthy individuals . 
With <START:ggp> HBxAg <END> -specific synthetic polypeptides , several T-cell epitopes were identified . 
Most were located in the <START:ggp> carboxyterminal half <END> of the <START:ggp> HBxAg protein <END> . 
Five <START:ana> T-cell clones <END> specific for a <START:ggp> T-cell epitope <END> located at the <START:ggp> carboxyterminal region <END> of <START:ggp> HBxAg <END> were established and found to belong to the <START:ana> CD2/CD4-positive , CD8-negative subtype <END> . 
These data establish for the first time <START:ggp> HBxAg <END> as an antigen in the cellular immune response . 
[ Changes in <START:ggp> leucocytic estrogen receptor <END> levels in patients with gynecomastia ] 
The number of <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) in <START:ana> human peripheral leucocytes <END> in 13 men with gynecomastia were measured by radioligand binding method. The results were compared with those of 13 sex-and age-matched healthy subjects . 
It was found that the number of <START:ggp> ER <END> in <START:ana> leucocytes <END> was significantly increased in gynecomastia ( Rs of <START:ana> leucocytes <END> were 1054 +/- 254 sites/cell ) . 
It suggested that increase of ER levels play an important role in the pathogenesis of gynecomastia . 
The <START:ggp> NF kappa B independent cis-acting sequences <END> in <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> responsive to T-cell activation . 
The rate of transcription initiation directed by the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( LTR ) of HIV-1 increases in response to mitogenic stimuli of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Here we show that the response of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> may be governed by two independent sequences located 5 ' to the site of transcription initiation sequences that bind either <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> or <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> . 
The rate of <START:ggp> LTR <END> -directed gene expression increased in response to treatment with either a phorbol ester or <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> if either the <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> or <START:ggp> NF kappa B binding sites <END> were deleted , but failed to respond to these mitogenic stimuli if both sequences were absent . 
The HIV-1 mutant virus containing both <START:ggp> NF kappa B and NFAT-1 deletion <END> was able to replicate although at a much decreased growth rate , while the deletion of <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> alone increased the viral growth rate in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
Neither deletion of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> nor deletion of <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> decreased activation of viral replication by phorbol ester . 
cAMP-dependent regulation of proenkephalin by <START:ggp> JunD <END> and <START:ggp> JunB <END> : positive and negative effects of <START:ggp> AP-1 proteins <END> . 
We demonstrate that <START:ggp> JunD <END> , a component of the <START:ggp> AP-1 transcription factor complex <END> , activates transcription of the <START:ggp> human proenkephalin gene <END> in a fashion that is completely dependent upon the <START:ggp> cAMP-dependent protein kinase <END> , <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> . 
Activation of proenkephalin transcription by <START:ggp> JunD <END> is dependent upon a previously characterized <START:ggp> cAMP- , phorbol ester- , and Ca ( 2+ ) -inducible enhancer <END> , and <START:ggp> JunD <END> is shown to bind the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> as a <START:ggp> homodimer <END> . 
Another component of the <START:ggp> AP-1 transcription complex <END> , <START:ggp> JunB <END> , is shown to inhibit activation mediated by <START:ggp> JunD <END> . 
As a homodimer <START:ggp> JunB <END> is unable to bind the enhancer ; however in the presence of <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> , high-affinity binding is observed . 
Furthermore , <START:ggp> JunD <END> is shown to activate transcription of genes linked to both cAMP and phorbol ester response elements in a <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> -dependent fashion , further blurring the distinction between these <START:ggp> response elements <END> . 
These results demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of an <START:ggp> AP-1-related protein <END> is regulated by the cAMP-dependent second-messenger pathway and suggest that <START:ggp> JunD <END> and other <START:ggp> AP-1-related proteins <END> may play an important role in the regulation of gene expression by cAMP-dependent intracellular signaling pathways . 
[ Plasma cortisol concentration and blood leukocyte content of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in patients with deficiency-cold vs deficiency-heat syndromes ] 
Plasma cortisol concentration and blood leukocyte content of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GCR <END> ) were assayed in 20 patients with deficiency syndromes , 10 cold in property ( deficiency-cold ) , the other 10 hot in property ( deficiency-heat ) , and also in 10 healthy individuals as normal control for the purpose of investigating the nature of cold and heat syndromes . 
As a result , the cases of deficiency-cold syndrome ( DCS ) had a normal concentration of plasma cortisol but a lowered content of <START:ggp> GCR <END> in <START:ana> leukocytes <END> when compared with the normal control ( P less than 0.05 ) ; the cases of deficiency-heat syndrome ( DHS ) had a higher concentration of plasma cortisol than the normal control ( P less than 0.05 ) and a slightly higher content of <START:ggp> GCR <END> in <START:ana> leukocytes <END> . 
It was concluded that the DCS is characterized by diminished biological effects of adrenocortical activity , while the DHS , by augmented biological effects of adrenocortical activity . 
The role of <START:ggp> jun and fos gene family members <END> in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced hemopoietic differentiation . 
Terminal differentiation of the <START:ana> leukemic cell lines <END> <START:ana> U-937 <END> and <START:ana> HL-60 <END> by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate is accompanied by marked changes in gene expression . 
In this study , we demonstrate that the expression of <START:ggp> jun and fos gene family members <END> is induced with variable kinetics during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced differentiation , with <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression best paralleling differentiation . 
The generation of <START:ggp> AP-1 complexes <END> , as measured by DNA binding activity , closely parallels morphological differentiation . 
Furthermore , the ability of these complexes to regulate gene expression is demonstrated by increased transcription from an <START:ggp> AP-1 driven reporter construct <END> and marked increases in the expression of <START:ggp> endogenous AP-1 regulated genes <END> . 
Differentiation assays using water soluble phorbol esters reveal that differentiation becomes irreversible soon after <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> appears . 
This tight correlation between <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression , the generation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> activity , and differentiation suggests a critical role for this gene and <START:ggp> transcriptional complex <END> during this process . 
Nuclear association of a <START:ggp> T-cell transcription factor <END> blocked by FK-506 and cyclosporin A [ see comments ] 
Cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibit T- and B-cell activation and other processes essential to an effective immune response . 
In <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> these drugs disrupt an unknown step in the transmission of signals from the <START:ggp> T-cell antigen receptor <END> to <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> that coordinate the immune response . 
The <START:ggp> putative intracellular receptors <END> for FK506 and cyclosporin are cis-trans prolyl isomerases . 
Binding of the drug inhibits <START:ggp> isomerase <END> activity , but studies with other prolyl <START:ggp> isomerase <END> inhibitors and analysis of <START:ana> cyclosporin-resistant mutants <END> in yeast suggest that the effects of the drug result from the formation of an <START:ggp> inhibitory complex <END> between the drug and <START:ggp> isomerase <END> , and not from inhibition of <START:ggp> isomerase <END> activity . 
A <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , which is essential for early T-cell gene activation , seems to be a specific target of cyclosporin A and FK506 action because transcription directed by this protein is blocked in <START:ana> T cells <END> treated with these drugs , with little or no effect on other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> such as <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Here we demonstrate that <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> is formed when a signal from the <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> induces a pre-existing cytoplasmic subunit to translocate to the nucleus and combine with a newly synthesized nuclear subunit of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> . 
FK506 and cyclosporin A block translocation of the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic component <END> without affecting synthesis of the <START:ggp> nuclear subunit <END> . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> in anorexia nervosa . 
OBJECTIVE : The aim was to explore the down-regulation of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> during hypercortisolaemia in anorexia nervosa . 
DESIGN : Urine and plasma samples were obtained for cortisol determination and <START:ana> blood lymphocytes <END> were isolated for receptor binding studies . 
PATIENTS : Sixteen anorexic patients , aged 16-27 years , with a mean +/- SEM body mass index of 14.2 +/- 2.0 ( ranging from 11.1 to 17.4 ) , and 15 normal women were studied . 
Six patients were reinvestigated after a significant weight gain . 
MEASUREMENTS : The binding capacity and affinity of the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> were measured with dexamethasone as ligand on <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
RESULTS : In patients , both total and free plasma cortisol concentrations were higher than in the normal women , as was their urinary free cortisol ; the number of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> per cell ( Ro ) and the binding affinity ( Kd ) for dexamethasone were , however , not significantly different ( Ro : 7687 +/- 1750 vs 7347 +/- 1285 sites/cell ; Kd : 7.7 +/- 2.4 vs 7.4 +/- 1.7 nM at 24 degrees C ) . 
After weight gain ( 14 +/- 2 to 16 +/- 2 kg/m2 ) , receptor numbers were 8421 +/- 2126 ( pre ) and 9011 +/- 500 ( post ) sites/cell , which are not significantly different ( P greater than 0.2 ) ; the Kd was unchanged ( 9.3 +/- 2.6 vs 9.2 +/- 2.4 nM ) . 
CONCLUSIONS Hypercortisolaemia does not down-regulate the lymphocyte <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in anorexia nervosa and a post-receptor defect might be involved in peripheral tissue resistance to the effects of glucocorticoid hormones in undernutrition . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> protein phosphatases <END> by okadaic acid induces <START:ggp> AP1 <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> . 
To examine the role of <START:ggp> protein phosphatases <END> in T cell activation , <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> were treated with okadaic acid , an inhibitor of <START:ggp> type 1 and 2A phosphatases <END> , and nuclear extracts were examined for the presence of <START:ggp> AP1 <END> as a measure of early T cell activation . 
Okadaic acid was found to be a potent inducer of <START:ggp> AP1 <END> . 
In contrast to phorbol esters such as phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , the induction of <START:ggp> AP1 <END> by okadaic acid occurs predominantly by transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> jun and fos family <END> of <START:ggp> proto-oncogenes <END> . 
Surprisingly , while the addition of <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> further enhanced the induction of <START:ggp> AP1 <END> , the addition of PMA inhibited it . 
Okadaic acid treatment was found to dramatically increase <START:ana> mRNA transcripts <END> of the <START:ggp> jun family of proto-oncogenes <END> including <START:ggp> c-jun <END> , <START:ggp> junD <END> , and <START:ggp> junB <END> and to a lesser extent the <START:ggp> fos family <END> including <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> fra-1 <END> . 
By comparison , PMA is a very inefficient inducer of the <START:ggp> jun gene family <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
Similar to its effect on the induction of <START:ggp> AP1 <END> by okadaic acid , PMA inhibits the induction of <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> by okadaic acid . 
Transfection of <START:ggp> c-jun promoter constructs <END> confirmed the marked difference between PMA and okadaic acid in inducing <START:ggp> c-jun <END> transcription . 
The induction of <START:ggp> AP1 <END> by okadaic acid suggests that <START:ggp> protein phosphatases 1 and 2A <END> ( <START:ggp> PP1 <END> and <START:ggp> PP2A <END> ) may be involved in T cell activation as important negative regulators of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> AP1 <END> . 
Cloning of <START:ggp> murine TCF-1 <END> , a T cell-specific <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> interacting with <START:ggp> functional motifs <END> in the <START:ggp> CD3-epsilon and T cell receptor alpha enhancers <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD3 <END> -epsilon gene expression is confined to the <START:ana> T cell lineage <END> . 
We have recently identified and cloned a <START:ggp> human transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> , that binds to a functional element in the T lymphocyte-specific enhancer of CD3-epsilon . 
In a panel of human cell lines , <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> expression was restricted to <START:ana> T lineage cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> belonged to a novel family of genes that contain the so-called high <START:ggp> mobility group 1 ( HMG ) box <END> . 
Here we report the cloning of <START:ggp> murine TCF-1 <END> . 
Two splice alternatives were identified that were not previously observed in <START:ggp> human TCF-1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> Murine and human TCF-1 <END> displayed a 95.5 % overall amino acid homology . 
<START:ggp> Recombinant murine and human TCF-1 <END> recognized the same sequence motif in the <START:ggp> CD3-epsilon enhancer <END> as judged by gel retardation and methylation interference assays . 
With the <START:ggp> murine cDNA clones <END> several aspects of <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> were analyzed . 
First , deletion analysis revealed that a region of <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> containing the <START:ggp> HMG box <END> was sufficient for sequence-specific binding . 
Second , by high stringency Northern blotting and in situ hybridization , <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> expression was shown to be confined to the thymus and to the T cell areas of the spleen . 
Third , <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> bound specifically to a functional <START:ggp> T cell-specific element <END> in the <START:ggp> T cell receptor alpha ( TCR-alpha ) enhancer <END> . 
The T lineage-specific expression and the affinity for functional motifs in the <START:ggp> TCR-alpha and CD3-epsilon enhancers <END> imply an important role for <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> in the establishment of the <START:ana> mature T cell phenotype <END> . 
Cloning of a <START:ggp> human homeobox gene <END> that resembles a <START:ggp> diverged Drosophila homeobox gene <END> and is expressed in activated <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
A new <START:ggp> homeobox gene <END> , <START:ggp> HB24 <END> , has been isolated from a human B-lymphocyte cDNA library . 
Northern blot analysis of <START:ana> polyadenylated RNA <END> purified from <START:ana> activated human B cells <END> revealed a <START:ana> single mRNA transcript <END> of approximately 2.3 kb . 
Two <START:ggp> cDNA clones <END> were sequenced and provided 2 , 250 nucleotides ( nt ) of <START:ggp> DNA sequence <END> information . 
There is a single <START:ggp> methionine codon-initiated open reading frame <END> of 1 , 458 nt in frame with a <START:ggp> homeobox <END> and a <START:ggp> CAX repeat <END> , and the <START:ggp> open reading frame <END> is predicted to encode a protein of 51 , 659 daltons . 
When the <START:ggp> homeodomain <END> from <START:ggp> HB24 <END> was compared to known <START:ggp> mammalian and Drosophila homeodomains <END> it was found to be only moderately conserved , but when it was compared to a highly diverged <START:ggp> Drosophila homeodomain <END> , H2.0 , it was found to be 80 % identical . 
The <START:ana> HB24 mRNA <END> was absent or present at low levels in normal B and <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> ; however , with the appropriate activation signal <START:ana> HB24 mRNA <END> was induced within several hours even in the presence of cycloheximide . 
Characterization of <START:ggp> HB24 <END> expression in lymphoid and select developing tissues was performed by in situ hybridization . 
Positive hybridization was found in thymus , tonsil , bone marrow , developing vessels , and in fetal brain . 
<START:ggp> HB24 <END> is likely to have an important role in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> as well as in certain developing tissues . 
<START:ggp> Platelet-activating factor <END> induces phospholipid turnover , calcium flux , arachidonic acid liberation , eicosanoid generation , and <START:ggp> oncogene <END> expression in a <START:ana> human B cell line <END> . 
<START:ggp> Platelet-activating factor <END> is a potent mediator of the inflammatory response . 
Studies of the actions of <START:ggp> platelet-activating factor <END> have centered mainly around <START:ana> neutrophils <END> , <START:ana> monocytes <END> , and <START:ana> platelets <END> . 
In this report we begin to uncover the influence of <START:ggp> platelet-activating factor <END> on <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
Employing the <START:ana> EBV-transformed human B cell line <END> <START:ana> SKW6.4 <END> , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> platelet-activating factor <END> significantly alters membrane phospholipid metabolism indicated by the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylinositol , and phosphatidic acid but not significantly into phosphatidylethanolamine at concentrations ranging from 10 ( -9 ) to 10 ( -6 ) M . 
The inactive precursor , <START:ggp> lyso-platelet-activating factor <END> , at a concentration as high as 10 ( -7 ) M had no effect on any of the membrane phospholipids . 
We also show that <START:ggp> platelet-activating factor <END> from 10 ( -12 ) to 10 ( -6 ) M induced rapid and significant elevation in intracellular calcium levels , whereas lyso- <START:ggp> platelet-activating factor <END> was again ineffective . 
We further demonstrate the impact of <START:ggp> platelet-activating factor <END> binding to <START:ana> B cells <END> by measuring <START:ggp> platelet-activating factor <END> induced arachidonic acid release and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> platelet-activating factor <END> was capable of inducing transcription of the <START:ggp> nuclear proto-oncogenes <END> <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-jun <END> . 
Finally we explored the possible role of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid as a regulator of arachidonic acid liberation demonstrating that endogenous <START:ggp> 5-lipoxygenase <END> activity modulates <START:ggp> platelet-activating factor <END> induced arachidonic acid release perhaps acting at the level of <START:ggp> phospholipase A2 <END> . 
In summary , <START:ggp> platelet-activating factor <END> is shown here to have a direct and profound effect on a <START:ana> pure B cell line <END> . 
Positive and negative regulation of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin gene <END> expression by a novel <START:ggp> B-cell-specific enhancer element <END> . 
A new <START:ggp> B-cell-specific enhancer element <END> has been identified 3 ' of <START:ggp> E4 and the octamerlike motifs <END> in the <START:ggp> human immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene enhancer <END> . 
Tandem copies of this <START:ggp> 67-bp MnlI-AluI fragment <END> , when fused to the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene <END> driven by the <START:ggp> conalbumin promoter <END> , stimulated transcription in <START:ana> B cells <END> but not in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> or <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
Footprinting analysis revealed that the identical sequence CCGAAACTGAAAAGG , designated <START:ggp> E6 <END> , was protected by nuclear extracts from <START:ana> B cells <END> , <START:ana> T cells <END> , or HeLa cells . 
Gel mobility shift assays using a <START:ggp> synthetic E6 motif <END> detected a <START:ggp> B-cell-specific complex <END> in addition to a ubiquitous band found also in <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
In agreement with the results of gel retardation assays , tandem copies of the <START:ggp> E6 motif <END> stimulated transcription in <START:ana> ARH77 <END> and <START:ana> Raji cells <END> but not in <START:ana> Jurkat <END> or <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
Furthermore , a <START:ggp> mutant E6 motif <END> lost both in vitro binding activity and in vivo enhancer activity . 
In striking contrast to the <START:ggp> mouse Ig heavy-chain enhancer <END> , in which the <START:ggp> octamer motif <END> acts as a <START:ggp> B-cell-specific enhancer element <END> , the <START:ggp> human enhancer <END> contains an <START:ggp> octamerlike sequence <END> with one base substitution which bound <START:ggp> octamer-binding proteins <END> with only very low affinity and showed no enhancer activity of its own . 
Interestingly , the <START:ggp> MnlI-AluI fragment <END> could suppress the basal-level activity of the <START:ggp> conalbumin promoter <END> in both <START:ana> Jurkat <END> and <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> . 
Moreover , simian virus 40 enhancer activity was blocked by the <START:ggp> MnlI-AluI fragment <END> in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> but not in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Thus , the novel enhancer element identified in this study is probably a target site for both <START:ggp> positive and negative factors <END> . 
Charybdotoxin-sensitive , Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent membrane potential changes are not involved in human <START:ana> T or B cell <END> activation and proliferation . 
The involvement of ion channels in B and T lymphocyte activation is supported by many reports of changes in ion fluxes and membrane potential after <START:ggp> mitogen <END> binding . 
<START:ana> Human T and B lymphocytes <END> demonstrate an early and transient hyperpolarization after ligand binding . 
Inasmuch as the change in membrane potential is dependent on elevation of free cytosolic calcium , the hyperpolarization is presumably through opening of Ca ( 2+ ) -stimulated K+ channels . 
We have used charybdotoxin , a known inhibitor of <START:ggp> Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent K+ channels <END> , to study the role of these channels in lymphocyte activation and mitogenesis . 
We demonstrate that charybdotoxin inhibits the ligand-induced transient membrane hyperpolarization in <START:ana> B and T cells <END> in a dose-dependent fashion , without affecting changes in cytosolic Ca2+ . 
However , blockade of the <START:ggp> Ca ( 2+ ) -activated K+ channel <END> is not associated with changes in cell-cycle gene activation , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production , <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> expression or B and T cell mitogenesis . 
These results imply that membrane potential changes secondary to the ligand-dependent opening of <START:ggp> Ca ( 2+ ) -activated K+ channels <END> are not involved in <START:ana> B and T lymphocyte <END> activation and mitogenesis . 
Activity of the <START:ggp> kappa B enhancer <END> of the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain <END> in <START:ana> somatic cell hybrids <END> is accompanied by the nuclear localization of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
The <START:ggp> two nuclear proteins <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( consisting of subunits <START:ggp> p50 <END> an <START:ggp> dp65 <END> ) and the <START:ggp> DNA-binding subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> p50 <END> ) by itself , also called <START:ggp> KBF1 <END> , are constitutively expressed and localized in the nucleus of the <START:ana> human T-cell line <END> <START:ana> IARC 301.5 <END> . 
In order to define the roles of these two <START:ggp> factors <END> , which bind to the same <START:ggp> kappa B enhancers <END> , in transcription activation we have prepared somatic cell hybrids between <START:ana> IARC 301.5 <END> and a <START:ana> murine myeloma <END> . 
Most hybrids express both <START:ggp> KBF1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in their nuclei , but one hybrid expresses only <START:ggp> KBF1 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> kappa B enhancer <END> of the gene encoding the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor alpha chain <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> ) is functional only in the <START:ana> hybrids <END> expressing <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kappa B <END> . 
These findings show that <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kappa B <END> is necessary to activate the <START:ggp> kappa B enhancer <END> , while <START:ggp> KBF1 <END> by itself is not sufficient . 
We propose that <START:ggp> KBF1 <END> is a competitive inhibitor of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and discuss how these factors may be involved in the transient expression of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 alpha <END> genes during the immune response . 
<START:ggp> T-helper-cell determinants <END> in <START:ggp> protein antigens <END> are preferentially located in <START:ggp> cysteine-rich antigen segments <END> resistant to proteolytic cleavage by <START:ggp> cathepsin B , L , and D <END> . 
We report on a computer algorithm capable of predicting the location of <START:ggp> T-helper-cell epitopes <END> in <START:ggp> protein antigen <END> ( <START:ggp> Ag <END> ) by analysing the <START:ggp> Ag <END> <START:ggp> amino acid sequence <END> . 
The algorithm was constructed with the aim of identifying segments in <START:ggp> Ag <END> which are resistant to proteolytic degradation by the enzymes <START:ggp> cathepsin B , L , and D <END> . 
These are prominent <START:ggp> enzymes <END> in the endocytic pathway through which <START:ggp> soluble protein Ag <END> enter <START:ggp> APC <END> , and <START:ggp> resistant segments <END> in <START:ggp> Ag <END> may , therefore , be expected to contain more <START:ggp> T-cell determinants <END> than <START:ggp> susceptible segments <END> . 
From information available in the literature on the substrate specificity of the three <START:ggp> enzymes <END> , it is clear that a cysteine is not accepted in any of the <START:ggp> S2 , S1 , S1 ' , and S2 ' subsites <END> of <START:ggp> cathepsin B and L <END> , and not in the <START:ggp> S1 <END> and <START:ggp> S1 ' <END> subsites of <START:ggp> cathepsin D <END> . 
Moreover , we have noticed that <START:ggp> cysteine-containing T-cell determinants <END> in a number of <START:ggp> protein Ag <END> are particularly rich in the amino acids alanine , glycine , lysine , leucine , serine , threonine , and valine . 
By searching protein <START:ggp> Ag <END> for clusters of amino acids containing cysteine and two of the other amino acids we were able to predict 17 out of 23 empirically known <START:ggp> T-cell determinants <END> in the <START:ggp> Ag <END> with a relatively low number of false ( positive ) predictions . 
Furthermore , we present a new principle for searching <START:ggp> Ag <END> for potential <START:ggp> amphipatic alpha-helical protein segments <END> . 
Such segments accord well with empirically known <START:ggp> T-cell determinants <END> and our algorithm produces a lower number of false positive predictions than the principle based on discrete Fourier transformations previously described . 
Contribution of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> Sp1 binding motifs <END> to the replicative capacity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 : distinct patterns of viral growth are determined by <START:ana> T-cell types <END> . 
Starting with a replication-incompetent molecular clone of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 , lacking all the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding sites <END> present in the <START:ggp> native long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) , proviruses containing <START:ggp> reconstructed LTRs <END> with individual or combinations of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B and Sp1 elements <END> were generated and evaluated for their capacity to produce virus progeny following transfection-cocultivation . 
Virus stocks obtained from these experiments exhibited a continuum of replicative capacities in different <START:ana> human T-cell types <END> depending on which <START:ggp> element <END> ( s ) was present in the <START:ggp> LTR <END> . 
For example , in experiments involving proviral clones with <START:ggp> LTRs <END> containing one or two <START:ggp> NF-kappa B elements <END> ( and no <START:ggp> Sp1 binding sites <END> ) , a hierarchy of cellular permissivity to virus replication ( <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> = <START:ana> MT4 <END> greater than <START:ana> H9 <END> greater than <START:ana> CEM <END> greater than <START:ana> Jurkat <END> ) was observed . 
Of note was the associated emergence of <START:ggp> second-site LTR <END> revertants which involved an alteration of the <START:ggp> TATA box <END> . 
These results suggest that the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 LTR <END> possesses functional redundancy which ensures virus replication in different <START:ana> T-cell types <END> and is capable of changing depending on the particular combination of <START:ggp> transcriptional factors <END> present . 
Stimulation of <START:ggp> interferon beta gene <END> transcription in vitro by purified <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and a novel <START:ggp> TH protein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human interferon beta ( IFN-beta ) regulatory element <END> consists of multiple <START:ggp> enhanson domains <END> which are targets for <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> involved in inducible expression of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> . 
To further characterize the protein-DNA interactions mediating <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> induction , <START:ggp> positive regulatory domain ( PRD ) II binding proteins <END> were purified from phorbol ester induced <START:ana> Jurkat T-cells <END> and from <START:ana> IFN primed , cycloheximide/polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid treated HeLa S3 cells <END> . 
From <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , two major proteins of <START:ggp> 52 and 45 kilodaltons ( kD ) <END> copurified with DNA binding activity , whereas from <START:ana> T-cells <END> , four proteins -- a <START:ggp> major protein <END> of <START:ggp> 52 kD <END> and three <START:ggp> minor proteins <END> of <START:ggp> 82 <END> , <START:ggp> 67 <END> , and <START:ggp> 43-47 kD <END> -- were purified . 
Also , an induction <START:ggp> specific DNA binding protein <END> was purified from <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> that interacted with the ( AAGTGA ) 4 <START:ggp> tetrahexamer sequence <END> and the <START:ggp> PRDI domain <END> . 
This protein is immunologically distinct from <START:ggp> IRF-1/ISGF2 <END> . 
Uninduced or Sendai virus induced HeLa extracts were used to examine transcription in vitro using a series of <START:ggp> IFN beta promoter deletions <END> . 
Deletions upstream of the <START:ggp> PRDII element <END> increased transcription in the uninduced extract , indicating predominantly negative regulation of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> . 
A 2-4-fold increase in <START:ggp> IFN-beta promoter <END> transcription was observed in Sendai virus induced extracts , and deletion of <START:ggp> PRDI <END> and <START:ggp> PRDII elements <END> decreased this induced level of transcription . 
When purified <START:ggp> PRDII and tetrahexamer binding proteins <END> were added to the induced extract , a 4-fold increase in transcription was observed . 
These experiments demonstrate that it is possible to modulate IFN-beta transcription in vitro but indicate that additional proteins may be required to fully activate <START:ggp> IFN-beta <END> transcription . 
The <START:ggp> rhombotin family <END> of <START:ggp> cysteine-rich LIM-domain oncogenes <END> : distinct members are involved in <START:ggp> T-cell translocations <END> to <START:ggp> human chromosomes 11p15 and 11p13 <END> . 
A chromosomal translocation in a T-cell leukemia involving the <START:ggp> short arm <END> of <START:ggp> human chromosome 11 <END> at <START:ggp> band 11p15 <END> disrupts the <START:ggp> rhombotin gene <END> . 
This gene encodes a protein with duplicated <START:ggp> cysteine-rich regions <END> called <START:ggp> LIM domains <END> , which show homology to <START:ggp> zinc-binding proteins <END> and to <START:ggp> iron-sulfur centers <END> of <START:ggp> ferredoxins <END> . 
Two homologues of the <START:ggp> rhombotin gene <END> have now been isolated . 
One of these , designated <START:ggp> Rhom-2 <END> , is located on <START:ggp> human chromosome 11 <END> at <START:ggp> band 11p13 <END> , where a cluster of <START:ggp> T-cell leukemia-specific translocations <END> occur ; all translocation breakpoints at <START:ggp> 11p13 <END> are upstream of the <START:ggp> Rhom-2 gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> Human and mouse Rhom-2 <END> are highly conserved and , like <START:ggp> rhombotin <END> , encode two <START:ggp> tandem cysteine-rich LIM domains <END> . 
<START:ana> Rhom-2 mRNA <END> is expressed in early mouse development in central nervous system , lung , kidney , liver , and spleen but only very low levels occur in thymus . 
The other gene , designated <START:ggp> Rhom-3 <END> , is not on chromosome 11 but also retains homology to the <START:ggp> LIM domain <END> of <START:ggp> rhombotin <END> . 
Since the <START:ggp> Rhom-2 gene <END> is such a common site of chromosomal damage in <START:ana> T-cell tumors <END> , the consistency of translocations near the <START:ggp> rhombotin gene <END> was further examined . 
A second translocation adjacent to <START:ggp> rhombotin <END> was found and at the same position as in the previous example . 
Therefore , <START:ggp> chromosome bands 11p15 <END> ( <START:ggp> rhombotin <END> ) and <START:ggp> 11p13 <END> ( <START:ggp> Rhom-2 <END> ) are consistent sites of chromosome translocation in T-cell leukemia , with the <START:ggp> 11p15 target <END> more rarely involved . 
The results define the <START:ggp> rhombotin <END> gene family as a class of <START:ggp> T-cell oncogenes <END> with duplicated <START:ggp> cysteine-rich LIM domains <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> in the <START:ana> Jurkat T cell line <END> is independent of <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> , <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> , and <START:ggp> Ca ( 2+ ) -regulated kinases <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is a <START:ggp> DNA-binding regulatory factor <END> able to control transcription of a number of genes , including <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) genes <END> . 
In <START:ana> T cells <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is activated upon cellular treatment by phorbol esters and the cytokine <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> ) . 
In the present work , we investigated the molecular events leading to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation by <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> in a <START:ana> human T cell line <END> ( <START:ana> Jurkat <END> ) and its subclone <START:ana> JCT6 <END> , which presents a deficiency in the <START:ggp> PKA <END> transduction pathway . 
We found that in both cell lines , both phorbol ester and <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> were able to activate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Phorbol activation was positively modulated by Ca2+ influx while <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> activation was not . 
Furthermore , while PMA activation was inhibited by the <START:ggp> PKC <END> inhibitor staurosporin , the <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> effect was unchanged . 
<START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> did not activate cAMP production and its signal was not modulated by cAMP activators . 
Moreover , cAMP activators did not activate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> -induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation was found to be mediated by none of the major <START:ggp> signal-mediating kinases <END> such as <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> ( <START:ggp> PKC <END> ) , <START:ggp> protein kinase A <END> , or <START:ggp> Ca ( 2+ ) -regulated kinases <END> . 
Furthermore , we found that cytoplasmic acidification facilitated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation by both <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> and <START:ggp> PKC <END> , by a mechanism that increases <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> /I kappa B <END> dissociation without affecting the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation step . 
The functional domains of the <START:ggp> murine Thy-1 gene promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Thy-1 gene promoter <END> resembles a <START:ggp> `` housekeeping '' promoter <END> in that it is located within a <START:ggp> methylation-free island <END> , lacks a <START:ggp> canonical TATA box <END> , and displays heterogeneity in the <START:ana> 5'-end termini <END> of the <START:ana> mRNA <END> . 
Using transgenic mice , we show that this <START:ggp> promoter <END> does not confer any tissue specificity and is active only in a position-dependent manner . 
It can only be activated in a tissue-specific manner by elements that lie downstream of the <START:ggp> initiation site <END> . 
We have analyzed the functional domains of the <START:ggp> minimal Thy-1 promoter <END> and show that the <START:ggp> dominant promoter elements <END> consist of <START:ggp> multiple binding sites <END> for the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , an inverted <START:ggp> CCAAT box <END> , and sequences proximal to the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> . 
DNase I and gel mobility shift assays show the binding of a number of <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> to these <START:ggp> elements <END> , including <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> CP1 <END> . 
Our results show that the structure of this <START:ggp> promoter <END> only permits productive interactions of the two <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> CP1 <END> with the basal transcription machinery in the presence of <START:ggp> enhancer sequences <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor kappa B <END> activates proenkephalin transcription in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Upon activation , <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> accumulate high levels of the neuropeptide enkephalin which correlate with high levels of <START:ana> proenkephalin mRNA <END> in the cells . 
Here we investigated the transcriptional basis for these changes . 
The proenkephalin promoter contains a sequence GGGGACGTCCCC , named <START:ggp> B2 <END> , which is similar to the <START:ggp> kappa B sequence <END> GGGGACTTTCC , the binding site of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> . 
Activation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> induces an <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -like binding activity to the <START:ggp> B2 <END> site , concomitant with activation of the <START:ggp> proenkephalin promoter <END> . 
Mutations at the <START:ggp> B2 <END> site abolish this transcriptional activation . 
The purified <START:ggp> homodimer <END> ( two <START:ggp> p50s <END> ) of the <START:ggp> DNA-binding subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binds the <START:ggp> B2 <END> site of proenkephalin relatively better than does the <START:ggp> heterotetramer <END> ( two <START:ggp> p65s <END> plus two <START:ggp> p50s <END> ) form of the factor . 
Thus , it appears that the T-cell-specific activation of the <START:ggp> proenkephalin promoter <END> is mediated by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
However , as <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is ubiquitous and the transcriptional activation through the <START:ggp> B2 <END> site is T cell specific , yet another <START:ggp> T-cell-specific factor <END> which synergizes with <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> should be considered . 
Induction of <START:ggp> NF-KB <END> during <START:ana> monocyte <END> differentiation by HIV type 1 infection . 
The production of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) progeny was followed in the <START:ana> U937 promonocytic cell line <END> after stimulation either with retinoic acid or PMA , and in <START:ana> purified human monocytes and macrophages <END> . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Southwestern blotting experiments were used to detect the binding of <START:ggp> cellular transactivation factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-KB <END> to the <START:ggp> double repeat-KB enhancer sequence <END> located in the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> . 
PMA treatment , and not retinoic acid treatment of the <START:ana> U937 cells <END> acts in inducing <START:ggp> NF-KB <END> expression in the nuclei . 
In nuclear extracts from <START:ana> monocytes <END> or <START:ana> macrophages <END> , induction of <START:ggp> NF-KB <END> occurred only if the cells were previously infected with HIV-1 . 
When <START:ana> U937 cells <END> were infected with HIV-1 , no induction of <START:ggp> NF-KB factor <END> was detected , whereas high level of progeny virions was produced , suggesting that this factor was not required for viral replication . 
These results indicate that in <START:ana> monocytic cell lineage <END> , HIV-1 could mimic some differentiation/activation stimuli allowing nuclear <START:ggp> NF-KB <END> expression . 
Disruption of the <START:ggp> human SCL locus <END> by `` illegitimate '' V- ( D ) -J recombinase activity . 
A <START:ggp> fusion complementary DNA <END> in the <START:ana> T cell line HSB-2 <END> elucidates a provocative mechanism for the disruption of the putative <START:ggp> hematopoietic transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> SCL <END> . 
The <START:ggp> fusion cDNA <END> results from an interstitial deletion between a previously <START:ggp> unknown locus <END> , <START:ggp> SIL <END> ( <START:ggp> SCL interrupting locus <END> ) , and the <START:ggp> 5 ' untranslated region <END> of <START:ggp> SCL <END> . 
Similar to 1 ; 14 translocations , this deletion disrupts the <START:ggp> SCL 5 ' regulatory region <END> . 
This event is probably mediated by V- ( D ) -J recombinase activity , although neither locus is an <START:ggp> immunoglobulin <END> or a <START:ggp> T cell receptor <END> . 
Two other <START:ana> T cell lines <END> , <START:ana> CEM <END> and <START:ana> RPMI 8402 <END> , have essentially identical deletions . 
Thus , in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , <START:ggp> growth-affecting genes <END> other than <START:ggp> immune receptors <END> risk rearrangements . 
<START:ggp> Thyroid hormone receptors <END> form distinct <START:ggp> nuclear protein-dependent and independent complexes <END> with a <START:ggp> thyroid hormone response element <END> . 
We have examined the binding of <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> and <START:ggp> recombinant thyroid hormone receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> TRs <END> ) to the <START:ggp> palindromic thyroid hormone responsive element <END> AGGTCATGACCT ( <START:ggp> TREp <END> ) using a gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay . 
Four specific <START:ggp> protein-DNA complexes <END> were detected after incubation of nuclear extracts ( NE ) from <START:ana> T3-responsive pituitary ( GH3 ) cells <END> with a <START:ggp> TREp-containing DNA fragment <END> . 
This was compared with the <START:ggp> TREp <END> binding of <START:ggp> reticulocyte lysate-synthesized TRs <END> . 
<START:ggp> TR alpha 1 <END> and <START:ggp> TR beta 2 <END> each formed a single major <START:ggp> TR : TREp complex <END> which comigrated with the least retarded complex formed by GH3 NE , while <START:ggp> TR beta 1 <END> formed multiple complexes suggesting that it can bind to <START:ggp> TREp <END> as an <START:ggp> oligomer <END> . 
Interestingly , coincubation of <START:ggp> 35S-TR alpha 1 <END> , GH3 NE , and unlabeled <START:ggp> TREp <END> resulted in not only the <START:ggp> 35S-TR : TREp complex <END> , but in two additional more greatly retarded complexes containing <START:ggp> 35S-TR alpha 1 <END> and comigrating with those formed by GH3 extract alone . 
Incubation of each of the <START:ggp> TRs <END> with NE from <START:ana> COS-7 cells <END> , which do not possess sufficient endogenous <START:ggp> TRs <END> to mediate T3-responses , resulted in formation of a new , more <START:ggp> greatly shifted complex <END> . 
A similar , heat labile activity which altered mobility of the <START:ggp> TR : TRE complex <END> was also present in NE from <START:ana> T3-unresponsive JEG-3 cells <END> . 
At high concentration of NE , all of the <START:ggp> TR <END> bound to <START:ggp> TREp <END> was more greatly retarded than in the absence of NE . 
Truncation of <START:ggp> TR alpha 1 <END> at <START:ggp> amino acid 210 <END> prevented additional complex formation in the presence of NE without affecting DNA binding , suggesting that the <START:ggp> carboxyl-terminus <END> of the <START:ggp> TRs <END> is essential for interaction with <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Cell-specific differences in activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B regulatory elements <END> of <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus and beta interferon promoters <END> by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> . 
Three aspects of the involvement of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) pathogenesis were examined . 
<START:ana> Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) mRNA <END> production was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification in <START:ana> monocytic U937 cells <END> and in a <START:ana> chronically HIV infected U937 cell line <END> ( <START:ana> U9-IIIB <END> ) . 
<START:ana> TNF-alpha RNA <END> was undetectable in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> , whereas a low constitutive level was detected in <START:ana> U9-IIIB cells <END> . 
Paramyxovirus infection induced a 5- to 10-fold increase in the steady-state level of <START:ana> TNF-alpha RNA <END> in <START:ana> U9-IIIB cells <END> compared with <START:ana> U937 cells <END> , suggesting that <START:ana> HIV-infected monocytic cells <END> produced higher levels of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> than did normal cells after a secondary virus infection . 
The effects of <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> on gene expression were examined by transient expression assays using <START:ggp> reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids <END> linked to <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> from the <START:ggp> HIV long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) and the <START:ggp> beta interferon promoter <END> . 
In <START:ana> U937 and Jurkat T lymphoid cells <END> , the inducibility of the different <START:ggp> hybrid promoters <END> by <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> or phorbol ester varied in a cell type- and promoter context-specific manner ; the levels of gene activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-containing plasmids <END> correlated directly with induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA-binding activity . 
Although the intact <START:ggp> beta interferon promoter <END> was only weakly stimulated by phorbol ester or <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , multimers of the <START:ggp> PRDII NF-kappa B-binding domain <END> were inducible by both agents . 
<START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> was able to increase expression of the <START:ggp> HIV LTR <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> , but in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> did not induce the <START:ggp> HIV LTR <END> above a constitutive level of activity . 
This level of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -independent activity appears to be sufficient for virus multiplication , since <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> treatment had no effect on the kinetics of de novo HIV type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection and <START:ana> viral RNA <END> production in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
However , in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> dramatically enhanced the spread of HIV-1 through the cell population and increased <START:ana> viral RNA <END> synthesis , indicating that in <START:ana> T cells <END> HIV-1 multiplication was stimulated by <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> treatment . 
Functional analysis of <START:ggp> cis-linked regulatory sequences <END> in the <START:ggp> HLA DRA promoter <END> by transcription in vitro . 
Two consensus sequences , called <START:ggp> X and Y boxes <END> , capable of binding <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> and regulating expression in <START:ana> B cells <END> have been defined within the immediate upstream region of <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II promoters <END> . 
Unlike other <START:ggp> class II promoters <END> , the <START:ggp> HLA-DR alpha ( DRA ) promoter <END> also contains one element identical to the <START:ggp> `` octamer '' motif <END> of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin variable region promoters <END> that is responsible for B cell-specific transcription . 
This `` <START:ggp> octamer <END> `` in the context of <START:ggp> DRA <END> appears capable of binding both the <START:ggp> ubiquitous <END> ( <START:ggp> OTF-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific ( OTF-2 ) `` octamer '' binding proteins <END> , but at least one other distinct <START:ggp> `` octamer '' complex <END> was found . 
In order to characterize the function of <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> , we have developed an in vitro system in which a <START:ggp> DRA promoter construct <END> is transcribed more efficiently in extracts from <START:ana> B cells <END> than in extracts from <START:ana> class II-negative HeLa cells <END> . 
5 ' deletion constructs which lacked the <START:ggp> Y box <END> , but retained the <START:ggp> `` octamer '' motif <END> and <START:ggp> TATA box <END> were completely inactive , and internal deletion of the <START:ggp> Y box <END> reduced transcription by 95 % . 
Using supercoiled , but not linear templates , we observed differences in transcription efficiencies from templates lacking or disrupting the <START:ggp> X consensus element <END> that reflect effects of random replacement of <START:ggp> X box sequences <END> in transient expression assays . 
Demonstration of the complete dependence on the <START:ggp> Y box <END> in this system suggests that , despite its demonstrated importance in the <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> , the <START:ggp> DRA `` octamer '' <END> does not utilize <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> in a manner analogous to <START:ggp> immunoglobulin promoters <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Lipopolysaccharide is a potent monocyte/macrophage-specific stimulator of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression . 
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) potently stimulates <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1-long terminal repeat ( HIV-1-LTR ) CAT constructs <END> transfected into <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage-like cell lines <END> but not a <START:ana> T cell line <END> . 
This effect appears to be mediated through the induction of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) . 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that LPS induces a DNA binding activity indistinguishable from <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> U937 <END> and <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> . 
LPS is also shown to dramatically increase HIV-1 production from a <START:ana> chronically infected monocyte/macrophage-like cloned cell line <END> , <START:ana> U1 <END> , which produces very low levels of HIV-1 at baseline . 
The stimulation of viral production from this cell line occurs only if these cells are treated with <START:ggp> granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) before treatment with LPS . 
This stimulation of HIV-1 production is correlated with an increase in the level of <START:ana> HIV-1 RNA <END> and and activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
LPS is not able to induce HIV-1 production in a cloned <START:ana> T cell line <END> . 
The effect of LPS on HIV-1 replication occurs at picogram per milliliter concentrations and may be clinically significant in understanding the variability of the natural history of HIV-1 infection . 
Steroid dose sparing : pharmacodynamic responses to single versus divided doses of methylprednisolone in man . 
Inhibitory drug interactions affecting the metabolism of methylprednisolone ( MP ) may produce either steroid sparing or adverse effects partly by increasing the exposure time to the steroid . 
This phenomenon can be mimicked by administering MP in divided doses . 
Two types of responses were compared after a single MP dose ( 40 mg bolus ) and a divided regimen ( 20 mg bolus and a 5 mg bolus 8 hours later ) in six healthy male volunteers . 
The suppression of <START:ana> basophils <END> measured as whole blood histamine and plasma cortisol concentrations was assessed during 32 hours . 
The 37.5 % reduction in dose produced a 23 % overall decreased blood histamine response . 
A pharmacodynamic model for basophil cell distribution to and from an extravascular compartment describes the effects of MP after both regimens . 
A slower initial decline in blood histamine after the divided regimen may be related to incomplete suppression of <START:ana> basophil cell <END> return to blood . 
The 50 % inhibitory concentrations of MP of about 5 ng/ml were similar for both regimens . 
The decline and return of cortisol concentrations were similar between MP treatments with suppression continuing for 24 hours . 
The 50 % inhibitory concentrations of MP values for adrenal suppression were about 1 ng/ml . 
Pharmacodynamic modeling is useful in quantitating corticosteroid responses and generally predicted the `` dose-sparing '' effects that were achieved by prolonging MP plasma concentrations . 
This study supports previous clinical observations that patients may require morning through evening exposure to MP to optimize efficacy while adrenal suppression is being minimized . 
1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D2 production by <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> alveolar macrophages <END> recovered by lavage from normocalcemic patients with tuberculosis . 
To compare extra-renal 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 production in different types of granulomatous disease , and to identify the cell types responsible , we have evaluated the conversion of 25 ( OH ) D3 in 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 by <START:ana> uncultured cells <END> recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage and <START:ana> blood mononuclear cells <END> from normocalcemic patients with sarcoidosis and tuberculosis . 
1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 was produced both by <START:ana> lavage cells <END> ( 12/12 tuberculosis patients , 2/6 sarcoidosis patients ) and <START:ana> blood mononuclear cells <END> ( 3/5 tuberculosis patients , 0/3 sarcoidosis patients ) from patients but not controls , but significantly greater amounts were produced by lavage cells from tuberculosis patients than those of sarcoidosis patients ( P less than 0.001 ) . 
1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 production by <START:ana> lavage cells <END> from tuberculosis patients correlated with the number of CD8+ <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> present but not other cell types . 
<START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> appeared to be an important source of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 production , since purified <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> from all patients with tuberculosis produced 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 , and 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 production by these cells correlated closely with that produced by unseparated <START:ana> lavage cells <END> . 
Because 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 can improve the capacity of <START:ana> macrophages <END> to kill mycobacteria , our results support the conclusion that macrophage-lymphocyte interactions , mediated at least in part by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 , may be an important component of a successful antituberculous immune response . 
<START:ana> Megakaryocytic and erythrocytic lineages <END> share specific <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
<START:ggp> Erythroid-specific genes <END> contain binding sites for <START:ggp> NF-E1 <END> ( also called <START:ggp> GF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Eryf-1 <END> ; refs 1-3 respectively ) , the principal <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> of the <START:ana> erythrocytic lineage <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-E1 <END> expression seems to be restricted to the <START:ana> erythrocytic lineage <END> . 
A closely related ( if not identical ) protein is found in both a <START:ana> human megakaryocytic cell line <END> and <START:ana> purified human megakaryocytes <END> ; it binds to <START:ggp> promoter regions <END> of two <START:ggp> megakaryocytic-specific genes <END> . 
The binding sites and partial proteolysis profile of this protein are indistinguishable from those of the <START:ggp> erythroid protein <END> ; also , <START:ana> NF-E1 messenger RNA <END> is the same size in both the <START:ana> megakaryocytic and erythroid cell lines <END> . 
Furthermore , point mutations that abolish binding of <START:ggp> NF-E1 <END> result in a 70 % decrease in the transcriptional activity of a <START:ggp> megakaryocytic-specific promoter <END> . 
We also find that <START:ggp> NF-E2 <END> , another <START:ggp> trans-acting factor <END> of the <START:ana> erythrocytic lineage <END> , is present in <START:ana> megakaryocytes <END> . 
Transcriptional effects in both lineages might then be mediated in part by the same specific <START:ggp> trans-acting factors <END> . 
Our data strengthen the idea of a close association between the <START:ana> erythrocytic and the megakaryocytic lineages <END> and could also explain the expression of markers specific to the <START:ana> erythrocytic and megakaryocytic lineages <END> in most <START:ana> erythroblastic and megakaryoblastic permanent cell lines <END> . 
Transcriptional down-regulation of <START:ggp> c-myc <END> expression by protein synthesis-dependent and -independent pathways in a <START:ana> human T lymphoblastic tumor cell line <END> . 
We show that in the <START:ana> human T lymphoblastic tumor cell line <END> <START:ana> Molt4 c-myc mRNA <END> and protein expression is down-regulated after exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide , to phorbol myristate acetate , or to the calcium ionophore A23187 , which raises the intracellular calcium concentration . 
A block to RNA elongation is largely responsible for decreased <START:ggp> c-myc <END> transcription . 
Although negative regulation by dimethyl sulfoxide takes place even when protein synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide , the phorbol myristate acetate effect is blocked to some extent only by cycloheximide . 
The calcium ionophore-induced <START:ggp> c-myc <END> suppression , however , strictly requires de novo protein synthesis . 
Therefore , two different negative regulatory pathways are involved in <START:ggp> c-myc <END> regulation : one which is independent and one which depends on de novo protein synthesis . 
The latter one appears to be mediated by a rapidly <START:ggp> calcium-dependent induced gene product <END> . 
<START:ggp> Oestrogen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) analysis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia : correlation of biochemical and immunocytochemical methods . 
<START:ggp> Oestrogen receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) are present in <START:ana> neoplastic lymphoid cells <END> and have been considered a physiological marker of growth rate or differentiation . 
Tamoxifen , an oestrogen antagonist , has been given in some patients with CLL and Hodgkin 's disease , with dramatic response in single cases . 
Until now , <START:ggp> ER <END> status has been assessed using a steroid binding assay ( SBA ) which has many inherent problems . 
Recently , the development of monoclonal antibodies directed against <START:ggp> ER <END> has been applied to the study of breast carcinomas and results obtained show good correlation with the quantitative SBA . 
We studied 49 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) using immunostaining of cytospin preparations . 
In 30 of these cases <START:ggp> ER <END> enzyme immunoassay ( <START:ggp> ER <END> -EIA ) was also performed . 
<START:ana> Cultured MCF-7 cells <END> , derived from a pleural effusion of a breast cancer patient , known to contain high levels of <START:ggp> ER <END> were used as a positive control ( 40-48 % <START:ana> ER positive cells <END> by immunocytochemistry ; 200 fmol/mg protein by EIA ) . 
All of the CLL cases except two ( 96 % ) were negative for <START:ggp> ER <END> ( less than 1 % staining ; less than 4 fmol/mg protein ) . 
The two positive cases expressed granular <START:ggp> ER <END> staining over the nucleus ( 9.2 and 12.1 % positive cells ) and were positive by EIA and SBA . 
It is concluded that ( i ) patients with CLL rarely express <START:ggp> ER <END> and ( ii ) immunocytochemical staining of cytospin preparations is a valid technique for the measurement of <START:ggp> ER <END> . 
It is of interest that one of the positive cases was diagnosed as CLL with Richter 's transformation confirming earlier findings . 
<START:ggp> Type-II estrogen binding sites <END> in a <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cell line <END> and growth-inhibitory effect of estrogen , anti-estrogen and bioflavonoids . 
<START:ggp> Type-II estrogen-binding sites <END> ( <START:ggp> type-II EBS <END> ) have been demonstrated in the <START:ana> human lymphoblastoid cell line <END> <START:ana> IM-9 <END> using a whole-cell assay with ( 6 , 7-3H ) estradiol ( 3H-E2 ) as tracer . 
Competition analysis showed that the anti-estrogen tamoxifen and the flavonoids quercetin and rutin competed for ( 3H ) -E2 binding to <START:ggp> type-II EBS <END> . 
Growth experiments demonstrated that diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) tamoxifen ( TAM ) , quercetin and rutin exerted a reversible dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in the range of concentrations between 10 nM and 10 microM . 
The relative binding affinity of quercetin , rutin , DES and TAM for <START:ggp> type-II EBS <END> correlated well with their potency as cell growth inhibitors . 
Moreover , hesperidin , a flavonoid which does not bind to <START:ggp> type-II EBS <END> , was ineffective in inhibiting cell growth . 
Cell-cycle analysis showed that the growth-inhibitory effect of DES , TAM or quercetin was due to a blocking effect in the G0-G1 phases . 
Our results suggest that high estrogen and anti-estrogen concentrations and flavonoids may regulate <START:ana> IM-9 <END> cell growth through a common mechanism involving a binding interaction with <START:ggp> type-II EBS <END> . 
[ <START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> of patients with bronchial asthma ] 
Quantitation of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GCR <END> ) and the study of their affinity for glucocorticosteroids ( GCS ) were made in <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> of bronchial asthma ( BA ) patients in consideration of <START:ggp> GCR <END> treatment and serum levels of endogenous cortisol . 
It is stated that <START:ggp> GCR <END> of healthy controls and GCS-untreated patients outnumbered those of cortisol-dependent BA patients on hormone therapy . 
Following discontinuation of glucocorticoid drugs <START:ggp> GCR <END> count in cortisol-dependent BA tends to rise . 
Endogenous cortisol has no effect on <START:ggp> GCR <END> level estimated by 3H-triamcinolone acetonide . 
Two <START:ggp> glucocorticoid binding sites <END> on the <START:ggp> human glucocorticoid receptor <END> . 
Glucocorticoids are known to have a lytic effect in <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> via interactions with the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) . 
Cortisol and various synthetic glucocorticoids bind to the <START:ggp> GR <END> with one-site kinetics . 
Cortivazol ( CVZ ) is a unique , high potency synthetic glucocorticoid , which has a phenylpyrazol fused to the A-ring of the steroid nucleus and displays binding consistent with two or more sites in the cytosol from <START:ana> CEM C7 cells <END> ( a <START:ana> human acute lymphoblastic T-cell line <END> ) . 
It has previously been shown that the lower affinity class of sites are similar in affinity and site molarity to those recognized by dexamethasone . 
The higher affinity sites bind CVZ with 20- to 50-fold greater affinity , consistent with CVZ 's enhanced biological effects . 
In mutant <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> resistant to the lytic effects of dexamethasone , CVZ both lyses the cells and recognizes a single class of sites similar to the high affinity site in <START:ana> CEM C7 cells <END> . 
We have carried out experiments to define the nature of the <START:ggp> higher affinity CVZ binding site <END> . 
We now show that : 1 ) CVZ has more than one binding site in a second , independent , <START:ana> B-cell line <END> , <START:ana> IM-9 <END> ; 2 ) the antiglucocorticoid RU 38486 is able to block both CVZ 's higher and lower affinity sites ; 3 ) all of <START:ggp> CVZ 's binding sites <END> are on a protein immunologically indistinguishable from the human <START:ggp> GR <END> ; and 4 ) freshly isolated clones of CVZ-resistant cells have lost all binding sites for CVZ . 
These data indicate that CVZ is recognizing two <START:ggp> glucocorticoid binding sites <END> on the human <START:ggp> GR <END> or a protein very similar to it . 
Retroviral mediated transfer and expression of <START:ggp> exogenous genes <END> in <START:ana> primary lymphoid cells <END> : assaying for a viral <START:ggp> transactivator <END> activity in <START:ana> normal and malignant cells <END> . 
In this report we describe the use of recombinant retroviruses to characterize the activity of an <START:ggp> exogenous promoter <END> in primary cells obtained from patients with lymphoproliferative disorders . 
The infection of a variety of cultured and <START:ana> primary lymphoid cells <END> with a recombinant retrovirus containing a <START:ggp> histone promoter-driven beta-galactosidase gene <END> is shown to result in the expression of <START:ggp> beta-galactosidase <END> in 50 % to 100 % of the cells . 
A similar infection with a recombinant retrovirus containing the <START:ggp> beta-galactosidase gene <END> with an <START:ggp> adenovirus E2 promoter <END> , results in <START:ggp> beta-galactosidase <END> activity in a limited number of <START:ana> cultured <END> and <START:ana> primary cells <END> . 
Since the <START:ggp> adenovirus E2 promoter <END> has been well characterized and is known to be regulated by <START:ggp> transactivators <END> encoded by many viruses , the activity of this promoter in specific cell types is discussed in reference to both the biology of the cell and the possible presence of as yet undetected <START:ggp> viral gene products <END> . 
[ The effect of 24 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( dioxyvit ) on Ca metabolism and immune status during chronic kidney failure ] 
Active metabolite of vitamin D3 , 24R , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ( dioxyvit ) was used at a daily dose of 100 micrograms in treatment of children affected with tubulointerstitial disease of kidney and with chronic glomerulonephritis under conditions of kidney insufficiency . 
The drug exhibited distinct normalizing effect on patterns of calcium metabolism : increase of total and ionized Ca2+ and of 25-OHD , decrease in concentration of parath hormone and osteocalcine in blood serum as well as on immunological parameters : restoration of decreased content of <START:ana> T- and 0-lymphocytes <END> . 
Concentration of receptors of hormonal form of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 was found to be minimal in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> under conditions of chronic kidney insufficiency , while their expression , after the dioxyvit action , was detected only in patients with glomerulonephritis . 
Specific calcitropic effect of dioxyvit with simultaneous correction of vitamin D deficiency were apparently responsible for high efficacy of the drug in treatment of calcium metabolism and immunity impairments in children with renal deteriorations at the step of chronic kidney insufficiency . 
[ The role of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> and <START:ggp> HLA antigens <END> in the pathogenesis of Cushing 's syndrome ] 
Lymphocytic levels of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> were evaluated in 114 patients suffering from Icenko-Cushing 's syndrome . 
Incidence of <START:ggp> HLA antigens <END> was determined in 94 of them . 
A significant rise of <START:ggp> A10 <END> and <START:ggp> B27 antigen <END> incidence compared to that in normal subjects allows these antigens to be considered genetic markers of Icenko-Cushing 's syndrome . 
The levels of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> of the patients are lower than in normal subjects both in the active stage of the disease and following bilateral total adrenalectomy . 
The patients carrying <START:ggp> B27 antigen <END> had lymphocytic receptor concentrations under the levels of such in patients free of the antigen carriage . 
<START:ggp> Antigen B27 <END> seems to be a cause of lower levels of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> blood lymphocytes <END> . 
Effects of 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on the <START:ana> human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line <END> <START:ana> RWLeu-4 <END> . 
The effects of 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VD3 ) on proliferation , differentiation , and macromolecular synthesis in the new <START:ana> Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line <END> , <START:ana> RWLeu-4 <END> , were investigated . 
Binding of [ 3H ] VD3 was saturable , with approximately 2000-3000 sites/cell , and half-maximal binding occurring at 0.21-0.33 nM . 
Treatment of <START:ana> RWLeu-4 cells <END> with VD3 induced <START:ggp> 24R-hydroxylase <END> activity , a marker of vitamin D3 responsiveness in many tissues . 
Exposure of <START:ana> RWLeu-4 cells <END> to VD3 also inhibited proliferation and DNA synthesis with a 50 % effective dose of 3.5-10 nM within 72 h ; in addition , protein and RNA synthesis were inhibited by VD3 treatment . 
Exposure of <START:ana> RWLeu-4 cells <END> to 5 nM VD3 for 72 h caused 50 % of the cells to differentiate into <START:ana> macrophage/monocyte type cells <END> as judged by nitroblue tetrazolium staining and adherence to plastic . 
Progressive expression of <START:ggp> cell surface maturation-specific antigens <END> of the <START:ana> monocyte/macrophage lineage <END> was induced by treatment of <START:ana> RWLeu-4 cells <END> with VD3 for 24 to 72 h at doses that inhibited cellular proliferation . 
<START:ana> c-myc RNA <END> , which is constitutively expressed in <START:ana> RWLeu-4 cells <END> , increased after 0.5 h of treatment with 50 nM VD3 and then rapidly decreased to barely detectable levels after 4 h of treatment . 
Finally , the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity associated with the <START:ggp> p210bcr-abl oncogene product <END> was decreased approximately 50 % by VD3 treatment . 
Because of the presence of a functional receptor-effector system for VD3 and multiple biological responses to the hormone , these cells provide a unique model system with which to probe the specific effects of VD3 on cell growth and differentiation in chronic myelogenous leukemia . 
A new member of the <START:ggp> leucine zipper class <END> of proteins that binds to the <START:ggp> HLA DR alpha promoter <END> . 
Several mutants derived from <START:ana> transformed human B cell lines <END> are defective in expressing <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes <END> . 
The failure to express a <START:ggp> class II gene <END> in at least one such <START:ana> mutant line <END> has been mapped to the <START:ggp> MHC class II X box <END> , a <START:ggp> conserved transcriptional element <END> in the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> . 
A <START:ggp> complementary DNA <END> encoding a <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> human X box binding protein <END> , <START:ggp> hXBP-1 <END> ) whose target is the <START:ggp> human DR alpha X box <END> and the <START:ggp> 3 ' flanking region <END> has now been cloned . 
This <START:ggp> complementary DNA <END> encoded a protein with structural similarities to the <START:ggp> c-jun proto-oncogene product <END> , and its target sequence was closely related to the <START:ggp> palindromic target sequence <END> of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> . 
Mutation of the <START:ggp> hXBP-1 DNA target sequence <END> decreased <START:ggp> DR alpha promoter <END> activity in vivo . 
These studies suggest that the <START:ggp> hXBP-1 protein <END> acts as a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Pseudohypoaldosteronism in eight families : different forms of inheritance are evidence for various genetic defects . 
Pseudohypoaldosteronism is a rare hereditary disorder presenting in early infancy with renal salt loss leading to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia despite high levels of plasma aldosterone . 
The patients are insensitive to mineralocorticoids ; however , sodium supplementation is able to correct electrolyte abnormalities . 
Absent or greatly diminished type <START:ggp> I aldosterone receptors <END> in <START:ana> peripheral mononuclear leucocytes <END> have been recently demonstrated and explain the lack of response to mineralocorticoids . 
We have studied the mode of inheritance in eight families with a total of nine patients . 
There was evidence for an autosomal recessive form of inheritance in four families , while the other four families appeared to have an autosomal dominant mode of transmission . 
In three families the autosomal recessive form was characterized by <START:ggp> normal receptor <END> as well as hormone data in both parents , while in one family receptor levels in both parents were greatly reduced , but hormone levels were normal . 
In the four families with an autosomal dominant mode of transmission there was always one parent with reduced receptor binding in <START:ana> peripheral mononuclear leucocytes <END> and elevated serum hormone levels . 
These parents were entirely asymptomatic . 
In an extended family we were able to study an aunt and her newborn daughter , who were both also biochemically affected but clinically asymptomatic . 
It , therefore , appears that this dual pattern of genetic transmission may indicate differing genetic defects which cause the same clinical picture of pseudohypoaldosteronism . 
Perceived social support and tumor <START:ggp> estrogen/progesterone receptor <END> status as predictors of <START:ana> natural killer cell <END> activity in breast cancer patients . 
This report is concerned with the prediction of natural <START:ana> killer ( NK ) cell <END> activity in 61 Stage I and II breast cancer patients , between the ages of 25 and 70 , who were accrued to this project . 
All baseline interview and testing data were obtained either just before patients were discharged from the hospital , or at their first outpatient visit , within two weeks of discharge . 
A major interest of this project is the predictive value of perceived social support , as a potential `` stress '' buffer , related to NK activity . 
In the main model reported here , we found that a significant amount of NK activity variance could be explained by five variables . 
Higher NK activity could be predicted by the perception of high quality emotional support from a spouse or intimate other , perceived social support from the patient 's physician , <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> -negative tumor status , having an excisional biopsy as surgical treatment , and actively seeking social support as a major coping strategy ( R2 = 0.33 , F ( 5 , 55 ) = 5.5 , p less than 0.0004 ) . 
Findings are discussed in terms of host interaction with tumor endocrine status , and the role that social support might play in modulating such activity . 
[ <START:ggp> Estrogen receptor <END> content of <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ] 
ER content in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> of peripheral blood from 27 SLE patients and 20 healthy controls were determined by dextran-coated charcoal assay . 
<START:ggp> ER <END> content in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> of each sample was expressed by both fmol/mg of <START:ggp> lymphocyte cytosolic protein <END> and fmol/micrograms of <START:ggp> lymphocyte DNA <END> . 
The results showed that there was no significant difference between the <START:ggp> ER <END> content of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> from the controls and that from patients with SLE . 
But the logarithmic mean of <START:ggp> ER <END> content in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , expressed by fmol/mg of <START:ggp> cytosolic protein <END> , in 14 patients with active SLE ( 0.9356 +/- 0.31 ) was significantly higher than that in 13 patients with inactive SLE ( 0.2979 +/- 0.23 , P less than 0.001 ) and in the controls ( 0.6204 +/- 0.52 , P less than 0.001 ) . 
The normal upper limit of <START:ggp> ER <END> content in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , expressed by fmol/micrograms of DNA , was 0.136 . 
The elevated rate of <START:ggp> ER <END> content in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> in 14 active SLE ( 92.9 % ) was also higher than that in quieiescent patients ( 23.1 % , P less than 0.001 ) and in the controls ( 10 % , P less than 0.001 ) . 
Moreover , the elevated level of <START:ggp> ER <END> content was found to be related to the positive <START:ggp> antidsDNA antibody <END> and hypocomplementemia . 
An in vitro <START:ggp> globin gene <END> switching model based on <START:ana> differentiated embryonic stem cells <END> . 
We used <START:ana> mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells <END> to study <START:ggp> globin gene <END> expression and switching in vitro . 
We show that <START:ana> ES-derived embryoid bodies <END> express the full complement of <START:ggp> mouse embryonic globin genes <END> in the correct temporal order and that on further differentiation , a switch occurs to the <START:ggp> fetal/adult genes <END> . 
In addition , the <START:ggp> erythroid-specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-E1 <END> was shown to be expressed coordinately with that of <START:ggp> globin <END> in <START:ana> embryoid bodies <END> . 
We conclude from these experiments that the ES cell system provides a good model to study hematopoietic development . 
When the <START:ggp> human epsilon- or beta-globin genes <END> driven by the <START:ggp> dominant control region <END> ( <START:ggp> DCR <END> ) are introduced into this system , the <START:ggp> human epsilon-globin gene <END> , in contrast to the <START:ggp> beta-globin gene <END> , is not deregulated by the presence of the <START:ggp> DCR <END> and is expressed strictly as an <START:ggp> embryonic gene <END> . 
We conclude from this that the <START:ggp> epsilon-globin gene <END> is not regulated by competition with other genes in the <START:ggp> human beta-globin locus <END> . 
Cloning of a <START:ggp> mitogen-inducible gene <END> encoding a <START:ggp> kappa B DNA-binding protein <END> with homology to the <START:ggp> rel oncogene <END> and to <START:ggp> cell-cycle motifs <END> . 
We have cloned and characterized a <START:ggp> mitogen-inducible gene <END> isolated from <START:ana> human T cells <END> that predicts a protein of <START:ggp> 968 amino acids <END> . 
The <START:ggp> amino-terminal domain <END> has regions homologous to the <START:ggp> oncogene rel <END> and to the developmentally important gene <START:ggp> dorsal <END> of Drosophila . 
The <START:ggp> carboxy-terminal domain <END> contains repeat structures found in a variety of proteins that are involved in cell-cycle control of yeast and in tissue differentiation in Drosophila and Ceanorhabditis elegans , as well as in the <START:ggp> putative human oncogene bcl-3 <END> and in the <START:ggp> ankyrin protein <END> . 
A truncated form of the product of this gene translated in vitro is a <START:ggp> DNA-binding protein <END> which interacts specifically with the <START:ggp> kappa B binding site <END> found in many <START:ggp> inducible genes <END> , including the enhancer in human immunodeficiency virus . 
This gene is yet another in a growing list of important regulatory molecules whose expression is transcriptionally induced upon cellular activation . 
Extrarenal receptor-effector-mechanisms for aldosterone : the sequence of effects on the cellular electrolyte transport in <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> and their implications for disorders of the water and electrolyte balances . 
High affinity aldosterone binding sites have not only been described in the classic target tissues such as the renal tubules , but also in non-classic target tissues such as the hippocampus , mammary gland , <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> and , recently , <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> . 
An in vitro effect of aldosterone on intracellular sodium , potassium and calcium concentrations and cell volume was shown in <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> . 
In the absence of aldosterone , the intracellular Na+ , K+ and Ca2+ concentrations and the cell volume decreased significantly , but remained constant when aldosterone ( 1.4 nmol/l ) was added to the incubation medium . 
These effects of aldosterone were blocked by the aldosterone antagonist canrenone ( 140 nmol/l ) . 
The <START:ggp> sodium/proton exchanger <END> of the cell membrane could be identified as the primary target of the aldosterone action , possibly non-genomically mediated through <START:ggp> membrane receptors <END> . 
The clinical significance of this model was underlined by the demonstration of absent or a decreased number of <START:ggp> mineralocorticoid receptors <END> and the lack of electrolyte response to aldosterone in <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> of patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism and aldosteronism . 
Additionally , an abnormal effector mechanism could be demonstrated in <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> from essential hypertensives . 
These studies are the first to demonstrate the significance of <START:ggp> extrarenal , nonepithelial mineralocorticoid receptors <END> and the related effector mechanism in different disorders of the water and electrolyte balance in man . 
Immunohistochemical study of steroid hormones and an estrogen binding assay in <START:ana> malignant soft tissue tumors <END> . 
Immunohistochemically , the immunoreaction against 5 steroid hormone anti-sera ( estradiol , estriol , cortisol , progesterone and testosterone ) was examined in 39 cases with the <START:ana> malignant soft tissue tumors <END> ( fibrosarcoma : 8 , malignant fibrous histiocytoma : 6 , rhabdomyosarcoma : 10 , leiomyosarcoma : 10 , liposarcoma : 5 ) . 
Seventeen cases revealed distinct immunostaining against at least 1 of the 5 steroid hormones . 
<START:ana> Immunostained tumor cells <END> were more frequently distributed in the area where tumor cell infiltration was more invasive . 
The majority of the positive cases occurred in female cases . 
Furthermore , the existence of <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> ( estrogen binding activity ) was examined histochemically in 39 cases and it was detected in 8 . 
We concluded that steroid hormones might be closely related to tumor cell infiltration of some <START:ana> malignant soft tissue tumors <END> . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases <END> in the signal transduction pathway for <START:ggp> interleukin-1 <END> . 
Expression of a highly specific protein inhibitor for <START:ggp> cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases <END> in <START:ana> interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) -responsive cells <END> blocked <START:ggp> IL-1-induced gene <END> transcription that was driven by the <START:ggp> kappa immunoglobulin enhancer <END> or the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat <END> . 
This inhibitor did not affect <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> -mediated gene transcription , suggesting that <START:ggp> cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases <END> are involved in the signal transduction pathway for <START:ggp> IL-1 <END> in a number of <START:ana> responsive cell types <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) ORI1yt enhancer <END> is not B-cell specific and does not respond synergistically to the <START:ggp> EBV transcription factors R and Z <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus DR promoter <END> is located upstream of the <START:ggp> PstI repeats <END> , and in addition to the <START:ggp> TATA box <END> , it contains an <START:ggp> upstream region <END> ( positions -69 to -220 ) responsive to <START:ggp> EB1 ( Z ) <END> ( the <START:ggp> BZLF1-encoded transcription factor <END> ) and an <START:ggp> enhancer <END> with two functionally distinct domains , A and <START:ggp> B <END> . 
<START:ggp> Domain B <END> has been described as a <START:ggp> B-cell-specific EB1-responsive element <END> ( P.M.Lieberman , J.M.Hardwick , and S.D.Hayward , J.Virol.63 : 3040-3050 , 1989 ) activated synergistically by <START:ggp> EB1 <END> and <START:ggp> R <END> , an <START:ggp> EBV early product <END> encoded by the <START:ggp> open reading frame BRLF1 <END> ( M.A. Cox , J.Leahy , and J.M.Hardwick , J.Virol.64 : 313-321 , 1990 ) . 
We show here that <START:ggp> domain B <END> is an <START:ggp> R-responsive element <END> in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> and is therefore not an <START:ggp> EB1-responsive B-cell-specific element <END> . 
However , there is an <START:ggp> EB1-binding site <END> ( <START:ggp> ZRE-B <END> ) located within the <START:ggp> R-responsive enhancer region <END> . 
<START:ggp> ZRE-B <END> can be deleted without affecting the R-dependent enhancer activity . 
Moreover , there is no cooperation or synergy between <START:ggp> R <END> and <START:ggp> EB1 <END> when activating the <START:ggp> B domain <END> ( <START:ggp> ZRE-B <END> plus the <START:ggp> R-responsive element <END> ) positioned as an <START:ggp> enhancer <END> . 
<START:ggp> ZRE-B <END> is therefore not part of the <START:ggp> R- inducible enhancer <END> . 
We have tested several subregions of the <START:ggp> DR enhancer <END> <START:ggp> B domain <END> , either alone or in combination , for their capacity to transmit the R-activating signal to the <START:ggp> rabbit beta-globin promoter <END> . 
We found that the <START:ggp> R-responsive element <END> is composed of four <START:ggp> protoenhancers <END> that span the whole <START:ggp> B domain <END> . 
These <START:ggp> protoenhancers <END> alone are weakly or not responsive to <START:ggp> R <END> . 
One of the <START:ggp> protoenhancers <END> contains the <START:ggp> overlapping palindromes <END> 5'-TTGTCCcgtGGACAAaTGTCC-3' . 
However , one <START:ggp> palindrome <END> , either alone or duplicated , or the <START:ggp> overlapping palindromes <END> did not respond to R . 
Nuclear <START:ggp> 3 , 5 , 3'-triiodothyronine receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> T3R <END> ) of <START:ana> circulating human lymphocytes <END> in hyper- and hypothyroidism and nonthyroidal diseases . 
The clinical implications of nuclear <START:ggp> T3R <END> alterations of <START:ana> circulating lymphocytes <END> in hyperthyroidism , hypothyroidism and nonthyroidal diseases were investigated . 
Nuclear <START:ggp> T3R <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> was determined by radio-ligand binding analysis . 
The results showed that in hyper- and hypothyroid patients the nuclear affinity ( Ka ) for T3 was similar to that of normal subjects . 
In hyperthyroidism nuclear T3 maximal binding capacity ( MBC ) was unaltered , whereas in hypothyroidism the MBC was significantly increased . 
In the patients with diabetes mellitus , chronic renal failure and hepatic cirrhosis , the <START:ggp> nuclear T3R <END> MBC of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> was about 1.5-1.6 times of the normal controls . 
It was concluded that there existed hormonal regulation of <START:ggp> nuclear T3R <END> , and up-regulation was seen in hypothyroidism and low T3 syndrome . 
<START:ana> Lymphocyte cell lines <END> from vitamin D-dependent rickets type II show functional defects in the <START:ggp> 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor <END> . 
<START:ana> Lymphocyte cell lines <END> were established from five patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets , type II ( VDDR-II ) . 
These lines were established by infection with human T-lymphotrophic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) . 
Binding of [ 3H ] 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) to its receptor in these cell lines was compared to binding studies using a <START:ana> T-lymphocyte cell line <END> ( <START:ana> S-LB1 <END> ) from a normal individual . 
The 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor of <START:ana> S-LB1 <END> was comparable to the well-characterized <START:ggp> chick intestinal 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor <END> in terms of its ligand binding affinity and capacity , its mobility on 5-20 % sucrose gradients , and its adsorption to and elution properties from DNA-cellulose . 
Three <START:ana> cell lines <END> established from patients with VDDR-II ( Rh- <START:ggp> VDR <END> , Sh- <START:ggp> VDR <END> , and Ab- <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) showed no specific binding of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 to a <START:ggp> receptor <END> and treatment of the <START:ana> cultured cells <END> with 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 did not stimulate production of 24 , 25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 ( 24 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) , a response which is diagnostic of the presence of a <START:ggp> functional 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor <END> . 
In a fourth <START:ana> cell line <END> , <START:ana> A1-VDR <END> , the receptor for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 had a low binding capacity and <START:ggp> 25 ( OH ) D3-24-hydroxylase <END> activity was not detectable . 
Induction of 24 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 synthesis by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 was observed in the fifth <START:ana> cell line <END> , designated <START:ana> Ro-VDR <END> , although the sensitivity to hormone treatment was lower than in the <START:ana> control cell line <END> from a normal donor . 
The capacity of the <START:ggp> receptor <END> for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 was low in <START:ana> Ro-VDR <END> . 
In all <START:ana> cell lines <END> where 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 binding to a <START:ggp> receptor <END> was detectable , the <START:ggp> receptor <END> had the typical sedimentation coefficient of 3.7 S on sucrose density gradient analysis . 
Binding and elution properties to DNA-cellulose , however , differed from normal in both <START:ana> Ro-VDR <END> and <START:ana> A1-VDR cells <END> where elution from DNA-cellulose occurred at a lower salt concentration than is typical of the <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor <END> . 
While <START:ana> Ro-VDR cells <END> showed typical nuclear localization of the <START:ggp> unoccupied 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor <END> , neither the unoccupied nor the occupied <START:ggp> receptor <END> from <START:ana> A1-VDR cells <END> was completely localized in the nucleus . 
In a series of functional studies we found that modulation of the level of the <START:ana> mRNAs <END> coding for both the <START:ggp> c-myc oncogene <END> and the growth factor known as granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating activity by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 correlated with the <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor <END> status of these cells . 
Use of these <START:ana> cell lines <END> will facilitate further study of the molecular defect ( s ) in the <START:ggp> receptor <END> for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 in vitamin D-dependent rickets type II and will allow a correlation with impairment of cellular functions . 
Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression during monocytic differentiation of <START:ana> human myeloid leukemic cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , the polypeptide product of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> , recognizes and binds to specific DNA sequences and stimulates transcription of <START:ggp> genes <END> responsive to certain growth factors and phorbol esters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) . 
We studied the effects of TPA on the regulation of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> gene expression in <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> during monocytic differentiation . 
Low levels of <START:ana> c-jun transcripts <END> were detectable in <START:ana> untreated HL-60 leukemic cells <END> , increased significantly by 6 h , and reached near maximal levels by 24 h of exposure to 32 nM TPA . 
Similar kinetics of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> induction by TPA were observed in <START:ana> human U-937 <END> and <START:ana> THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells <END> . 
Similar findings were obtained with bryostatin 1 ( 10 nM ) , another activator of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> and inducer of monocytic differentiation . 
Furthermore , 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 0.5 microM ) , a structurally distinct agent which also induces HL-60 monocytic differentiation , increased <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression . 
TPA treatment of <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> in the presence of cycloheximide was associated with superinduction of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> transcripts . 
Run-on analysis demonstrated detectable levels of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> gene transcription in <START:ana> untreated HL-60 cells <END> , and that exposure to TPA increases this rate 3.3-fold . 
Treatment of <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> with both TPA and cycloheximide had no effect on the rates of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> transcription . 
The half-life of <START:ana> c-jun RNA <END> as determined by treating <START:ana> HL-60 cells <END> with TPA and actinomycin D was 30 min . 
In contrast , the half-life of <START:ana> c-jun RNA <END> in <START:ana> TPA-treated HL-60 cells <END> exposed to cycloheximide and actinomycin D was greater than 2 h . 
These findings suggested that the increase in <START:ana> c-jun RNA <END> observed during TPA-induced monocytic differentiation is mediated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms . 
[ Hormonal interactions and <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in patients with the nephrotic syndrome ] 
As many as 27 children aged 6 to 15 years with morphologically verified nephropathies were examined . 
Four variants of changes in the thyroid status , characteristic of children with different variants of nephrotic syndrome were distinguished : 1 ) biochemical signs of primary hypothyroidism , 2 ) biochemical signs of secondary hypothyroidism , 3 ) low content of T3 , 4 ) dysfunction of the hypophyseal and thyroid system . 
It is shown that the low level of <START:ggp> steroid receptors <END> , thyroid hormones that the low level of <START:ggp> steroid receptors <END> , thyroid hormones ( T3 and T4 ) and cortisol is typical of children with the signs of renal dysplasia . 
It is assumed that superaddition under such conditions of immune glomerulopathy ( glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome ) gives rise to the resistance to the treatment with glucocorticoids . 
Lymphoid specific gene expression of the <START:ggp> adenovirus early region 3 promoter <END> is mediated by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B binding motifs <END> . 
A primary site of infection by human adenoviruses is <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
However , analysis of the <START:ggp> viral control elements <END> and the <START:ggp> cellular factors <END> that regulate adenoviral gene expression in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> has not been reported . 
The <START:ggp> adenovirus early region 3 ( ES ) gene products <END> are involved in the maintenance of viral persistence by complexing with the <START:ggp> class I MHC antigens <END> , thus preventing their cell surface expression with a resultant decrease in host immunologic destruction . 
To determine whether different <START:ggp> cellular factors <END> were involved in E3 regulation in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> as compared with <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , both DNA binding and transfection analysis with the <START:ggp> E3 promoter <END> in both cell types were performed . 
These studies detected two <START:ggp> novel domains <END> referred to as <START:ggp> L1 <END> and <START:ggp> L2 <END> with a variety of lymphoid but not HeLa extracts . 
Each of these domains possessed strong homology to motifs previously found to bind the <START:ggp> cellular factor NF-kappa B <END> . 
Transfections of <START:ggp> E3 constructs <END> linked to the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene <END> revealed that mutagenesis of the <START:ggp> distal NF-kappa B motif <END> ( <START:ggp> L2 <END> ) had minimal effects on promoter expression in <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , but resulted in dramatic decreases in expression by <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
In contrast , mutagenesis of <START:ggp> proximal NF-kappa B motif <END> ( <START:ggp> L1 <END> ) had minimal effects on gene expression in both <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> and <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> but resulted in a small , but reproducible , increase in gene expression in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> when coupled to the <START:ggp> L2 <END> mutation . 
Reversing the position and subsequent mutagenesis of the <START:ggp> L1 <END> and <START:ggp> L2 domains <END> indicated that the <START:ggp> primary sequence <END> of these motifs rather than their position in the <START:ggp> E3 promoter <END> was critical for regulating gene expression . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Characterization of <START:ggp> defensin <END> resistance phenotypes associated with mutations in the <START:ggp> phoP virulence regulon <END> of Salmonella typhimurium . 
The <START:ggp> defensin <END> sensitivities of Salmonella typhimurium strains with mutations in the <START:ggp> phoP/phoQ two-component virulence regulon <END> were tested by using <START:ggp> purified defensins <END> <START:ggp> NP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NP-2 <END> . 
Strains with mutations in either gene of the <START:ggp> regulatory pair <END> ( <START:ggp> phoP <END> [ <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> ] or <START:ggp> phoQ <END> [ <START:ggp> membrane sensor kinase <END> ] ) had increased sensitivities to <START:ggp> defensin <END> . 
The predicted <START:ggp> periplasmic domain <END> of the <START:ggp> PhoQ protein <END> contained a markedly anionic domain that could interact with <START:ggp> cationic proteins <END> and that could be responsible for resistance to <START:ggp> defensin <END> . 
Because insertion mutations in <START:ggp> phoP <END> are polar on <START:ggp> phoQ <END> , we constructed strains that expressed the <START:ggp> PhoQ protein <END> in the absence of <START:ggp> PhoP <END> to test whether resistance to defensin requires only the <START:ggp> phoQ gene product <END> . 
We found that resistance to defensin requires the function of both components of this regulatory system , because strains expressing <START:ggp> PhoQ <END> without <START:ggp> PhoP <END> were still markedly sensitive to <START:ggp> defensins <END> . 
This implied that a <START:ggp> pag ( phoP-activated gene ) product <END> is responsible for <START:ggp> defensin <END> resistance . 
We also tested for the ability of <START:ggp> defensins <END> <START:ggp> NP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NP-5 <END> , and <START:ggp> HNP-1 <END> to activate <START:ggp> pag <END> expression and found that these peptides have no effect . 
Defensin resistance is not the only virulence characteristic controlled by the <START:ggp> PhoP-PhoQ regulon <END> because mutations in <START:ggp> pagC <END> , as well as ones in the <START:ggp> phoP locus <END> that resulted in constitutive <START:ggp> pag <END> activation ( phenotype <START:ggp> PhoPc <END> ) , had no effect on <START:ggp> defensin <END> resistance , even though they rendered the organism avirulent and deficient in survival within <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
The virulence defect conferred by mutations in the <START:ggp> phoP <END> <START:ggp> -phoQ <END> two-component regulatory system is not completely explained by alterations in resistance to <START:ggp> cationic proteins <END> and involves the control of other proteins necessary for S. typhimurium survival within <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
Stimulation of a <START:ana> human T-cell clone <END> with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> or <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> induces <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation but not human immunodeficiency virus 1 enhancer-dependent transcription . 
The expression of transiently transfected expression vectors under the control of the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) or its <START:ggp> enhancer sequence <END> and the translocation of the <START:ggp> HIV enhancer-binding protein <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> were analyzed in two human <START:ana> T-cell clones <END> stimulated through their <START:ggp> T-cell receptor complex <END> or by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate . 
We found a dissociation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation from transactivation of either the <START:ggp> HIV LTR <END> or the <START:ggp> HIV enhancer <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin 2 <END> induced proliferation but not <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation or <START:ggp> LTR <END> transactivation . 
Phorbol ester or specific antigen recognition induced <START:ggp> HIV LTR <END> transactivation , whereas stimulation with <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> or antibody to <START:ggp> CD3 <END> did not . 
The two latter signals were nevertheless able to induce <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation with a pattern in the band-shift assay indistinguishable from that observed using phorbol ester . 
Our finding that induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor <END> or <START:ggp> antibody to CD3 <END> is not sufficient to induce <START:ggp> HIV enhancer <END> -dependent transcription in <START:ana> cloned T cells <END> contrasts with results obtained in most <START:ana> lymphoblastoid T-cell lines <END> and indicates that normal <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> differ from <START:ana> tumoral T cells <END> in terms of requirements for <START:ggp> HIV LTR <END> activation . 
Furthermore , our results suggest that events linked to T-cell activation , in addition to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> translocation per se , induce functional interactions of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> with the <START:ggp> HIV enhancer <END> . 
Decreased concentration of <START:ggp> 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors <END> in <START:ana> peripheral mononuclear cells <END> of patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets : effect of phosphate supplementation . 
Abnormal renal tubular phosphate transport is considered to be the primary defect in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets ( XLH ) . 
However , the resistance to vitamin D treatment in XLH can not be explained by hypophosphatemia alone . 
Since most of the actions of vitamin D are mediated by its receptors ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) , abnormalities of <START:ggp> VDR <END> have been postulated in XLH . 
In order to investigate this possibility , we measured the concentration of <START:ggp> VDR <END> in <START:ana> PHA-activated peripheral mononuclear cells <END> from 10 XLH patients . 
Patients without phosphate supplementation showed significantly lower concentration ( 21.7 +/- 5.1 fmol/mg protein , mean +/- SEM ) compared to the normal controls ( 60.7 +/- 4.0 ) . 
On the contrary , there was no significant difference between the phosphate-supplemented patients ( 58.3 +/- 2.7 ) and controls . 
There was a significant positive correlation between <START:ggp> VDR <END> concentration and serum phosphate ( P less than 0.05 ) . 
In two patients , <START:ggp> VDR <END> was increased after daily phosphate supplementation was started . 
These results indicate that a decreased concentration of <START:ggp> VDR <END> secondary to persistent hypophosphatemia is one of the causes of vitamin D resistance in XLH . 
Two distinct forms of <START:ggp> active transcription factor CREB <END> ( <START:ggp> cAMP response element binding protein <END> ) . 
<START:ana> Mammalian cells <END> express two distinct forms of <START:ggp> transcription factor CREB <END> ( <START:ggp> cAMP response element binding protein <END> ) that are apparently the products of alternative splicing of the <START:ana> CREB gene transcript <END> . 
The two proteins differ by a <START:ggp> 14-amino acid serine-rich insertion <END> present in one of the <START:ggp> CREB isoforms <END> . 
We show that both <START:ggp> CREB isoforms <END> are expressed in <START:ana> many cell types <END> and mammalian species . 
Both encode proteins that bind specifically to a <START:ggp> cAMP response element in vitro <END> . 
As expected for proteins of this class , the <START:ggp> CREB proteins <END> bind DNA as dimers . 
Both proteins impart cAMP-regulated transcriptional activity to a <START:ggp> heterologous DNA-binding domain <END> , showing that cAMP directly modulates the transcriptional stimulatory activity of <START:ggp> CREB <END> . 
The presence of multiple <START:ggp> CREB isoforms <END> with identical DNA-binding specificities but differences in the presumed <START:ggp> regulatory domain <END> raises the possibility that <START:ggp> CREB proteins <END> may be able to integrate distinct regulatory signals at the level of gene transcription . 
Human immunodeficiency virus vpr product is a <START:ggp> virion-associated regulatory protein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> vpr product <END> of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) acts in trans to accelerate virus replication and cytopathic effect in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Here it is shown that the HIV-1 viral particle contains multiple copies of the <START:ggp> vpr protein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> vpr product <END> is the first regulatory protein of HIV-1 to be found in the virus particle . 
This observation raises the possibility that <START:ggp> vpr <END> acts to facilitate the early steps of infection before de novo viral protein synthesis occurs . 
A novel <START:ggp> B-cell lineage-specific transcription factor <END> present at early but not late stages of differentiation . 
A novel <START:ggp> B-cell-specific transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> BSAP <END> , was identified as a <START:ggp> mammalian homolog <END> of the <START:ggp> sea urchin protein <END> <START:ggp> TSAP <END> , which interacts with the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of four <START:ggp> tissue-specific late histone H2A-2 and H2B-2 genes <END> . 
As shown by mobility-shift , methylation interference , and mutational analyses , the <START:ggp> mammalian protein <END> <START:ggp> BSAP <END> recognizes all four <START:ggp> sea urchin binding sites <END> in a manner indistinguishable from <START:ggp> TSAP <END> ; however , the two proteins differ in molecular weight . 
<START:ggp> BSAP <END> is exclusively restricted to the B-cell lineage of lymphoid differentiation . 
Its expression appears to be activated during pro-B-cell development , is abundant at the pre-B- and mature B-cell stages , but is absent in <START:ana> terminally differentiated plasma cells <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> BSAP <END> is clearly a <START:ggp> B-cell-specific transcription factor <END> , as a <START:ggp> wild-type <END> but not a <START:ggp> mutant TSAP-binding site <END> of the sea urchin functions only in <START:ana> transfected B cells <END> as an <START:ggp> upstream promoter element <END> . 
Competition experiments did not reveal any <START:ggp> high-affinity binding site <END> for <START:ggp> BSAP <END> in known <START:ggp> regulatory regions <END> of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin and class II major histocompatibility ( MHC ) genes <END> , suggesting that <START:ggp> BSAP <END> is a regulator of a different set of <START:ggp> B-lymphoid-specific genes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Octamer transcription factors <END> and the <START:ggp> cell type-specificity of immunoglobulin gene <END> expression . 
<START:ggp> Antibodies <END> are produced exclusively in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
The expression of the <START:ggp> antibody-encoding genes <END> , the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin ( Ig ) genes <END> , is also restricted to <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
The <START:ggp> octamer sequence <END> ATGCAAAT is present in the <START:ggp> promoter <END> and the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> of <START:ggp> Ig genes <END> , and plays an important role in its tissue-specific expression . 
This <START:ggp> sequence motif <END> is a binding site for <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> , the so-called <START:ggp> octamer transcription factors <END> ( <START:ggp> Oct <END> or <START:ggp> OTF factors <END> ) . 
The <START:ggp> Oct-1 protein <END> is present in all cell types analyzed so far , whereas <START:ggp> Oct-2A <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2B <END> are found mainly in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
All three proteins show the same sequence specificity and binding affinity . 
It appears that the B cell-specific expression of <START:ggp> Ig genes <END> is mediated at least in part by cell <START:ggp> type-specific Oct factors <END> , and that there are both quantitative and qualitative differences between <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2 factors <END> . 
Recently , a number of other <START:ggp> octamer factor variants <END> were identified . 
Many of these may be created by alternative splicing of a <START:ana> primary transcript <END> of one Oct factor gene and may serve a specific function in the fine tuning of gene expression . 
A factor known to bind to <START:ggp> endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer <END> only in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> is a <START:ggp> ubiquitously active transcription factor <END> . 
The <START:ggp> transcriptional enhancer <END> located in the first intron of the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region <END> is a major determinant of B-cell-specific expression of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin genes <END> . 
Like other <START:ggp> enhancers <END> , the <START:ggp> Ig heavy chain enhancer <END> contains several short <START:ggp> sequence motifs <END> that bind <START:ggp> specific transcription factors <END> . 
Each <START:ggp> binding site <END> contributes to the overall activity of the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> , however no single element seems absolutely required for activity . 
For a better understanding of the <START:ggp> Ig heavy chain enhancer components <END> , we have cloned and analyzed individual <START:ggp> sequence elements <END> . 
We find that the factor that binds to the <START:ggp> E3 enhancer motif <END> , CATGTGGC , is a <START:ggp> ubiquitous transcription factor <END> . 
It is present in an active form in both <START:ana> B cells <END> and <START:ana> non-B cells <END> , where it can mediate transcriptional activation in vitro and in vivo . 
However , despite its ability to activate transcription of a <START:ggp> transfected reporter gene <END> , the factor is apparently unable to bind to the <START:ggp> endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer <END> in <START:ana> non-lymphoid cells <END> : In previous experiments by others , the characteristic in vivo footprint of this factor , designated <START:ggp> NF-muE3 <END> , was detected in <START:ana> B cells <END> but not in <START:ana> non-B cells <END> . 
From this and other findings the picture emerges that there are at least three categories of factors which mediate cell-type-specific transcription in <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> : ( a ) <START:ggp> cell-specific factors <END> such as <START:ggp> Oct-2A <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2B <END> that are not expressed in most other cell types : ( b ) <START:ggp> ubiquitous factors <END> such as <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> that are constitutively active in <START:ana> B cells <END> but are sequestered in an inactive form in other cells ; ( c ) <START:ggp> ubiquitously active factors <END> , exemplified by the one binding to the <START:ggp> E3 sequence motif <END> . 
This factor is present in an active form in a variety of cell types but is apparently unable to bind to the <START:ggp> endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer <END> in <START:ana> non-B cells <END> , perhaps due to a non-permissive <START:ggp> chromatin <END> structure of the <START:ggp> Ig heavy chain locus <END> . 
[ Endocrine status changes in children with bronchial asthma ] 
A study was made of adrenocortical function by measuring blood plasma cortisol concentration and amount of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> as well as thyroid function by measuring blood plasma triidothyronine and thyroxine concentration in 58 bronchial asthma children aged 1 to 14 years . 
The authors revealed alterations in the functional activity of the indicated endocrine glands depending on the intensity of bronchial patency disorders and the nature of the therapeutic measures carried out . 
<START:ggp> TAR <END> independent activation of the human immunodeficiency virus in phorbol ester stimulated <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Multiple regulatory elements <END> in the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> HIV LTR <END> ) are required for activation of HIV gene expression . 
Previous transfection studies of <START:ggp> HIV LTR constructs <END> linked to the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene <END> indicated that multiple <START:ggp> regulatory regions <END> including the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> , <START:ggp> SP1 <END> , <START:ggp> TATA <END> and <START:ggp> TAR regions <END> were important for HIV gene expression . 
To characterize these <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> further , mutations in these regions were inserted into both the 5 ' and 3 ' <START:ggp> HIV LTRs <END> and infectious proviral constructs were assembled . 
These constructs were transfected into either <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> or <START:ana> U937 cells <END> in both the presence and absence of phorbol esters which have previously been demonstrated to activate HIV gene expression . 
Viral gene expression was assayed by the level of <START:ggp> p24 gag protein <END> released from cultures transfected with the proviral constructs . 
Results in all cell lines indicated that mutations of the <START:ggp> SP1 <END> , <START:ggp> TATA <END> and the TAR loop and stem secondary structure resulted in marked decreases in gene expression while mutations of the <START:ggp> enhancer motif <END> or <START:ggp> TAR primary sequence <END> resulted in only slight decreases . 
However , viruses containing mutations in either the <START:ggp> TAR loop sequences <END> or stem secondary structure which were very defective for gene expression in untreated <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> , gave nearly wild-type levels of gene expression in <START:ana> phorbol ester-treated Jurkat cells <END> but not in <START:ana> phorbol ester-treated HeLa <END> or <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
High level gene expression of these <START:ggp> TAR mutant constructs <END> in <START:ana> phorbol ester-treated Jurkat cells <END> was eliminated by second site mutations in the <START:ggp> enhancer region <END> or by disruption of the <START:ggp> tat gene <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
A case of hypersensitivity to thyroid hormones with normally functioning thyroid gland and increased nuclear <START:ggp> triiodothyronine receptors <END> . 
A 52-year-old male presented himself with tachycardia crises which appeared first during childhood , increased in frequency without goiter or exophthalmos . 
Cardiac and adrenergic diseases were excluded . 
The thyroid function was normal regarding T4 , free T4 and T3 , TBG , radioiodine uptake , TSH and T3 suppressibility ; however the TSH response to TRH was decreased . 
The <START:ggp> lymphocyte nuclear T3 receptor <END> was found with an affinity close to that of normal volunteers ( Ka : 1.42 x 10 ( 10 ) M-1 vs 1.95 +/- 0.35 x 10 ( 10 ) M-1 ) and a binding capacity markedly increased ( 9.9 vs 3.7 +/- 0.4 fmol T3/100 micrograms DNA ) . 
Pindolol was inefficient on the dysrhythmia which disappeared with carbimazole and relapsed after withdrawal of the antithyroid drug . 
Under carbimazole , the plasma T4 markedly decreased ( 27.7 +/- 3.6 nmol/l ) but the patient remained euthyroid . 
The clinical course and the laboratory data suggest that the tachycardia crises are the consequence of a hypersensitivity of the heart to thyroid hormones , associated with an increased number of <START:ggp> T3 nuclear receptor <END> sites in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
Induction of <START:ggp> immediate early response genes <END> by <START:ggp> macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> in <START:ana> normal human monocytes <END> . 
A group of coordinately induced <START:ggp> protooncogenes <END> , <START:ggp> cytoskeletal , and extracellular matrix genes <END> have been termed <START:ggp> immediate early response genes <END> , and their induction has been associated with <START:ggp> growth factor <END> -stimulated cell proliferation . 
We have investigated the induction of these genes by <START:ggp> macrophage-CSF <END> ( <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> ) in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> that do not proliferate in response to <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> but require the factor for optimal cell differentiation . 
Normal <START:ana> human monocytes <END> were isolated , carefully washed , and incubated for 36 to 48 h in fetal bovine serum-containing medium . 
At the end of this incubation the <START:ana> resting cells <END> were stimulated with <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> , and RNA was isolated for analysis by Northern blotting . 
RNA from control <START:ana> resting cells <END> contained low to undetectable levels of <START:ana> c-jun <END> , <START:ana> fibronectin receptor <END> , and <START:ana> actin mRNA <END> . 
Within 15 to 30 min of addition of <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> , however , there was a dramatic coordinate induction of these genes . 
The <START:ggp> c-jun gene <END> expression was very transient and was not detectable by 60 min after <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> addition . 
In contrast , the expression of <START:ana> actin and fibronectin receptor mRNA <END> was more sustained , and the expression of these genes remained elevated at 24 to 48 h after <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> addition . 
We also observed the induction of the <START:ggp> myelomonocytic specific tyrosine kinase hck gene <END> simultaneously with the other <START:ggp> immediate early response genes <END> . 
The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not block the induction of any of these genes , and in fact , super-induced the expression of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> and <START:ggp> hck <END> . 
Nuclear run on transcription of the <START:ggp> c-jun <END> , <START:ggp> hck <END> , and <START:ggp> actin genes <END> . 
Therefore , in <START:ana> normal human monocytes <END> <START:ggp> M-CSF <END> induces <START:ggp> immediate early response genes <END> without inducing cell proliferation . 
These genes may then play a role in altering the physiologic status of the cells in response to <START:ggp> CSF <END> . 
Inducible <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> binding to the <START:ggp> kappa B elements <END> of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus enhancer <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> can be blocked by cyclosporin A in a signal-dependent manner . 
Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) is thought to exert its immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting the expression of a distinct set of <START:ggp> lymphokine genes <END> which are induced upon T-cell activation , among them the gene coding for <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> . 
In addition , the activation of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is partially suppressed . 
To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying suppression by CsA , we have investigated the effects of this drug on <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Here we report that the formation of two distinct <START:ggp> mitogen-inducible DNA-binding complexes <END> , the <START:ggp> kappa B complex <END> within the <START:ggp> HIV enhancer <END> and the <START:ggp> NFAT-1 complex <END> within the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 enhancer <END> , is inhibited in the presence of CsA . 
The kappa B-binding activity with the <START:ggp> HIV enhancer <END> is inhibited only if it is activated via the <START:ggp> mitogen <END> <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> whereas phorbol myristate acetate-mediated activation is completely insensitive to the drug . 
This suggests a model in which functionally indistinguishable <START:ggp> kappa B complexes <END> can be activated via two separate pathways of signal transduction distinguishable by CsA . 
Purification of <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha <END> , a <START:ggp> T-cell-specific transcription factor <END> that activates the <START:ggp> T-cell receptor C alpha gene enhancer <END> in a context-dependent manner . 
The differentiation of <START:ana> T cells <END> into functionally diverse subpopulations is controlled in part , by transcriptional activation and silencing ; however , little is known in detail about the proteins that influence this developmental process . 
We have purified a new <START:ggp> T-cell-specific factor <END> , <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha <END> , that is implicated in the activation of genes encoding a major component of the <START:ggp> human T-cell receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TCR <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha <END> , originally identified and purified through its binding sites on the <START:ggp> HIV-1 promoter <END> , was found to bind to the <START:ggp> TCR alpha enhancer <END> and to <START:ggp> promoters <END> for several <START:ggp> genes <END> expressed at significantly earlier stages of T-cell development than the <START:ggp> TCR alpha gene <END> ( e.g. , <START:ggp> p56lck <END> and <START:ggp> CD3 delta <END> ) . 
Sequences related to the <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha binding motif <END> ( 5'-GGCACCCTTTGA-3 ' ) are also found in the <START:ggp> human TCR delta <END> ( and possibly <START:ggp> TCR beta <END> ) <START:ggp> enhancers <END> . 
Southwestern and gel renaturation experiments with the use of purified protein fractions revealed that <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha <END> activity is derived from a family of <START:ggp> 57- to 53-kD proteins <END> that are abundantly expressed in <START:ana> mature and immature T-cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> Jurkat <END> , <START:ana> CCRF-CEM <END> ) and not in <START:ana> mature B cells <END> ( <START:ana> JY <END> , <START:ana> Namalwa <END> ) or <START:ana> nonlymphoid ( HeLa ) cell lines <END> . 
A small 95-bp fragment of the <START:ggp> TCR alpha control region <END> that contains the <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha binding site <END> juxtaposed between a <START:ggp> cAMP-response element <END> ( the <START:ggp> CRE <END> or <START:ggp> T alpha 1 motif <END> ) and the <START:ggp> binding site <END> for a distinct <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific protein <END> ( <START:ggp> TCF-2 alpha <END> ) behaved as a potent <START:ggp> T-cell-specific enhancer <END> in vivo . 
Tandem copies of this enhancer functioned synergistically in <START:ana> mature ( Jurkat ) T-cell lines <END> as well as resting and activated <START:ana> immature ( CCRF-CEM ) T-cell lines <END> . 
Mutation of the <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha binding site <END> diminished enhancer activity and disrupted the synergism observed in vivo between <START:ggp> tandem enhancer repeats <END> . 
The <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha binding site <END> was also required for <START:ggp> TCR <END> alpha enhancer activity in transcriptionally active extracts from <START:ana> Jurkat <END> but not <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , confirming that <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha <END> is a <START:ggp> T-cell-specific transcription factor <END> . 
Curiously , the <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha <END> binding element was inactive in vivo when removed from its neighboring elements on the <START:ggp> TCR alpha enhancer <END> and positioned in one or more copies upstream of a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> . 
Thus , the transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> TCF-1 alpha <END> appears to depend on the <START:ggp> TCF-2 alpha <END> and <START:ggp> T alpha 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> CREB <END> ) <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> and the context of its binding site within the <START:ggp> TCR alpha enhancer <END> . 
<START:ggp> Tandem AP-1-binding sites <END> within the <START:ggp> human beta-globin dominant control region <END> function as an <START:ggp> inducible enhancer <END> in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> . 
A powerful enhancer has been mapped to an <START:ggp> 18-bp DNA segment <END> located 11 kb 5 ' to the <START:ggp> human epsilon-globin gene <END> within the <START:ggp> dominant control <END> or <START:ggp> locus-activating region <END> . 
This <START:ggp> enhancer <END> is inducible in <START:ana> K562 human erythroleukemia cells <END> , increasing linked <START:ggp> gamma-globin promoter <END> <START:ggp> /luciferase <END> gene expression to 170-fold over an <START:ggp> enhancerless construct <END> . 
The <START:ggp> enhancer <END> consists of <START:ggp> tandem AP-1-binding sites <END> , phased 10 bp apart , which are both required for full activity . 
DNA-protein binding assays with nuclear extracts from induced cells demonstrate a <START:ggp> high molecular weight complex <END> on the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> . 
The formation of this complex also requires both <START:ggp> AP-1 sites <END> and correlates with maximal <START:ggp> enhancer <END> activity . 
Induction of the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> may have a role in the increase in <START:ggp> globin gene <END> transcription that characterizes erythroid maturation . 
Enhancer activity appears to be mediated by the binding of a complex of proteins from the <START:ggp> jun and fos families <END> to <START:ggp> tandem AP-1 consensus sequences <END> . 
Identification of a <START:ggp> novel factor <END> that interacts with an <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy-chain promoter <END> and stimulates transcription in conjunction with the <START:ggp> lymphoid cell-specific factor <END> <START:ggp> OTF2 <END> . 
The tissue-specific expression of the <START:ggp> MOPC 141 immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene <END> was studied by using in vitro transcription . 
B-cell-specific transcription of this gene was dependent on the <START:ggp> octamer element <END> 5'-ATGCAAAG-3 ' , located in the <START:ggp> upstream region <END> of this <START:ggp> promoter <END> and in the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of all other <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes <END> . 
The interaction of purified <START:ggp> octamer transcription factors <END> 1 and 2 ( <START:ggp> OTF1 <END> and <START:ggp> OTF2 <END> ) with the <START:ggp> MOPC 141 promoter <END> was studied by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and <START:ggp> DNase I <END> footprinting . 
Purified <START:ggp> OTF1 <END> from <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> and <START:ggp> OTF1 <END> and <START:ggp> OTF2 <END> from <START:ana> B cells <END> bound to identical sequences within the <START:ggp> heavy-chain promoter <END> . 
The OTF interactions we observed extended over the <START:ggp> heptamer element <END> 5'-CTCAGGA-3 ' , and it seems likely that the binding of the <START:ggp> purified factors <END> involves cooperation between <START:ggp> octamer and heptamer sites <END> in this <START:ggp> promoter <END> . 
In addition to these elements , we identified a second <START:ggp> regulatory element <END> , the <START:ggp> N element <END> with the sequence 5'-GGAACCTCCCCC-3' . 
The <START:ggp> N element <END> could independently mediate low levels of transcription in both B-cell and HeLa-cell extracts , and , in conjunction with the <START:ggp> octamer element <END> , it can promote high levels of transcription in B-cell extracts . 
The <START:ggp> N element <END> bound a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> NTF <END> , that is ubiquitous in cell-type distribution , and <START:ggp> NTF <END> was distinct from any of the <START:ggp> previously described proteins <END> that bind to similar sequences . 
Based on these results , we propose that <START:ggp> NTF <END> and <START:ggp> OTF2 <END> interactions ( both with their <START:ggp> cognate DNA elements <END> and possibly at the protein-protein level ) may be critical to B-cell-specific expression and that these interactions provide additional pathways for regulating gene expression . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> as inducible <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> of the <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene <END> . 
The expression of the gene encoding the <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) is induced upon activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> with <START:ggp> phytohemagglutinin <END> and active phorbolester and upon expression of <START:ggp> tax1 <END> , a <START:ggp> transactivating protein <END> of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I . 
The same agents induce transcription from the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain and interleukin-2 genes <END> , depending on <START:ggp> promoter elements <END> that bind the <START:ggp> inducible transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( or an <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-like factor <END> ) . 
We therefore tested the possibility that the <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> is also regulated by a cognate motif for the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B transcription factor <END> . 
A recent functional analysis by Miyatake et al. ( S. Miyatake , M. Seiki , M. Yoshida , and K. Arai , Mol. Cell. Biol. 8 : 5581-5587 , 1988 ) described a <START:ggp> short promoter region <END> in the <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> that conferred strong inducibility by T-cell-activating signals and <START:ggp> tax1 <END> , but no <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-binding motifs <END> were identified . 
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we showed binding of purified <START:ggp> human NF-kappa B <END> and of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activated in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> to an oligonucleotide comprising the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter element <END> responsible for mediating responsiveness to T-cell-activating signals and <START:ggp> tax1 <END> . 
As shown by a methylation interference analysis and oligonucleotide competition experiments , purified <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binds at <START:ggp> positions -82 to -91 <END> ( GGGAACTACC ) of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> sequence with an affinity similar to that with which it binds to the <START:ggp> biologically functional kappa B motif <END> in the <START:ggp> beta interferon promoter <END> ( GGGAAATTCC ) . 
Two <START:ggp> kappa B-like motifs <END> at <START:ggp> positions -98 to -108 <END> of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> were also recognized but with much lower affinities . 
Our data provide strong evidence that the expression of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> following T-cell activation is controlled by binding of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B transcription factor <END> to a <START:ggp> high-affinity binding site <END> in the <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> . 
Effects of mitogenic agents upon glucocorticoid action in <START:ana> human tonsillar T-lymphocytes <END> . 
The treatment of <START:ana> human tonsillar T-lymphocytes <END> with 4-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , resulted in about two fold increase in <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) number , without any significant change in the receptor affinity . 
This increase disappeared in the presence of cycloheximide . 
Alone , PMA and calcium ionophore A23187 did not affect , but together stimulated , like <START:ggp> phytohaemagglutinin <END> ( <START:ggp> PHA <END> ) , leucine and , in particular , thymidine incorporation . 
PMA enhanced slightly the stimulatory effect of <START:ggp> PHA <END> . 
Alone , these agents failed to alter the suppressive effect of dexamethasone on thymidine and leucine incorporation ; however , PMA-A23187 and PMA <START:ggp> -PHA <END> combinations appeared to antagonize the suppression by dexamethasone . 
To be or not to be a responder in T-cell responses : ubiquitous oligopeptides in all proteins . 
Amino acid sequences of all proteins are essays written in the same language . 
Accordingly , the same set of words and phrases ( oligopeptides ) appear in totally unrelated proteins . 
The reason that only certain individuals of particular <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) haplotypes <END> can mount T-cell responses against a given antigen of pathogens is found in the fact that <START:ggp> T-cell receptors <END> are designed to recognize 18-20 residue-long peptide fragments sandwiched between two <START:ggp> alpha-helices <END> of <START:ggp> class I <END> or class II MHC molecules . 
At this range of peptide lengths , most would appear as self , while nonselfness of the remainders are destined to be quite ambiguous , hence creating responders and nonresponders . 
Two distinct signal transmission pathways in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> are inhibited by complexes formed between an <START:ggp> immunophilin <END> and either FK506 or rapamycin . 
Proliferation and immunologic function of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> are initiated by signals from the <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> that are inhibited by the immunosuppressant FK506 but not by its structural analog , rapamycin . 
On the other hand , <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) -induced signals are blocked by rapamycin but not by FK506 . 
Remarkably , these two drugs inhibit each other 's actions , raising the possibility that both act by means of a common <START:ggp> immunophilin <END> ( <START:ggp> immunosuppressant binding protein <END> ) . 
We find that the dissociation constant of rapamycin to the <START:ggp> FK506 binding protein <END> <START:ggp> FKBP <END> ( Kd = 0.2 nM ) is close to the dissociation constant of FK506 to <START:ggp> FKBP <END> ( Kd = 0.4 nM ) and to their effective biologic inhibitory concentrations . 
However , an excess of rapamycin is needed to revert FK506-mediated inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production , apoptosis , and transcriptional activation of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , a <START:ggp> T-cell-specific transcription factor <END> necessary for <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> activation . 
Similarly , an excess of FK506 is needed to revert rapamycin-mediated inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced proliferation . 
The drug concentrations required for antagonism may be explained by the relative affinity of the drugs to , and by the abundance of , the <START:ggp> immunophilin <END> <START:ggp> FKBP <END> . 
<START:ggp> FKBP <END> has been shown to catalyze the interconversion of the cis- and trans-rotamers of the <START:ggp> peptidyl-prolyl amide bond <END> of peptide substrates ; here we show that rapamycin , like FK506 , is a potent inhibitor of the rotamase activity of <START:ggp> FKBP <END> ( Ki = 0.2 nM ) . 
Neither <START:ggp> FKBP <END> binding nor inhibition of rotamase activity of <START:ggp> FKBP <END> alone is sufficient to explain the biologic actions of these drugs . 
Rather , these findings suggest that <START:ggp> immunophilin <END> bound to FK506 interferes with <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> -induced signals , while rapamycin bound to the <START:ggp> immunophilin <END> interferes with <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced signals . 
Adherence-dependent increase in <START:ana> human monocyte PDGF ( B ) mRNA <END> is associated with increases in <START:ana> c-fos , c-jun , and EGR2 mRNA <END> . 
Adherence is an important initial step in the transition of a <START:ana> circulating monocyte <END> to a <START:ana> tissue macrophage <END> . 
This differentiation is accompanied by an augmented capacity to generate <START:ggp> growth factors <END> . 
We hypothesized that adherence itself might be an important trigger for a sequence of gene activation culminating in cells with increased <START:ana> mRNA <END> encoding profibrotic <START:ggp> growth factors <END> such as <START:ggp> platelet-derived growth factor B subunit <END> ( <START:ggp> PDGF [ B ] <END> ) and <START:ggp> transforming growth factor-beta <END> ( <START:ggp> TGF-beta <END> ) . 
After in vitro adherence , human monocytes had a biphasic increase in <START:ana> PDGF ( B ) mRNA <END> with peaks at 6 h and 13 d . 
No increase in <START:ana> TGF-beta mRNA <END> was observed . 
The 6-h increase in <START:ana> PDGF ( B ) mRNA <END> was adherence dependent , and in addition , was abrogated when the cytoskeletal integrity was compromised by cytochalasin D . 
The 6-h increase in <START:ana> PDGF ( B ) mRNA <END> was unaltered by adherence in the presence of the monocyte stimulus lipopolysaccharide . 
Adherence to either fibronectin or collagen-coated plastic had little consistent effect on <START:ana> PDGF ( B ) mRNA <END> accumulation . 
The increased <START:ana> PDGF ( B ) mRNA <END> observed in <START:ana> adherent monocytes <END> was accompanied by increases in <START:ana> mRNAs <END> of the <START:ggp> early growth response genes <END> <START:ggp> c-fos <END> ( maximal at 20 min ) , c-jun , and EGR2 ( maximal at 6-24 h ) . 
The increase in c-jun and EGR2 , but not <START:ggp> c-fos <END> , mRNA was also abrogated by cytochalasin D . 
These observations suggest that adherence results in increases of <START:ana> c-fos , c-jun , EGR2 , and PDGF ( B ) mRNA <END> . 
In addition , the increases in <START:ggp> c-jun <END> , <START:ggp> EGR2 <END> , and <START:ggp> PDGF ( B ) <END> may depend on cytoskeletal rearrangement . 
Modulation of these events at the time of adherence offers a mechanism by which differential priming of the cells may be accomplished . 
Single cell assay of a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> reveals a threshold in transcription activated by signals emanating from the <START:ggp> T-cell antigen receptor <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> through their <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> leads to the appearance of several <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , including <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , which are involved in regulating genes required for immunologic activation . 
To investigate the activity of a single <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> in <START:ana> individual viable cells <END> , we have applied an assay that uses the fluorescence-activated cell sorter to quantitate <START:ggp> beta-galactosidase <END> ( <START:ggp> beta-gal <END> ) . 
We have analyzed the distribution of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> transcriptional activity among <START:ana> T cells <END> undergoing activation by using a construct in which three tandem copies of the <START:ggp> NF-AT-binding site <END> directs transcription of the <START:ggp> lacZ gene <END> . 
Unexpectedly , stimulation of <START:ana> cloned stably transfected Jurkat T cells <END> leads to a bimodal pattern of beta-gal expression in which some cells express no <START:ggp> beta-gal <END> and others express high levels . 
This expression pattern can not be accounted for by cell-cycle position or heritable variation . 
Further results , in which <START:ggp> beta-gal <END> activity is correlated with <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> -binding activity , indicate that the concentration of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> must exceed a critical threshold before transcription initiates . 
This threshold likely reflects the <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> concentration-dependent assembly of <START:ggp> transcription complexes <END> at the <START:ggp> promoter <END> . 
Similar constructs controlled by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> or the entire <START:ggp> interleukin-2 enhancer <END> show bimodal expression patterns during induction , suggesting that thresholds set by the concentration of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> may be a common property of <START:ggp> inducible genes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) BMRF1 promoter <END> for <START:ggp> early antigen <END> ( <START:ggp> EA-D <END> ) is regulated by the <START:ggp> EBV transactivators <END> , <START:ggp> BRLF1 <END> and <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> , in a cell-specific manner . 
The <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus early antigen diffuse component <END> ( <START:ggp> EA-D <END> ) is essential for Epstein-Barr <START:ggp> virus DNA <END> polymerase activity , and its activity is suppressed during latent infection . 
We investigated the regulation of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> ( <START:ggp> BMRF1 <END> ) for this early gene by studying its responsiveness in vitro to two <START:ggp> immediate-early viral transactivators <END> , <START:ggp> BZLF1 <END> ( <START:ggp> Z <END> ) and <START:ggp> BRLF1 <END> ( <START:ggp> R <END> ) , focusing on the differences in response in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> and <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> . 
In <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> , <START:ggp> Z <END> or <START:ggp> R <END> alone produced only small increases in <START:ggp> EA-D promoter <END> activity , whereas both <START:ggp> transactivators <END> together produced a large stimulatory effect . 
In <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> , the <START:ggp> Z transactivator <END> alone produced maximal stimulation of the <START:ggp> EA-D promoter <END> ; the effect of <START:ggp> R <END> and <START:ggp> Z <END> together was no greater than that of <START:ggp> Z <END> alone . 
Deletional analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the <START:ggp> EA-D promoter <END> demonstrated that in <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> the potential <START:ggp> AP-1 binding site <END> plays an essential role in <START:ggp> Z <END> responsiveness , although sequences further upstream are also important . 
In <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> , only the <START:ggp> upstream sequences <END> are required for transactivation by the <START:ggp> Z/R <END> combination , and the <START:ggp> AP-1 site <END> is dispensable . 
These data suggest that <START:ggp> EA-D ( BMRF1 ) promoter <END> regulation by <START:ggp> Z <END> and <START:ggp> R <END> is cell type specific and appears to involve different mechanisms in each cell type . 
<START:ggp> Complementary DNA <END> encoding the <START:ggp> human T-cell FK506-binding protein <END> , a <START:ggp> peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase <END> distinct from <START:ggp> cyclophilin <END> . 
The recently discovered macrolide FK506 has been demonstrated to have potent immunosuppressive activity at concentrations 100-fold lower than cyclosporin A , a cyclic undecapeptide that is used to prevent rejection after transplantation of bone marrow and organs , such as kidney , heart , and liver . 
After the recent discovery that the <START:ggp> cyclosporin A-binding protein <END> <START:ggp> cyclophilin <END> is identical to <START:ggp> peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase <END> , a <START:ggp> cellular binding protein <END> for FK506 was found to be distinct from <START:ggp> cyclophilin <END> but to have the same enzymatic activity . 
In this study , we isolated a <START:ggp> cDNA <END> coding for FK506-binding protein ( <START:ggp> FKBP <END> ) from human peripheral blood <START:ana> T cells <END> by using mixed 20-mer oligonucleotide probes synthesized on the basis of the sequence , Glu-Asp-Gly-Lys-Lys-Phe-Asp , reported for <START:ggp> bovine FKBP <END> . 
The DNA isolated contained an open reading frame encoding 108 amino acid residues . 
The first 40 residues of the deduced amino acid sequence were identical to those of the reported amino-terminal sequence of bovine <START:ggp> FKBP <END> , indicating that the DNA sequence isolated represents the gene coding for <START:ggp> FKBP <END> . 
Computer-assisted analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicates that <START:ggp> FKBP <END> exhibits no internal homology and does not have significant sequence similarity to any other amino acid sequences of known proteins , including <START:ggp> cyclophilin <END> . 
This result suggests that two catalytically similar proteins , <START:ggp> cyclophilin <END> and <START:ggp> FKBP <END> , evolved independently . 
In Northern blot analysis , <START:ana> mRNA species <END> of approximately 1.8 kilobases that hybridized with <START:ggp> human FKBP cDNA <END> were detected in <START:ana> poly ( A ) + RNAs <END> from brain , lung , liver , and <START:ana> placental cells <END> and <START:ana> leukocytes <END> . 
Induction of <START:ana> Jurkat leukemic T cells <END> with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin did not affect the level of <START:ana> FKBP mRNA <END> . 
Southern blot analysis of <START:ggp> human genomic DNA <END> digested with different <START:ggp> restriction enzymes <END> suggests the existence of only a few copies of the DNA sequence encoding <START:ggp> FKBP <END> . 
This is in contrast to the result that as many as 20 copies of the <START:ggp> cyclophilin gene <END> and possible pseudogenes may be present in the <START:ggp> mammalian genome <END> . 
Involvement of a second <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific enhancer element <END> in the regulation of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene <END> expression . 
To determine whether <START:ggp> enhancer elements <END> in addition to the highly conserved <START:ggp> octamer ( OCTA ) -nucleotide motif <END> are important for lymphoid-specific expression of the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) gene <END> , we have investigated the effect of mutating the <START:ggp> binding site <END> for a <START:ggp> putative additional lymphoid-specific transcription factor <END> , designated <START:ggp> NF-microB <END> , in the <START:ggp> murine IgH enhancer <END> . 
We demonstrate that the <START:ggp> NF-microB-binding site <END> plays a critical role in the <START:ggp> IgH enhancer <END> , because mutation of the microB DNA motif decreased transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> IgH enhancer <END> in cells of the <START:ana> B-cell lineage <END> but not in <START:ana> nonlymphoid cells <END> . 
This effect was comparable to or even stronger than the effect of a mutation in the <START:ggp> OCTA site <END> . 
Moreover , combined mutation of both <START:ggp> microB <END> and <START:ggp> OCTA sites <END> further reduced enhancer activity in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
Interestingly , alteration of either the <START:ggp> microB <END> or <START:ggp> E3 site <END> in a <START:ggp> 70-base-pair fragment <END> of the <START:ggp> IgH enhancer <END> that lacks the binding site for OCTA abolished enhancer activity in <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> completely . 
Nevertheless , a multimer of the <START:ggp> microB motif <END> alone showed no enhancer activity . 
DNase footprinting analysis corroborated the functional data showing that a <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific protein <END> binds to the <START:ggp> microB DNA motif <END> . 
Our results suggest that the <START:ggp> microB element <END> is a new crucial element important for lymphoid-specific expression of the IgH gene but that interaction with another <START:ggp> enhancer element <END> is essential for its activity . 
Stimulation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 ( HIV-2 ) gene expression by the cytomegalovirus and <START:ggp> HIV-2 transactivator gene <END> . 
Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) often causes latent infection . 
Transactivation by some DNA viruses has been implicated in inducing HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis . 
The <START:ggp> transactivator ( IE-2 ) gene <END> of the human cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) can enhance HIV-2 as well as HIV-1 gene expression in vitro . 
This inducer can act in concert with the <START:ggp> HIV-2 tat gene <END> and T-cell activation in enhancing gene expression in <START:ana> human CD4+ lymphocytes <END> . 
While the HIV-2 and <START:ggp> HIV-1 tat genes <END> and <START:ggp> T-cell activators <END> apparently employ independent modes of action , the <START:ggp> CMV transactivator <END> in combination with the <START:ggp> HIV-2 tat <END> or <START:ggp> T-cell activators <END> may employ a gene activation pathway with some common and some distinct components . 
Both HIV-2 and <START:ggp> CMV transactivators <END> enhance HIV-2 gene expression by transcriptional activation involving transcript initiation as well as elongation , with <START:ggp> CMV transactivator <END> affecting elongation more than the initiation . 
A significant proportion of <START:ana> transcripts <END> appear to terminate prematurely in the absence of <START:ggp> transactivators <END> . 
Deletion mutation analysis of the <START:ggp> HIV-2 long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) suggests that the element that responds to CMV transactivation in <START:ana> human CD4+ lymphocytes <END> is either a diffuse one or located downstream of the <START:ggp> HIV-2 enhancer element <END> . 
Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of <START:ana> mononuclear infiltrates <END> in breast carcinomas -- correlation with tumour differentiation . 
<START:ana> Inflammatory infiltrates <END> were analysed in tissue sections of 76 breast carcinomas by counting the percentage of <START:ana> macrophages <END> , <START:ana> IgA+ and IgG+ plasma cells <END> , <START:ana> T cells <END> with their subpopulations , and <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> , and by measuring postcapillary venules ( PCVs , found in 12 cases ) within the infiltrates . 
These parameters were correlated with nuclear grade and biochemically determined hormone receptor status , known markers of tumour differentiation . 
A direct correlation was found between the extent of inflammation and nuclear grade ( P less than 0.0001 ) , and an inverse correlation between inflammation and <START:ggp> oestrogen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> OR <END> ) positivity ( P less than 0.05 ) as well as inflammation and <START:ggp> progesterone receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> PR <END> ) positivity ( P less than 0.05 ) . 
The percentage of the <START:ana> OKT8+ suppressor/cytotoxic T cells <END> increased when the inflammation expanded from scanty to moderate ( P less than 0.02 ) . 
The diameter of the PCVs also increased with increasing inflammatory infiltrate ( P less than 0.02 ) . 
In addition , a direct correlation exists between the diameter of the PCVs and both the percentage of the <START:ana> OKT8+ T cells <END> ( P less than 0.04 ) and the Leu-7+ <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> ( P less than 0.03 ) . 
Reactivity of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> to a <START:ggp> progesterone receptor-specific monoclonal antibody <END> . 
In this study we present evidence for reactivity of <START:ana> pregnancy lymphocytes <END> , but not <START:ana> nonpregnancy lymphocytes <END> , with the <START:ggp> progesterone receptor-specific monoclonal antibody <END> <START:ggp> mPRI <END> . 
Using an <START:ggp> avidin <END> <START:ggp> -biotin peroxidase <END> detection system , we found a nuclear staining in 14.6 +/- 3.7 % ( mean +/- SEM , N = 27 ) of <START:ana> pregnancy lymphocytes <END> , while only 0.47 +/- 0.33 % ( mean +/- SEM , N = 15 ) of <START:ana> nonpregnancy lymphocytes <END> reacted with the antibody . 
To characterize the receptor-bearing subset , <START:ana> CD8+ and CD4+ cells <END> were depleted by complement-dependent lysis . 
Depletion of <START:ana> CD8+ cells <END> was accompanied by 62 +/- 18 % loss of <START:ana> progesterone receptor-bearing cells <END> , while depletion of <START:ana> CD4+ cells <END> resulted in a twofold increase in the number of positively staining <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
In <START:ana> nonpregnancy lymphocytes <END> a 3-day <START:ggp> PHA <END> treatment , as well as allogeneic stimulation , resulted in a significant increase in the number of <START:ana> receptor-containing cells <END> . 
These results suggest that pregnancy , but not nonpregnancy , <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> contain <START:ggp> progesterone binding structures <END> , and that these are inducible by mitogenic or alloantigenic stimuli . 
Activation of <START:ana> human CD4 T lymphocytes <END> . 
Interaction of <START:ggp> fibronectin <END> with <START:ggp> VLA-5 receptor <END> on <START:ana> CD4 cells <END> induces the <START:ggp> AP-1 transcription factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> Fibronectin <END> synergized with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 antibody <END> to promote <START:ggp> CD4 <END> cell proliferation in a serum-free culture system whereas no proliferation was observed when <START:ana> CD4 cells <END> were cultured with <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> alone or <START:ggp> fibronectin <END> alone . 
In addition , <START:ggp> anti-CD29 <END> ( <START:ggp> integrin beta 1 <END> ) as well as <START:ggp> anti-VLA-5 <END> ( <START:ggp> human fibronectin receptor <END> ) antibodies blocked this <START:ana> CD4 cell <END> activation in this system . 
Although <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> alone or <START:ggp> fibronectin <END> alone can not induce <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> message by <START:ana> CD4 cells <END> , the combination of <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> plus <START:ggp> fibronectin <END> induced <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> message by <START:ana> CD4 cells <END> . 
In an analysis of the molecular mechanism by which <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> message was generated , we showed that a <START:ggp> fibronectin <END> -VLA-5 <START:ggp> fibronectin receptor <END> interaction may contribute an independent signal distinct from the <START:ggp> CD3 <END> pathway of activation by the induction of an <START:ggp> AP-1 transcriptional factor <END> . 
Thus the <START:ggp> VLA-5 fibronectin receptor <END> on <START:ana> CD4 cells <END> can play a complementary role in <START:ggp> CD3 <END> - <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated signal transduction through its interaction with <START:ggp> fibronectin <END> . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> on <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> in Alzheimer 's disease . 
Several lines of evidence suggest disturbances of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) system in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . 
In an exploration of the potential role of the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) in AD , GR density and affinity were assessed on <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> of 12 AD patients and 12 healthy controls . 
GR binding characteristics did not differ between patients and controls or between patients subdivided according to diagnosis or associated clinical features . 
These data suggest that the abnormalities of the HPA system in AD are not related to a <START:ggp> GR <END> deficiency . 
Oncogene amplification correlates with dense lymphocyte infiltration in human breast cancers : a role for <START:ggp> hematopoietic growth factor <END> release by <START:ana> tumor cells <END> ? 
One hundred six primary breast cancer samples were analysed for c-erbB2 , int-2 , and c-myc gene amplification . 
Surgically confirmed nodal involvement was observed in 42 % . 
Level of gene amplification was studied by Southern and/or slot blot techniques . 
Amplified <START:ggp> c-erbB2 gene sequences <END> were present in 21.5 % of all samples . 
<START:ggp> Int-2 <END> was amplified in 13.1 % and <START:ggp> c-myc <END> was amplified in 10.3 % . 
In a non-parametric test ( Kruskal-Wallis ) a strong negative association was found between high levels of <START:ggp> c-erbB2 <END> amplification and absence of estrogen receptor ( ER ) ( P = .0009 ) or <START:ggp> progesterone receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> PR <END> ) ( P = .011 ) expression . 
No correlations were found between all or high levels of amplification of each oncogene separately or combined with T , N , grade , multifocality of tumor , or associated carcinoma in situ . 
There was a trend approaching statistical significance for patients with <START:ggp> c-erbB2 <END> amplifications to have positive lymph nodes at surgery ( P = 0.09 ) . 
A somewhat surprising finding however was a very strong association between <START:ggp> oncogene <END> amplification and dense lymphocyte infiltration of the tumor ( P = .05 ) . This correlation is even stronger when only high levels of amplification are considered , either for each oncogene separately ( P = .0048 ) or in combination ( P = .0007 ) . 
We propose that malignant cell <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production may help explain this observation . 
Suppression of signals required for activation of <START:ggp> transcription factor NF-kappa B <END> in cells constitutively expressing the <START:ggp> HTLV-I Tax protein <END> . 
Transient short-term expression of the <START:ggp> Tax protein <END> of human T-cell leukemia virus type-I ( HTLV-I ) leads to activation of the pleiotropic <START:ggp> transcription factor NF-kappa B <END> . 
Consistent with findings obtained with transient expression assays , we observed marked accumulation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor NF-kappa B <END> in the nucleus of <START:ana> Namalwa B lymphoid cells <END> , which constitutively express <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity was not detected in the nucleus following long-term expression of <START:ggp> Tax <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T lymphocytes <END> . 
The ability of both mitogens and <START:ggp> cytokines <END> to activate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> was also blocked in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> constitutively expressing <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
However , the activation of other <START:ggp> mitogen-inducible transcription factors <END> , such as <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> , was unaffected . 
Thus , depending on the cellular environment , the short- and long-term effects of <START:ggp> Tax <END> expression can be quite different . 
Consequently , one function of <START:ggp> Tax <END> in cells infected with HTLV-I might involve cell-type-specific suppression , as opposed to activation , of distinct signal pathways . 
The cells lines described here should be useful for the delineation of signaling pathways utilized in the selective regulation of gene expression . 
<START:ggp> Interferon-gamma <END> and the sexual dimorphism of autoimmunity . 
The sexual difference in the incidence of autoimmune diseases has remained an enigma for many years . 
In the examination of the induction of autoimmunity in transgenic mice , evidence has been obtained further implicating the <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> in the etiology of autoimmunity . 
Sex steroid regulation of the production of this molecule , as well as other <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , may help explain the gender-specific differences in the immune system , including autoimmunity . 
Cloning of a <START:ggp> transcriptionally active human TATA binding factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factor IID <END> ( <START:ggp> TFIID <END> ) binds to the <START:ggp> TATA box promoter element <END> and regulates the expression of most <START:ggp> eukaryotic genes <END> transcribed by <START:ggp> RNA polymerase II <END> . 
<START:ggp> Complementary DNA <END> ( <START:ggp> cDNA <END> ) encoding a <START:ggp> human TFIID protein <END> has been cloned . 
The <START:ggp> human TFIID polypeptide <END> has 339 amino acids and a molecular size of 37 , 745 daltons . 
The <START:ggp> carboxyl-terminal 181 amino acids <END> of the <START:ggp> human TFIID protein <END> shares 80 % identity with the <START:ggp> TFIID <END> protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae . 
The <START:ggp> amino terminus <END> contains an unusual repeat of 38 consecutive glutamine residues and an <START:ggp> X-Thr-Pro repeat <END> . 
Expression of DNA in reticulocyte lysates or in Escherichia coli yielded a protein that was competent for both DNA binding and transcription activation . 
A novel <START:ggp> T-cell trans-activator <END> that recognizes a <START:ggp> phorbol ester-inducible element <END> of the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 promoter <END> . 
The <START:ggp> interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene promoter <END> is recognized by several <START:ggp> cell-type-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators <END> that integrate information transmitted by various signaling systems leading to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production and <START:ana> T-cell <END> activation . 
Using a combination of transfection , protein-DNA binding , and in vitro transcription methods , we have discovered the <START:ggp> novel T-cell-specific transcriptional activator <END> <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> ( for <START:ggp> T-Cell Factor-1 <END> ) , which recognizes a <START:ggp> T-cell-specific response element <END> ( <START:ggp> TCE <END> ) located within the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> . 
Although the <START:ggp> TCE <END> is similar in sequence to a <START:ggp> consensus NF kappa B site <END> , several criteria indicate that <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> is distinct from <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> . 
However , like <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> activity is induced by phorbol esters and other T-cell activators . 
Risk factors for breast recurrence in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with ductal cancers treated by conservation therapy . 
Risk factors for local failure were evaluated for 496 clinical Stage I-II patients with infiltrating ductal carcinomas ( median follow-up , 71 months ) treated by conservative surgery and radiotherapy . 
Monofactorial analysis identified the following factors to be correlated with increased risk : moderate/marked mononuclear cell reaction ( MCR ) , high histologic grade ( G ) , extensive intraductal component ( EIC ) , tumor necrosis , macroscopic multiplicity , <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> negativity , anatomic tumor size , age younger than 40 years , and vascular invasion . 
Only MCR , G , and EIC proved significant in Cox multivariate analysis . 
These risk factors were highly age dependent , with EIC markedly more prevalent in women younger than 50 , MCR and G in women younger than 40 . 
Separate Cox analysis for premenopausal patients showed that MCR/EIC determined risk independent of resection margins : tumors with MCR had a 28 % , and with EIC a 22 % probability of recurring locally by 5 years . 
Premenopausal patients with neither risk factor had a very low failure rate ( 2.6 % at 5 years ) , regardless of age . 
For postmenopausal patients risk of breast recurrence was determined both by adequacy of resection margins and grade , with a high local failure rate for patients having G3 tumors with positive or indeterminate margins ( 31 % at 5 years ) . 
The authors conclude that the microscopic examination is the only useful tool for assessing the risk of local failure , which is quite low for the majority of patients treated with breast conservation . 
High-risk patients can be recognized morphologically . 
The age dependence of morphologic risk factors appears to explain the high local failure rate seen in patients younger than 40 . 
<START:ggp> Tax <END> -independent binding of multiple <START:ggp> cellular factors <END> to <START:ggp> Tax-response element DNA <END> of HTLV-I . 
The <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) promoter <END> contains three copies of imperfect repeats of a 21-base pair sequence designated here as <START:ggp> TRE <END> ( <START:ggp> Tax-response element <END> ) that is responsive to the <START:ggp> virally encoded transactivator protein <END> <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
We have identified and separated four <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> from C81-66-45 cells , an <START:ana> HTLV-I immortalized Tax-expressing human T-lymphocyte line <END> ( Salahuddin et al. , 1983 ) , that interact with the <START:ggp> TRE-DNA <END> , none of which are identical with the <START:ggp> Tax-protein <END> . 
The proteins identified have molecular weights of about 32 , 36 to 42 , 50 and 110 kD . 
Four different methods were used to identify the proteins . 
First , from different cell lines three or all four of the <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> were specifically cross-linked by UV irradiation to the radioactively labeled <START:ggp> TRE-DNA fragment <END> . 
Second , <START:ggp> TRE-DNA binding proteins <END> sedimented through a glycerol density gradient at rates corresponding to proteins of native molecular weights of 35 to 50 kD and 110 kD . 
Third , only the <START:ggp> 50 kD protein <END> was retained on a biotinylated DNA-streptavidin matrix when the DNA fragment contained the <START:ggp> TRE-DNA <END> . 
Fourth , extensive purification by several cycles of <START:ggp> TRE <END> -DNA affinity chromatography resulted in the <START:ggp> 32 , 36 to 42 and 110 kD proteins <END> and to less extent the <START:ggp> 50 kD factor <END> . 
Two abundant proteins of 75 and 80 kD were competed out by poly [ d ( I-C ) ] in all reactions . 
The <START:ggp> cAMP-response element <END> <START:ggp> CRE <END> , TGACGTCA , present in the <START:ggp> 21 base-pair sequence <END> , appears to be essential for specific protein- <START:ggp> TRE <END> -DNA interactions because mutation of the two G 's destroys this complex . 
This result suggests that the <START:ggp> cAMP response element binding protein <END> , <START:ggp> CREB <END> , is involved in the <START:ggp> protein-TRE-DNA complex <END> and in mediating the <START:ggp> Tax <END> response . 
Two distinct <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that bind the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin enhancer <END> <START:ggp> microE5/kappa 2 motif <END> . 
Activity of the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain gene enhancers <END> depends on a complex interplay of <START:ggp> ubiquitous and developmentally regulated proteins <END> . 
Two <START:ggp> complementary DNAs <END> were isolated that encode proteins , denoted <START:ggp> ITF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> ITF-2 <END> , that are expressed in a variety of cell types and bind the <START:ggp> microE5/kappa 2 motif <END> found in both <START:ggp> heavy and kappa light chain enhancers <END> . 
The <START:ggp> complementary DNAs <END> are the products of distinct genes , yet both <START:ggp> ITF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> ITF-2 <END> are structurally and functionally similar . 
The two proteins interact with one another through their putative <START:ggp> helix-loop-helix motifs <END> and each possesses a distinct domain that dictates transcription activation . 
Elevated <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> concentrations before and after glucocorticoid therapy in <START:ana> peripheral mononuclear leukocytes <END> of patients with atopic dermatitis . 
The number and affinity of glucocorticoid binding sites in <START:ana> peripheral mononuclear leukocytes <END> of patients with atopic dermatitis ( AD ) and healthy controls were determined under baseline conditions and after a defined oral glucocorticoid treatment . 
Patients with AD ( n = 15 ) exhibited significantly more <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GR <END> ) per cell than the control group ( n = 22 ) , while the <START:ggp> GR <END> affinity did not differ . 
Methylprednisolone treatment resulted in a significant reduction of the <START:ggp> GR <END> sites per cell in the steroid-treated control group ( n = 10 ) in contrast to the patients . 
The dissociation constant was not affected by methylprednisolone treatment in either group . 
In view of the therapeutic efficiency of glucocorticoids in AD and findings of abnormal cAMP and cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity , the elevated <START:ggp> GR <END> concentrations in AD lend support to the hypothesis of a compensatory <START:ggp> GR <END> upregulation due to an insufficient action of endogenous cortisol or to altered cAMP-induced <START:ggp> GR <END> expression . 
The actions of cyclosporin A and FK506 suggest a novel step in the activation of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Cyclosporin A and FK506 are immunosuppressive compounds that have similar inhibitory effects on the expression of several <START:ggp> lymphokines <END> produced by <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Despite their similar effects the drugs bind to two different <START:ggp> cytosolic protein <END> , <START:ggp> cyclophilin <END> and <START:ggp> FKBP <END> respectively , which raises the possibility that they have different modes of action . 
Using constructs in which <START:ana> mRNA <END> production controlled by a specific <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> could be readily measured we found that both cyclosporin A and FK506 completely inhibited transcription activated by <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> , <START:ggp> NFIL2 A <END> , <START:ggp> NFIL2 B <END> and partially inhibited transcription activated by <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> . 
Cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibited only transcriptional activation that was dependent on Ca2+ mobilization . 
However , cyclosporin A and FK506 did not inhibit Ca2+ mobilization dependent expression of <START:ana> c-fos mRNA <END> indicating that only a subset of signalling pathways regulated by Ca2+ is sensitive to these drugs . 
Furthermore , we did not observe any qualitative differences between the effect of cyclosporin A and FK506 on six different <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> which suggests that these drugs may interfere with the activity of a novel Ca2+ dependent step that regulates several <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
The internal methionine codons of <START:ggp> human T-cell leukemia virus type II rex gene <END> are not required for <START:ggp> p24rex <END> production or virus replication and transformation . 
Human T-cell leukemia virus types I ( HTLV-I ) and II ( HTLV-II ) have two <START:ggp> nonstructural trans-acting regulatory genes <END> , <START:ggp> tax <END> and <START:ggp> rex <END> , located in the <START:ggp> 3 ' region <END> of the <START:ggp> viral genome <END> . 
The <START:ggp> tax gene product <END> ( <START:ggp> HTLV-I p40tax <END> and <START:ggp> HTLV-II p37tax <END> ) is the transcriptional activator of the <START:ggp> viral long terminal repeat <END> . 
The <START:ggp> rex gene <END> encodes two protein products , <START:ggp> p27rex/p21rex <END> and <START:ggp> p26rex/p24rex <END> in HTLV-I and HTLV-II , respectively . 
<START:ggp> Rex <END> acts posttranscriptionally to facilitate accumulation of full-length <START:ggp> gag/pol <END> and singly spliced <START:ana> env mRNA <END> in the cytoplasm of <START:ana> HTLV-infected cells <END> . 
Previous studies showed that the first ATG of the <START:ggp> rex gene <END> is critical for <START:ggp> Rex <END> production and function . 
The importance of the internal ATGs to <START:ggp> Rex <END> function is not known . 
However , in vitro mutagenesis of the HTLV-I <START:ggp> rex gene <END> has provided indirect evidence which suggests that <START:ggp> p21rex <END> , and by analogy HTLV-II <START:ggp> p24rex <END> , results from initiation at an internal AUG of the <START:ana> tax/rex mRNA <END> . 
By using an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-II , we investigated the importance of the internal ATGs of the <START:ggp> rex gene <END> on <START:ggp> Rex <END> protein production and function . 
Our results indicate that <START:ggp> p24rex <END> of HTLV-II is not initiated at an internal AUG and that the internal methionine codons are not crucial to the function of the <START:ggp> rex gene <END> and , ultimately , the transforming properties of the virus . 
<START:ana> Astrocytes <END> and <START:ana> glioblastoma cells <END> express novel <START:ggp> octamer-DNA binding proteins <END> distinct from the <START:ggp> ubiquitous Oct-1 and B cell type Oct-2 proteins <END> . 
The <START:ggp> 'octamer ' sequence <END> , ATGCAAAT or its complement ATTTGCAT , is a key element for the transcriptional regulation of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin genes <END> in <START:ana> B-lymphocytes <END> as well as a number of <START:ggp> housekeeping genes <END> in all cell types . 
In <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> , the <START:ggp> octamer-binding protein <END> <START:ggp> Oct-2A <END> and variants thereof are thought to contribute to the <START:ggp> B-cell specific gene <END> expression , while the ubiquitous protein Oct-1 seems to control general <START:ggp> octamer site <END> -dependent transcription . 
Various other genes , for example <START:ggp> interleukin-1 and MHC class II genes <END> , contain an <START:ggp> octamer sequence <END> in the <START:ggp> promoter <END> and are expressed in cells of both the immune and nervous systems . 
This prompted us to analyze the <START:ggp> octamer-binding proteins <END> in the latter cells . 
Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay , at least six novel <START:ggp> octamer binding proteins <END> were detected in nuclear extracts of <START:ana> cultured mouse astrocytes <END> . 
These proteins are differentially expressed in <START:ana> human glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines <END> . 
The <START:ggp> nervous system-derived ( N-Oct ) proteins <END> bound to the <START:ggp> octamer DNA sequence <END> in a manner which is indistinguishable from the <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2A proteins <END> . 
The relationship of the <START:ggp> N-Oct proteins <END> to <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2A <END> was analyzed by proteolytic clipping bandshift assays and by their reactivity towards antisera raised against recombinant <START:ggp> Oct-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Oct-2A <END> proteins . 
On the basis of these assays , all <START:ggp> N-Oct-factors <END> were found to be distinct from the <START:ggp> ubiquitous Oct-1 <END> and the <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific Oct-2A <END> proteins . 
In <START:ana> melanoma cells <END> that contain the <START:ggp> N-Oct-3 factor <END> , a transfected lymphocyte-specific promoter was neither activated nor was it repressed upon contransfection with an <START:ggp> Oct-2A expression vector <END> . 
We therefore speculate that <START:ggp> N-Oct-3 <END> and other <START:ggp> N-Oct factors <END> have a specific role in gene expression in cells of the nervous system . 
Detection in <START:ana> non-erythroid cells <END> of a factor with the binding characteristics of the <START:ggp> erythroid cell transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> EF1 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> erythroid transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> erythroid factor-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> EF1 <END> ) plays a critical role in the transcription of <START:ggp> erythroid-specific genes <END> . 
Here we report the presence of a factor with the mobility and sequence-specific DNA-binding characteristics of <START:ggp> EF1 <END> at low abundance in a wide variety of <START:ana> non-erythroid cell types <END> . 
This is the first report of an <START:ggp> EF1 <END> -like activity in <START:ana> non-erythroid cells <END> and indicates that this factor may play a role in the regulation of <START:ggp> genes <END> expressed in such cells . 
Protein kinase inhibitor H-7 blocks accumulation of <START:ana> unspliced mRNA <END> of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) . 
<START:ggp> Rex <END> , the <START:ggp> post-transcriptional regulator <END> of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) , is known to induce accumulation of the <START:ana> unspliced viral gag-pol mRNA <END> . 
<START:ggp> Rex <END> is a <START:ggp> phosphoprotein <END> found in the cell nucleolus , whose function may be regulated by its localization and phosphorylation . 
We have examined the role of phosphorylation on <START:ggp> Rex <END> function by using a protein kinase inhibitor , H-7 [ 1- ( 5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl ) -2-methylpiperazine ] . 
Treatment of an <START:ana> HTLV-I infected human T-cell line <END> with H-7 blocked specifically accumulation of the <START:ana> unspliced gag-pol mRNA <END> , resulting in the decreased <START:ggp> Gag protein <END> synthesis that corresponds with the decreased in vivo phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Rex <END> . 
In contrast , other viral and cellular products have not been influenced by the level of H-7 used . 
Therefore , the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Rex <END> is required for the viral RNA partition of HTLV-I . 
Increased glucocorticoid responsiveness of <START:ana> CD4+ T-cell clonal lines <END> grown in serum-free media . 
<START:ana> CEM-C7 <END> , a <START:ana> human leukemic CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell line <END> and three of its subclones , <START:ana> CEM-4R4 <END> , <START:ana> CEM-3R43 <END> , and <START:ana> ICR-27 <END> , previously cultured in a medium supplemented with 5 to 10 % fetal bovine serum , have been adapted to serum-free media . 
The best medium of those tested was RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 micrograms/ml each <START:ggp> transferrin <END> and <START:ggp> insulin <END> + 5 ng/ml sodium selenite +/- 0.1 % <START:ggp> bovine serum albumin <END> . 
While growing either with or without albumin , the several <START:ana> clonal lines <END> of <START:ana> CEM <END> cells displayed growth similar to serum-supplemented cultures . 
Cell proliferation of <START:ana> CEM-C7 <END> cells cultured in both serum-free media has been sustained for 3 mo . 
with culture doubling times of about 25 h for both <START:ana> serum-supplemented and serum-free cultures <END> ( viability greater than or equal to 90 % ) . 
Cell morphology remained essentially the same in serum-free or serum containing media . 
The expression of <START:ggp> CD4 <END> , a marker for <START:ana> T-derived lymphoid cells <END> , was not significantly different in serum-free medium . 
When grown in serum-free medium , <START:ana> CEM-C7 <END> cells exhibited increased steroid responsiveness as evidenced by increased <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> binding sites , increased induction of <START:ggp> glutamine synthetase <END> , and cell lysis at lower concentrations of steroid . 
Receptor mutant subclones of <START:ana> CEM-C7 <END> , which are proven to be completely unresponsive to micromolar concentrations of dexamethasone when grown in serum-supplemented medium , become partially sensitive to the hormone after growth in defined medium . 
The increased sensitivity of <START:ana> CEM-C7 cells <END> and its subclones to dexamethasone in serum-free medium returned to previous levels when these cells were recultured in serum-containing medium . 
Our results suggest that substances in serum influence steroid effects on these cells and that the molecular details of glucocorticoid hormone action may be pursued more precisely in a clearly defined culture medium . 
[ <START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptors <END> on <START:ana> human peripheral mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leucocytes <END> : changes in patients with yang-deficiency ] 
It was found that , in former works , the <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> GCR <END> ) on <START:ana> peripheral mixed leucocytes <END> in patients with Yang-deficiency were decreased . 
In this work , the <START:ana> mixed leucocytes <END> were further separated into <START:ana> mononuclear ( MNL ) and polymorphonuclear ( PML ) leucocytes <END> , and <START:ggp> GCR <END> were determined in each part of <START:ana> leucocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> GCR <END> on <START:ana> MNL <END> and <START:ana> PML <END> in 6 Yang deficient patients were 3473 +/- 413 and 4433 +/- 651 sites/cell respectively , statistically significant from the normal control group ( 4462 +/- 962 and 5622 +/- 782 sites/cell respectively , P less than 0.05 ) . 
<START:ggp> GCR <END> on <START:ana> MNL <END> , <START:ana> PML <END> and <START:ana> mixed leucocytes <END> in 5 patients were determined simultaneously , and all lowered from the control group . 
The results were 3369 +/- 370 , 4986 +/- 419 and 4524 +/- 852 sites/cell respectively , with the lowest <START:ggp> GCR <END> on <START:ana> MNL <END> and highest on <START:ana> PML <END> . 
The <START:ggp> ubiquitous octamer-binding protein <END> ( s ) is sufficient for transcription of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin genes <END> . 
All <START:ggp> immunoglobulin genes <END> contain a conserved <START:ggp> octanucleotide promoter element <END> , ATGCAAAT , which has been shown to be required for their normal B-cell-specific transcription . 
Proteins that bind this octamer have been purified , and <START:ggp> cDNAs <END> encoding <START:ggp> octamer-binding proteins <END> have been cloned . 
Some of these proteins ( referred to as <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> ) are lymphoid specific , whereas at least one other , and possibly more ( referred to as <START:ggp> OTF-1 <END> ) , is found ubiquitously in all cell types . 
The exact role of these different proteins in directing the tissue-specific expression of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin genes <END> is unclear . 
We have identified two <START:ana> human pre-B-cell lines <END> that contain extremely low levels of <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> yet still express high levels of <START:ana> steady-state immunoglobulin heavy-chain mRNA <END> in vivo and efficiently transcribe an <START:ggp> immunoglobulin gene <END> in vitro . 
Addition of a highly enriched preparation of <START:ggp> OTF-1 <END> made from one of these <START:ana> pre-B cells <END> or from <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> specifically stimulated in vitro transcription of an <START:ggp> immunoglobulin gene <END> . 
Furthermore , OFT-1 appeared to have approximately the same transactivation ability as <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> when normalized for binding activity . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> OTF-1 <END> , without <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> , is sufficient for transcription of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin genes <END> and that <START:ggp> OTF-2 <END> alone is not responsible for the B-cell-specific regulation of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin gene <END> expression . 
Effects of aldosterone on intralymphocytic sodium and potassium in patients with essential hypertension . 
In vitro binding of aldosterone to <START:ggp> mineralocorticoid receptors <END> on <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> ( <START:ana> HML <END> ) and its effects on the intracellular sodium and potassium concentrations of <START:ana> HML <END> have already been described . 
In the present paper this easily accessible human cell model was investigated in 13 patients with essential hypertension . 
In only four patients sodium in <START:ana> HML <END> without incubation was elevated compared with the range for normal persons . 
A decrease of intracellular sodium or potassium occurred during incubation without aldosterone ( P less than 0.02 ) . 
The addition of 1.4 nM aldosterone did not prevent this loss of electrolytes as observed in normal persons . 
<START:ggp> Plasma renin <END> activity and aldosterone were not correlated with the electrolyte response and were within the normal limits . 
The number of <START:ggp> mineralocorticoid receptors <END> /cell were within or close to the normal range ( n = 9 ) . 
The independence of intracellular electrolytes from aldosterone despite a normal number of <START:ggp> mineralocorticoid receptors <END> may reflect an impairment of the mineralocorticoid effector mechanism in the <START:ana> HML <END> of patients with essential hypertension . 
[ Differential diagnostic value of receptors of 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( calcitriol ) determination in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> of children with rickets and rickets-like diseases ] 
The authors provide the results of studying 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( calcitriol ) in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> of children with rickets and rickets-like diseases . 
It is proposed that the character of their expression under the influence of vitamin D may be used with differential diagnostic purposes in view . 
Regulation of gene expression with double-stranded phosphorothioate oligonucleotides . 
Alteration of gene transcription by inhibition of specific <START:ggp> transcriptional regulatory proteins <END> is necessary for determining how these factors participate in cellular differentiation . 
The functions of these proteins can be antagonized by several methods , each with specific limitations . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins <END> was achieved with double-stranded ( ds ) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained <START:ggp> octamer or kappa B consensus sequences <END> . 
The phosphorothioate oligonucleotides specifically bound either <START:ggp> octamer transcription factor <END> or <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> . 
The modified oligonucleotides accumulated in cells more effectively than standard ds oligonucleotides and modulated gene expression in a specific manner . 
Octamer-dependent activation of a <START:ggp> reporter plasmid <END> or <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -dependent activation of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) enhancer <END> was inhibited when the appropriate phosphorothioate oligonucleotide was added to a <START:ana> transiently transfected B cell line <END> . 
Addition of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained the <START:ggp> octamer consensus <END> to <START:ana> Jurkat T leukemia cells <END> inhibited <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) secretion to a degree similar to that observed with a <START:ggp> mutated octamer site <END> in the <START:ggp> IL-2 enhancer <END> . 
The ds phosphorothioate oligonucleotides probably compete for binding of specific transcription factors and may provide anti-viral , immunosuppressive , or other therapeutic effects . 
[ Effect of the regimen of kidney-tonifying and qi-invigorating on aging changes of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ] 
The plasma cortisol concentration and the sites of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> GCR <END> ) in the <START:ana> peripheral lymphocytes <END> were measured in 32 healthy aged persons and 13 young adults . 
In animal experiment , <START:ggp> GCR <END> of <START:ana> spleen lymphocytic cell <END> was also measured in 18 aged rats and 9 young rats . 
The results showed that <START:ggp> GCR <END> was significantly lower in the aged persons or rats than that in the young while the plasma cortisol level did n't change with aging . 
So we think that <START:ggp> GCR <END> is more sensitive than the plasma cortisol level to reflect the aging change of the adrenal cortex function . 
After the treatment with the regimen of Kidney-tonifying and Qi-invigorating , the <START:ggp> GCR <END> of the aged persons and rats was enhanced , and in this way , the function of the aged adrenal cortex was improved . 
Interferon affects <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> in cells of clinically sensitive chronic myelogenous leukemia patients . 
Cytoplasmic protein extracts from <START:ana> chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) cells <END> contained an activity that altered the electrophoretic mobility of complexes formed between <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> and the transcriptional enhancers of interferon ( IFN ) -inducible genes . 
Exposure of <START:ana> CML cells <END> to <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> diminished the effect of the <START:ggp> CML cytoplasmic proteins <END> on these <START:ggp> nuclear protein-DNA complexes <END> . 
The presence of clinical responsiveness to <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> correlated with the sensitivity to the <START:ggp> IFN <END> -induced change in the electrophoretic mobility of <START:ggp> nuclear protein-DNA complexes <END> . 
These data suggest that the action of <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> in CML may be linked to a pathway that can result in posttranslational modification of <START:ggp> nuclear proteins <END> . 
<START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 <END> transactivates <START:ggp> latent membrane protein <END> <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> . 
Several lines of evidence are compatible with the hypothesis that <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) nuclear antigen 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> ) or <START:ggp> leader protein <END> ( <START:ggp> EBNA-LP <END> ) affects expression of the <START:ggp> EBV latent infection membrane protein <END> <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> . 
We now demonstrate the following . 
( i ) Acute transfection and expression of <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> under control of <START:ggp> simian virus 40 or Moloney murine leukemia virus promoters <END> resulted in increased <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> expression in <START:ana> P3HR-1-infected Burkitt 's lymphoma cells <END> and the <START:ana> P3HR-1 <END> or <START:ana> Daudi cell line <END> . 
( ii ) Transfection and expression of <START:ggp> EBNA-LP <END> alone had no effect on <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> expression and did not act synergistically with <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> to affect <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> expression . 
( iii ) <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> expression in <START:ana> Daudi <END> and <START:ana> P3HR-1-infected cells <END> was controlled at the <START:ana> mRNA <END> level , and <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> expression in <START:ana> Daudi cells <END> increased <START:ana> LMP1 mRNA <END> . 
( iv ) No other <START:ggp> EBV genes <END> were required for <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> transactivation of <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> since cotransfection of <START:ggp> recombinant EBNA-2 expression vectors <END> and genomic <START:ggp> LMP1 DNA fragments <END> enhanced <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> expression in the <START:ana> EBV-negative B-lymphoma cell lines <END> <START:ana> BJAB <END> , <START:ana> Louckes <END> , and <START:ana> BL30 <END> . 
( v ) An <START:ggp> EBNA-2-responsive element <END> was found within the <START:ggp> -512 to +40 LMP1 DNA <END> since this DNA linked to a <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene <END> was transactivated by cotransfection with an <START:ggp> EBNA-2 expression vector <END> . 
( vi ) The EBV type 2 <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> transactivated <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> as well as the <START:ggp> EBV type 1 EBNA-2 <END> . 
( vii ) Two deletions within the <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> gene which rendered EBV transformation incompetent did not transactivate <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> , whereas a <START:ggp> transformation-competent EBNA-2 deletion mutant <END> did transactivate <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> LMP1 <END> is a potent effector of B-lymphocyte activation and can act synergistically with <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> to induce cellular CD23 gene expression . 
Thus , <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> transactivation of <START:ggp> LMP1 <END> amplifies the biological impact of <START:ggp> EBNA-2 <END> and underscores its central role in EBV-induced growth transformation . 
The expression of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> , <START:ggp> c-jun <END> , and <START:ggp> c-myc genes <END> is regulated by heat shock in <START:ana> human lymphoid cells <END> . 
The effect of heat shock on the expression of the <START:ggp> nuclear protooncogenes <END> <START:ggp> c-fos <END> , <START:ggp> c-jun <END> , and <START:ggp> c-myc <END> was studied in <START:ana> human lymphoid cells <END> . 
Heat shock caused an increase in c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels and a decrease in <START:ana> c-myc mRNA <END> levels in <START:ana> pre-B ( Hyon ) and T ( DND-41 ) cell lines <END> as well as in freshly isolated normal human thymocytes . 
The changes in the mRNA levels of these <START:ggp> protooncogenes <END> in <START:ana> Hyon cells <END> were most pronounced at 42 and 43 degrees C ; kinetic analysis demonstrated that the changes could be detected within 30 min of heat shock . 
Altered transcription of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and <START:ggp> c-myc genes <END> was the primary effect of heat shock . 
Secondarily , heat shock of <START:ana> Hyon cells <END> stabilized the <START:ana> c-myc mRNA <END> level by increasing its half-life from 24 to 45 min . 
The overall effect of heat shock on <START:ana> c-myc mRNA <END> level , however , was a marked inhibition of its transcription . 
These results demonstrate that the transcription of <START:ggp> nuclear protooncogenes <END> is regulated by heat shock indicating a role for <START:ggp> nuclear protooncogenes <END> in the stress response of <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> . 
Mapping of <START:ggp> B-cell epitopes <END> of the <START:ggp> human hepatitis B virus X protein <END> . 
The immune response to the <START:ggp> X protein <END> of human hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) was studied by epitope mapping by using a set of <START:ggp> MS2-HBx fusion proteins <END> and synthetic peptides . 
Antibodies in sera of patients with acute and chronic HBV infection showed a multispecific immune response . 
Each serum contained <START:ggp> antibodies <END> to a different set of <START:ggp> epitopes <END> , which taken together cover most of the <START:ggp> HBx sequence <END> . 
Some of the epitopes were detectable only by immunoblotting with <START:ggp> fusion proteins <END> ; others were detectable only by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) with synthetic peptides . 
The <START:ggp> carboxy-terminal half <END> of the <START:ggp> HBx protein <END> was preferentially recognized by <START:ggp> antibodies <END> from patients with chronic hepatitis and contained a short <START:ggp> immunodominant antigenic region <END> with at least two major <START:ggp> nonoverlapping epitopes <END> . 
Anti- <START:ggp> HBx <END> antibody titers as revealed by peptide ELISAs were highest and most frequent in patients with chronic hepatitis and usually low in acutely infected patients and asymptomatic carriers . 
The data demonstrate a remarkable qualitative and quantitative heterogeneity of the humoral <START:ggp> HBx <END> immune response which can be monitored by <START:ggp> HBx <END> -specific peptide ELISAs . 
Such tests may become useful diagnostic tools . 
[ The inhibitory effect of hydrocortisone on the chemotactic migration of <START:ana> human leukocytes <END> ] 
Random migration ( RM ) and chemotactic migration ( ChtM ) of <START:ana> human leukocytes <END> to yeast activated serum were studied with the modified Boyden chamber method . 
Both RM and ChtM showed circadian rhythm . 
<START:ana> Leukocytes <END> migrated most rapidly at night . 
The difference between the peak ( 0 : 00 ) and trough values ( 8 : 00 ) of RM and ChtM was significant statistically ( P less than 0.01 ) . 
ChtM was inhibited by hydrocortisone ( F ) of physiological concentration ( 10 ( -9 ) -10 ( -7 ) mol/L ) which was dose-dependent and completely antagonized by the competitive antagonist , RU38486 . 
The inhibitory effect was much more evident with higher dose ( more than 10 ( -5 ) mol/L ) and it was also reversed by RU38486 , but only partially . 
It is suggested that glucocorticoids ( GC ) may be a physiological regulator of the activity of <START:ana> leukocytes <END> and its inhibitory action on ChtM may be involved in antiinflammatory mechanisms of GC of pharmacological doses . 
The action of physiological and pharmacological concentration of GC may be mediated by <START:ggp> low affinity specific binding sites <END> of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> . 
Heterogeneity of <START:ggp> antigen molecules <END> recognized by <START:ggp> anti-tax1 monoclonal antibody <END> <START:ggp> Lt-4 <END> in cell lines bearing human T cell leukemia virus type I and related retroviruses . 
Using a <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> , <START:ggp> Lt-4 <END> , directed against <START:ggp> human T cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) trans-activator ( tax1 ) antigen <END> , we examined the expression of <START:ggp> tax1 <END> and related <START:ggp> antigens <END> in a variety of <START:ana> T cell lines <END> bearing HTLV-I and related retroviruses , simian T cell leukemia virus type I ( STLV-I ) and HTLV-II , by immunofluorescence and immunoblot assays . 
<START:ggp> Lt-4 <END> reacted with all <START:ana> HTLV-I-bearing cell lines <END> tested and five out of eight <START:ana> simian cell lines <END> bearing STLV-I , but not with an <START:ana> HTLV-II-bearing cell line <END> . 
<START:ggp> Lt-4 <END> detected 40 kd <START:ggp> tax1 antigen molecules <END> in most <START:ana> HTLV-I-bearing cell lines <END> except one cell line that expressed <START:ggp> 39 kd tax1 antigen <END> . 
In the <START:ana> STLV-I-bearing T cell lines <END> , <START:ggp> tax1-related antigen molecules <END> detected by <START:ggp> Lt-4 <END> were heterogeneous , having molecular weights in the range of 36-41 kd . 
Characterization of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer-binding proteins <END> from the <START:ana> human T-cell line <END> <START:ana> Jurkat <END> . 
The transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is under the control of <START:ggp> cellular proteins <END> that bind to the <START:ggp> viral long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) . 
Among the protein-binding regions of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> is the <START:ggp> transcription-enhancer region <END> . 
We show that at least one <START:ggp> inducible <END> , <START:ggp> C1 <END> , and one <START:ggp> constitutive , C2 , protein <END> can bind to the <START:ggp> HIV enhancer <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
The two proteins differ in their surface charge , since they are separable by anion-exchange chromatography . 
Bivalent cations such as Mg2+ and Zn2+ differentially affect their binding to oligonucleotides which contain the <START:ggp> HIV-enhancer domain <END> . 
Both <START:ggp> C1 <END> and <START:ggp> C2 proteins <END> also bind to a similar sequence found in the <START:ggp> interleukin-2-receptor alpha-subunit enhancer <END> . 
The <START:ggp> inducible C1 protein <END> was partially purified by three chromatographic steps and characterized by u.v. cross-linking as a <START:ggp> 47 kDa protein <END> . 
Differences in <START:ggp> transcriptional enhancers <END> of HIV-1 and HIV-2 . 
Response to <START:ana> T cell <END> activation signals . 
<START:ana> T cell <END> activation results in high levels of HIV replication and is thought to be one mechanism leading to the conversion from latent to active viral infection . 
In HIV-1 , the sequences that respond to these signaling events are found in the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) and comprise the <START:ggp> transcriptional enhancer <END> , which contains two <START:ggp> conserved binding sites <END> for the <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> ) . 
The corresponding region in the second AIDS retrovirus , HIV-2 , contains a conserved and a divergent <START:ggp> NF kappa B binding site <END> . 
We demonstrate that the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> responds better than the <START:ggp> HIV-2 LTR <END> to T cell activation signals . 
These qualitative differences in the response to <START:ana> T cell <END> activation are reproduced not only when <START:ggp> HIV-1 or HIV-2 enhancers <END> are placed upstream of a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> but also when these <START:ggp> enhancers <END> are switched between their respective <START:ggp> LTR <END> . 
In electrophoretic mobility shift assays , <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> binds to both conserved sites in the <START:ggp> HIV-1 transcriptional enhancer <END> and only to the single conserved site in the <START:ggp> HIV-2 transcriptional enhancer <END> . 
Instead of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> , the <START:ggp> activator protein 3 <END> binds to the divergent site in HIV-2 . 
In conclusion , HIV-1 and HIV-2 are differentially regulated by T cell activation signals , and this difference may account for the longer period of viral latency observed with HIV-2 than with HIV-1 infection . 
<START:ggp> NF-X2 <END> that binds to the <START:ggp> DRA X2-box <END> is <START:ggp> activator protein 1 <END> . 
Expression cloning of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> . 
<START:ggp> Human class II MHC Ag <END> are a family of <START:ggp> cell surface glycoproteins <END> . 
Their constitutive expression is limited to <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> thymic epithelial cells <END> . 
In many other cells their expression can be induced by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
Conserved upstream promoter sequences regulate this tissue-specific expression of <START:ggp> class II genes <END> . 
In the <START:ggp> DRA promoter <END> , one of these <START:ggp> cis-acting regulatory motifs <END> is the <START:ggp> X2-box <END> to which <START:ggp> nuclear factor X2 <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-X2 <END> ) binds . 
Here , we present the isolation and characterization of the <START:ggp> full-length cDNA clone <END> encoding <START:ggp> NF-X2 <END> . 
This <START:ggp> cDNA clone <END> was isolated by expression <START:ggp> cDNA <END> cloning , and encodes the <START:ggp> human c-Jun protein <END> , which together with <START:ggp> c-Fos <END> forms the <START:ggp> heterodimeric activator protein-1 transcription complex <END> . 
Whereas <START:ggp> c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers <END> do not exist in <START:ana> B cells <END> , they form and bind to the <START:ggp> X2-box <END> in <START:ana> class II nonexpressing cells <END> . 
Thus , <START:ggp> c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers <END> might contribute to the repression of <START:ggp> DRA gene <END> expression . 
Synthesis of 4 , 19-disubstituted derivatives of DOC . 
Radioreceptor assay of some corticosteroid derivatives in <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> . 
Several new 4 , 19-substituted steroids and previously synthesized corticosteroids were assayed for affinity to <START:ggp> type 1 receptors <END> in <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> . 
11 beta , 19-epoxy-4 , 21-dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3 , 20-dione ( 2 ) was hydrogenated with Pd-C to yield a mixture of all four dihydro derivatives 5 , accompanied by 4 , 21-diacetoxy-11 beta , 19-epoxy-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one ( 6 ) and 21-acetoxy-11 beta , 19-epoxy-4-hydroxypregnane-3 , 20-dione ( 7 ) . 
With hot acetic + p-toluenesulfonic acid 5 underwent rearrangement to 21-acetoxy-11 beta , 19-epoxypregn-5-ene-4 , 20-dione ( 8 ) Pd-C hydrogenation of 3 , 21-diacetoxy-5 beta , 19-cyclopregna-2 , 9 ( 11 ) -diene-4 , 20-dione ( 10 ) gave 3 , 21-diacetoxy-5 beta , 19-cyclopregn-5-ene-4 , 20-dione ( 11 ) and the 9 , 11-dihydro derivative of the latter . 
Treatment of 10 with warm HCl furnished 19-chloro-4 , 21-dihydroxypregna-4 , 9 ( 11 ) -diene-3 , 20-dione ( 13 ) . 
Pd-C hydrogenation of its diacetate 14 afforded the 4 , 5-dihydro derivative 18 , 19-chloro-21-acetoxypregn-9 ( 11 ) -en-20-one ( 15 ) , its 4-acetoxy derivative 16 and the 3 , 4-diacetoxy derivative 17 . 
When tested in a radioreceptor assay in <START:ana> human mononuclear leukocytes <END> the synthesized compounds showed only low relative binding affinities ( RBA ) to <START:ggp> type 1 receptor <END> , the highest being 0.72 % for 13 ( aldosterone = 100 % ) . 
For comparison , other RBA in this system were : 19-noraldosterone , 20 % ; 18-deoxyaldosterone , 5.8 % ; 18-deoxy-19-noraldosterone , 4.7 % ; 18 , 21-anhydroaldosterone , 0.37 % ; 17-isoaldosterone , 7.6 % and apoaldosterone , 4.3 % 
Cell type specificity and activation requirements for <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> of <START:ana> activated T-cells <END> ) transcriptional activity determined by a new method using transgenic mice to assay transcriptional activity of an individual <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor <END> of <START:ana> activated T-cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> ) is a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> which is considered to be an important regulator in early T-cell activation . 
We have developed a system to monitor the transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> at the single cell level in whole animals . 
The system is based on the use of an oligomerized <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> binding motif that directs <START:ggp> transcription of SV40 T-antigen <END> in transgenic mice . 
This report represents the first demonstration that a multimerized short binding motif can function appropriately in transgenic mice . 
<START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> activity had previously been thought to be confined to <START:ana> activated T-lymphocytes <END> upon release of <START:ana> intracellular calcium <END> . 
By targeting <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> -dependent gene expression in transgenic mice we discovered new sites of <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> activity . 
Besides in <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> activity could also be induced in <START:ana> T-lymphocyte-depleted spleen cells <END> and <START:ana> purified B-lymphocytes <END> and requires agents that both release intracellular calcium and activate <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> . 
A difference in the time course of appearance of <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> activity between <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> non-T-lymphocytes <END> was revealed . 
Constitutive expression was observed in a small population of cells in the dermis and some mice have developed skin lesions . 
Interestingly , the tissue pattern of expression of the <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> activity resembles the expression pattern described for HIV-LTR/tat transgenic mice ( Vogel , J. , Hinrichs , S. H. , Reynolds , R. K. , Luciw , P. A. , and Jay , G. ( 1988 ) Nature 335 , 606-611 ) . 
This similarity in expression and the fact that <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> has been shown to bind <START:ggp> functional sequences <END> in <START:ggp> HIV-LTR <END> suggest a role for <START:ggp> NFAT-1 <END> in dermal activation of the <START:ggp> HIV-LTR <END> . 
A novel <START:ggp> T-cell protein <END> which recognizes a <START:ggp> palindromic sequence <END> in the <START:ggp> negative regulatory element <END> of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat <END> . 
Two <START:ggp> major protein-binding sites <END> within the <START:ggp> negative regulatory element <END> of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat <END> have been identified . 
One ( <START:ggp> site B <END> ) contained a <START:ggp> palindromic sequence <END> with homology to <START:ggp> steroid/thyroid hormone response elements <END> but was distinct from previously described binding sites of this class . 
A novel <START:ggp> T-cell protein <END> recognized the <START:ggp> palindromic sequence <END> within <START:ggp> site B <END> and also bound <START:ggp> estrogen- or thyroid hormone-response elements <END> with lower affinity . 
A 7-base-pair mutation in the <START:ggp> site B palindrome <END> , which destroyed protein binding , resulted in increased expression from the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Progesterone suppression of <START:ana> pregnancy lymphocytes <END> is not mediated by glucocorticoid effect . 
This study investigated whether the suppressive effect of progesterone on <START:ana> pregnancy lymphocytes <END> is mediated by specific <START:ggp> progesterone receptors <END> . 
The effects of a competitive progesterone antagonist ( RU486 ) and a specific <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> blocker ( RU43044 ) were tested on the release of a <START:ggp> blocking factor <END> by <START:ana> progesterone-treated pregnancy lymphocytes <END> . 
RU 486 tested at an equal concentration as progesterone significantly inhibited the production of the <START:ggp> blocking factor <END> , while RU 43044 was without effect . 
These data suggest that in pregnancy , lymphocyte progesterone acts on specific <START:ggp> progesterone receptors <END> and <START:ggp> glucocorticoid binding sites <END> are not involved . 
The <START:ggp> 56-59-kilodalton protein <END> identified in <START:ggp> untransformed steroid receptor complexes <END> is a <START:ggp> unique protein <END> that exists in cytosol in a complex with both the <START:ggp> 70- and 90-kilodalton heat shock proteins <END> . 
It has previously been shown that <START:ggp> 9S <END> , <START:ggp> untransformed progestin , estrogen , androgen , and glucocorticoid receptor complexes <END> in rabbit uterine and liver cytosols contain a <START:ggp> 59-kDa protein <END> [ Tai , P.K. , Maeda , Y. , Nakao , K. , Wakim , N.G. , Duhring , J.L. , & Faber , L.E. ( 1986 ) Biochemistry 25 , 5269-5275 ] . 
In this work we show that the <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody KN 382/EC1 <END> raised against the <START:ggp> rabbit 59-kDa protein <END> reacts with <START:ggp> 9S <END> , <START:ggp> untransformed glucocorticoid receptor complexes <END> in cytosol prepared from <START:ana> human IM-9 lymphocytes <END> but not with <START:ggp> 4S salt-transformed receptors <END> . 
The human protein recognized by the <START:ggp> EC1 antibody <END> is a <START:ggp> 56-kDa protein <END> ( <START:ggp> p56 <END> ) of moderate abundance located predominantly in the cytoplasm by indirect immunofluorescence . 
There are at least six <START:ggp> isomorphs <END> of <START:ggp> p56 <END> by two-dimensional gel analysis . 
N-Terminal sequencing ( 20 amino acids ) shows that <START:ggp> p56 <END> is a <START:ggp> unique human protein <END> . 
When <START:ggp> p56 <END> is immunoadsorbed from <START:ana> IM-9 cell <END> cytosol , both the <START:ggp> 70- and 90-kDa heat shock proteins <END> are coadsorbed in an immune-specific manner . 
Neither <START:ggp> heat shock protein <END> reacts directly with the <START:ggp> EC1 antibody <END> . 
We conclude that <START:ggp> p56 <END> exists in cytosol in a higher order complex containing <START:ggp> hsp70 <END> and <START:ggp> hsp90 <END> , both of which in turn have been found to be associated with <START:ggp> untransformed steroid receptors <END> . 
Sequence-specific DNA binding of the <START:ggp> proto-oncoprotein <END> <START:ggp> ets-1 <END> defines a <START:ggp> transcriptional activator sequence <END> within the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus . 
The <START:ggp> ets proto-oncogene family <END> is a group of <START:ggp> sequence-related genes <END> whose normal cellular function is unknown . 
In a study of <START:ggp> cellular proteins <END> involved in the transcriptional regulation of murine retroviruses in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , we have discovered that a member of the <START:ggp> ets gene family <END> encodes a <START:ggp> sequence-specific DNA-binding protein <END> . 
A <START:ggp> mouse ets-1 cDNA clone <END> was obtained by screening a mouse thymus cDNA expression library with a <START:ggp> double-stranded oligonucleotide probe <END> representing 20 bp of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus ( MSV ) <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) . 
The <START:ggp> cDNA sequence <END> has an <START:ggp> 813-bp open reading frame <END> ( <START:ggp> ORF <END> ) whose predicted amino acid sequence is 97.6 % identical to the <START:ggp> 272 carboxy-terminal amino acids <END> of the <START:ggp> human ets-1 protein <END> . 
The <START:ggp> ORF <END> was expressed in bacteria , and the <START:ggp> 30-kD protein product <END> was shown to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner by mobility-shift assays , Southwestern blot analysis , and methylation interference . 
A <START:ggp> mutant LTR <END> containing four base pair substitutions in the <START:ggp> ets-1 binding site <END> was constructed and was shown to have reduced binding in vitro . 
Transcriptional efficiency of the <START:ggp> MSV LTR promoter <END> containing this disrupted <START:ggp> ets-1 binding site <END> was compared to the activity of a <START:ggp> wild-type promoter <END> in <START:ana> mouse T lymphocytes <END> in culture , and 15- to 20-fold reduction in expression of a <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> was observed . 
We propose that <START:ggp> ets-1 <END> functions as a transcriptional activator of mammalian type-C retroviruses and speculate that <START:ggp> ets-related genes <END> constitute a new group of <START:ggp> eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins <END> . 
<START:ggp> Type II estrogen binding sites <END> in <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> : variations during the menstrual cycle . 
We have previously reported that <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) contain type <START:ggp> II estrogen binding sites <END> ( <START:ggp> type II EBS <END> ) . 
In this study , the fluctuations of <START:ggp> type II EBS <END> during the menstrual cycle were analyzed in 6 normally menstruating women . 
Approximately 3 times higher levels of <START:ggp> type II EBS <END> were found in the periovulatory period with respect to both follicular and luteal phases . 
In postmenopausal women the mean <START:ggp> type II EBS <END> levels were similar to those observed in the follicular phase of the cycle . 
However , in 3 postmenopausal patients a short course of estrogen or tamoxifen resulted in a marked increase of <START:ggp> type II EBS <END> levels . 
Tamoxifen was also found to compete with 17 beta-estradiol for <START:ggp> type II EBS <END> in <START:ana> PBMC <END> , although to a lesser extent than diethylstilbestrol . 
<START:ana> Mononuclear leukocyte <END> <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> binding characteristics and down-regulation in major depression . 
Some patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) have elevated plasma cortisol concentrations and show failure to suppress cortisol secretion upon administration of dexamethasone ( DEX ) , yet they do not have Cushingoid features . 
To study whether this represents glucocorticoid ( GC ) resistance , [ 3H ] -DEX-binding assays were used to measure , in vitro , the <START:ggp> GC receptor <END> affinity ( 1/Kd ) and number ( Bmax ) in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> of 11 MDD patients and 15 control subjects . 
No receptor abnormalities were detected in the MDD group ; thus any cellular defect leading to a lack of responsiveness to GC in the MDD patients , if present , probably lies beyond the initial receptor binding . 
DEX ( 1.0 mg orally ) was administered to study in <START:ggp> vivo GC receptor <END> down-regulation . 
Compared to the control group , fewer depressed subjects down-regulated Bmax after DEX . 
By paired t-test , Bmax decreased significantly in the control group but not in the depressed group . 
Receptor number on the control day did not correlate significantly with the degree of receptor down-regulation , severity of depression or cortisol concentrations across all the subjects . 
These results do not lend support to previous reports suggesting that GC resistance in MDD results from a GC receptor-binding abnormality , and they emphasize the importance of considering receptor studies in the context of GC-mediated cell processes in order to identify the exact cellular defect ( s ) leading to GC resistance . 
<START:ggp> Ras-related GTP-binding proteins <END> and <START:ana> leukocyte <END> signal transduction . 
Many aspects of <START:ana> leukocyte <END> function are regulated by both <START:ggp> heterotrimeric <END> and <START:ggp> Ras-related GTP-binding proteins <END> , but there is little definite information about their roles in the specialized processes utilized by <START:ana> leukocytes <END> for cell killing . 
Recent progress in understanding the regulation of the <START:ggp> phagocyte NADPH oxidase <END> by the <START:ggp> Rac GTP-binding proteins <END> provides a basis for defining the operational characteristics of one such phagocyte system . 
It is clear from various studies that the activity of the <START:ggp> NADPH oxidase <END> can be modulated through the regulation of the GTP-GDP state of <START:ggp> Rac <END> . 
Proteins exist in <START:ana> leukocytes <END> able to modify <START:ggp> GTP-binding protein <END> function in this manner , and their activity may be regulated by signals generated on phagocyte stimulation . 
Proteins of the <START:ggp> Ras superfamily <END> are likely to be involved in a variety of normal phagocyte functions through their ability to modulate the assembly of <START:ggp> actin filaments <END> , direct vesicle trafficking and fusion , and so forth . 
<START:ggp> BSAP <END> : a key regulator of <START:ana> B-cell <END> development and differentiation . 
<START:ggp> B-cell-specific activator protein <END> ( <START:ggp> BSAP <END> ) is a recently identified member of the <START:ggp> Pax-gene family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> ; in the lymphoid system , <START:ggp> BSAP <END> is produced only in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
Here , Markus Neurath , Eckhard Stuber and Warren Strober describe the molecular structure of <START:ggp> BSAP <END> and focus on the ability of this protein to regulate the expression of <START:ggp> B-cell-specific genes <END> . 
They propose that <START:ggp> BSAP <END> is a <START:ggp> key protein <END> of <START:ana> B cells <END> and that it not only influence B-cell development but also influences the balance between B-cell proliferation and <START:ggp> immunoglobulin <END> secretion at later stages of B-cell differentiation . 
Down-regulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B protein <END> levels in activated human lymphocytes by 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1996 Jan 9 ; 93 ( 1 ) : 524 ] 
The effect of 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 ) D3 ] , a steroid hormone with immunomodulating properties , on <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) proteins was examined in <START:ana> in vitro activated normal human lymphocytes <END> by Western blot analysis . 
Over a 72-hr period of activation , the expression of the <START:ggp> 50-kDa NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> p50 <END> , and its precursor , <START:ggp> p105 <END> , was increased progressively . 
When cells were activated in the presence of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 , the levels of the mature protein as well as its precursor were decreased . 
The effect of the hormone on the levels of <START:ggp> p50 <END> was demonstrable in the cytosolic and nuclear compartments ; it required between 4 and 8 hr and was specific , as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 24 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were ineffective . 
Besides <START:ggp> p50 <END> , 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 decreased the levels of another <START:ggp> NF-kappa B protein <END> , namely <START:ggp> c-rel <END> . 
In addition , 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 decreased the abundance of a <START:ggp> specific DNA-protein complex <END> formed upon incubation of nuclear extracts from activated lymphocytes with a labeled <START:ggp> NF-kappa B DNA binding motif <END> . 
Further , 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 inhibited the transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> transiently transfected with a <START:ggp> construct <END> containing four <START:ggp> tandem repeats <END> of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B binding sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin kappa light chain gene <END> linked to the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene <END> . 
These observations demonstrate directly that there is de novo synthesis of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> during human lymphocyte activation and suggest that this process is hormonally regulated . 
The <START:ggp> myeloid zinc finger gene <END> , <START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> , regulates the <START:ggp> CD34 promoter <END> in vitro . 
<START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> is a <START:ggp> C2H2 zinc finger gene <END> encoding a <START:ggp> putative transcriptional regulator <END> of myeloid differentiation . 
The <START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> protein contains 13 <START:ggp> C2H2 zinc fingers <END> arranged in bipartite <START:ggp> DNA binding domains <END> containing <START:ggp> zinc fingers <END> through 4 and , in the <START:ggp> carboxy-terminus <END> , 5 through 13 . 
We previously identified the <START:ggp> DNA consensus binding site <END> recognized by the two <START:ggp> DNA binding domains <END> . 
To assess the transcription regulatory function of <START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> , the full-length <START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> coding region was fused to the <START:ggp> DNA binding domain <END> of the <START:ggp> yeast transactivator GAL4 <END> . 
The expression vector was cotransfected with the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) reporter gene <END> regulated by the <START:ggp> thymidine kinase promoter <END> containing <START:ggp> GAL4 DNA binding sites <END> into <START:ana> NIH 3T3 <END> , <START:ana> 293 <END> , <START:ana> K562 <END> , and <START:ana> Jurkat cell lines <END> . 
<START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> represses <START:ggp> CAT reporter gene <END> expression via <START:ggp> GAL4 <END> binding sites in the <START:ana> nonhematopoietic cell lines <END> <START:ana> NIH 3T3 <END> and <START:ana> 293 <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> activates <START:ggp> CAT reporter gene <END> expression in the <START:ana> hematopoietic cell lines <END> <START:ana> K562 <END> and <START:ana> Jurkat <END> . 
The <START:ggp> MZF-1 binding sites <END> are present in the <START:ggp> promoters <END> of several <START:ggp> genes <END> expressed during myeloid differentiation , including the <START:ggp> CD34 promoter <END> . 
<START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> transcriptional regulation of this <START:ggp> physiologically relevant promoter <END> was assessed in both <START:ana> hematopoietic <END> and <START:ana> nonhematopoietic cell lines <END> . 
<START:ggp> Recombinant MZF-1 protein <END> specifically binds to the <START:ggp> consensus binding sites <END> in the <START:ggp> CD34 promoter <END> in mobility shift assays . 
<START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> expression vectors were cotransfected with the <START:ggp> luciferase reporter plasmids <END> regulated by the <START:ggp> CD34 promoter <END> into both <START:ana> nonhematopoietic and hematopoietic cell lines <END> . 
As with the heterologous <START:ggp> DNA binding domain <END> , <START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> represses <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> expression in <START:ana> nonhematopoietic cell lines <END> and activates expression in <START:ana> hematopoietic cell lines <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> CD34 <END> expression in <START:ana> hematopoietic cell lines <END> is dependent on the presence of intact <START:ggp> MZF-1 binding sites <END> . 
The cell type-specific regulation of the <START:ggp> CD34 promoter <END> by <START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> suggests the presence of tissue-specific regulators/adapters or differential <START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> modifications that determine <START:ggp> MZF-1 <END> transcriptional regulatory function . 
The murine <START:ggp> BCL6 gene <END> is induced in <START:ana> activated lymphocytes <END> as an <START:ggp> immediate early gene <END> . 
The chromosomal translocation involving <START:ggp> 3q27 <END> is often detected in <START:ana> human B-cell lymphomas <END> , especially diffuse lymphomas with a large-cell component . 
The <START:ggp> BCL6 gene <END> has been isolated from the chromosomal breakpoint in these lymphomas . 
Here we cloned the <START:ggp> murine BCL6 ( mBCL6 ) cDNA <END> from the <START:ggp> muscle cDNA library <END> using the <START:ggp> human BCL6 ( hBCL6 ) cDNA <END> as a probe . 
The predicted amino acid sequence was 95 % identical to that of <START:ggp> hBCL6 <END> . 
It contains six repeats of the <START:ggp> Kruppel-like zinc-finger motif <END> that are completely identical to those of <START:ggp> hBCL6 <END> , indicating that the <START:ggp> BCL6 gene <END> is well conserved between humans and mice . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> mBCL6 gene <END> was ubiquitously detected in adult mouse tissues including lymphatic organs . 
Furthermore , it was induced in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> activated with phorbol ester and Ca2+ ionophore within 30 min after stimulation . 
This induction was not inhibited by treatment of the cells with a protein synthesis inhibitor , cycloheximide . 
These results suggest that <START:ggp> BCL6 <END> plays a role in <START:ana> activated lymphocytes <END> as an immediate early gene . 
The role of <START:ggp> BSAP <END> ( <START:ggp> Pax-5 <END> ) in B-cell development . 
The hierarchy of transcriptional control in B-cell development has recently been analyzed by targeted gene inactivation in the mouse . 
In this manner , the <START:ggp> paired box containing gene <END> <START:ggp> Pax-5 <END> , encoding the <START:ggp> B cell specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> BSAP <END> , has been shown to play a key role in early B lymphopoiesis . 
Other experimental strategies have implicated <START:ggp> BSAP <END> in the control of cell proliferation , isotype switching and transcription of the <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy-chain <END> gene at late stages of B-cell differentiation . 
The DNA-binding properties of <START:ggp> two heat shock factors <END> , <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> and <START:ggp> HSF3 <END> , are induced in the <START:ana> avian erythroblast cell line <END> <START:ana> HD6 <END> . 
Avian cells express three <START:ggp> heat shock transcription factor ( HSF ) genes <END> corresponding to a <START:ggp> novel factor <END> , <START:ggp> HSF3 <END> , and homologs of mouse and human <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> and <START:ggp> HSF2 <END> . 
Analysis of the biochemical and cell biological properties of these <START:ggp> HSFs <END> reveals that <START:ggp> HSF3 <END> has properties in common with both <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> and <START:ggp> HSF2 <END> and yet has features which are distinct from both . 
<START:ggp> HSF3 <END> is constitutively expressed in the <START:ana> erythroblast cell line HD6 <END> , the <START:ana> lymphoblast cell line MSB <END> , and <START:ana> embryo fibroblasts <END> , and yet its DNA-binding activity is induced only upon exposure of HD6 cells to heat shock . 
Acquisition of <START:ggp> HSF3 <END> DNA-binding activity in <START:ana> HD6 cells <END> is accompanied by oligomerization from a <START:ggp> non-DNA-binding dimer <END> to a <START:ggp> DNA-binding trimer <END> , whereas the effect of heat shock on <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> is oligomerization of an <START:ggp> inert monomer <END> to a <START:ggp> DNA-binding trimer <END> . 
Induction of <START:ggp> HSF3 <END> DNA-binding activity is delayed compared with that of <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> . 
As occurs for <START:ggp> HSF1 <END> , heat shock leads to the translocation of <START:ggp> HSF3 <END> to the nucleus . 
HSF exhibits the properties of a <START:ggp> transcriptional activator <END> , as judged from the stimulatory activity of <START:ggp> transiently overexpressed HSF3 <END> measured by using a <START:ggp> heat shock element-containing reporter construct <END> and as independently assayed by the activity of a <START:ggp> chimeric GAL4-HSF3 protein <END> on a <START:ggp> GAL4 reporter construct <END> . 
These results reveal that <START:ggp> HSF3 <END> is negatively regulated in <START:ana> avian cells <END> and acquires DNA-binding activity in certain cells upon heat shock . 
Direct demonstration of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> dephosphorylation and nuclear localization in <START:ana> activated HT-2 cells <END> using a specific <START:ggp> NFATp polyclonal antibody <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) regulates transcription of a number of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> , and <START:ggp> NFAT <END> DNA binding activity is stimulated following T cell activation . 
Several lines of evidence have suggested that <START:ggp> NFAT <END> is a substrate for <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , a <START:ggp> serine/threonine phosphatase <END> . 
Using a polyclonal antibody to <START:ggp> murine NFATp <END> , Western blot analysis of various mouse tissues demonstrated that the 110-130-kDa <START:ggp> NFATp protein <END> was highly expressed in thymus and spleen . 
Treatment of immunoprecipitated <START:ggp> NFATp <END> from untreated <START:ana> HT-2 cells <END> with <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> resulted in the dephosphorylation of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> , demonstrating that <START:ggp> NFATp <END> is an in vitro substrate for <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
<START:ggp> NFATp <END> immunoprecipitated from <START:ana> 32P-labeled HT-2 cells <END> migrated as an approximately 120-kDa protein that was localized to the cytosol of the cells . 
Treatment of the cells with ionomycin resulted in a decrease in the molecular weight of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> and a loss of 32P , consistent with <START:ggp> NFATp <END> dephosphorylation . 
The dephosphorylation of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> was accompanied by localization of the protein to the nuclear fraction . 
Both of these events were blocked by preincubation of the cells with FK506 , a <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> inhibitor , consistent with the hypothesis that <START:ggp> NFATp <END> is a <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> substrate in cells . 
Activation and expression of the <START:ggp> nuclear factors <END> of <START:ana> activated T cells <END> , <START:ggp> NFATp <END> and <START:ggp> NFATc <END> , in <START:ana> human natural killer cells <END> : regulation upon <START:ggp> CD16 <END> ligand binding . 
The putative factors that couple the signal transduction from surface receptors to the activation of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> synthesis in <START:ana> natural killer ( NK ) cells <END> have not been elucidated . 
We report here that the <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> of <START:ana> activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFATp <END> ) , a <START:ggp> cyclosporin A ( CsA ) -sensitive factor <END> that regulates the transcription of several <START:ggp> cytokines <END> , mediates <START:ggp> CD16 <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> in <START:ana> human NK cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD16 <END> ( <START:ggp> Fc gamma RIIIA <END> ) -induced expression of <START:ana> cytokine mRNA <END> in <START:ana> NK cells <END> occurs via a CsA-sensitive and Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent mechanism . 
Stimulation of <START:ana> NK cells <END> with <START:ggp> CD16 <END> ligands induces <START:ggp> NFAT <END> -like DNA binding activity in the nuclear extracts from these cells , as detected in electrophoretic mobility shift assays . 
This occurs with fast kinetics after stimulation , via a CsA-sensitive and Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent mechanism that does not require de novo protein synthesis . 
<START:ggp> NK cell NFAT <END> is present in the cytosol of <START:ana> nonstimulated cells <END> , migrates to the nucleus upon stimulation , and can associate with <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
Two distinct molecules , <START:ggp> NFATp <END> and <START:ggp> NFATc <END> , have been reported to mediate <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activity . 
The results of supershift assays using <START:ggp> NFATp- and NFATc- specific antibodies <END> indicate that NK cell activation early after <START:ggp> CD16 <END> ligand binding involves primarily , if not exclusively , <START:ggp> NFATp <END> , and Western blot analysis shows that this has the same electrophoretic mobility ( approximately 120 kD ) as that of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ana> NK cells <END> do not express <START:ggp> NFATc <END> constitutively , but <START:ana> NFATc mRNA <END> accumulation is induced in these cells within 2 h of stimulation with CD16 ligands . 
However , supershift assays using the available <START:ggp> mAb <END> recognizing the <START:ggp> T cell NFATc <END> revealed no detectable <START:ggp> NFATc <END> protein in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from CD16- or <START:ana> phorbol ester-stimulated cells <END> at any time tested , up to 4 h . 
These results provide the first direct evidence that both <START:ggp> CsA-sensitive transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> NFATp <END> and <START:ggp> NFATc <END> , are expressed in human <START:ana> NK cells <END> , and that their activation and/or expression can be regulated in primary cells by a single stimulus , that , in the case of CD16 in <START:ana> NK cells <END> , results in early activation of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> and subsequently induced expression of <START:ana> NFATc mRNA <END> . 
Interleukin 2 signaling involves the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> . 
One of the most important <START:ggp> cytokines <END> involved in immune response regulation is interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , a potent activator of the proliferation and function of <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> and <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> . 
The mechanisms by which the effects of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> are propagated within cells are not understood . 
While the binding of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> to its receptor was recently shown to lead to the activation of two <START:ggp> kinases <END> , <START:ggp> Jak-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Jak-3 <END> , subsequent steps in the signaling pathway to the nucleus that lead to the activation of specific genes had not been characterized . 
Since many <START:ggp> cytokines <END> that activate <START:ggp> Jak kinases <END> also lead to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of members of the <START:ggp> Stat family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , the ability of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> to trigger Stat phosphorylation was examined . 
Exposure of activated <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> or of a <START:ana> natural killer cell line <END> ( <START:ana> NKL <END> ) to <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> leads to the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Stat1 alpha <END> , Stat1 beta , and <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> , as well as of two <START:ggp> Stat-related proteins <END> , <START:ggp> p94 <END> and <START:ggp> p95 <END> . 
<START:ggp> p94 <END> and <START:ggp> p95 <END> share homology with <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> at the <START:ggp> phosphorylation site <END> and in the <START:ggp> Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain <END> , but otherwise are immunologically distinct from <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> . 
These <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> were found to translocate to the nucleus and to bind to a <START:ggp> specific DNA sequence <END> . 
These findings suggest a mechanism by which <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> binding to its receptor may activate <START:ggp> specific genes <END> involved in immune cell function . 
Expression of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> correlates with <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> responsiveness in Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia . 
This study evaluates ( i ) constitutive levels of <START:ggp> oncogene <END> and <START:ana> p53 transcripts <END> in chronic phase CML patients and ( ii ) their modulations subsequent to in vivo therapy with <START:ggp> rIFN-alpha 2c <END> . 
<START:ana> Peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> pbmc <END> ) and <START:ana> bone marrow cells <END> of 26 patients were examined for c-fos , c-myc , p53 and the hybrid bcr/abl mRNA levels . 
Results indicated that ( i ) constitutive <START:ana> c-fos transcript <END> levels are significantly higher in patients subsequently responding to <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> therapy ( p < 0.01 ) and positively correlated with the proportion of <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> ( r = 0.6895 , p < 0.01 ) and negatively with the proportion of <START:ana> immature cells <END> ( r = -0.568 , p < 0.01 ) contained in the <START:ana> pbmc <END> preparations tested , ( ii ) <START:ana> constitutive mRNA <END> levels of the <START:ggp> hybrid bcr/abl <END> , <START:ggp> c-myc <END> and <START:ggp> p53 <END> are positively correlated with each other , but failed to relate to disease parameters , and ( iii ) acute and chronic in vivo exposure to <START:ggp> IFN-alpha <END> is accompanied by upregulation of <START:ggp> c-fos <END> and downregulation of <START:ana> c-myc mRNA <END> levels in responder patients . 
Menopause is associated with a significant increase in blood monocyte number and a relative decrease in the expression of <START:ggp> estrogen receptors <END> in <START:ana> human peripheral monocytes <END> . 
PROBLEM : The clinical significance of the differential expression of <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> was evaluated . 
METHOD : Two color flow cytometry analysis was used on peripheral blood samples of young and postmenopausal females and postmenopausal females treated with estrogen replacement therapy . 
In addition , the monocyte and lymphocyte counts and the blood estrogen levels of each patient were determine . 
RESULTS : During menopause there is a significant decrease in the percentage of <START:ana> ER positive monocytes <END> , and an increase in <START:ana> blood monocyte <END> number , which declines following estrogen replacement therapy to values of the young . 
CONCLUSIONS : These findings suggest that estrogen modulates the <START:ana> monocyte <END> numbers and its effects may be mediated through the <START:ggp> ER <END> in the <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Staphylococcal enterotoxins <END> modulate <START:ggp> interleukin 2 receptor <END> expression and ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> Janus protein-tyrosine kinase 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> ) and <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription <END> ( <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> Staphylococcal enterotoxins <END> ( <START:ggp> SE <END> ) stimulate <START:ana> T cells <END> expressing the appropriate <START:ggp> variable region beta chain of ( V beta ) T-cell receptors <END> and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases . 
Depending on costimulatory signals , <START:ggp> SE <END> induce either proliferation or anergy in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
In addition , <START:ggp> SE <END> can induce an <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) nonresponsive state and apoptosis . 
Here , we show that <START:ggp> SE <END> induce dynamic changes in the expression of and signal transduction through the <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) beta and gamma chains <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2R gamma <END> ) in <START:ana> human antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell lines <END> . 
Thus , after 4 hr of exposure to <START:ggp> SEA <END> and <START:ggp> SEB <END> , the expression of <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> was down-regulated , <START:ggp> IL-2R gamma <END> was slightly up-regulated , while <START:ggp> IL-2R alpha <END> remained largely unaffected . 
The changes in the composition of <START:ggp> IL-2Rs <END> were accompanied by inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> Janus protein-tyrosine kinase 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> ) and <START:ggp> signal transducers and activators of transcription <END> called <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat5 <END> . 
In parallel experiments , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -driven proliferation was inhibited significantly . 
After 16 hr of exposure to <START:ggp> SE <END> , the expression of <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> remained low , while that of <START:ggp> IL2R alpha <END> and <START:ggp> IL2R gamma <END> was further up-regulated , and ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> was partly normalized . 
Yet , <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -driven proliferation remained profoundly inhibited , suggesting that signaling events other than <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> <START:ggp> /Stat <END> activation had also been changed following <START:ggp> SE <END> stimulation . 
In conclusion , our data suggest that <START:ggp> SE <END> can modulate <START:ggp> IL-2R <END> expression and signal transduction involving the <START:ggp> Jak/Stat <END> pathway in <START:ana> CD4+ T-cell lines <END> . 
Constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation , enhanced granulopoiesis , and neonatal lethality in <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> -deficient mice . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factors <END> belonging to the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B family <END> are controlled by <START:ggp> inhibitory I kappa B proteins <END> , mainly <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> . 
Apparently normal at birth , <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> -/- mice exhibit severe runting , skin defects , and extensive granulopoiesis postnatally , typically dying by 8 days . 
Hematopoietic tissues from these mice display elevated levels of both <START:ggp> nuclear NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ana> mRNAs <END> of some , but not all , genes thought to be regulated by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> elevation results in these phenotypic abnormalities because mice lacking both <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and the <START:ggp> p50 subunit <END> of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> show a dramatically delayed onset of abnormalities . 
In contrast to <START:ana> hematopoietic cells <END> , <START:ana> I kappa B alpha-/- embryonic fibroblasts <END> show minimal <START:ggp> constitutive NF-kappa B <END> , as well as normal signal-dependent <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation that is concomitant with <START:ggp> I kappa B beta <END> degradation . 
Our results indicate that I kappa b beta , but not <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> , is required for the signal-dependent activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
However , <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> is required for the postinduction repression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> . 
These results define distinct roles for the two forms of <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> and demonstrate the necessity for stringent control of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interleukin-7 <END> can induce the activation of <START:ggp> Jak 1 <END> , <START:ggp> Jak 3 <END> and <START:ggp> STAT 5 proteins <END> in murine <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The activation of <START:ggp> Janus protein tyrosine kinases <END> ( <START:ggp> Jak <END> ) and <START:ggp> STAT ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) proteins <END> has recently been linked to the signal transduction mechanism of several <START:ggp> cytokines <END> . 
<START:ggp> IL-7 <END> was observed to induce a rapid and dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak 1 <END> and <START:ggp> Jak 3 <END> and concomitantly , the tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of multiple <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> . 
The <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> utilized by <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> were identical to those induced by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and could be identified as various <START:ggp> STAT 5 isoforms <END> . 
Moreover , the induction of both <START:ggp> Jak 1 and 3 <END> , and <START:ggp> STAT 5 <END> activity strongly correlated with the growth-promoting effects of <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> , suggesting that this signal transduction mechanism may play a key role in <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> -induced proliferation . 
<START:ggp> Cytokine <END> -modulating activity of tepoxalin , a new potential antirheumatic . 
Tepoxalin is a new dual cyclooxygenase/5-lipoxygenase anti-inflammatory compound currently under clinical investigation . 
It has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activity in a variety of animal models and more recently to inhibit <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> induced signal transduction . 
The current study was conducted to evaluate the <START:ggp> cytokine <END> modulating activity of tepoxalin and the role of iron in these effects . 
In <START:ana> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) stimulated with OKT3/PMA , tepoxalin inhibited <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> proliferation with an IC50 of 6 microM . 
Additionally , it inhibited the production of <START:ggp> LTB4 <END> ( IC50 = 0.5 microM ) and the <START:ggp> cytokines <END> <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> and <START:ggp> TNF alpha <END> ( IC50 = 10-12 microM ) . 
Cytotoxicity was not demonstrated at these concentrations . 
Add-back experiments with either <START:ggp> cytokines <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> ) , <START:ggp> LTB4 <END> or conditioned media failed to restore the proliferative response in the presence of tepoxalin . 
However , the concurrent addition of iron ( in the form of ferrous or ferric chloride and other iron salts ) reversed the inhibition of proliferation caused by tepoxalin . 
Tepoxalin also inhibits the activation of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> which acts on several <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> . 
Tepoxalin 's effect on <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> is also reversed by the addition of iron salts . 
These data suggest that the action of tepoxalin to inhibit proliferation in <START:ana> PBMC <END> may be at least in part due to its ability to reduce the amount of available iron resulting in decreased activation of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> and subsequent inhibition of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production . 
<START:ggp> N- and C-terminal sequences <END> control degradation of <START:ggp> MAD3/I kappa B alpha <END> in response to inducers of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity . 
The proteolytic degradation of the <START:ggp> inhibitory protein <END> <START:ggp> MAD3/I kappa B alpha <END> in response to extracellular stimulation is a prerequisite step in the activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Analysis of the expression of <START:ggp> human I kappa B alpha protein <END> in stable transfectants of <START:ana> mouse 70Z/3 cells <END> shows that , as for the endogenous murine protein , exogenous <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> is degraded in response to inducers of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity , such as phorbol myristate acetate or lipopolysaccharide . 
In addition , pretreatment of the cells with the <START:ggp> proteasome <END> inhibitor N-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal inhibits this ligand-induced degradation and , in agreement with previous studies , stabilizes a hyperphosphorylated form of the <START:ggp> human I kappa B alpha protein <END> . 
By expressing mutant forms of the human protein in this <START:ana> cell line <END> , we have been able to delineate the sequences responsible for both the ligand-induced phosphorylation and the degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
Our results show that deletion of the <START:ggp> C terminus <END> of the <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> molecule up to <START:ggp> amino acid 279 <END> abolishes constitutive but not ligand-inducible phosphorylation and inhibits ligand-inducible degradation . 
Further analysis reveals that the inducible phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> maps to two serines in the <START:ggp> N terminus <END> of the protein ( residues 32 and 36 ) and that the mutation of either residue is sufficient to abolish ligand-induced degradation , whereas both residues must be mutated to abolish inducible phosphorylation of the protein . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
<START:ggp> Microtubules <END> mediate cellular 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 trafficking and the genomic response to 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in normal <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
The genomic actions of 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) are mediated by the intracellular <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) . 
Although immunocytochemistry has shown that disruption of microtubular assembly prevents nuclear access of the <START:ggp> sterol-VDR complex <END> , the role of <START:ggp> microtubules <END> in the response to 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 has not been studied in <START:ana> viable cells <END> . 
Our studies examined this interaction in normal <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Monocytes convert 25 ( OH ) D3 to 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 and to 24-hydroxylated metabolites more polar than 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . 
Microtubule disruption totally abolished the ability of exogenous 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 to suppress its own synthesis and to induce <START:ana> 24-hydroxylase mRNA <END> and activity , without affecting either total 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 uptake or maximal 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 <START:ggp> -VDR <END> binding . 
Thus , intact <START:ggp> microtubules <END> are essential for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3-dependent modulation of gene transcription . 
Interestingly , <START:ggp> microtubule <END> disruption also decreased <START:ana> monocyte <END> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 synthesis , not by decreasing the Vmax of <START:ggp> monocyte mitochondrial 1 alpha-hydroxylase <END> but through an increase in the Km for 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . 
We examined 25 ( OH ) D3 transport . 
Microtubule disruption did not affect total cellular 25 ( OH ) D3 uptake but reduced its intracellular trafficking to the mitochondria . 
Thus , <START:ggp> microtubules <END> participate in intracellular 25 ( OH ) D3 transport , and their integrity determines normal 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 synthesis . 
Relationship between <START:ggp> Rap1 protein <END> phosphorylation and regulation of Ca2+ transport in <START:ana> platelets <END> : a new approach . 
Although the interrelationship between the two messengers Ca2+ and cyclic AMP in platelet function is well documented , its mechanism of action still remains to be established . 
We investigated here the question of the regulation of <START:ggp> platelet Ca ( 2+ ) -ATPases <END> by cyclic AMP through the phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> Rap1 protein <END> using a pathological model . 
We first found experimental conditions where Ca ( 2+ ) -transport by platelet membrane vesicles appeared to be dependent on the phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> Rap1 protein <END> . 
Then , we studied <START:ana> platelets <END> of patients with congestive heart failure for their expression of the potential <START:ggp> 97 kDa Ca ( 2+ ) -ATPase target <END> of regulation through the <START:ggp> Rap1 protein <END> as well as the phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> Rap1 protein <END> using the <START:ggp> catalytic subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> C. Sub . <END> ) . 
In the first patients studied , we found no significant modification in the expression of the <START:ggp> 97 kDa Ca ( 2+ ) -ATPase <END> by Western blotting using the <START:ggp> PL/IM 430 monoclonal antibody <END> which specifically recognized this isoform . 
In contrast , the <START:ggp> Rap1 protein <END> was differentially phosphorylated when using 15 micrograms/ml of the <START:ggp> C. Sub . <END> 
These results allowed us to use these pathological <START:ana> platelets <END> to study the relationship between the expression of <START:ggp> Rap1 protein <END> and the regulation of Ca2+ transport by selecting a patient with severe heart failure . 
We could show a decrease in the expression as well as in the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Rap1 protein <END> and demonstrate a lower effect of <START:ggp> C. Sub . <END> on Ca2+ transport . 
Finally , by studying a further series of patients , we could confirm that the decrease in <START:ggp> Rap1 protein <END> expression in heart failure , whatever its extent , was variable , and could strictly correlate the expression of <START:ggp> Rap1 protein <END> with the stimulatory effect of <START:ggp> C. Sub . <END> on Ca2+ transport . 
Besides the evidence for regulation of the expression of the <START:ggp> Rap1 protein <END> in <START:ana> platelets <END> from patients with heart failure , these findings constitute a new approach in favour of the regulation of platelet Ca2+ transport through the phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> Rap1 protein <END> . 
An <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> -dependent pathway of DNA damage-induced apoptosis in <START:ana> mitogen-activated T lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ana> Lymphocytes <END> are particularly susceptible to DNA damage-induced apoptosis , a response which may serve as a form of 'altruistic suicide ' to counter their intrinsic high potential for mutation and clonal expansion . 
The <START:ggp> tumour suppressor p53 <END> has been shown to regulate this type of apoptosis in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> , but an as yet unknown , <START:ggp> p53 <END> -independent pathway ( s ) appears to mediate the same event in <START:ana> mitogen-activated mature T lymphocytes <END> . 
Here we show DNA damage-induced apoptosis in these <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> is dependent on the <START:ggp> antioncogenic transcription factor interferon regulatory factor <END> <START:ggp> ( IRF ) -1 <END> . 
Thus two different <START:ggp> anti-onco-genic transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> p53 <END> and <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> , are required for distinct apoptotic pathways in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
We also show that mitogen induction of the <START:ggp> interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme ( ICE ) gene <END> , a <START:ggp> mammalian homologue <END> of the <START:ggp> Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene <END> <START:ggp> ced-3 <END> , is <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> -dependent . 
Ectopic overexpression of <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> results in the activation of the <START:ggp> endogenous gene <END> for <START:ggp> ICE <END> and enhances the sensitivity of cells to radiation-induced apoptosis . 
Circadian rhythm of <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> in <START:ana> human peripheral leukocytes <END> and their reactivity to glucocorticoids . 
1 ) There exists a CR of <START:ggp> GR <END> in <START:ana> human leukocytes <END> , <START:ana> PMN <END> , and <START:ana> monocytes <END> with the peak values from 0400 to 0800 hr and the trough values between 2300 and 0000 hr . 
The difference between them was significant statistically . 
2 ) The FI of the chemotactic migration rate of <START:ana> PMN <END> by cortisol also showed diurnal changes which were synchronous with that of <START:ggp> GR <END> . 
This indicates that the CR of <START:ggp> GR <END> may be of functional significance . 
3 ) In Cushing 's syndrome , the CR of <START:ggp> GR <END> was normal in spite of the fact that the CR of plasma cortisol was disturbed . 
This indicates the independency of the CR of <START:ggp> GR <END> from that of cortisol . 
4 ) In apoplexy caused by brain ischemia , the CR of <START:ggp> GR <END> was abolished in patients with basal lesions but preserved when the lesions were located in the cerebral cortex . 
These results strongly suggest that the main `` circadian pacemaker '' of <START:ggp> GR <END> is located in the basal brain , most probably in the suprachiasmatic nuclei as has been suggested for rodents . 
<START:ana> B-lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> from multiple sclerosis patients and a healthy control producing a putative new human retrovirus and Epstein-Barr virus . 
On several occasions we have observed retrovirus-like particles ( RVLPs ) by transmission electron microscopy ( EM ) of <START:ana> cultured T cells <END> from a patient with MS . 
Later we established spontaneously formed <START:ana> B-lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> ( <START:ana> LCLs <END> ) from a patient with an MS-like disease and from another patient with MS who had a reactivated Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection . 
Both <START:ana> LCLs <END> were found by EM to produce RVLP and EBV particles . 
Reverse transcriptase ( RT ) assays were positive in purified viral material from both <START:ana> LCLs <END> . 
To substantiate these findings we initiated an intensified culturing procedure and were able to establish <START:ana> LCLs <END> from 5 out of 21 consecutive MS patients and 1 out of 13 consecutive healthy controls . 
All <START:ana> LCLs <END> were found to produce both RVLP and EBV particles by EM . 
Whether the putative new retrovirus ( es ) and EBV have any causal relationship to MS is still not known , but the findings support this possibility . 
Identification of an <START:ggp> ionomycin/cyclosporin A-responsive element <END> within the <START:ggp> human T cell receptor gamma enhancer <END> . 
Activation through the Ca2+/ <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> pathway is essential to the transcription of many <START:ggp> cytokine genes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> conserved cis-acting sequence <END> , GGAAAA , and <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> binding to this sequence are involved in the response to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations . 
Here we report the identification and importance of the same sequence in a <START:ggp> non-cytokine gene <END> , the <START:ggp> human T cell receptor gamma ( TCRG ) enhancer <END> . 
Results from site-directed mutations and electrophoretic mobility shift assays strongly suggest that this sequence mediates the ionomycin-induced activation of the <START:ggp> TCRG enhancer <END> . 
Our studies provide an explanation for a previous observation that <START:ana> TCRG mRNA <END> levels , but not mRNA levels for <START:ggp> T cell receptor alpha and -beta <END> , are increased by ionomycin treatment . 
Coexpression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> in human immunodeficiency virus 1-induced , dendritic cell-T-cell syncytia . 
Productive infection of <START:ana> T cells <END> with human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) typically requires that the <START:ana> T cells <END> be stimulated with antigens or mitogens . 
This requirement has been attributed to the activation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , which synergizes with the <START:ggp> constitutive transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> to drive the <START:ggp> HIV-1 promoter <END> . 
Recently , we have found that vigorous replication of HIV-1 takes place in nonactivated <START:ana> memory T cells <END> after syncytium formation with <START:ana> dendritic cells <END> ( <START:ana> DCs <END> ) . 
These syncytia lack <START:ana> activated cells <END> as determined by an absence of staining for Ki-67 cell cycle antigen . 
The expression and activity of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> were , therefore , analyzed in isolated <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> DCs <END> from humans and mice . 
We have used immunolabeling , Western blot analysis , and electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays . 
<START:ana> T cells <END> lack active <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> but express <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> as expected . 
<START:ana> DCs <END> express high levels of all known <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> Rel proteins <END> , with activity residing primarily within <START:ggp> RelB <END> , <START:ggp> p50 <END> , and <START:ggp> p65 <END> . 
However , <START:ana> DCs <END> lack <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> , which may explain the failure of HIV-1 to replicate in purified <START:ana> DCs <END> . 
Coexpression of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> occurs in the <START:ana> heterologous DC-T-cell syncytia <END> that are induced by HIV-1 . 
Therefore , HIV-1-induced cell fusion brings together factors that upregulate virus transcription . 
Since <START:ana> DCs <END> and memory <START:ana> T cells <END> frequently traffic together in situ , these unusual <START:ana> heterologous syncytia <END> could develop in infected individuals and lead to chronic HIV-1 replication without ostensible immune stimulation . 
Cupric ion blocks <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> activation through inhibiting the signal-induced phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
A <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> , which regulates expression of various cellular genes involved in immune responses and <START:ggp> viral genes <END> including HIV , is sequestered in the cytoplasm as a complex with an <START:ggp> inhibitory protein I kappa B <END> . 
Various extracellular signals induce phosphorylation and rapid degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> to release <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> . 
Cu2+ was found to inhibit the activation of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> induced by <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , TPA , or H2O2 . 
Deoxycholate treatment of the cytoplasmic extract prepared from cells stimulated by <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> in the presence of Cu2+ resulted in the release of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> from <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> , indicating that Cu2+ interferes with the dissociation of the <START:ggp> NF kappa B-I kappa B complex <END> . 
Neither phosphorylation nor degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> was observed upon <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> stimulation in the presence of Cu2+ . 
These results indicate that Cu2+ inhibits the release of <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> by blockade of a signal leading to the phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
Cloning a <START:ggp> cDNA <END> from human <START:ana> NK/T cells <END> which codes for a protein with high proline content . 
A <START:ggp> cDNA clone <END> , <START:ggp> B4-2 <END> , was isolated from a <START:ggp> natural killer ( NK ) minus T cell subtractive library <END> . 
The <START:ggp> B4-2 <END> clone coded for an <START:ana> mRNA <END> of 2061 bp in length . 
It encodes a deduced <START:ggp> 327 aa protein <END> with a calculated molecular mass of 35.2 kDa . 
Searching of <START:ggp> B4-2 DNA <END> and protein sequences against various databases revealed no high homology to other sequences . 
However , <START:ggp> B4-2 <END> has an unusually high proline content ( 13 % ) , contains a putative <START:ggp> nuclear targeting sequence <END> , and has several <START:ggp> SPXX motifs <END> which are frequently found in <START:ggp> gene regulatory proteins <END> . 
One of the stretches of prolines in <START:ggp> B4-2 <END> closely resembles the ligand for proteins with <START:ggp> SH3 domains <END> . 
Northern hybridization data showed that <START:ggp> B4-2 <END> is not a <START:ggp> lymphoid specific gene <END> and is expressed in a <START:ana> hepatoma cell line <END> and also weakly transcribed or absent in a variety of other cells . 
A polyclonal antiserum raised against <START:ggp> recombinant B4-2 <END> recognizes a <START:ggp> 32-34 kDa protein <END> in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> . 
Activation of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> , but not <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> , is critical for <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced proliferation and <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> recruitment by a <START:ggp> COOH-terminal region <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor beta-chain <END> . 
A number of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and <START:ggp> growth factors <END> use the <START:ggp> JAK <END> <START:ggp> -STAT <END> pathway to signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus . 
While <START:ggp> homodimerizing cytokine receptors <END> may transmit signal via a single form of <START:ggp> JAK <END> ( i.e . <START:ggp> growth hormone receptors <END> ) , several <START:ggp> multicomponent cytokine receptors <END> have been shown to require simultaneous activation of pairs of different <START:ggp> JAK kinases <END> ( i.e . <START:ggp> interferon receptors <END> ) . 
Recent evidence for a preferential coupling of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> to <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptor-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2R gamma <END> ) and <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> to <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> supports the concept of heterotrans-activation of <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> caused by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced heterodimerization of their receptor partners . 
The present study verified the ability of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> to cause tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> , but demonstrated that <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> stimulated <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> to a significantly larger extent than <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> in <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> and the <START:ana> YT cell line <END> . 
This conclusion was based upon several independent criteria , including more vigorous tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> , more marked enzymatic activation of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> as well as higher abundance of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> in activated <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor complexes <END> . 
Furthermore , when <START:ggp> human IL-2R beta <END> was stably expressed in <START:ana> murine BA/F3 cells <END> , robust <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced proliferation and <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> activation occurred without detectable involvement of either <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> , <START:ggp> JAK2 <END> or <START:ggp> TYK2 <END> . 
We therefore propose that <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor <END> signal transduction does not depend on equimolar heterodimerization of <START:ggp> JAK1 <END> and <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> following <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -induced heterodimerization of <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2R gamma <END> . 
Nonetheless , a <START:ggp> membrane-proximal region <END> of human <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> ( <START:ggp> Asn240-Leu335 <END> ) was critical for <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> activation , and the amount of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> present in activated <START:ggp> IL-2 receptor complexes <END> increased with time , suggesting that stabilization of <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> binding to the <START:ggp> receptor complex <END> relies on both <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2R gamma <END> . 
Moreover , <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> was found to be the predominant <START:ggp> STAT transcription factor <END> used by <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> in <START:ana> human T cells <END> , and specifically required a <START:ggp> COOH-terminal region <END> of <START:ggp> IL-2R beta <END> ( <START:ggp> Ser386-Val525 <END> ) , while <START:ggp> STAT5 <END> recruitment was not correlated to activation of <START:ggp> IL-2R gamma <END> or <START:ggp> JAK3 <END> . 
Up-regulation of high-affinity dehydroepiandrosterone binding activity by dehydroepiandrosterone in activated <START:ana> human T lymphocytes <END> . 
Although evidence indicates that dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) exerts direct physiological effects , its mechanism of action remains unknown . 
DHEA binding sites were examined using a whole-cell binding assay in a <START:ana> human T lymphoid cell line <END> , <START:ana> PEER <END> , revealing that a single class of high-affinity binding sites for DHEA ( dissociation constant = 7.4 +/- 0.53 nmol/L , mean +/- SE , n = 4 ) was greatly increased when treated with DHEA , phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate , and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 . 
Bound [ 3H ] DHEA was displaced sensitively by DHEA and secondarily by dihydrotestosterone , but not effectively by other steroids , including DHEA sulfate . 
These results not only indicate the existence of a <START:ggp> DHEA receptor <END> , but also suggest that <START:ana> T cells <END> become susceptible to regulation by DHEA during the process of signal-induced activation . 
Ubiquitin-mediated processing of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> transcriptional activator precursor <END> <START:ggp> p105 <END> . 
Reconstitution of a cell-free system and identification of the <START:ggp> ubiquitin-carrier protein <END> , <START:ggp> E2 <END> , and a novel <START:ggp> ubiquitin-protein ligase <END> , <START:ggp> E3 <END> , involved in conjugation . 
In most cases , the <START:ggp> transcriptional factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> is a <START:ggp> heterodimer <END> consisting of two subunits , <START:ggp> p50 <END> and <START:ggp> p65 <END> , which are encoded by two distinct genes of the <START:ggp> Rel family <END> . 
<START:ggp> p50 <END> is translated as a precursor of <START:ggp> 105 kDa <END> . 
The <START:ggp> C-terminal domain <END> of the precursor is rapidly degraded , forming the <START:ggp> mature p50 subunit <END> consisted of the <START:ggp> N-terminal region <END> of the molecule . 
The mechanism of generation of <START:ggp> p50 <END> is not known . 
It has been suggested that the <START:ggp> ubiquitin <END> <START:ggp> -proteasome <END> system is involved in the process ; however , the specific <START:ggp> enzymes <END> involved and the mechanism of limited proteolysis , in which half of the molecule is spared , have been obscure . 
Palombella and colleagues ( Palombella , V.J. , Rando , O.J. , Goldberg , A.L. , and Maniatis , T. ( 1994 ) Cell 78 , 773-785 ) have shown that <START:ggp> ubiquitin <END> is required for the processing in a cell-free system of a truncated , artificially constructed , <START:ggp> 60-kDa precursor <END> . 
They have also shown that <START:ggp> proteasome <END> inhibitors block the processing both in vitro and in vivo . 
In this study , we demonstrate reconstitution of a cell-free processing system and demonstrate directly that : ( a ) the <START:ggp> ubiquitin <END> <START:ggp> -proteasome <END> system is involved in processing of the intact <START:ggp> p105 <END> precursor , ( b ) conjugation of <START:ggp> ubiquitin <END> to the precursor is an essential intermediate step in the processing , ( c ) the recently discovered novel species of the <START:ggp> ubiquitin-carrier protein <END> , <START:ggp> E2-F1 <END> , that is involved in the conjugation and degradation of <START:ggp> p53 <END> , is also required for the limited processing of the <START:ggp> p105 precursor <END> , and ( d ) a novel , approximately <START:ggp> 320-kDa species <END> of <START:ggp> ubiquitin-protein ligase <END> , is involved in the process . 
This novel enzyme is distinct from <START:ggp> E6-AP <END> , the <START:ggp> p53-conjugating ligase <END> , and from <START:ggp> E3 alpha <END> , the <START:ggp> `` N-end rule '' ligase <END> . 
Flutamide in the treatment of hirsutism : long-term clinical effects , endocrine changes , and <START:ggp> androgen receptor <END> behavior . 
OBJECTIVE : To investigate the long-term effects of treatment with low doses of flutamide on clinical and hormonal parameters , as well as on the <START:ggp> androgen receptor <END> status , in hirsute women . 
DESIGN : Eighteen hirsute patients with regular menses were studied basally and during treatment with 125 mg flutamide , three times per day for 12 months . 
Barrier or intrauterine contraception was used during the study in sexually active women . 
Safety parameters were assessed throughout the study . 
Hirsutism , graded by the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score , and hormonal parameters were evaluated basally and at 4-month intervals during treatment . 
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and ACTH stimulation tests were performed before and after 3 to 4 months of therapy . 
In addition , the concentration of <START:ggp> androgen receptors <END> in <START:ana> mononuclear leukocytes <END> was measured , in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle , basally and after 4 months of flutamide treatment . 
RESULTS : Flutamide was well tolerated in all women , with the noticeable exception of one patient who presented increased <START:ggp> serum transaminase <END> after 8 months of therapy . 
Hirsutism markedly improved in all women during the treatment ( Ferriman-Gallwey score after 1 year : 4.1 +/- 0.5 versus 14.1 +/- 0.9 ) . 
A reduction of serum androgens was found , whereas no change was observed in either basal or GnRH-stimulated gonadotropins or in the cortisol and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone response to ACTH . 
Cycles remained ovulatory . 
Before treatment , the number of <START:ggp> androgen receptors <END> was higher in the luteal than in the follicular phase . 
This rhythmic differentiation disappeared after the patients had been given the antiandrogen drug . 
CONCLUSIONS : Flutamide is effective in the treatment of hirsutism but requires constant surveillance of liver function . 
Androgen receptor blockade might be potentiated by a reduction of serum androgens . 
Flutamide affects <START:ggp> androgen receptor <END> behavior during the menstrual cycle . 
The meaning of this finding remains to be elucidated . 
Constitutive expression of <START:ggp> HIV-1 tat protein <END> in <START:ana> human Jurkat T cells <END> using a BK virus vector . 
The production and characterization of <START:ana> Jurkat cell lines <END> that constitutively express functional <START:ggp> human immune deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) tat protein <END> , using a BK virus plasmid expression vector and <START:ggp> HIV-1 tat cDNA <END> , is described . 
An increased growth rate of these <START:ana> Jurkat-tat cell lines <END> as compared with <START:ana> control cell lines <END> was observed . 
A <START:ggp> PEBP2 alpha/AML-1-related factor <END> increases <START:ggp> osteocalcin promoter <END> activity through its binding to an <START:ggp> osteoblast-specific cis-acting element <END> . 
To identify <START:ggp> osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements <END> and <START:ggp> trans-acting factors <END> , we initiated an analysis of the <START:ggp> promoter <END> of a <START:ggp> mouse osteocalcin gene <END> , an <START:ggp> osteoblast-specific gene <END> . 
In this promoter , we identified two <START:ggp> osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements <END> ( Ducy , P.and Karsenty , G. ( 1995 ) Mol.Cell.Biol.15 , 1858-1869 ) . 
The sequence of one of these <START:ggp> elements <END> , OSE2 , is identical to the <START:ggp> DNA-binding site <END> of the <START:ggp> PEBP2 alpha/AML-1 transcription factors <END> , the <START:ggp> mammalian homologues <END> of the <START:ggp> Drosophila Runt protein <END> . 
Here we show , using nuclear extracts , <START:ggp> recombinant protein <END> , and a specific antiserum against <START:ggp> AML-1 proteins <END> in DNA-binding assays , that one member of this family , <START:ggp> AML-1B <END> , binds specifically to OSE2 and is immunologically related to <START:ggp> OSF2 <END> , the factor present in osteoblast nuclear extracts that binds to OSE2 . 
By DNA cotransfection experiments , we also demonstrate that <START:ggp> AML-1B <END> can increase the activity of a short <START:ggp> osteocalcin promoter <END> through its binding to OSE2 . 
Lastly , the different mobilities of <START:ggp> osteoblast nuclear extract-DNA complexes <END> compared with <START:ggp> T-cell nuclear extract-DNA complexes <END> , along with the inability of <START:ggp> OSF2 <END> to be upregulated by retinoic acid , unlike the other <START:ggp> PEBP2 alpha factors <END> , suggest that <START:ggp> OSF2 <END> is a new member of this family of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Thus , this study demonstrates that <START:ggp> AML-1B <END> can increase gene expression of an <START:ggp> osteoblast-specific gene <END> through its binding to an <START:ggp> osteoblast-specific cis-acting element <END> and presents evidence that <START:ggp> OSF2 <END> is a member of the <START:ggp> PEBP2 alpha/AML-1 family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
<START:ggp> Initiation binding repressor <END> , a factor that binds to the <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> of the <START:ggp> histone h5 gene <END> , is a <START:ggp> glycosylated member <END> of a family of <START:ggp> cell growth regulators <END> [ corrected ] [ published erratum appears in Mol Cell Biol 1996 Feb ; 16 ( 2 ) : 735 ] 
<START:ggp> Initiation binding repressor <END> [ corrected ] ( <START:ggp> IBR <END> ) is a <START:ggp> chicken erythrocyte factor <END> ( apparent molecular mass , 70 to 73 kDa ) that binds to the sequences spanning the <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> of the <START:ggp> histone h5 gene <END> , repressing its transcription . 
A variety of other cells , including <START:ana> transformed erythroid precursors <END> , do not have <START:ggp> IBR <END> but a factor referred to as <START:ggp> IBF <END> ( 68 to 70 kDa ) that recognizes the same <START:ggp> IBR <END> sites . 
We have cloned the <START:ggp> IBR cDNA <END> and studied the relationship of <START:ggp> IBR <END> and <START:ggp> IBF <END> . 
<START:ggp> IBR <END> is a <START:ggp> 503-amino-acid-long acidic protein <END> which is 99.0 % identical to the recently reported <START:ggp> human NRF-1/alpha-Pal factor <END> and highly related to the invertebrate <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> P3A2 <END> and <START:ggp> erected wing gene product <END> ( <START:ggp> EWG <END> ) . 
We present evidence that <START:ggp> IBR <END> and <START:ggp> IBF <END> are most likely identical proteins , differing in their degree of glycosylation . 
We have analyzed several molecular aspects of <START:ggp> IBR/F <END> and shown that the factor associates as stable <START:ggp> homodimers <END> and that the <START:ggp> dimer <END> is the <START:ggp> relevant DNA-binding species <END> . 
The evolutionarily conserved <START:ggp> N-terminal half <END> of <START:ggp> IBR/F <END> harbors the <START:ggp> DNA-binding/dimerization domain <END> ( outer limits , 127 to 283 ) , one or several <START:ggp> casein kinase II sites <END> ( 37 to 67 ) , and a <START:ggp> bipartite nuclear localization signal <END> ( 89 to 106 ) which appears to be necessary for nuclear targeting . 
Binding site selection revealed that the <START:ggp> alternating RCGCRYGCGY consensus <END> constitutes high-affinity <START:ggp> IBR/F binding sites <END> and that the <START:ggp> direct-repeat palindrome <END> TGCGCATGCGCA is the <START:ggp> optimal site <END> . 
A survey of <START:ggp> genes <END> potentially regulated by this family of <START:ggp> factors <END> primarily revealed <START:ggp> genes <END> involved in growth-related metabolism . 
Triggering of the human interleukin-6 gene by interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in monocytic cells involves cooperation between <START:ggp> interferon regulatory factor-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> , and <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
We investigated the molecular basis of the synergistic induction by <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> ) / <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) of <START:ggp> human interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) gene <END> in <START:ana> THP-1 monocytic cells <END> , and compared it with the basis of this induction by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . 
Functional studies with <START:ggp> IL-6 promoter <END> demonstrated that three regions are the targets of the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and/or <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> action , whereas only one of these regions seemed to be implicated in LPS activation . 
The three regions concerned are : 1 ) a region between -73 and -36 , which is the <START:ggp> minimal element <END> inducible by LPS or <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ; 2 ) an element located between -181 and -73 , which appeared to regulate the response to <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> negatively ; and 3 ) a <START:ggp> distal element upstream <END> of -224 , which was inducible by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> alone . 
LPS signaling was found to involve <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> activation by the <START:ggp> p50/p65 heterodimers <END> . 
Synergistic induction of the <START:ggp> IL-6 gene <END> by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> , involved cooperation between the <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF kappa B p65 homodimers <END> with concomitant removal of the negative effect of the <START:ggp> retinoblastoma control element <END> present in the <START:ggp> IL-6 promoter <END> . 
This removal occurred by activation of the <START:ggp> constitutive Sp1 factor <END> , whose increased binding activity and phosphorylation were mediated by <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> . 
Mutation of <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> in a patient with SCID : essential role of <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> in lymphoid development . 
Males with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) have defects in the common <START:ggp> cytokine receptor gamma chain ( gamma c ) gene <END> that encodes a shared , essential component of the receptors of <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) , <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-7 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-15 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> Janus family tyrosine kinase <END> <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> is the only signaling molecule known to be associated with <START:ggp> gamma c <END> , so it was hypothesized that defects in <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> might cause an XSCID-like phenotype . 
A girl with immunological features indistinguishable from those of XSCID was therefore selected for analysis . 
An <START:ana> Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -transformed cell line <END> derived from her <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> had normal <START:ggp> gamma c <END> expression but lacked <START:ggp> Jak3 protein <END> and had greatly diminished <START:ana> Jak3 messenger RNA <END> . 
Sequencing revealed a different mutation on each allele : a single nucleotide insertion resulting in a frame shift and premature termination in the <START:ggp> Jak3 JH4 domain <END> and a nonsense mutation in the <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> JH2 domain . 
The lack of <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> expression correlated with impaired B cell signaling , as demonstrated by the inability of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> to activate <START:ggp> Stat6 <END> in the <START:ana> EBV-transformed cell line <END> from the patient. These observations indicate that the functions of <START:ggp> gamma c <END> are dependent on <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> and that <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> is essential for lymphoid development and signaling . 
Constitutive overexpression of the <START:ggp> L-selectin gene <END> in fresh <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> of adult T-cell leukemia that can be transactivated by <START:ggp> human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax <END> . 
<START:ggp> L-selectin <END> is an adhesion molecule of the selectin family that mediates the initial step of leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium . 
Upon cellular activation , expression of the <START:ggp> L-selectin gene <END> is downregulated at both the protein and mRNA levels . 
To understand the mechanism of <START:ana> leukemic cell <END> infiltration into organs , we studied the expression and regulation of <START:ana> L-selectin mRNA <END> in fresh <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> of adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) patients and investigated the response of the <START:ggp> L-selectin promoter <END> to <START:ggp> human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax <END> , which is a <START:ggp> viral transcriptional transactivator <END> . 
Flow cytometry showed that <START:ggp> L-selectin <END> was expressed on fresh <START:ana> ATL cells <END> along with other <START:ggp> activation antigens <END> . 
Northern blot analysis showed that <START:ana> ATL cells <END> overexpressed that <START:ana> L-selectin mRNA <END> and that the level was aberrantly upregulated after PMA stimulation . 
Studies using in situ hybridization showed expression of the <START:ana> L-selectin mRNA <END> in the infiltrating <START:ana> leukemic cells <END> in the liver of two ATL patients . 
Intravenous injection of a <START:ana> rat T-cell line <END> that overexpresses <START:ggp> L-selectin <END> showed increased organ infiltration . 
The induction of <START:ggp> Tax <END> expression in <START:ana> JPX9 cells <END> resulted in about a twofold increase in the <START:ana> mRNA <END> expression levels compared with the basal level . 
<START:ggp> Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase <END> ( <START:ggp> CAT <END> ) assay after transient cotransfection showed about a fivefold transactivation of the <START:ggp> L-selectin promoter <END> by <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
The serum level of the shed form of <START:ggp> L-selectin <END> was significantly increased in ATL patients ( mean +/- SD , 4 , 215.4 +/- 4 , 111 ng/mL ) compared with those of asymptomatic carriers and healthy blood donors ( mean +/- SD , 1 , 148.0 +/- 269.0 ng/mL and 991.9 +/- 224 ng/mL , respectively ) . 
These results indicated that <START:ana> ATL cells <END> constitutively overexpress the <START:ggp> L-selectin gene <END> that can be transactivated by HTLV-1 <START:ggp> Tax <END> . 
The overexpression of <START:ggp> L-selectin <END> , as well as of <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> , by <START:ana> ATL cells <END> may provide a basis for <START:ana> ATL cells <END> to attach the vascular endothelium , leading to transmigration and organ infitration . 
Human herpesvirus 6 variant A , but not variant B , infects <START:ana> EBV-positive B lymphoid cells <END> , activating the <START:ggp> latent EBV genome <END> through a <START:ggp> BZLF-1 <END> -dependent mechanism . 
Human herpesvirus 6 , a predominantly T lymphotropic virus , has been recently shown to infect some <START:ana> EBV-positive B cell lines <END> , and to induce in them the activation of the EBV lytic cycle . 
Here we have confirmed and extended such observations , showing that ( 1 ) this phenomenon is restricted to the variant A of HHV-6 : in fact two isolates belonging to the HHV-6 variant B ( BA92 and Z29 ) were neither able to infect any <START:ana> B cell line <END> , independently of the EBV status , nor to induce the EBV genome expression . 
The only exception is represented by the <START:ana> P3HR1 cells <END> , in which , however , the infection by the variant B does not determine induction of <START:ggp> EBV antigens <END> ; ( 2 ) the presence of the <START:ggp> EBV genome <END> contributes to the susceptibility of the <START:ana> B cell lines <END> to HHV-6 infection , increasing the binding sites and the percentage of <START:ana> infectable cells <END> , as detected by immunoelectron microscopy ; and ( 3 ) <START:ana> HHV-6 infected T cells <END> , transfected with <START:ggp> plasmids <END> bearing the <START:ggp> promoter regions <END> of the EBV early genes BZLF1 and <START:ggp> BMRF1 <END> , show a strong transactivation of these <START:ggp> promoters <END> . 
Evidence for normal <START:ana> vitamin D receptor messenger ribonucleic acid <END> and genotype in absorptive hypercalciuria . 
Absorptive hypercalciuria ( a stone-forming condition ) is characterized by gut hyperabsorption of calcium , hypercalciuria , and reduced bone density . 
Inasmuch as these features implicate enhanced calcitriol action in gut and bone , we analyzed the <START:ggp> vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) gene <END> to ascertain whether an abnormality of this gene marks patients with intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium . 
We have compared the frequency of a <START:ggp> restriction fragment length polymorphism <END> ( Bsm I ) associated with different alleles of the <START:ggp> VDR gene <END> in a group of 33 well characterized absorptive hypercalciuric patients and a group of 36 normal race- and age-matched control subjects . 
There was no difference between the distribution of the <START:ggp> VDR <END> alleles in the patient population when compared with the normal population . 
The coding region of <START:ana> VDR messenger RNA <END> was also normal , as determined by both <START:ggp> DNA sequence <END> analysis and chemical mismatch cleavage analysis of copy DNA from 11 index absorptive hypercalciuric patients . 
On the basis of these results , we propose that the enhanced intestinal calcium absorption invariably seen in absorptive hypercalciuria and attendant symptoms of this disorder are not attributable to mutations of the <START:ggp> VDR <END> and are not linked to a common <START:ggp> VDR genotype <END> . 
Transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding the <START:ggp> human C-type lectin leukocyte receptor <END> <START:ggp> AIM/CD69 <END> and functional characterization of its <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha-responsive elements <END> . 
The <START:ggp> human activation antigen <END> <START:ggp> CD69 <END> is a member of the <START:ggp> C-type animal lectin superfamily <END> that functions as a <START:ggp> signal-transmitting receptor <END> . 
Although the expression of <START:ggp> CD69 <END> can be induced in vitro on cells of most hematopoietic lineages with a wide variety of stimuli , in vivo it is mainly expressed by <START:ana> T-lymphocytes <END> located in the inflammatory infiltrates of several human diseases . 
To elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the constitutive and inducible expression of <START:ggp> CD69 <END> by <START:ana> leukocytes <END> , we isolated the <START:ggp> promoter region <END> of the <START:ggp> CD69 <END> gene and carried out its functional characterization . 
Sequence analysis of the <START:ggp> 5'-flanking region <END> of the <START:ggp> CD69 gene <END> revealed the presence of a potential <START:ggp> TATA element <END> <START:ggp> 30 base pairs upstream <END> of the major <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> and several putative binding sequences for inducible <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> Egr-1 <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) , which might mediate the inducible expression of this gene . 
Transient expression of <START:ggp> CD69 promoter-based reporter gene constructs <END> in <START:ana> K562 cells <END> indicated that the <START:ggp> proximal promoter region <END> spanning positions -78 to +16 contained the <START:ggp> cis-acting sequences <END> necessary for basal and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-inducible transcription of the <START:ggp> CD69 gene <END> . 
Removal of the upstream sequences located between positions -78 and -38 resulted in decreased promoter strength and abolished the response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate . 
We also found that <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> ( <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> ) is capable of inducing the surface expression of the <START:ggp> CD69 <END> molecule as well as the promoter activity of fusion plasmids that contain 5'-flanking sequences of the <START:ggp> CD69 <END> gene , suggesting that this cytokine may regulate in vivo the expression of <START:ggp> CD69 <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Characterization of <START:ggp> 5 ' end of human thromboxane receptor gene <END> . 
Organizational analysis and mapping of <START:ggp> protein kinase C -- responsive elements <END> regulating expression in <START:ana> platelets <END> . 
<START:ggp> Platelet thromboxane receptors <END> are acutely and reversibly upregulated after acute myocardial infarction . 
To determine if platelet <START:ggp> thromboxane receptors <END> are under transcriptional control , we isolated and characterized <START:ggp> human genomic DNA clones <END> containing the <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking region <END> of the <START:ggp> thromboxane receptor gene <END> . 
The <START:ggp> exon-intron structure <END> of the <START:ggp> 5 ' portion <END> of the <START:ggp> thromboxane receptor gene <END> was determined initially by comparing the <START:ggp> nucleotide sequence <END> of the <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking genomic clone <END> with that of a <START:ggp> novel human uterine thromboxane receptor cDNA <END> that extended the <START:ana> mRNA <END> <START:ggp> 141 bp further upstream <END> than the <START:ggp> previously identified human placental cDNA <END> . 
A major <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> was located in three human tissues approximately <START:ggp> 560 bp upstream <END> from the <START:ggp> translation initiation codon <END> and <START:ggp> 380 bp upstream <END> from any previously identified <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> . 
The <START:ggp> thromboxane receptor gene <END> has neither a <START:ggp> TATA <END> nor a <START:ggp> CAAT consensus site <END> . 
Promoter function of the <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking region <END> of the <START:ggp> thromboxane receptor gene <END> was evaluated by transfection of <START:ggp> thromboxane receptor gene promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) chimera plasmids <END> into platelet-like <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
Thromboxane <START:ggp> receptor promoter <END> activity , as assessed by <START:ggp> CAT <END> expression , was relatively weak but was significantly enhanced by phorbol ester treatment . 
Functional analysis of <START:ggp> 5 ' deletion constructs <END> in transfected <START:ana> K562 cells <END> and gel mobility shift localized the major phorbol ester-responsive motifs in the <START:ggp> thromboxane receptor gene <END> promoter to a cluster of <START:ggp> activator protein-2 ( AP-2 ) binding consensus sites <END> located approximately 1.8 kb 5 ' from the <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> . 
These studies are the first to determine the structure and organization of the 5 ' end of the <START:ggp> thromboxane receptor gene <END> and demonstrate that <START:ggp> thromboxane receptor gene <END> expression can be regulated by activation of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> via induction of an <START:ggp> AP-2-like nuclear factor <END> binding to <START:ggp> upstream promoter elements <END> . 
These findings strongly suggest that the mechanism for previously described upregulation of <START:ggp> platelet thromboxane receptors <END> after acute myocardial infarction is increased <START:ggp> thromboxane receptor gene <END> transcription in <START:ana> platelet-progenitor cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Estrogen receptor <END> concentration and social factors as predictors of natural killer cell activity in early-stage breast cancer patients . 
Confirmation of a model . 
Previous work of ours has demonstrated that a significant amount of natural killer ( NK ) activity variance after surgery in stage I and II breast cancer patients could be accounted for by both the <START:ggp> estrogen receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> ER <END> ) status of the tumor and by social factors , namely , perceived social support and seeking social support as a general coping strategy . 
As considerable evidence has accumulated that social support in both animal and human populations may have survival value , we sought to test the reliability of this regression model , using coping and perceived support factor values obtained at 3 months after surgery to account for concurrent follow-up NK activity in this serially assessed group of patients . 
It was found that the most significant variable predicting NK activity at follow-up was tumor <START:ggp> ER <END> concentration , with higher NK activity associated with <START:ggp> ER <END> -status . 
In addition , seeking social support as a coping strategy , as well as the perceived quality of support , also entered the model to account for a significant amount of NK activity variance ( multivariate F = 5.25 , p less than 0.001 ) . 
If , as the literature suggests , NK activity is relevant to breast cancer control , and since <START:ggp> ER <END> -tumors have a worse prognosis , we suggest here that perhaps such tumors are resistant to control by <START:ana> NK cells <END> because they lack the ability to attract an accumulation of <START:ana> effector cells <END> to the tumor site , or because blocking factors at the site of the tumor prevent local tumor control at the site of action . 
The finding related to social support also replicates results from an independent sample of breast cancer patients . 
This finding , taken together with other evidence that this social variable is associated with longer survival in breast cancer populations , underscores the potential importance of this social support variable . 
Our findings also suggest one possible immunological variable involved , with potential clinical significance , for this patient population . 
Solution structure of the <START:ggp> sequence-specific HMG box <END> of the <START:ggp> lymphocyte transcriptional activator <END> <START:ggp> Sox-4 <END> . 
Two groups of <START:ggp> HMG box proteins <END> are distinguished . 
Proteins in the first group contain multiple <START:ggp> HMG boxes <END> , are non-sequence-specific , and recognize structural features as found in <START:ggp> cruciform DNA <END> and <START:ggp> cross-over DNA <END> . 
The abundant <START:ggp> chromosomal protein <END> <START:ggp> HMG-1 <END> belongs to this subgroup . 
Proteins in the second group carry a <START:ggp> single HMG box <END> with affinity for the minor groove of the <START:ggp> heptamer motif <END> AACAAAG or variations thereof . 
A solution structure for the non-sequence-specific <START:ggp> C-terminal HMG box <END> of <START:ggp> HMG-1 <END> has recently been proposed . 
Now , we report the solution structure of the <START:ggp> sequence-specific HMG-box <END> of the <START:ggp> SRY-related protein <END> <START:ggp> Sox-4 <END> . 
NMR analysis demonstrated the presence of three <START:ggp> alpha-helices <END> ( <START:ggp> Val10-Gln22 <END> , <START:ggp> Glu30-Leu41 <END> and <START:ggp> Phe50-Tyr65 <END> ) connected by <START:ggp> loop regions <END> ( <START:ggp> Ser23-Ala49 <END> and <START:ggp> Leu42-Pro49 <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> Helices I and II <END> are positioned in an <START:ggp> antiparallel mode <END> and form one arm of the <START:ggp> HMG box <END> . 
<START:ggp> Helix III <END> is less rigid , makes an average angle of about 90 degrees with <START:ggp> helices I and II <END> , and constitutes the other arm of the molecule . 
As in <START:ggp> HMG1B <END> , the overall structure of the <START:ggp> Sox-4 <END> <START:ggp> HMG box <END> is L-shaped and is maintained by a cluster of conserved , mainly aromatic residues . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor-IL6 <END> activates the <START:ggp> human IL-4 promoter <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Positive regulatory element I <END> ( <START:ggp> PRE-I <END> ) is a strong <START:ggp> enhancer element <END> essential for expression of the <START:ggp> human IL-4 gene <END> . 
To identify <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> binding to <START:ggp> PRE-I <END> , we screened a <START:ggp> cDNA expression library <END> from <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> and isolated a <START:ggp> cDNA <END> encoding <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> <START:ggp> ( NF ) -IL6 <END> ( also known as <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> ) . 
<START:ana> NF-IL6 mRNA <END> was found in <START:ana> human Jurkat T cells <END> and in the <START:ana> mouse Th2 clone <END> <START:ana> D10 <END> , but not in <START:ana> Th1 clone 29 <END> . 
<START:ggp> rNF-IL6 <END> expressed in bacteria was shown to specifically bind to <START:ggp> PRE-I <END> . 
<START:ggp> PRE-I <END> forms <START:ggp> multiple DNA-protein complexes <END> with nuclear extracts from <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
Some of these complexes were demonstrated to contain <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> by using <START:ggp> anti-C/EBP beta Abs <END> . 
Overexpression of <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> enhanced expression of the <START:ggp> chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene <END> linked to the <START:ggp> PRE-I-thymidine kinase <END> or the <START:ggp> human IL-4 promoter <END> more than 10-fold in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> . 
Promoter deletion studies revealed two additional <START:ggp> NF-IL6 binding sites <END> located at positions -44 to -36 ( <START:ggp> C/EBP proximal <END> ) and -87 to -79 ( <START:ggp> C/EBP medial <END> ) , respectively . 
Our results demonstrate that <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> is involved in transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> human IL-4 promoter <END> in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Identification of an <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha-associated protein kinase <END> in a <START:ana> human monocytic cell line <END> and determination of its <START:ggp> phosphorylation sites <END> on <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) is stored in the cytoplasm as an inactive form through interaction with <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> . 
Stimulation of cells leads to a rapid phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> , which is presumed to be important for the subsequent degradation . 
We have recently reported the establishment of a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -dependent cell-free activation system of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in association with the induction of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> phosphorylation . 
In this study , we have identified a <START:ggp> kinase <END> in cell extracts from the <START:ana> LPS-stimulated human monocytic cell line <END> , <START:ana> THP-1 <END> , that specifically binds and phosphorylates <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
LPS stimulation transiently enhanced the <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> <START:ggp> -bound kinase <END> activity in <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> . 
Mutational analyses of <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> alpha and competition experiments with the synthetic peptides identified major <START:ggp> phosphorylation sites <END> by the bound <START:ggp> kinase <END> as Ser and Thr residues in the <START:ggp> C-terminal acidic domain <END> of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> . 
Moreover , we show that the peptide , corresponding to the <START:ggp> C-terminal acidic domain <END> of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> , blocked the LPS-induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation as well as inducible phosphorylation of endogenous <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> in a cell-free system using <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> . 
These results suggested that the <START:ggp> bound kinase <END> is involved in the signaling pathway of LPS by inducing the phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> C-terminal region <END> of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> and subsequent dissociation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha complex <END> . 
<START:ggp> Bik <END> , a novel <START:ggp> death-inducing protein <END> shares a distinct sequence motif with <START:ggp> Bcl-2 family proteins <END> and interacts with viral and <START:ggp> cellular survival-promoting proteins <END> . 
The survival-promoting activity of the <START:ggp> Bcl-2 family <END> of proteins appears to be modulated by interactions between various <START:ggp> cellular proteins <END> . 
We have identified a novel <START:ggp> cellular protein <END> , <START:ggp> Bik <END> , that interacts with the <START:ggp> cellular survival-promoting proteins <END> , <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> and <START:ggp> Bcl-xL <END> , as well as the <START:ggp> viral survival-promoting proteins <END> , <START:ggp> Epstein Barr virus-BHRF1 <END> and <START:ggp> adenovirus E1B-19 kDa <END> . 
In transient transfection assays , <START:ggp> Bik <END> promotes cell death in a manner similar to the <START:ggp> death-promoting members <END> of the <START:ggp> Bcl-2 family <END> , <START:ggp> Bax <END> and <START:ggp> Bak <END> . 
This death-promoting activity of <START:ggp> Bik <END> can be suppressed by coexpression of <START:ggp> Bcl-2 <END> , <START:ggp> Bcl-XL <END> , <START:ggp> EBV-BHRF1 <END> and <START:ggp> E1B-19 kDa <END> proteins suggesting that <START:ggp> Bik <END> may be a common target for both <START:ggp> cellular and viral anti-apoptotic proteins <END> . 
While <START:ggp> Bik <END> does not show overt homology to the <START:ggp> BH1 <END> and <START:ggp> BH2 <END> conserved domains characteristic of the <START:ggp> Bcl-2 family <END> , it does share a 9 <START:ggp> amino acid domain <END> ( <START:ggp> BH3 <END> ) with <START:ggp> Bax <END> and <START:ggp> Bak <END> which may be a critical determinant for the death-promoting activity of these proteins . 
The <START:ggp> human TCF-1 gene <END> encodes a <START:ggp> nuclear DNA-binding protein <END> uniquely expressed in <START:ana> normal and neoplastic T-lineage lymphocytes <END> . 
The <START:ggp> TCF-1 gene <END> encodes a <START:ggp> putative transcription factor <END> with affinity for a sequence motif occurring in a number of <START:ggp> T-cell enhancers <END> . 
<START:ana> TCF-1 mRNA <END> was originally found to be expressed in a T cell-specific fashion within a set of <START:ana> human and mouse cell lines <END> . 
In contrast , expression reportedly occurs in multiple nonlymphoid tissues during murine embryogenesis . 
We have now raised a <START:ggp> monoclonal antibody <END> to document expression and biochemistry of the <START:ggp> human TCF-1 protein <END> . 
As expected , the <START:ggp> TCF-1 protein <END> was detectable only in <START:ana> cell lines of T lineage <END> . 
Its expression was always restricted to the nucleus . 
Immunohistochemistry on a panel of human tissues revealed that the <START:ggp> TCF-1 protein <END> was found exclusively in thymocytes and in <START:ana> CD3+ T cells <END> in peripheral lymphoid tissues . 
Western blotting yielded a set of bands ranging from 25 kD to 55 kD , resulting from extensive alternative splicing . 
The <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> protein was detectable in all samples of a set of 22 <START:ana> T-cell malignancies <END> of various stages of maturation , but was absent from a large number of other <START:ana> hematologic neoplasms <END> . 
These observations imply a T cell-specific function for <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> , a notion corroborated by recent observations on Tcf-1 knock-out mice . 
In addition , these results indicate that nuclear <START:ggp> TCF-1 <END> expression can serve as a pan-T-lineage marker in the diagnosis of lymphoid malignancies . 
Cross-linking of <START:ggp> Fc gamma receptors <END> activates <START:ggp> HIV-1 long terminal repeat <END> -driven transcription in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> . 
Elevation of the levels of <START:ggp> circulating immune complexes <END> frequently accompanies HIV-1 infection and is a prognostic indicator of clinical progression from asymptomatic infection to AIDS . 
Here we report that cross-linking of <START:ggp> Fc gamma RI <END> or <START:ggp> Fc gamma RII <END> by <START:ggp> adherent human IgG <END> or by specific <START:ggp> anti-Fc gamma R mAb <END> activates HIV-1 gene expression in the <START:ana> human monocytic cell line <END> <START:ana> BF24 <END> and increased <START:ana> HIV RNA <END> expression in <START:ana> monocytes <END> from HIV infected patients as assayed by reverse transcription-PCR . 
In <START:ana> THP-1 cells <END> , <START:ggp> Fc gamma R <END> cross-linking induced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , which is known to bind to the <START:ggp> regulatory region <END> of the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) of HIV-1 and to activate HIV-1 transcription . <START:ggp> Anti-TNF-alpha antibody <END> but not <START:ggp> anti-IL-1 beta antibody <END> strongly inhibited both the induction of HIV-1- <START:ggp> LTR <END> -driven transcription and the induction of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> by <START:ggp> Fc gamma R <END> cross-linking . 
These results indicate that <START:ggp> Fc gamma R <END> can mediate a <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> -dependent induction of <START:ggp> HIV-1 gene <END> transcription and suggest that <START:ggp> immune complexes <END> may contribute to the pathophysiology of HIV-1 infection by augmenting viral replication in <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Signalling via <START:ggp> CD28 <END> of <START:ana> human naive neonatal T lymphocytes <END> . 
Accessory molecules play a crucial role in the development of the T cell response to antigenic challenge . 
We have examined the role of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> in modulating the 'naive ' neonatal T cell response to <START:ggp> anti-CD2 <END> -mediated activation . 
To compare the role of <START:ggp> CD28 <END> , <START:ana> neonatal <END> and <START:ana> adult T cells <END> were stimulated with a pair of <START:ggp> mitogenic anti-CD2 antibodies <END> in the presence or absence of <START:ggp> anti-CD28 MoAb <END> . 
With <START:ggp> anti-CD2 <END> alone , <START:ana> neonatal T cells <END> proliferated slightly but produced no detectable <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , whereas adult <START:ana> T cells <END> proliferated vigorously , with significant <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production . 
Costimulation with <START:ggp> anti-CD28 MoAb <END> greatly enhanced the proliferative response of <START:ana> neonatal T cells <END> to levels equivalent to those of <START:ana> adult T cells <END> , whereas <START:ana> adult T cells <END> showed only slight increases . 
Although <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> secretion was increased in the presence of <START:ggp> anti-CD28 MoAb <END> , <START:ana> neonatal T cell <END> <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production remained lower than in adults . 
In contrast , enhancement of <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> expression in neonates was similar to adult levels . 
Anti- <START:ggp> CD28 MoAb <END> costimulation increased <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> levels in neonates , albeit to levels lower than that of adults . 
The cellular mechanism governing the diminished proliferative response of <START:ana> neonatal T lymphocytes <END> to <START:ggp> anti-CD2 <END> may therefore be due to decreased <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> induction , reduced <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> expression and deficient <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production . 
Although <START:ggp> anti-CD28 MoAb <END> costimulation enhances all of the above signals , NF kappa B and IL-2 levels remain lower than in adults , suggesting the need for further activation requirements in the neonate . 
TCL1 oncogene activation in <START:ana> preleukemic T cells <END> from a case of ataxia-telangiectasia . 
The <START:ggp> TCL1 oncogene <END> on <START:ggp> human chromosome <END> <START:ggp> 14q32.1 <END> is involved in chromosome translocations [ <START:ggp> t ( 14 ; 14 ) ( q11 ; q32.1 ) <END> and <START:ggp> t ( 7 ; 14 ) ( q35 ; q32.1 ) <END> ] and inversions [ <START:ggp> inv14 ( q11 ; q32.1 ) <END> ] with <START:ggp> TCR alpha/beta loci <END> in T-cell leukemias , such as T-prolymphocytic ( T-PLL ) . 
It is also involved in T- acute and- chronic leukemias arising in cases of ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) , an immunodeficiency syndrome . 
Similar chromosomal rearrangements occur also in the clonally expanded <START:ana> T cells <END> in AT patients before the appearance of the overt leukemia . 
We have analyzed the expression of <START:ana> TCL1 mRNA <END> and <START:ggp> protein <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> ( <START:ana> PBLs <END> ) from four AT cases and from healthy controls . 
We found that the <START:ggp> TCL1 gene <END> was overexpressed in the <START:ana> PBLs <END> of an AT patient with a <START:ana> large clonal T-cell population <END> exhibiting the t ( 14 ; 14 ) translocation but not in the <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> of the other cases . 
Fluorescence in situ hybridization of the <START:ggp> TCL1 genomic locus <END> to lymphocyte metaphases from the AT patient with the T-cell clonal expansion showed that the breakpoint of the t ( 14 ; 14 ) translocation lies within the <START:ggp> TCL1 locus <END> and is accompanied by an inverted duplication of the <START:ggp> distal part <END> of <START:ggp> chromosome 14 <END> . 
These data indicate that <START:ggp> TCL1 <END> is activated in <START:ana> preleukemic clonal cells <END> as a consequence of chromosome translocation involving sequences from the <START:ggp> TCR locus <END> at <START:ggp> 14q11 <END> . 
Deregulation of <START:ggp> TCL1 <END> is the first event in the initiation of malignancy in these types of leukemias and represents a potential tool for clinical evaluation . 
<START:ggp> C/EBP proteins <END> activate transcription from the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat <END> in macrophages/ <START:ana> monocytes <END> . 
Three binding sites for <START:ggp> C/EBP proteins <END> are found in the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) long terminal repeat <END> ( <START:ggp> LTR <END> ) ( V.M. Tesmer , A.Rajadhyaksha , J.Babin , and M.Bina , Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci. USA 90 : 7298-7302 , 1993 ) . 
We have determined the functional role of <START:ggp> C/EBP proteins <END> and <START:ggp> C/EBP sites <END> in regulating transcription from the <START:ggp> HIV- 1 LTR <END> in <START:ana> monocytes/macrophages <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> endogenous C/EBP proteins <END> , using either an excess of <START:ggp> C/EBP binding sites <END> or a <START:ggp> trans- dominant negative inhibitor <END> , demonstrated that <START:ggp> C/EBP proteins <END> are required for basal and activated levels of <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> transcription in the <START:ana> promonocytic cell line U937 <END> . 
Northern ( RNA ) blots and binding assays showed that <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> is the only known <START:ggp> C/EBP family member <END> which is increased when <START:ana> U937 cells <END> are activated . 
Mutational analyses of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 LTR <END> showed that one <START:ggp> C/EBP site <END> is required for normal <START:ggp> LTR <END> transcription both before and after cellular activation and that the two 3 ' <START:ggp> C/EBP sites <END> are functionally equivalent . 
However , transcription from <START:ggp> crippled HIV-1 LTRs <END> lacking <START:ggp> C/EBP sites <END> can still be induced following activation of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
Several models are suggested for how elevated <START:ggp> NF-IL6 <END> may participate in an autostimulatory loop involving HIV infection , macrophage activation , <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression , and HIV replication . 
Human immunodeficiency virus type-2 gene expression : two <START:ggp> enhancers <END> and their activation by <START:ana> T-cell <END> activators . 
The human immunodeficiency viruses ( HIVs ) may include a spectrum of retroviruses with varying potential to infect their host , undergo long periods of latent infection , and induce pathology . 
Since expression of the viruses is in large part regulated by the <START:ggp> sequence elements <END> in their <START:ggp> long terminal repeats <END> ( <START:ggp> LTRs <END> ) , this study was directed to an analysis of the <START:ggp> regulatory elements <END> in the <START:ggp> HIV-2 LTR <END> . 
The <START:ggp> HIV-2 LTR <END> was found to contain two <START:ggp> enhancers <END> . 
One of these <START:ggp> enhancers <END> is , in part , identical to the <START:ggp> HIV-1 enhancer <END> . 
This <START:ggp> enhancer <END> in HIV-1 is the <START:ggp> T-cell activation response element <END> ; in HIV-2 , however , it is the <START:ggp> second enhancer <END> that is mainly responsible for activation in response to T-cell activators . 
The second <START:ggp> enhancer <END> interacts with two <START:ggp> nuclear binding proteins <END> ( 85 kD and 27 kD mobility ) that appear to be required for optimal enhancer function and activation . 
Observations such as these encourage the speculation that there may be subtle differences in the regulation of HIV-1 and HIV-2 expression that may be relevant to the possible longer latency and reduced pathogenicity of HIV-2 . 
<START:ggp> NF-M <END> ( <START:ggp> chicken C/EBP beta <END> ) induces eosinophilic differentiation and apoptosis in a <START:ana> hematopoietic progenitor cell line <END> . 
<START:ggp> CAAT/enhancer binding proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> C/EBPs <END> ) are transcriptional activators implicated in the differentiation processes of various cell lineages . 
We have shown earlier that <START:ggp> NF-M <END> , the <START:ggp> chicken homolog <END> of <START:ggp> C/EBP beta <END> , is specifically expressed in <START:ana> myelomonocytic and eosinophilic cells <END> of the hematopoietic system . 
To investigate the role of <START:ggp> NF-M <END> in <START:ana> hematopoietic cell lineage <END> commitment , we constructed a conditional form of the protein by fusing it to the <START:ggp> hormone binding domain <END> of the <START:ggp> human estrogen receptor <END> . 
This construct was stably expressed in a <START:ana> multipotent progenitor cell line <END> transformed by the <START:ggp> Myb-Ets oncoprotein <END> . 
We report here that both <START:ggp> NF-M-dependent promoter constructs <END> and resident genes could be activated by addition of beta-estradiol to the <START:ana> NF-M-estrogen receptor expressing progenitors <END> . 
At the same time , we observed a down-regulation of <START:ggp> progenitor-specific surface markers <END> and the up-regulation of <START:ggp> differentiation markers <END> restricted to the <START:ana> eosinophil <END> and <START:ana> myeloid lineages <END> . 
In addition to the onset of differentiation , cell death was induced with typical apoptotic features . 
Our results suggest that <START:ggp> NF-M <END> plays an important role in commitment along the <START:ana> eosinophil lineage <END> and in the induction of apoptosis . 
<START:ggp> Prolactin <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin-2 receptors <END> in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> signal through a <START:ggp> MGF-STAT5-like transcription factor <END> . 
The cell surface receptors for <START:ggp> PRL <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) are structurally distinct , but share regulatory tasks in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
They can stimulate proliferation and activate transcription of over-lapping sets of genes of <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> PRL <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> receptor activation are both linked to the <START:ggp> Jak/Stat <END> ( <START:ggp> signal transducer and activator of transcription <END> ) pathway . 
We investigated the ability of <START:ggp> PRL <END> and <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> to activate <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> in different <START:ana> T cell lines <END> . 
The DNA binding specificities , the reactivities toward Stat-specific antisera , and the mol wt of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> -and <START:ggp> PRL-induced DNA-binding proteins <END> in <START:ana> Nb2 and C196 T cell lines <END> were investigated . 
A comparison with the <START:ggp> Stat proteins <END> induced by <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> , <START:ggp> PRL <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> in <START:ana> T47D mammary tumor cells <END> was made . 
We found that these parameters were indistinguishable for one of the <START:ggp> PRL- and IL-2-induced factors <END> . 
A transcription factor closely related to <START:ggp> mammary gland factor-Stat5 <END> is rapidly activated upon interaction of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> and <START:ggp> PRL <END> with their respective receptors . 
Activation of a second protein related to <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> was also observed . 
Our results emphasize the role of <START:ggp> PRL <END> as a regulator of the immune response and indicate that the <START:ggp> Stat factors <END> <START:ggp> mammary gland factor-Stat5 <END> and <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> play a role in the regulation of gene expression during T cell development . 
<START:ggp> ETS1 <END> transactivates the <START:ggp> human GM-CSF promoter <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> stimulated with PMA and ionomycin . 
Activation of <START:ana> T helper cells <END> results in coordinate expression of a number of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> involved in differentiation , proliferation and activation of the haematopoietic system . 
<START:ggp> Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> ( <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> ) is one such <START:ggp> cytokine <END> whose increased expression results partly from increases in transcription . 
<START:ggp> Cis-acting elements <END> with <START:ggp> NF kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> ETS-like motifs <END> have been identified in the promoter region of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF gene <END> , which are important for transcriptional activity following PMA and ionomycin stimulation . 
A number of the <START:ggp> ETS family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> are expressed in <START:ana> T cells <END> , including <START:ggp> ETS1 <END> and <START:ggp> ELF1 <END> . 
Here we describe the ability of these factors to interact with a site ( <START:ggp> GM5 <END> ) , located within the <START:ggp> CLE0 element <END> , <START:ggp> -47 to -40 upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF transcription initiation site <END> . 
Exogenous <START:ggp> ETS1 <END> , but not <START:ggp> ELF1 <END> , can transactivate <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> , through the <START:ggp> GM5 <END> site , in a PMA/ionomycin dependent manner . 
Other unidentified <START:ggp> ETS-like factors <END> present in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> are also capable of binding <START:ggp> GM5 <END> . 
Mutation of the core <START:ggp> ETS binding site <END> from <START:ggp> -GGAA- to -GGAT- <END> prevents the binding of <START:ggp> ETS-like factors <END> with the exception of <START:ggp> ETS1 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> GM-CSF promoter <END> , modified in this way to be <START:ggp> ETS1 <END> specific , is fully responsive to PMA/ionomycin induction , in addition to <START:ggp> ETS1 <END> transactivation in the presence of PMA and ionomycin . 
Together these data suggest that <START:ggp> ETS1 <END> may be involved in mediating the increased <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> production associated with <START:ana> T cell <END> activation . 
Quantitation of <START:ana> beta 1 triiodothyronine receptor mRNA <END> in human tissues by competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction . 
Thyroid hormones act by binding to <START:ggp> nuclear receptor proteins <END> , the <START:ggp> thyroid hormone receptors ( TR ) alpha and beta <END> . 
Data from cell culture and animal studies indicate that <START:ggp> TR <END> expression may be regulated to modulate target organ responsiveness to thyroid hormone . 
To investigate whether such adaptive changes in <START:ggp> TR <END> expression occur in humans , we determined the mRNA levels of the <START:ggp> hTR beta 1 <END> in various thyroid states . 
Patients with overt hypo -or hyperthyroidism were enrolled in the study . 
Total RNA was isolated from <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> and <START:ana> hTR beta 1 mRNA <END> levels determined by quantitative competitive reverse transcription PCR . 
For comparison , <START:ana> hTR beta 1 mRNA <END> levels were determined in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> and normal thyroid tissue of euthyroid patients . 
<START:ana> Human TR beta 1 mRNA <END> levels in <START:ana> lymphocytes <END> were 1.8 +/- 0.4 , 1.9 +/- 0.5 , 1.1 +/- 0.4 10 ( -18 ) mol/microgram RNA in hypo- , eu -and hyperthyroid patients , respectively , corresponding to an estimated 0.5 -2 molecules per cell . 
Although the mean <START:ana> hTR beta 1 mRNA <END> levels were 40 % lower in hyperthyroid than in euthyroid subjects , this difference did not reach statistical significance . 
Similar levels of <START:ana> hTR beta 1 mRNA <END> levels were detected in thyroid gland from euthyroid patients . 
In summary , we developed an assay for the quantitative determination of <START:ana> hTR beta 1 mRNA <END> levels in small human tissue samples , containing as little as 50 ng of total RNA . 
Absolute <START:ana> hTR beta 1 mRNA <END> levels are very low with an estimated one molecule of <START:ana> mRNA <END> being present in a <START:ana> mononuclear blood cell <END> or <START:ana> thyrocyte <END> . 
No up-regulation of <START:ggp> hTR beta 1 <END> was seen in hypothyroid relative to euthyroid patients . 
However , there is a non-significant trend towards a down-regulation of <START:ana> hTR beta 1 mRNA <END> levels in hyperthyroid patients . 
Multiple proteins interact with the <START:ggp> nuclear inhibitory protein repressor element <END> in the <START:ggp> human interleukin-3 promoter <END> . 
T cell expression of <START:ggp> interleukin 3 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-3 <END> ) is directed by <START:ggp> positive and negative cis-acting DNA elements <END> clustered within 300 base pairs of the <START:ggp> transcriptional start site <END> . 
A strong <START:ggp> repressor element <END> , termed <START:ggp> nuclear inhibitory protein <END> ( <START:ggp> NIP <END> ) , was previously mapped to a segment of the <START:ggp> IL-3 promoter <END> between <START:ggp> nucleotides -271 and -250 <END> . 
Functional characterization of this element demonstrates that it can mediate repression when linked in cis to a <START:ggp> heterologous promoter <END> . 
DNA binding experiments were carried out to characterize the repressor activity . 
Using varying conditions , three distinct complexes were shown to interact specifically with the <START:ggp> NIP region <END> , although only one correlates with repressor activity . 
<START:ggp> Complex 1 <END> results from binding of a ubiquitous polypeptide that recognizes the <START:ggp> 3 ' portion <END> of this sequence and is not required for repression . 
<START:ggp> Complex 2 <END> corresponds to binding of <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> ( <START:ggp> upstream stimulatory factor <END> ) to an <START:ggp> E-box motif <END> in the <START:ggp> 5 ' portion <END> of the <START:ggp> NIP region <END> . 
DNA binding specificity of complex 3 overlaps with that of <START:ggp> upstream stimulatory factor <END> but is clearly distinct . 
To determine which of the latter two complexes represents <START:ggp> NIP <END> activity , we incorporated small alterations into the <START:ggp> NIP site <END> of an <START:ggp> IL-3 promoter-linked reporter construct <END> and examined their effects on <START:ggp> NIP <END> -mediated repression . 
Functional specificity for repression matches the DNA binding specificity of <START:ggp> complex 3 <END> ; both repressor activity and <START:ggp> complex 3 <END> binding require the <START:ggp> consensus sequence <END> CTCACNTNC . 
The <START:ggp> hematopoietic transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> is downregulated in <START:ana> human multiple myeloma cell lines <END> . 
<START:ggp> PU.1 <END> is a <START:ggp> hematopoietic transcription factor <END> belonging to the <START:ggp> Ets-family <END> . 
It is identical to the <START:ggp> Spi-1 oncogene <END> , which is implicated in spleen focus-forming virus-induced murine erythroleukemias . 
<START:ggp> PU.1 <END> seems to be required for early development of <START:ana> multiple hematopoietic lineages <END> , but its expression in <START:ana> mature cells <END> is preferentially observed in cells of the <START:ana> B-cell-and monocyte/macrophage-differentiation lineage <END> . 
It binds the so-called <START:ggp> Pu box <END> , an important <START:ggp> tissue-specific regulatory DNA element <END> present in a number of genes expressed in these <START:ana> cell lineages <END> . 
We have analyzed the expression and activity of <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> during human B-cell development using a panel of <START:ana> B-cell lines <END> representing different stages of maturation , from <START:ana> early precursors <END> to <START:ana> differentiated plasma cells <END> . 
<START:ana> PU.1 mRNA <END> expression and <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> DNA binding activity , as measured by Northern blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay , respectively , were evident in <START:ana> cell lines <END> representing <START:ana> pro-B , pre-B , and mature B cells <END> . 
We could also show <START:ggp> Pu box <END> -dependent transactivation of a reporter gene in transient transfections in these <START:ana> cell lines <END> . 
In contrast , in a number of <START:ana> multiple myeloma cell lines <END> , representing <START:ana> differentiated , plasma cell-like B cells <END> , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> DNA binding activity , mRNA expression , and <START:ggp> Pu box <END> -dependent transactivation were absent or detectable at a very low level . 
In <START:ana> lymphoblastoid cell lines <END> , which exemplify an intermediate stage of B-cell differentiation , a reduced expression and activity were observed . 
The findings in the <START:ana> human multiple myeloma cell lines <END> represent the first examples of <START:ana> B cells <END> with downregulated <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> expression and apparently contradict observations in the murine system in which <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> is expressed and active in <START:ana> plasmacytoma cell lines <END> . 
At present , it is unclear whether the lack of <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> expression and activity in <START:ana> human multiple myeloma cell lines <END> represents a malignancy-associated defect in these cells or exemplifies a normal developmental regulation in <START:ana> terminally differentiated B cells <END> . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> and <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> expression in <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> by cyclosporin A and the <START:ggp> T-cell transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
<START:ggp> Nuclear factor of activated T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) was originally described as a <START:ggp> T-cell-specific transcription factor <END> athat supported the activation of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> gene expression and mediated the <START:ggp> immunoregulatory <END> effects of cyclosporin A ( CsA ) . 
As we observed that <START:ana> activated endothelial cells <END> also expressed <START:ggp> NFAT <END> , we tested the antiinflammatory properties of CsA in <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> . 
Significantly , CsA completely suppressed the induction of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> in <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> and inhibited the activity of <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene regulatory elements <END> that use <START:ggp> NFAT <END> by 60 % . 
CsA similarly mediated a reduction of up to 65 % in <START:ana> GM-CSF mRNA <END> and protein expression in <START:ana> activated endothelial cells <END> . 
CsA also suppressed <START:ggp> E-selectin <END> , but not <START:ggp> vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> VCAM-1 <END> ) expression in endothelial cells , even though the <START:ggp> E-selectin promoter <END> is activated by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> rather than <START:ggp> NFAT <END> . 
Hence , induction of cell surface expression of this <START:ggp> leukocyte adhesion molecule <END> by <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha <END> was reduced by 40 % in the presence of CsA , and this was reflected by a 29 % decrease in <START:ana> neutrophil <END> adhesion . 
The effects of CsA on <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> were also detected at the <START:ggp> chromatin <END> structure level , as <START:ggp> DNasel hypersensitive sites <END> within both the <START:ggp> GM-CSF <END> enhancer and the <START:ggp> E-selectin promoter <END> were suppressed by CsA . 
This represents the first report of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> in <START:ana> endothelial cells <END> and suggests mechanisms by which CsA could function as an antiinflammatory agent . 
Costimulation requirement for <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> transcription factor activation in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
The transcriptional activity of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> requires <START:ana> T-cell <END> costimulation delivered by the <START:ggp> TCR <END> and the <START:ggp> auxiliary receptor CD28 <END> . 
Several <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> participate in <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> promoter activation , among which are <START:ggp> AP-1-like factors <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Protein phosphorylation has an important role in the regulation of these two factors : ( 1 ) it induces the transactivating capacity of the <START:ggp> AP-1 protein <END> <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> ; and ( 2 ) it is involved in the release of the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic inhibitor <END> , <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> , from <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , allowing translocation of the latter into the nucleus . 
We have recently shown that both phosphorylation processes require T-cell costimulation . 
Furthermore , in <START:ana> activated T cells <END> , the kinetics of the two phosphorylation events are essentially similar . 
According to our results , however , the kinases responsible for the two processes are distinct entities . 
Whereas <START:ggp> TPCK <END> inhibits phosphorylation of <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> and , consequently , activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , it markedly enhances the activity of <START:ggp> JNK <END> , the <START:ggp> MAP kinase-related kinase <END> that phosphorylates the <START:ggp> transactivation domain <END> of <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> . 
We , therefore , propose the activation scheme presented in FIGURE 3 for T-cell costimulation . 
Costimulation results in the activation of a signaling pathway that leads to the simultaneous induction of the two <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Integration of the signals generated by <START:ggp> TCR <END> and <START:ggp> CD28 <END> engagement occurs along this pathway , which then bifurcates to induce <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> phosphorylation and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation on the one hand , and <START:ggp> JNK <END> activation and <START:ggp> c-Jun <END> phosphorylation on the other . 
We are currently engaged in defining where the two signals integrate along the <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> / <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> pathway . 
Regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and cytokine gene expression in <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B/Rel <END> <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
<START:ana> CD4+ macrophages <END> in tissues such as lung , skin , and lymph nodes , <START:ana> promyelocytic cells <END> in bone marrow , and <START:ana> peripheral blood monocytes <END> serve as important targets and reservoirs for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication . 
HIV-1-infected <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> are often diminished in their ability to participate in chemotaxis , phagocytosis , and intracellular killing . 
HIV-1 infection of <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> can lead to the expression of <START:ggp> surface receptors <END> associated with cellular activation and/or differentiation that increase the responsiveness of these cells to <START:ggp> cytokines <END> secreted by neighboring cells as well as to bacteria or other pathogens . 
Enhancement of HIV-1 replication is related in part to increased DNA-binding activity of <START:ggp> cellular transcription factors <END> such as <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
<START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binds to the <START:ggp> HIV-1 enhancer <END> region of the <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> and contributes to the inducibility of HIV-1 gene expression in response to multiple activating agents . 
Phosphorylation and degradation of the <START:ggp> cytoplasmic inhibitor <END> <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> alpha are crucial regulatory events in the activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA-binding activity . 
Both N- and C-terminal residues of <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> alpha are required for inducer-mediated degradation . 
Chronic HIV-1 infection of <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> leads to constitutive <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> DNA-binding activity and provides an intranuclear environment capable of perpetuating HIV-1 replication . 
Increased intracellular stores of <START:ggp> latent NF-kappa B <END> may also result in rapid inducibility of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> -dependent <START:ggp> cytokine <END> gene expression . 
In response to secondary pathogenic infections or antigenic challenge , <START:ggp> cytokine <END> gene expression is rapidly induced , enhanced , and sustained over prolonged periods in <START:ana> HIV-1-infected myeloid cells <END> compared with <START:ana> uninfected cells <END> . 
Elevated levels of several <START:ggp> inflammatory cytokines <END> have been detected in the sera of HIV-1-infected individuals . 
Secretion of <START:ggp> myeloid cell-derived cytokines <END> may both increase virus production and contribute to AIDS-associated disorders . 
Steroid mediated lysis of <START:ana> lymphoblasts <END> requires the DNA binding region of the steroid hormone receptor . 
Glucocorticoids kill certain types of <START:ana> lymphoblasts <END> , but the mechanisms are unknown . 
It is clear that sufficient numbers of functional <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> are required to mediate lysis , but whether they do so through the classical model of steroid hormone activation and modulation of gene expression has not been established . 
In this report we have asked which region ( s ) of the <START:ggp> steroid receptor <END> are important for mediating lysis in <START:ana> leukemic T lymphoblasts <END> . 
<START:ana> CEM-ICR 27 leukemic lymphoblasts <END> , a clone of <START:ana> CEM cells <END> which lack functional <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> and therefore are neither lysed by dexamethasone nor capable of showing <START:ggp> glutamine synthetase <END> induction , were provided with <START:ggp> steroid receptors <END> by DNA transfections of various receptor gene constructs . 
We measured steroid mediated lysis , receptor number and induction of <START:ggp> glutamine synthetase <END> in the <START:ana> transfected cells <END> . 
Our results provide evidence that the lysis mechanism in the <START:ana> ICR27 lymphoblasts <END> is restored when functional receptor number is restored . 
The <START:ggp> DNA binding region <END> specifying high affinity for <START:ggp> GRE sites <END> is required . 
Lysis is mediated by any steroid that allows for activation of the receptor containing such a region . 
Our data support the view that steroid-mediated cell death occurs by a process requiring direct interaction of <START:ggp> steroid-receptor complexes <END> with the genome . 
Functional characterization of the <START:ggp> murine homolog <END> of the <START:ggp> B cell-specific coactivator <END> <START:ggp> BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> . 
B cell-specific transcriptional promoter activity mediated by the <START:ggp> octamer motif <END> requires the <START:ggp> Oct1 <END> or <START:ggp> Oct2 protein <END> and additional <START:ggp> B cell-restricted cofactors <END> . 
One such <START:ggp> cofactor <END> , <START:ggp> BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> , was recently isolated from <START:ana> human B cells <END> . 
Here , we describe the isolation and detailed characterization of the <START:ggp> murine homolog <END> . 
Full-length <START:ggp> cDNAs <END> and <START:ggp> genomic clones <END> were isolated , and the gene structure was determined. Comparison of the deduced amino acids shows 88 % sequence identity between <START:ggp> mouse and human BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> . 
The <START:ggp> NH2-terminal 126 amino acids <END> of <START:ggp> BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> are both essential and sufficient for interaction with the <START:ggp> POU domains <END> of either <START:ggp> Oct1 <END> or <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> . 
This protein-protein interaction does not require the simultaneous binding of <START:ggp> Oct proteins <END> to DNA , and high resolution footprinting of the <START:ggp> Oct <END> -DNA interaction reveals that binding of <START:ggp> BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> to <START:ggp> Oct1 <END> or <START:ggp> Oct2 <END> does not alter the interaction with DNA . 
<START:ggp> BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> can efficiently activate octamer-dependent promoters in <START:ana> fibroblasts <END> ; however , it fails to stimulate <START:ggp> octamer-dependent enhancer <END> activity . 
Fusion of subdomains of <START:ggp> BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> with the <START:ggp> GAL4 DNA binding domain <END> reveals that both <START:ggp> NH2- and COOH-terminal domains <END> of <START:ggp> BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> contribute to full transactivation function , the <START:ggp> COOH-terminal domain <END> is more efficient in this transactivation assay . 
Consistent with the failure of <START:ggp> full-length BOB.1/OBF.1 <END> to stimulate <START:ggp> octamer-dependent enhancer elements <END> in <START:ana> non B cells <END> , the <START:ggp> GAL4 fusions <END> likewise only stimulate from a promoter-proximal position . 
<START:ggp> Anti-immunoglobulin M <END> activates <START:ggp> nuclear calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II <END> in <START:ana> human B lymphocytes <END> . 
We and others have previously shown that the <START:ggp> nuclear protein <END> , <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> , is phosphorylated in a calcium-dependent manner after ligation of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) M on <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> . 
As this phosphorylation was independent of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> activity , we tested whether a <START:ggp> calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> CaM kinase <END> ) might phosphorylate the <START:ggp> Ets-1 protein <END> after elevation of intracellular free calcium concentrations . 
The dephosphorylated form of <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> has been shown to bind to chromatin , suggesting that the <START:ggp> operative kinase <END> should be detectable in the nucleus . 
We prepared nuclear extracts from two <START:ana> human B cell lines <END> in which increased intracellular free calcium levels correlated with increased phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> protein . 
Activity of the <START:ggp> CaM kinases <END> was determined using a synthetic peptide substrate both in the absence and presence of an inhibitor specific for the <START:ggp> CaM kinase family <END> , KN-62 . 
Stimulation of cells with <START:ggp> anti-IgM <END> led to increased activity of a <START:ggp> nuclear kinase <END> that could phosphorylate the peptide , and this activity was reduced by 10 microM KN-62 . 
Kinase activity was reduced in lysates preadsorbed using an <START:ggp> antibody <END> specific for <START:ggp> CaM kinase II <END> . 
Two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of the <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> protein from cells incubated with ionomycin or <START:ggp> anti-IgM <END> contained two unique phosphopeptides that were absent in untreated cells . 
Incubation of <START:ggp> isolated Ets-1 protein <END> with purified <START:ggp> CaM kinase II <END> produced phosphorylation of peptides that migrated identically to those found in cells incubated with either <START:ggp> anti-IgM <END> or ionomycin . 
These data suggest a model of signal transduction by the <START:ggp> antigen receptor <END> on <START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> in which increased intracellular free calcium can rapidly activate <START:ggp> nuclear CaM kinase II <END> , potentially resulting in phosphorylation and regulation of <START:ggp> DNA-binding proteins <END> . 
Transcriptional activation and repression , two properties of the <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> . 
The <START:ggp> lymphoid-specific transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> contains two <START:ggp> transcriptional activation domains <END> which are located within the <START:ggp> N-terminal <END> and <START:ggp> C-terminal regions <END> . 
To study their differential activation properties , we linked the isolated <START:ggp> effector domains <END> to the <START:ggp> GAL4 DNA-binding domain <END> . 
We have shown that both activating regions of <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> , isolated from their natural context , can activate transcription as <START:ggp> promoter factors <END> . 
In contrast to the <START:ggp> C-terminus <END> , activation by the <START:ggp> N-terminal domain <END> is dependent on a yet unidentified factor ( s ) binding to the <START:ggp> simian virus 40 enhancer <END> . 
The results obtained by duplication of <START:ggp> activation domains <END> or their mixed combination suggest that the domains are functionally independent . 
However , activation from a remote position could only be achieved with the <START:ggp> C-terminus <END> of <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> in <START:ana> B cells <END> . 
In <START:ana> lymphoid cells <END> , higher activation levels were observed , suggesting that distinct <START:ggp> B-cell-specific cofactors <END> in concert with the <START:ggp> effector domains <END> of <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> might be involved in mediating transcription from proximal and remote positions . 
Furthermore , we identified a repression domain at the N-terminus of <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> . 
When transferred to a potent activator , transcriptional stimulation was inhibited efficiently . 
These results underscore the modular structure of <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> with separable domains for activation and repression and suggest that <START:ggp> Oct-2a <END> might have complex regulatory functions in vivo . 
Nonopsonic phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by <START:ana> macrophages <END> and <START:ana> polymorphonuclear leukocytes <END> requires the presence of the bacterial flagellum . 
Whereas the mechanism of nonopsonic phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been described , the bacterial ligands required are poorly understood . 
To identify the requisite bacterial ligands , studies with isogenic mutants of P. aeruginosa PAK lacking pili , flagella , and the <START:ggp> RpoN sigma factor <END> were undertaken . 
The RpoN mutant , lacking pili , flagella , and <START:ggp> nonpilus adhesins <END> , bound poorly and was resistant to ingestion by both <START:ana> macrophages <END> and <START:ana> neutrophils <END> . 
Pili were not absolutely required for binding or phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa . 
The presence of a flagellum was not required for binding of P. aeruginosa to <START:ana> macrophages <END> but was critical for the subsequent internalization of the bacterium , suggesting that this factor or a surface ligand associated with its assembly was responsible for stimulation of nonopsonic phagocytosis . 
Identification of essential <START:ggp> GATA <END> and <START:ggp> Ets binding motifs <END> within the promoter of the <START:ggp> platelet glycoprotein Ib alpha gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> Platelet glycoprotein <END> ( <START:ggp> GP <END> ) <START:ggp> Ib-IX-V <END> is a <START:ggp> multisubunit adhesion receptor <END> that supports platelet attachment to thrombogenic surfaces at sites of vascular injury . 
The congenital absence of the receptor results in a bleeding disorder associated with <START:ana> `` giant '' platelets <END> , a condition linking the expression of the complex to platelet morphogenesis . 
To understand better the expression of the <START:ggp> GP Ib-IX-V complex <END> , studies were undertaken to define the essential <START:ggp> genetic elements <END> supporting the expression of the <START:ggp> alpha-subunit <END> of the complex ( <START:ggp> GP Ib alpha <END> ) . 
<START:ggp> GP Ib alpha promoter <END> activity was evaluated by transfection of <START:ana> human erythroleukemia cells <END> with reporter plasmids coding for the <START:ggp> enzyme <END> , <START:ggp> luciferase <END> . 
Studies were initiated with a fragment extending 2 , 738 nucleotides 5 ' to the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> and lead to the identification of 253 nucleotides retaining full promoter activity in <START:ana> human erythroleukemia cells <END> . 
In cells of <START:ana> nonhematopoietic lineage <END> , <START:ana> human endothelial <END> and <START:ana> HeLa cells <END> , the <START:ggp> GP Ib alpha promoter <END> activity was no greater than background levels obtained with <START:ggp> promoterless constructs <END> . 
Gel shift assays and site-directed mutagenesis studies defined essential <START:ggp> GATA <END> and <START:ggp> Ets binding motifs <END> <START:ggp> 93 and 150 nucleotides upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> transcription start site <END> , a finding which further substantiates these elements as important determinants of megakaryocytic gene expression . 
The results define essential <START:ggp> cis-acting elements <END> responsible for the expression of <START:ggp> GP Ib alpha <END> and provide insights into molecular events coinciding with the release of <START:ana> normal platelets <END> into the bloodstream . 
<START:ggp> CD30 <END> ligation induces <START:ggp> nuclear factor-kappa B <END> activation in <START:ana> human T cell lines <END> . 
<START:ggp> CD30 <END> is a recently described member of the <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily <END> . 
In this report , we show that following incubation of <START:ana> L540 cells <END> ( <START:ana> Hodgkin 's disease-derived , T cell-like , CD30+ cells <END> ) with the <START:ggp> agonistic anti-CD30 monoclonal antibodies <END> ( <START:ggp> mAb <END> ) <START:ggp> M44 <END> and <START:ggp> M67 <END> , two <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> DNA binding activities were induced in nuclear extracts , as determined in gel retardation assays . 
The effect of the <START:ggp> mAb <END> towards <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation was rapid , as it occurred within 20 min , and was sustained for up to 6 h . 
By comparison , an <START:ggp> isotype-matched antibody <END> had no effect on <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
Moreover , in <START:ana> human T helper ( Th ) clones <END> functionally characterized as being of the type 0 , type 1 and type 2 ( 28 % , < 1 % und 93 % CD30+ , respectively ) , the extent of <START:ggp> CD30 <END> -mediated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation correlated with the proportion of <START:ana> CD30+ cells <END> . 
In all cell lines investigated , the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complexes <END> induced following <START:ggp> CD30 <END> engagement were shown to contain <START:ggp> p50 NF-kappa B1 <END> , <START:ggp> p65 RelA <END> , and possibly other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Collectively , our results demonstrate that nuclear translocation and activation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> rank among the short-term cellular responses elicited following <START:ggp> CD30 <END> ligation . 
Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis . 
The earliest lesion in the development of an atherosclerotic plaque is the fatty streak . 
This chronic inflammatory reaction results from a sequence of events that begins with the trapping of low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) in the subendothelial space of the artery wall . 
The trapped LDL is seeded with oxidative species released by the overlying endothelium , and lipid oxidation is initiated within the LDL particle. Some of the lipids that result lead to the activation of <START:ggp> NFkB-like transcription factors <END> that cause the expression of genes whose <START:ggp> protein products <END> mediate monocyte binding , <START:ana> monocyte <END> chemotaxis into the subendothelial space , and conversion into <START:ana> macrophages <END> . 
At least 1 <START:ggp> major gene <END> modulates the oxidation of LDL lipids and/or the biologic response to these lipids . 
The inverse relation between high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) and atherosclerotic events may in part be due to <START:ggp> enzymes <END> associated with HDL that destroy the biologically active lipids generated in LDL . 
<START:ggp> Estrogen <END> and <START:ggp> progesterone receptors <END> in vernal keratoconjunctivitis . 
PURPOSE : Sex-related influences have been implicated in the pathogenesis of vernal keratoconjunctivitis ( VKC ) , an allergic eosinophilic disease . 
METHODS : The authors evaluated tarsal and bulbar conjunctival biopsies from seven patients with severe and symptomatic VKC for the presence of <START:ggp> estrogen <END> and <START:ggp> progesterone receptors <END> by using <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> with a peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique . 
RESULTS : Both the epithelium and subepithelium of the tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva of patients with VKC , but not those of four nonatopic control subjects , showed intense positive staining for estrogen and <START:ggp> progesterone receptors <END> . 
Immunofluorescence colocalization of both <START:ggp> estrogen <END> and <START:ggp> progesterone receptors <END> with <START:ggp> eosinophil cationic protein <END> showed that approximately 70 % of <START:ana> positive cells <END> were <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
CONCLUSIONS : Sexual hormones , through their <START:ggp> receptors <END> , may influence the activity of <START:ana> eosinophils <END> in patients with VKC . 
<START:ggp> CIITA <END> activates the expression of <START:ggp> MHC class II genes <END> in mouse T cells . 
It has long been a puzzle that <START:ggp> MHC class II molecules <END> are expressed in <START:ana> human T cells <END> after activation but not in <START:ana> mouse T cells <END> ; this expression is believed to play a role in the cell mediated immune response . 
Recently the <START:ggp> MHC class II transactivator <END> ( <START:ggp> CIITA <END> ) has been reported to be a <START:ggp> major regulatory factor <END> for both the constitutive and IFN inducible expression of <START:ggp> MHC class II genes <END> . 
Here we show that <START:ana> human T cells <END> expressing MHC class II have <START:ggp> CIITA <END> transcripts while MHC class II-negative <START:ana> human T cells <END> and <START:ana> mouse T cells <END> do not . 
The expression of <START:ggp> MHC class II genes <END> in <START:ana> mouse T cells <END> can be reconstituted upon transfection with the <START:ggp> human CIITA cDNA <END> . 
These data indicate that the expression of <START:ggp> CIITA <END> explains the expression or lack of expression of <START:ggp> MHC class II <END> in <START:ana> human <END> and <START:ana> mouse T cells <END> respectively . 
<START:ggp> Anti-Ro ( SSA ) autoantibodies <END> are associated with <START:ggp> T cell receptor beta genes <END> in systemic lupus erythematosus patients . 
Several of the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus have been associated with specific <START:ggp> autoantibodies <END> . 
Associations between <START:ggp> HLA class II antigens <END> and <START:ggp> autoantibodies <END> to the <START:ggp> ribonucleoproteins <END> <START:ggp> Ro ( SSA ) <END> and <START:ggp> La ( SSB ) <END> have been reported in these patients . 
Because <START:ggp> HLA class II molecules <END> present antigen to <START:ggp> T cell receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> TCRs <END> ) , we have searched for a <START:ggp> TCR gene <END> associated with the production of <START:ggp> anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies <END> . 
A pair of <START:ggp> restriction fragment length polymorphisms <END> ( <START:ggp> RFLPs <END> ) , one of which hybridizes to the <START:ggp> TCR constant region C beta 1 <END> and the other to the <START:ggp> C beta 2 gene <END> , has been identified , suggesting these may be genotypic markers for an extended region of the <START:ggp> TCR beta locus <END> . 
This <START:ggp> RFLP pair <END> occurs in 76 % of patients with <START:ggp> Ro ( SSA ) <END> precipitins , 84 % of anti- <START:ggp> Ro ( SSA ) <END> -positive patients lacking <START:ggp> La ( SSB ) <END> <START:ggp> precipitins <END> , but only 41 % of the patients lacking both <START:ggp> precipitins <END> ( P = 0.0004 ) . 
This disproportionate occurrence in a subset of lupus patients indicates that these <START:ggp> RFLPs <END> are not disease susceptibility markers , but rather are important markers for <START:ggp> TCR genes <END> whose products are involved in the production of <START:ggp> anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies <END> . 
The majority of patients who have these <START:ggp> RFLPs <END> and <START:ggp> HLA class II antigens <END> previously associated with the anti- <START:ggp> Ro ( SSA ) <END> response make this antibody , suggesting that interactions between products of these <START:ggp> loci occur <END> in response to <START:ggp> Ro ( SSA ) <END> . 
Inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> -dependent transcription by <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> : implications for differential gene expression in <START:ana> T helper cell subsets <END> . 
Activation of individual <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> results in differential <START:ggp> lymphokine <END> expression : <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> ) is preferentially produced by <START:ana> T helper type 1 ( TH1 ) cells <END> , which are involved in cell-mediated immune responses , whereas <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> is synthesized by <START:ana> TH2 cells <END> , which are essential for humoral immunity . 
The <START:ggp> Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent factor <END> <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> plays a key role in the inducible transcription of both these <START:ggp> lymphokine genes <END> . 
However , while <START:ggp> IL2 <END> expression requires the contribution of Ca ( 2+ ) - and <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> -dependent signals , we report that activation of <START:ggp> human IL4 <END> transcription through the Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent pathway is diminished by <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> stimulation in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> . 
This phenomenon is due to mutually exclusive binding of <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> to the <START:ggp> P sequence <END> , an element located <START:ggp> 69 bp upstream <END> of the <START:ggp> IL4 transcription initiation site <END> . 
<START:ggp> Human IL4 promoter <END> -mediated transcription is downregulated in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> stimulated with the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B-activating cytokine <END> <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> and suppressed in <START:ana> RelA-overexpressing cells <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> stimulation or <START:ggp> RelA <END> overexpression does not affect the activity of a <START:ggp> human IL4 promoter <END> containing a <START:ggp> mouse P sequence <END> , which is a <START:ggp> higher-affinity site <END> for <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> and a <START:ggp> lower-affinity site <END> for <START:ggp> RelA <END> . 
Thus , competition between two general <START:ggp> transcriptional activators <END> , <START:ggp> RelA <END> and <START:ggp> NF-ATp <END> , mediates the inhibitory effect of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> stimulation on <START:ggp> IL4 <END> expression and may contribute to differential gene expression in <START:ana> TH cells <END> . 
Regulation of the balance of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production and the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( <START:ggp> STAT <END> ) transcription factor activity by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and inflammatory synovial fluids . 
The balance between type 1 and 2 T helper cell cytokine production plays an important role in several animal models of autoimmunity , and skewed patterns of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> expression have been described in human inflammatory diseases . 
Many <START:ggp> cytokines <END> activate <START:ggp> signal transducer and activation of transcription ( STAT ) transcription factors <END> , which , in turn , activate transcription of inflammatory effector genes . 
We used <START:ana> mononuclear cell priming cultures <END> and <START:ana> inflammatory synovial fluids <END> ( <START:ana> SFs <END> ) derived from arthritis patients to examine the regulation of <START:ggp> cytokine <END> production and <START:ggp> STAT <END> activity by an inflammatory synovial microenvironment . 
Exposure to <START:ana> SFs <END> during priming resulted in an 81 % inhibition of <START:ggp> interferon ( IFN ) -gamma <END> , but not <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL ) 4 <END> , production by <START:ana> effector cells <END> generated in priming cultures . 
SF suppression was mediated by <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> and inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> expression , and it was reversed in a dominant fashion by exogenous IL-12 . 
<START:ana> SFs <END> blocked the sustained activity of <START:ggp> transcription factor Stat1 <END> , but not <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> , during the priming period , and <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> activity was differentially regulated by <START:ggp> cytokines <END> in parallel with their positive or negative regulation of <START:ggp> IFN-gamma <END> production . 
Active <START:ggp> Stat3 <END> , but not <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> , was detected in cells from inflamed joints . 
These results suggest a role for altered balance of Stat1 and Stat3 transcriptional activity in the regulation of <START:ana> T cell <END> differentiation and in the pathogenesis of inflammatory synovitis . 
Triggering of <START:ggp> complement receptors <END> <START:ggp> CR1 <END> ( <START:ggp> CD35 <END> ) and <START:ggp> CR3 <END> ( <START:ggp> CD11b/CD18 <END> ) induces nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> ) in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and enhances viral replication in <START:ana> HIV-infected monocytic cells <END> . 
<START:ana> Monocyte/macrophages <END> may harbor HIV in a nonproductive fashion for prolonged periods of time . 
Viral gene expression may be reactivated by stimulation of the cells with LPS or <START:ggp> cytokines <END> such as <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> in vitro . 
The effect of LPS and <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> is mediated by their ability to induce nuclear translocation of the <START:ggp> DNA-binding heterodimer <END> <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> ) , which binds to a specific sequence in the <START:ggp> HIV-long terminal repeat <END> . 
The present study demonstrates that triggering of <START:ggp> complement receptors <END> <START:ggp> CR1 <END> ( <START:ggp> CD35 <END> ) and <START:ggp> CR3 <END> ( <START:ggp> CD11b/CD18 <END> ) enhances viral replication in <START:ana> HIV-infected human monocytic cells <END> . 
<START:ana> Monocytic cell lines <END> and normal peripheral blood monocytes were infected with HIV-1 in vitro and cultured in the presence or absence of <START:ggp> F ( ab ' ) 2 fragments <END> of <START:ggp> monoclonal anti-CR1 <END> or <START:ggp> anti-CR3 Abs <END> or with <START:ggp> C3 fragments <END> . 
Stimulation of <START:ggp> CR1 <END> or <START:ggp> CR3 <END> induces a two- to fourfold increase in the amount of cell-associated and released <START:ggp> p24 Ag <END> in <START:ana> cell cultures <END> that was equivalent to that observed in <START:ana> control cultures <END> triggered with LPS . 
We further observed that stimulation of <START:ggp> CR1 <END> or <START:ggp> CR3 <END> induces the nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> in <START:ana> infected cells <END> . 
Translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> was also observed following stimulation of <START:ggp> CR1 <END> or <START:ggp> CR3 <END> of <START:ana> uninfected peripheral blood monocytes <END> from HIV-seronegative donors . 
The amount of protein translocated was similar to that observed when cells were stimulated with <START:ggp> rhTNF-alpha <END> . 
<START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> did not mediate the translocation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> <START:ggp> p50/p65 <END> induced by triggering of <START:ggp> complement receptors <END> . 
Taken together , these observations suggest that HIV gene expression may be activated in <START:ana> infected monocytes <END> through interaction of the cells with <START:ggp> complement-opsonized particles <END> and that enhanced viral replication is associated with <START:ggp> C3 receptor <END> -mediated nuclear translocation of the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B complex <END> . 
Attenuation of <START:ggp> gamma interferon <END> -induced tyrosine phosphorylation in <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> infected with Leishmania donovani : selective inhibition of signaling through <START:ggp> Janus kinases <END> and <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> . 
The induction of gene transcription in response to <START:ggp> gamma interferon <END> is impaired in <START:ana> mononuclear phagocytes <END> infected with Leishmania donovani , and the mechanisms involved are not fully understood . 
The changes in gene expression brought about by <START:ggp> gamma interferon <END> are thought to involve transient increases in the activities of <START:ggp> cellular protein tyrosine kinases <END> , including the <START:ggp> Janus kinases <END> <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> and <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> , leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor Stat1 <END> . 
To investigate the mechanisms accounting for the impaired responses to <START:ggp> gamma interferon <END> , a model system for examining overall changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation , activation of <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> and <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> and phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> was developed in <START:ana> phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated U-937 cells <END> . 
Analysis of whole-cell lysates by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting showed that incubation with <START:ggp> gamma interferon <END> brought about specific increases in phosphotyrosine labeling of several proteins . 
Increased labeling of these proteins occurred to similar extents in <START:ana> control cells <END> and in cells that had been infected with L. donovani for 16 h . 
<START:ggp> Jak1 <END> , <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> , and <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> were immunoprecipitated from control and <START:ana> interferon-treated cells <END> , and tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins , detected by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting was used to measured their activation . 
Tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> , <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> , and <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> increased markedly , in a dose-dependent manner , in <START:ana> U-937 cells <END> incubated with <START:ggp> gamma interferon <END> . 
In contrast , in cells infected with L. donovani , tyrosine phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak1 <END> , <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> , and <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> was markedly impaired . 
This effect was dependent upon the duration of exposure to L. donovani and was maximal and complete at 16 h . 
Results similar to those observed with <START:ana> U-937 cells <END> were also obtained with <START:ana> human peripheral blood monocytes <END> . 
These findings indicate that infection of <START:ana> human mononuclear phagocytes <END> with L. donovani leads to impaired <START:ggp> gamma interferon <END> -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and selective effects on the Jak- <START:ggp> Stat1 <END> pathway . 
Unresponsiveness to <START:ggp> gamma interferon <END> for activation of this pathway may explain impaired transcriptional responses in <START:ana> leishmania-infected cells <END> . 
Mutually exclusive interaction of a novel <START:ggp> matrix attachment region binding protein <END> and the <START:ggp> NF-muNR enhancer repressor <END> . 
Implications for regulation of <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy chain <END> expression . 
The <START:ggp> immunoglobulin heavy chain <END> ( <START:ggp> IgH <END> ) intronic enhancer stimulates transcription from functional promoters in B lymphocytes but not other cell types . 
The observation that binding sites for the <START:ggp> nuclear factor-mu negative regulator ( NF-muNR ) enhancer repressor overlap nuclear matrix attachment regions <END> ( <START:ggp> MARs <END> ) in this <START:ggp> enhancer <END> has lead to the hypothesis that the cell type specificity of the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> might be controlled by regulating nuclear matrix attachment ( Scheuermann , R. H. , and Chen , U. ( 1989 ) Genes & Dev. 3 , 1255-1266 ) . 
To understand the role of <START:ggp> MARs <END> in <START:ggp> IgH enhancer <END> regulation , we have identified a novel <START:ggp> MAR-binding protein <END> , <START:ggp> MAR-BP1 <END> , from soluble nuclear matrix preparations based on its ability to bind to the <START:ggp> MARs <END> associated with the <START:ggp> IgH enhancer <END> . 
Purified <START:ggp> MAR-BP1 <END> migrates as a <START:ggp> 33-kDa protein <END> , and it can be found in nuclear matrix preparations from a number of different types of <START:ana> lymphoid cell lines <END> . 
Although specific binding sites have been difficult to localize by chemical or enzymatic footprinting procedures , <START:ggp> NF-muNR <END> binding sites are critical for efficient <START:ggp> MAR-BP1 <END> binding . 
Indeed , binding of the <START:ggp> IgH enhancer <END> to either intact nuclear matrix preparations or to <START:ggp> MAR-BP1 <END> is mutually exclusive to <START:ggp> NF-muNR <END> binding . 
These results are consistent with a model for cell-type specific regulation in which binding of the <START:ggp> NF-muNR repressor <END> to the <START:ggp> IgH enhancer <END> prevents nuclear matrix attachment in inappropriate cells by interfering with <START:ggp> MAR-BP1 <END> <START:ggp> /enhancer <END> interaction . 
<START:ggp> PU.1 <END> ( <START:ggp> Spi-1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> C/EBP alpha <END> regulate expression of the <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor alpha gene <END> . 
<START:ggp> Growth factor receptors <END> play an important role in hematopoiesis . 
In order to further understand the mechanisms directing the expression of these key regulators of hematopoiesis , we initiated a study investigating the <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> activating the expression of the <START:ggp> granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) receptor alpha gene <END> . 
Here , we demonstrate that the <START:ggp> human GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter <END> directs <START:ggp> reporter gene <END> activity in a tissue-specific fashion in <START:ana> myelomonocytic cells <END> , which correlates with its expression pattern as analyzed by reverse transcription PCR . 
The <START:ggp> GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter <END> contains an important functional site between positions -53 and -41 as identified by deletion analysis of <START:ggp> reporter constructs <END> . 
We show that the myeloid and <START:ggp> B cell transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> binds specifically to this site . 
Furthermore , we demonstrate that a <START:ggp> CCAAT site <END> located upstream of the <START:ggp> PU.1 site <END> between positions -70 and -54 is involved in positive-negative regulation of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter <END> activity . 
<START:ggp> C/EBP alpha <END> is the major <START:ggp> CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein <END> ( <START:ggp> C/EBP <END> ) form binding to this site in nuclear extracts of <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
Point mutations of either the <START:ggp> PU.1 site <END> or the <START:ggp> C/EBP site <END> that abolish the binding of the respective factors result in a significant decrease of <START:ggp> GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter <END> activity in <START:ana> myelomonocytic cells <END> only . 
Furthermore , we demonstrate that in myeloid and B cell extracts , <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> forms a novel , specific , more slowly migrating complex ( <START:ggp> PU-SF <END> ) when binding the <START:ggp> GM-CSF receptor alpha <END> promoter <START:ggp> PU.1 site <END> . 
This is the first demonstration of a specific interaction with <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> on a <START:ggp> myeloid PU.1 binding site <END> . 
The novel complex is distinct from that described previously as binding to <START:ggp> B cell enhancer sites <END> and can be formed by addition of <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> to extracts from certain <START:ana> nonmyeloid cell types <END> which do not express <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> , including <START:ana> T cells <END> and <START:ana> epithelial cells <END> , but not from <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> . 
Furthermore , we demonstrate that the <START:ggp> PU-SF complex <END> binds to <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> sites found on a number of <START:ggp> myeloid promoters <END> , and its formation requires an intact <START:ggp> PU.1 site <END> adjacent to a single-stranded region . 
Expression of <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> in <START:ana> nonmyeloid cells <END> can activate the <START:ggp> GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter <END> . 
Deletion of the <START:ggp> amino-terminal region <END> of <START:ggp> PU.1 <END> results in a failure to form the <START:ggp> PU-SF <END> complex and in a concomitant loss of transactivation , suggesting that formation of the <START:ggp> PU-SF complex <END> is of functional importance for the activity of the <START:ggp> GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter <END> . 
Finally , we demonstrate that <START:ggp> C/EBP alpha <END> can also active the <START:ggp> GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter <END> in <START:ana> nonmyeloid cells <END> . 
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS ) 
<START:ggp> HMG-I <END> binds to <START:ggp> GATA motifs <END> : implications for an HPFH syndrome . 
We have examined binding of the <START:ggp> nuclear protein <END> <START:ggp> HMG-I <END> to the <START:ggp> human gamma-globin promoter <END> . 
We find that <START:ggp> HMG-I <END> binds preferentially to the more 3 ' of a pair of <START:ggp> GATA motifs <END> in the <START:ggp> gamma-globin promoter <END> ; this paired motif is bound by the <START:ggp> erythroid factor GATA-1 <END> . 
A naturally occurring mutation ( -175 T-C ) in the area bound by <START:ggp> HMG-I <END> results in overexpression of <START:ggp> gamma-globin <END> in <START:ana> adult red blood cells <END> ( <START:ana> HPFH <END> ) and up-regulation of the <START:ggp> gamma-globin promoter <END> in in vitro expression assays ; <START:ggp> HMG-I <END> does not bind to this <START:ggp> mutant sequence <END> . 
A survey of <START:ggp> GATA motifs <END> from other <START:ggp> globin cis-elements <END> demonstrates <START:ggp> HMG-I <END> binding to most of them . 
These findings implicate <START:ggp> HMG-I <END> in the <START:ana> HPFH <END> phenotype ; we speculate that it may participate in the formation of <START:ggp> multiprotein complexes <END> that regulate globin gene expression . 
Constitutive activation of different <START:ggp> Jak tyrosine kinases <END> in <START:ggp> human T cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) tax protein <END> or <START:ana> virus-transformed cells <END> . 
HTLV-1 infection causes an adult T cell leukemia in humans . 
The <START:ggp> viral encoded protein <END> <START:ggp> tax <END> , is thought to play an important role in oncogenesis . 
Our previous data obtained from a <START:ggp> tax <END> transgenic mouse model revealed that <START:ggp> tax <END> transforms <START:ana> mouse fibroblasts <END> but not <START:ana> thymocytes <END> , despite comparable levels of <START:ggp> tax <END> expression in both tissues . 
Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of a <START:ggp> 130-kD protein <END> ( s ) was observed in the <START:ggp> tax <END> <START:ana> transformed fibroblast B line <END> and in <START:ana> HTLV-1 transformed human lymphoid lines <END> , but not in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> from Thy-tax transgenic mice . 
Phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis with a set of <START:ggp> Jak kinase specific antibodies <END> , identified p130 as <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> in the <START:ggp> tax <END> transformed <START:ana> mouse fibroblastic cell line <END> and <START:ggp> Jak3 <END> in <START:ana> HTLV-1 transformed human T cell lines <END> . 
Phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak2 <END> in <START:ana> tax transformed cells <END> resulted from high expression of IL-6 . 
Tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein could also be induced in <START:ana> Balb/c3T3 cells <END> using a supernatant from the <START:ana> B line <END> , which was associated with induction of cell proliferation . 
Both phosphorylation and proliferation were inhibited by <START:ggp> IL-6 neutralizing antibodies <END> . 
Constitutive phosphorylation of <START:ggp> Jak kinases <END> may facilitate tumor growth in both <START:ana> HTLV-1 infected human T cells <END> and the transgenic mouse model . 
Regulation of <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> expression by hydroxyurea in <START:ana> human K562 cells <END> during erythroid differentiation [ published erratum appears in Biochim Biophys Acta 1995 Dec 27 ; 1264 ( 3 ) : 409 ] 
Hydroxyurea ( HU ) is an antitumor agent which also induces hemoglobinization during erythroid differentiation . 
In addition , HU stimulates the synthesis of <START:ggp> fetal hemoglobin <END> in sickle cell anemia patients . 
To further understand its mechanism of action , we investigated the effects of HU on regulation of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> expression prior to the onset of erythroid differentiation of <START:ana> K562 cells <END> . 
HU induced a dose-dependent stimulation of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> synthesis . 
The levels of <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> was elevated 4 to 7.5-fold by HU within 2 h . 
This was followed by a gradual decline to the basal level by 24 h . 
Both nuclear run-on and actinomycin D pulse experiments strongly indicate that HU regulates <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> expression by increasing the rate of synthesis as well as stabilizing the <START:ana> c-jun mRNA <END> . 
In addition , the level of <START:ggp> jun protein <END> was elevated by 2 to 5-fold within 4 h in <START:ana> HU treated cells <END> . 
Furthermore , concentrations of HU below 250 microM slightly increased the 5X <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> <START:ggp> /CAT <END> activity . 
These results strongly suggest that HU induces both transcriptional and post-transcription regulation of <START:ggp> c-jun <END> during erythroid differentiation . 
In vivo and in vitro effects of glucocorticoids on lymphocyte proliferation in man : relationship to <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptors <END> . 
Interrelations between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system ( HPA ) and the immune system represent a well-documented biological phenomenon . 
While in vitro administration of glucocorticoids may inhibit concanavalin A ( Con A ) - and phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) -induced T-cell proliferation , <START:ggp> pokeweed mitogen <END> ( <START:ggp> PWM <END> ) -driven B-cell mitogenesis is relatively resistant to glucocorticoids . 
To further explore the link between the HPA and the immune system in relation to <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> function , dose-response curves were obtained for Con A -and <START:ggp> PHA <END> -induced T-cell mitogenesis , <START:ggp> PWM <END> -generated B-cell mitogenesis and spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation in 13 healthy controls . 
Glucocorticoid effects were assessed in vivo by depletion of endogenous glucocorticoids after oral administration of 1.5 g metyrapone ( MET ) and subsequent glucocorticoid replacement , and in vitro by incubation of the cells with different doses of dexamethasone ( DEX ) . 
There was a significant decrease in <START:ggp> PWM <END> -induced B-cell mitogenesis and a more pronounced effect of DEX administered in vitro on spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation after MET treatment when compared with the DEX plus MET pretreated condition in vivo . 
These data suggest that the inhibition of spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation by glucocorticoids in vitro is related to <START:ggp> glucocorticoid receptor <END> function . 
The decrease in <START:ggp> PWM <END> -generated B-cell proliferation following cortisol depletion by MET may be seen in connection with impaired glucocorticoid-mediated induction of <START:ggp> interleukin-1 receptor <END> synthesis . 
Transcription specific differences visualized by fluorescence in situ hybridization pattern on interphase nuclei of different cell types . 
Application of a `` formamide free '' and thus `` material preserving '' in situ hybridization technique using the <START:ggp> cDNA <END> of the <START:ggp> myf3 gene <END> revealed the following results : <START:ana> Human rhabdomyosarcoma cells <END> , characterized by a high expression of <START:ggp> myf3 <END> show intensive hybridization signals in their interphase . 
<START:ggp> RNase <END> treatment prior to hybridization considerably reduces the size of this signals . 
In comparison , isolated nuclei of <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> in which no need for the expression of this gene exists , show barely hybridization signals . 
Correspondingly , <START:ggp> RNase <END> treatment had no effect on hybridization pattern at all . 
In conclusion an increased transcription efficiency of a cell type specific gene is accompanied by a higher hybridization accessibility in the corresponding cell nuclei . 
Oncogenicity of <START:ana> human papillomavirus- or adenovirus-transformed cells <END> correlates with resistance to lysis by <START:ana> natural killer cells <END> . 
The reasons for the dissimilar oncogenicities of human adenoviruses and human papillomaviruses ( HPV ) in humans are unknown but may relate to differences in the capacities of the <START:ggp> E1A <END> and <START:ggp> E7 proteins <END> to <START:ana> target cells <END> for rejection by the <START:ana> host natural killer ( NK ) cell <END> response . 
As one test of this hypothesis , we compared the abilities of <START:ggp> E1A <END> -and <START:ggp> E7 <END> -expressing <START:ana> human fibroblastic or keratinocyte-derived human cells <END> to be selectively killed by either <START:ana> unstimulated <END> or <START:ana> interferon ( IFN ) -activated NK cells <END> . 
Cells expressing the <START:ggp> E1A oncoprotein <END> were selectively killed by <START:ana> unstimulated NK cells <END> , while the same <START:ana> parental cells <END> but expressing the HPV type 16 ( HPV-16 ) or HPV-18 <START:ggp> E7 oncoprotein <END> were resistant to NK cell lysis . 
The ability of <START:ana> IFN-activated NK cells <END> to selectively kill virally transformed cells depends on <START:ggp> IFN <END> 's ability to induce resistance to NK cell lysis in normal ( i.e. , <START:ana> non-viral oncogene-expressing <END> ) but not <START:ana> virally transformed cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> E1A <END> blocked <START:ggp> IFN <END> 's induction of cytolytic resistance , resulting in the selective lysis of <START:ana> adenovirus-transformed cells <END> by <START:ana> IFN-activated NK cells <END> . 
The extent of <START:ggp> IFN <END> -induced NK cell killing of <START:ana> E1A-expressing cells <END> was proportional to the level of <START:ggp> E1A <END> expression and correlated with the ability of <START:ggp> E1A <END> to block <START:ggp> IFN <END> -stimulated gene expression in <START:ana> target cells <END> . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> E7 <END> blocked neither <START:ggp> IFN <END> -stimulated gene expression nor <START:ggp> IFN <END> 's induction of cytolytic resistance , thereby precluding the selective lysis of <START:ana> HPV-transformed cells <END> by <START:ana> IFN-activated NK cells <END> . 
In conclusion , <START:ggp> E1A <END> expression marks cells for destruction by the host <START:ana> NK cell <END> response , whereas the <START:ggp> E7 oncoprotein <END> lacks this activity . 
Regulation of <START:ggp> IkB alpha <END> phosphorylation by PKC- and Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent signal transduction pathways . 
The <START:ggp> Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , a target of FK506 and CsA , synergizes with <START:ggp> PKC <END> -induced activation of <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B <END> in <START:ana> T cell lines <END> . 
We have investigated whether this synergy is present in other cell types and the mechanism ( s ) by which these two pathways lead to <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activation . 
While this synergy is present in other cell types , in the <START:ana> monocytic cell line U937 <END> <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> is also sufficient to activate <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> . 
Having previously shown that Ca ( 2+ ) - and PKC-dependent pathways synergize by accelerating the degradation of <START:ggp> IkB alpha <END> , we focused on the regulation of <START:ggp> IkB alpha <END> phosphorylation . 
While <START:ggp> PKC <END> -dependent pathways sequentially result in the phosphorylation and in an incomplete degradation of <START:ggp> IkB alpha <END> in <START:ana> T cell lines <END> , co-activation of Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent pathways accelerates the rate of <START:ggp> IkB alpha <END> phosphorylation and results in its complete degradation . 
Activation of Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent pathways alone do not result in the phosphorylation and/or degradation of <START:ggp> IkB alpha <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T <END> or in <START:ana> U937 cells <END> . 
Treatment of <START:ana> T cells <END> with the selective <START:ggp> PKC <END> inhibitor GF109203X abrogates the PMA-induced <START:ggp> IkB alpha <END> phosphorylation/degradation irrespective of activation of Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent pathways , but not the phosphorylation and degradation of <START:ggp> IkB alpha <END> induced by <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> , a <START:ggp> PKC <END> -independent stimulus . 
Contrary to the interaction with <START:ggp> PKC <END> , Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent pathways synergize with <START:ggp> TNF-alpha <END> not at the level of <START:ggp> IkB alpha <END> phosphorylation , but at the level of its degradation . 
These results indicate that Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent pathways , including the <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , participate in the regulation of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in a cell specific fashion and synergize with <START:ggp> PKC <END> -dependent and -independent pathways at the level of <START:ggp> IkB alpha <END> phosphorylation and degradation . 
Vitamin E therapy of acute CCl4-induced hepatic injury in mice is associated with inhibition of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> binding . 
Oxidative stress , with reactive oxygen intermediate formation , may represent a common mechanism by which liver injury is induced by diverse etiologies . 
Oxidative stress enhances <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) activity , and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity has been shown to enhance the expression of <START:ggp> cytotoxic cytokines <END> . 
Acute hepatic injury caused by reactive oxygen intermediate production was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 in mice . 
This injury was significantly inhibited by intravenous pretreatment of the mice with a water-soluble emulsion of alpha-tocopherol . 
Alpha-tocopherol treatment of the mice given the CCl4 also reduced the <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding to levels approaching those found in normal mice . 
In vitro treatment of a monocyte/macrophage cell line with CCl4 led to enhanced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding and an increase in <START:ana> tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) messenger RNA <END> levels . 
Liver specimens taken from patients with acute fulminant hepatitis had markedly increased <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding activity in comparison with the binding of normal livers . 
These data demonstrate that abolishing acute hepatic injury with alpha-tocopherol , a free radical scavenger , also eliminated increased <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> binding . 
It is tempting to speculate that enhanced <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> expression caused by free radical production/oxidative stress may modulate liver injury , perhaps through an effect on <START:ggp> cytotoxic cytokine <END> synthesis . 
Immunosuppression by glucocorticoids : inhibition of <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activity through induction of <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> synthesis [ see comments ] 
Glucocorticoids are among the most potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents . 
They inhibit synthesis of almost all known <START:ggp> cytokines <END> and of several <START:ggp> cell surface molecules <END> required for immune function , but the mechanism underlying this activity has been unclear. Here it is shown that glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of <START:ggp> nuclear factor kappa B <END> ( <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> ) activation in mice and <START:ana> cultured cells <END> . 
This inhibition is mediated by induction of the <START:ggp> I kappa B <END> alpha inhibitory protein , which traps activated <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> in <START:ggp> inactive cytoplasmic complexes <END> . 
Because <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> activates many <START:ggp> immunoregulatory genes <END> in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli , the inhibition of its activity can be a major component of the anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoids . 
Transcriptional repression of the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 gene <END> by vitamin D3 : direct inhibition of <START:ggp> NFATp/AP-1 complex <END> formation by a <START:ggp> nuclear hormone receptor <END> . 
T-lymphocyte proliferation is suppressed by 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ] , the active metabolite of vitamin D3 , and is associated with a decrease in interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , gamma interferon , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA levels . 
We report here that 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3-mediated repression in <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> is cycloheximide resistant , suggesting that it is a direct transcriptional repressive effect on <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression by the <START:ggp> vitamin D3 receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> VDR <END> ) . 
We therefore examined vitamin D3-mediated repression of activated <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression by cotransfecting <START:ana> Jurkat cells <END> with <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter/reporter constructs <END> and a <START:ggp> VDR overexpression vector <END> and by DNA binding . 
We delineated an element conferring both DNA binding by the receptor in vitro and 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3-mediated repression in vivo to a short <START:ggp> 40-bp region <END> encompassing an important <START:ggp> positive regulatory element <END> , <START:ggp> NF-AT-1 <END> , which is bound by a <START:ggp> T-cell-specific transcription factor <END> , <START:ggp> NFATp <END> , as well as by <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> . 
<START:ggp> VDR DNA-binding mutants <END> were unable to either bind to this element in vitro or repress in vivo ; the <START:ggp> VDR DNA-binding domain <END> alone , however , bound the element but also could not repress <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> expression . 
These results indicate that DNA binding by <START:ggp> VDR <END> is necessary but not sufficient to mediate <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> repression . 
By combining <START:ggp> partially purified proteins <END> in vitro , we observed the loss of the bound <START:ggp> NFATp/AP-1-DNA complex <END> upon inclusion of <START:ggp> VDR <END> or <START:ggp> VDR-retinoid X receptor <END> . 
Order of addition and off-rate experiments indicate that the <START:ggp> VDR-retinoid X receptor heterodimer <END> blocks <START:ggp> NFATp/AP-1 complex <END> formation and then stably associates with the <START:ggp> NF-AT-1 element <END> . 
This direct inhibition by a nuclear hormone receptor of <START:ggp> transcriptional activators <END> of the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> may provide a mechanistic explanation of how vitamin derivatives can act as potent immunosuppressive agents . 
Tissue-specific regulation of the <START:ggp> rabbit 15-lipoxygenase gene <END> in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> by a <START:ggp> transcriptional silencer <END> . 
The <START:ggp> 15-lipoxygenase ( lox ) gene <END> is expressed in a tissue-specific manner , predominantly in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> but also in <START:ana> airway epithelial cells <END> and <START:ana> eosinophils <END> . 
We demonstrate in this report that the <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking DNA <END> of the <START:ggp> 15-lox gene <END> contains sequences which down-regulate its activity in a variety of <START:ana> non-erythroid cell lines <END> but not in two <START:ana> erythroid cell lines <END> . 
The element has characteristics of a <START:ggp> transcriptional 'silencer ' <END> since it functions in both orientations . 
The main activity of the <START:ggp> silencer <END> has been mapped to the first 900 bp of <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking DNA <END> , which contains nine binding sites for a <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> present in non- <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> but not in <START:ana> erythroid cells <END> . 
These binding sites have similar sequences and multiple copies of the <START:ggp> binding sites <END> confer tissue-specific down-regulation when attached to a <START:ggp> minimal lox promoter fragment <END> . 
The <START:ggp> 5 ' flanking DNA <END> also contains a cluster of three <START:ggp> binding sites <END> for the <START:ggp> GATA family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Phosphorylation of the <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> NFATp <END> inhibits its DNA binding activity in <START:ana> cyclosporin A-treated human B <END> and <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) exerts its immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting the activity of <START:ggp> nuclear factor <END> of activated <START:ana> T cells <END> ( <START:ggp> NFAT <END> ) , thus preventing transcriptional induction of several cytokine genes . 
This effect is thought to be largely mediated through inactivation of the phosphatase <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> , which in turn inhibits translocation of an <START:ggp> NFAT <END> component to the nucleus . 
Here we report that CsA treatment of <START:ana> Raji B <END> and <START:ana> Jurkat T cell lines <END> yields a phosphorylated form of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> that is inhibited in DNA-binding and in its ability to form an <START:ggp> NFAT complex <END> with <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> . 
Immunoblot analyses and metabolic labeling with [ 32P ] orthophosphate show that CsA alters <START:ggp> NFATp <END> migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by increasing its phosphorylation level without affecting subcellular distribution . 
Dephosphorylation by in vitro treatment with <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> or <START:ggp> alkaline phosphatase <END> restores <START:ggp> NFATp <END> DNA binding activity and its ability to reconstitute an <START:ggp> NFAT complex <END> with <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun <END> proteins . 
These data point to a new mechanism for CsA-sensitive regulation of <START:ggp> NFATp <END> in which dephosphorylation is critical for DNA binding . 
<START:ggp> Transcription factors <END> as targets for oxidative signalling during lymphocyte activation . 
We previously have demonstrated a requirement for oxidative events during cell cycle entry in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> and have hypothesised that reactive oxygen species may act as intracellular signalling agents during lymphocyte activation . 
In the current study , cysteamine , an aminothiol compound with antioxidant activity , has been used to further investigate the role of oxidative signalling during lymphocyte activation . 
Treatment of normal <START:ana> human peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> with cysteamine in vitro was found to inhibit proliferation in a dose-dependent manner , with essentially complete inhibition occurring at a dose of 400 microM . 
This inhibitory effect was limited to the first 2 h after mitogenic activation , localizing the time-frame of action of cysteamine to within the commitment period . 
It therefore was of interest to establish which , if any , commitment events were affected by oxidative signalling during cell cycle entry . 
Taking the <START:ggp> IL-2 gene <END> as a candidate , we examined the effect of cysteamine treatment on <START:ggp> early gene <END> expression during lymphocyte activation , and on the activity of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> , <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> , <START:ggp> NF-AT <END> and <START:ggp> Oct1 <END> , whose functions are required for expression of the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> mRNA . 
Cysteamine treatment inhibited both expression of the <START:ana> IL-2 mRNA <END> and secretion of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> into the culture medium . 
The inhibitory effect of cysteamine may be mediated at least in part by an effect on <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> function , as the DNA binding activities of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> and <START:ggp> NF-kappa B <END> extracted from <START:ana> mitogen-stimulated cells <END> were significantly inhibited by cysteamine treatment . 
Interestingly , Oct1 and NF-AT DNA binding activity were not affected by cysteamine treatment , suggesting that oxidative signalling processes operate in a selective manner . 
The identification of <START:ggp> regulatory proteins <END> , such as <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> , as molecular targets for oxidative signalling provides further evidence to implicate oxidative signalling as being intimately involved in the G0 to G1 phase transition in <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Sex and age distribution of <START:ggp> 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptors <END> in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> from normal human subjects . 
Specific receptors for 1 , 25 Dihydroxyvitamin D3 have been described in human <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> ( <START:ana> PBMC <END> ) . 
We have tried to find out whether these receptors could show any difference in sex or age distribution . 
Twenty two healthy men aged 21-66 yr ( mean +/- SD 41.0 +/- 13.6 ) and nineteen healthy women aged 22-60 yr ( 38.9 +/- 13.9 ) have been studied . 
The mean dissociation constant ( Kd ) was similar in both sexes ( 1.35 +/- 0.70 x 10 ( -10 ) M in males , 1.13 +/- 0.66 x 10 ( -10 ) M in females ) , but the concentration of binding sites ( Nmax ) was significantly lower in females ( 2.32 +/- 0.92 fmol/10 ( 7 ) <START:ana> PBMC <END> vs 4.43 +/- 1.38 fmol/10 ( 7 ) <START:ana> PBMC <END> in males ; p = 0.0001 ) . 
Neither Kd nor Nmax were significantly correlated with age . 
No difference was found between pre and postmenopausal women . 
Further studies are needed to elucidate if this sex difference in <START:ggp> PBMC receptors <END> for 1.25 Dihydroxyvitamin D3 is of any pathophysiological relevance . 
Expression of Id2 and Id3 mRNA in <START:ana> human lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ggp> Helix-loop-helix ( HLH ) transcription factors <END> are involved in cellular growth and differentiation . 
The <START:ggp> Id <END> ( inhibitor of DNA binding and differentiation ) <START:ggp> HLH proteins <END> , in a dominantly negative fashion , regulate transcriptional activities of <START:ggp> basic HLH proteins <END> . 
We examined by northern hybridization the expression of <START:ana> Id2 and Id3 mRNA <END> in <START:ana> human leukemia/lymphoma lines <END> and patient samples , as well as resting and <START:ana> activated normal human lymphocytes <END> from peripheral blood ( <START:ana> PBL <END> ) . 
The <START:ana> Id2 mRNA <END> was abundantly expressed in <START:ana> 5/12 T-cell <END> and <START:ana> 3/4 B-cell lines <END> , and <START:ana> Id3 mRNA <END> was detected in <START:ana> 4/12 T-cell <END> and <START:ana> 3/4 B-cell lines <END> . 
Interestingly , <START:ana> Id2 <END> , but not <START:ana> Id3 <END> , mRNA was strongly expressed in <START:ana> 4/5 T-cell lines <END> infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) ( <START:ana> ATL-1k <END> , <START:ana> MT-2 <END> , <START:ana> S-LB1 <END> ) and type II ( <START:ana> Mo <END> ) . 
Another unexpected finding was that T-cell leukemias and <START:ana> T-cell lines <END> often expressed either <START:ana> Id2 <END> or <START:ana> Id3 mRNA <END> . 
In addition , <START:ana> resting PBL <END> constitutively expressed prominent levels of <START:ana> Id2 mRNA <END> , but not <START:ana> Id3 mRNA <END> . 
Upon <START:ggp> PHA <END> -stimulation , <START:ggp> Id2 <END> expression decreased and <START:ggp> Id3 <END> levels increased with biphasic kinetics . 
Taken together , our studies revealed three unexpected findings which require further analysis : ( 1 ) expression of <START:ana> Id2 mRNA <END> is often associated with lymphocytic transformation by HTLV-I or -II ; ( 2 ) T-cells usually express either <START:ggp> Id2 <END> or <START:ana> Id3 mRNA <END> , but B-cells often express both simultaneously ; ( 3 ) non-dividing , normal <START:ana> PBL <END> express high levels of <START:ggp> Id2 <END> and no <START:ana> Id3 mRNA <END> ; and with the onset of cellular proliferation , levels of <START:ana> Id2 mRNA <END> decrease while levels of <START:ana> Id3 mRNA <END> increase , suggesting that regulation of expression of these closely related <START:ggp> genes <END> is disparate . 
Salicylates inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced transcriptional activation of the tissue factor gene in <START:ana> human monocytic cells <END> . 
Binding of <START:ggp> plasma Factor VII/VIIa <END> to the <START:ggp> tissue factor ( TF ) receptor <END> initiates the <START:ggp> coagulation protease <END> cascades . 
TF expression by <START:ana> circulating monocytes <END> is associated with thrombotic and inflammatory complications in a variety of diseases . 
Transcriptional activation of the <START:ggp> human TF gene <END> in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is mediated by binding of <START:ggp> c-Rel/p65 heterodimers <END> to a <START:ggp> kappa B site <END> in the <START:ggp> TF promoter <END> . 
Here , we report that a family of anti-inflammatory agents , known as the salicylates , inhibited LPS induction of TF activity and <START:ggp> TF gene <END> transcription in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> and <START:ana> monocytic THP-1 cells <END> at clinically relevant doses . 
Furthermore , sodium salicylate blocked the LPS-induced proteolytic degradation of <START:ggp> I kappa B alpha <END> , which prevented the nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> c-Rel/p65 heterodimers <END> . 
In contrast , two other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , ibuprofen and indomethacin , did not inhibit LPS induction of the <START:ggp> TF gene <END> . 
These results indicated that salicylates inhibited LPS induction of <START:ggp> TF gene <END> transcription in <START:ana> monocytic cells <END> by preventing nuclear translocation of <START:ggp> c-Rel/p65 heterodimers <END> . 
The clinical benefits of salicylates in the treatment of several diseases , including atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis , may be related to their ability to reduce monocyte gene expression . 
Activation of the signal transducer and transcription ( <START:ggp> STAT <END> ) signaling pathway in a primary T cell response . 
Critical role for <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> . 
The T cell activation is initiated by interaction of specific <START:ggp> Ags <END> with <START:ggp> TCR <END> , followed by activation of intracellular biochemical events leading to activation of several genes . 
The activation of signal transducer and activator of <START:ggp> transcription ( STAT ) proteins <END> in a primary <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated activation of <START:ana> T cells <END> have been explored . 
In <START:ana> purified human peripheral blood T cells <END> , <START:ggp> nuclear STAT proteins <END> were activated approximately 3 h after activation by cross-linked <START:ggp> anti-CD3 Abs <END> . 
These <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> were detected by using the <START:ggp> IFN-gamma-activated sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> GAS <END> ) and related oligonucleotides as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assay . 
Analysis of the nuclear extracts with <START:ggp> anti-STAT Abs <END> indicated that they contained <START:ggp> STAT-3 <END> and additional proteins crossreactive with the <START:ggp> STAT family <END> . 
The induction of <START:ggp> STAT <END> activity was inhibited completely by pretreatment with either cycloheximide or cyclosporin A , thus indicating that the induction was due to a <START:ggp> secondary factor <END> produced by the activated <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
As <START:ggp> neutralizing anti-IL-6 Abs <END> effectively down-regulated the early induction of <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> and as exogenously added <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> rapidly activated DNA binding similar to <START:ggp> TCR <END> -mediated bindings , it can be concluded that <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> is the factor responsible for the activation of <START:ggp> STAT proteins <END> in a primary T cell response . 
The normal cell cycle activation program is exploited during the infection of <START:ana> quiescent B lymphocytes <END> by Epstein-Barr virus . 
<START:ana> B lymphocytes <END> in the peripheral circulation are maintained in a non-proliferative state . 
Antigen recognition stimulates limited proliferation , whereas infection with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) results in continual proliferation and the outgrowth of <START:ana> immortal cell lines <END> . 
Because it is not clear at which point in cell cycle the <START:ana> peripheral B lymphocytes <END> are arrested , we characterized the expression of several <START:ggp> cell cycle-associated genes <END> in <START:ana> quiescent and stimulated cells <END> . 
We show that the expression of four <START:ggp> cell genes <END> , <START:ggp> cdc-2 <END> , <START:ggp> cyclin E <END> , <START:ggp> CD23 <END> , and <START:ggp> cyclin D2 <END> , are up-regulated approximately 100-fold as a result of EBV-mediated immortalization . 
Because these genes play a positive role in cell proliferation , we suggest that this regulatory switch contributes to controlling entry into the cell cycle . 
Transient stimulation of <START:ana> quiescent B lymphocytes <END> with either a cocktail of <START:ggp> anti-CD40 <END> , <START:ggp> anti-IgM <END> , and <START:ggp> IL4 <END> , or EBV results in the rapid expression of the same four genes , suggesting that , after infection , EBV exploits the normal program of <START:ana> B-lymphocyte <END> cell cycle activation . 
Expression of the <START:ggp> chemokine receptor <END> <START:ggp> BLR2/EBI1 <END> is specifically transactivated by <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 <END> . 
In our attempt to identify <START:ggp> chemokine receptors <END> that are related to <START:ggp> Burkitt 's lymphoma receptor 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> BLR1 <END> ) and are expressed in <START:ana> activated lymphocytes <END> we used RT-PCR resulting in the isolation of a cDNA encoding a <START:ggp> seven transmembrane receptor <END> termed <START:ggp> BLR2 <END> . 
The protein shows significant sequence similarities to the family of <START:ggp> G-protein coupled chemokine receptors <END> and turned out to be identical to the recently described <START:ggp> receptor EBI1 <END> . 
Northern blot analysis revealed that <START:ana> BLR2 mRNA <END> could be highly stimulated in <START:ana> mitogen- and anti-CD3-treated peripheral blood lymphocytes <END> . 
<START:ana> BLR2-specific mRNA <END> could be detected in all <START:ana> Epstein-Barr virus positive B cell lines <END> . 
We show that transcription of the <START:ggp> BLR2 gene <END> could be specifically induced in <START:ana> Epstein-Barr virus negative BL 41 cells <END> via estrogen-mediated activation of <START:ggp> Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 <END> , a key regulator of <START:ggp> viral and cellular genes <END> in <START:ana> immortalized B cells <END> . 
Our data suggest an involvement of <START:ggp> BLR2 <END> in the regulation of migration in <START:ana> activated lymphocytes <END> and in viral pathogenesis . 
A central role for a <START:ggp> single c-Myb binding site <END> in a <START:ggp> thymic locus control region <END> . 
<START:ggp> Locus control regions <END> ( <START:ggp> LCRs <END> ) are powerful assemblies of <START:ggp> cis elements <END> that organize the actions of <START:ggp> cell-type-specific trans-acting factors <END> . 
A <START:ggp> 2.3-kb LCR <END> in the <START:ggp> human adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) gene first intron <END> , which controls expression in <START:ana> thymocytes <END> , is composed of a <START:ggp> 200-bp enhancer domain <END> and extended flanking sequences that facilitate activation from within <START:ggp> chromatin <END> . 
Prior analyses have demonstrated that the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> contains a <START:ggp> 28-bp core region <END> and local adjacent augmentative <START:ggp> cis elements <END> . 
We now show that the core contains a single critical <START:ggp> c-Myb binding site <END> . 
In both <START:ana> transiently cotransfected human cells <END> and stable <START:ana> chromatin-integrated yeast cells <END> , <START:ggp> c-Myb <END> strongly <START:ggp> transactivated reporter constructs <END> that contained <START:ggp> polymerized core sequences <END> . 
<START:ggp> c-Myb protein <END> was strongly evident in <START:ana> T lymphoblasts <END> in which the <START:ggp> enhancer <END> was active and was localized within discrete nuclear structures . 
Fetal murine thymus exhibited a striking concordance of endogenous <START:ggp> c-myb <END> expression with that of <START:ggp> mouse ADA <END> and <START:ggp> human ADA LCR <END> -directed transgene expression . 
Point mutation of the <START:ggp> c-Myb site <END> within the intact <START:ggp> 2.3-kb LCR <END> severely attenuated enhancer activity in transfections and <START:ggp> LCR <END> activity in <START:ana> transgenic thymocytes <END> . 
Within the context of a <START:ggp> complex enhancer <END> and <START:ggp> LCR <END> , <START:ggp> c-Myb <END> can act as an organizer of <START:ggp> thymocyte-specific gene <END> expression via a single binding site . 
A <START:ggp> regulatory element <END> in the <START:ggp> human interleukin 2 gene promoter <END> is a <START:ggp> binding site <END> for the <START:ggp> zinc finger proteins <END> <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and <START:ggp> EGR-1 <END> . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene <END> after antigen recognition is a critical event for T cell proliferation and effector function . 
Prior studies have identified several <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> that contribute to the activity of the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> in <START:ana> stimulated T lymphocytes <END> . 
Here we describe a novel <START:ggp> regulatory element <END> within the <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> located immediately upstream of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NFAT ) domain <END> . 
This region ( termed the <START:ggp> zinc finger protein binding region <END> ( <START:ggp> ZIP <END> ) ) serves as binding site for two differently regulated <START:ggp> zinc finger proteins <END> : the <START:ggp> constitutively expressed transcription factor <END> <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> and the <START:ggp> inducible early growth response protein <END> <START:ggp> EGR-1 <END> . 
In <START:ana> unstimulated cells <END> which do not secrete <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> , only <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> binds to this region , while in <START:ana> stimulated IL-2 secreting cells <END> the <START:ggp> inducible EGR-1 protein <END> recognizes this element . 
In <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> , the <START:ggp> ZIP site <END> serves as an activator for <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> gene expression , and a combination of <START:ggp> ZIP <END> and <START:ggp> NFAT binding sites <END> is required for maximal <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activity . 
These results suggest a critical role of the <START:ggp> ZIP site <END> for <START:ggp> IL-2 promoter <END> activity . 
Activation of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 enhancer <END> by the <START:ggp> LEF-1 HMG protein <END> on <START:ggp> nucleosome-assembled DNA <END> in vitro . 
<START:ggp> Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> ) is a <START:ggp> regulatory high mobility group ( HMG ) protein <END> that activates the <START:ggp> T cell receptor alpha ( TCR alpha ) enhancer <END> in a context-restricted manner in <START:ana> T cells <END> . 
In this paper we demonstrate that the distal region of the <START:ggp> human immunodeficiency virus-1 ( HIV-1 ) enhancer <END> , which contains <START:ggp> DNA-binding sites <END> for <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> and Ets-1 , also provides a functional context for activation by <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> . 
First , we show that mutations in the <START:ggp> LEF-1-binding site <END> inhibit the activity of <START:ggp> multimerized copies <END> of the <START:ggp> HIV-1 enhancer <END> in <START:ana> Jurkat T cells <END> , and that <START:ggp> LEF-1/GAL4 <END> can activate a <START:ggp> GAL4-substituted HIV-1 enhancer <END> 80- to 100-fold in vivo . 
Second , <START:ggp> recombinant LEF-1 <END> is shown to activate HIV-1 transcription on <START:ggp> chromatin-assembled DNA <END> in vitro . 
By using a <START:ggp> nucleosome <END> -assembly system derived from Drosophila embryos , we find that the packaging of DNA into <START:ggp> chromatin <END> in vitro strongly represses HIV-1 transcription and that repression can be counteracted efficiently by preincubation of the DNA with <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> ( or <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> and <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> ) supplemented with fractions containing the <START:ggp> promoter-binding protein <END> , <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> . 
Addition of <START:ggp> TFE-3 <END> , which binds to an <START:ggp> E-box motif <END> upstream of the <START:ggp> LEF-1 and Ets-1 sites <END> , further augments transcription in this system . 
Individually or collectively , none of the three <START:ggp> enhancer-binding proteins <END> ( <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> , <START:ggp> Ets-1 <END> , and <START:ggp> TFE-3 <END> ) could activate transcription in the absence of <START:ggp> Sp1 <END> . 
A <START:ggp> truncation mutant <END> of <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> HMG-88 <END> ) , which contains the <START:ggp> HMG box <END> but lacks the <START:ggp> trans-activation domain <END> , did not activate transcription from <START:ggp> nucleosomal DNA <END> , indicating that bending of DNA by the <START:ggp> HMG domain <END> is not sufficient to activate transcription in vitro . 
We conclude that transcription activation by <START:ggp> LEF-1 <END> in vitro is a <START:ggp> chromatin <END> -dependent process that requires a functional <START:ggp> trans-activation domain <END> in addition to the <START:ggp> HMG domain <END> . 
<START:ggp> HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins <END> induce activation of activated <START:ggp> protein-1 <END> in <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> [ published erratum appears in J Biol Chem 1995 Dec 1 ; 270 ( 48 ) : 29038 ] 
Activation of <START:ana> CD4 positive T cells <END> is a primary requirement for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) entry , efficient HIV replication , and progression to AIDS , Utilizing <START:ana> CD4 positive T cell lines <END> and <START:ana> purified T cells <END> from normal individuals , we have demonstrated that <START:ggp> native envelope glycoproteins <END> of HIV , <START:ggp> gp 160 <END> , can induce activation of <START:ggp> transcription factor , activated protein-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> ) . 
The stimulatory effects of <START:ggp> gp160 <END> are mediated through the <START:ggp> CD4 molecule <END> , since treatment of <START:ggp> gp160 <END> with soluble <START:ggp> CD4-IgG <END> abrogates its activity , and <START:ana> CD4 negative T cell lines <END> fail to be stimulated with <START:ggp> gp160 <END> . 
Immunoprecipitation of the <START:ggp> gp 160 <END> -induced nuclear extracts with <START:ggp> polyclonal antibodies <END> to <START:ggp> Fos <END> and <START:ggp> Jun proteins <END> indicates that <START:ggp> AP-1 complex <END> is comprised of members of these family of proteins . 
The <START:ggp> gp160-induced AP-1 complex <END> is dependent upon protein tyrosine phosphorylation and is protein synthesis-independent . 
This stimulation can also be abolished by inhibitors of <START:ggp> protein kinase C <END> , but it is unaffected by calcium channel blocker or cyclosporine A . 
This <START:ggp> gp160 <END> treatment adversely affects the functional capabilities of <START:ana> T cells <END> : pre-treatment of <START:ana> CD4+ T cells <END> with <START:ggp> gp160 <END> for 4 h at 37 degrees C inhibited <START:ggp> anti-CD3 <END> -induced <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> secretion . 
Effects similar to <START:ggp> gp160 <END> were seen with <START:ggp> anti-CD4 mAb <END> . 
The aberrant activation of <START:ggp> AP-1 <END> by <START:ggp> gp160 <END> in <START:ana> CD4 positive T cells <END> could result in up-regulation of <START:ggp> cytokines <END> containing <START:ggp> AP-1 sites <END> , e.g . <START:ggp> interleukin-3 <END> and <START:ggp> granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor <END> , and concurrently lead to <START:ana> T cell <END> unresponsiveness by inhibiting <START:ggp> interleukin-2 <END> secretion . 
High-dose growth hormone does not affect <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokine <END> ( <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin-6 <END> , and <START:ggp> interferon-gamma <END> ) release from activated <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> or after minimal to moderate surgical stress . 
High-dose GH therapy , with GH doses 10-20 times the normal replacement dose for GH-deficient adults , has been used as an anti-catabolic agent in a number of different patient groups . 
A recent study , however , has shown an increase in mortality in critically ill patients treated with high-dose GH . 
The increased mortality was associated with multiorgan failure , septic shock , and uncontrolled infection , suggesting that GH may have altered the immune response . 
The <START:ggp> GH receptor <END> and GH are both expressed in <START:ana> peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) <END> ; thus , GH could act as either an endocrine or an autocrine modulator of the immune response . 
We have examined the hypothesis that high-dose GH therapy may induce <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokines <END> , which are implicated in septic shock . 
To do this we measured cytokine production by <START:ana> PBMCs <END> incubated in conditions that simulated high-dose GH therapy , and we measured cytokine levels in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy who were randomized to receive either high-dose GH therapy ( 13 IU/m2 x day ) or placebo . 
To confirm the biological activity of GH in our cell culture system we used a Stat5 functional assay . 
In this assay GH induced a bell-shaped curve , with a maximal response at GH levels between 100-1 , 000 ng/mL . 
<START:ana> PBMCs <END> from healthy volunteers were incubated with GH in doses from 1-1 , 000 ng/mL for 6-72 h under resting conditions and after activation with endotoxin and the mixed <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> reaction . 
Studies were repeated with <START:ana> PBMCs <END> from six individuals using a GH dose of 100 ng/mL ( the level of GH found after high-dose GH therapy ) and an endotoxin dose that gave a submaximal response ( 0.01 ng/mL ) . 
GH had no effect on cell proliferation or the production of <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) <END> , or <START:ggp> interferon-gamma ( IFNgamma ) <END> . 
In patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy there was a time-related effect of surgery on cytokine levels . 
There was a rise in <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> and a fall in <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> at 24 h after surgery ; however , high-dose GH therapy had no effect on the cytokine response . 
We considered the possibility that endogenous GH production by <START:ana> PBMCs <END> could influence the cytokine response in activated <START:ana> PBMCs <END> ; however , incubation of <START:ana> PBMCs <END> in the presence of the <START:ggp> GH receptor <END> antagonist , B2036 , had no effect on <START:ggp> TNFalpha <END> , <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> , or <START:ggp> IFNgamma <END> production by <START:ana> PBMCs <END> in either the mixed <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> reaction or when activated by endotoxin . 
These results suggest that high-dose GH therapy does not alter the <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokine <END> response to surgery or endotoxin . 
The results do not exclude an effect of GH on the immune response , but they suggest that the mortality seen in critically ill patients may be due to factors other than immune modulation . 
Interaction between <START:ggp> interferon consensus sequence-binding protein <END> and <START:ggp> COP9/signalosome subunit CSN2 ( Trip15 ) <END> . 
A possible link between <START:ggp> interferon regulatory factor <END> signaling and the <START:ggp> COP9/signalosome <END> . 
<START:ggp> Interferon consensus sequence-binding protein ( ICSBP ) <END> is a member of the <START:ggp> interferon regulatory factors ( IRF ) <END> that has a pivotal role in mediating resistance to pathogenic infections in mice and in promoting the differentiation of <START:ana> myeloid cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> ICSBP <END> exerts some of its transcriptional activities via association with other factors that enable its binding to a variety of <START:ggp> promoters <END> containing <START:ggp> DNA composite elements <END> . 
These interactions are mediated through a specific <START:ggp> COOH-terminal domain <END> termed <START:ggp> IAD ( IRF association domain ) <END> . 
To gain a broader insight of the capacity of <START:ggp> ICSBP <END> to interact with other factors , yeast two-hybrid screens were performed using <START:ggp> ICSBP-IAD <END> as a bait against a B-cell cDNA library . 
<START:ggp> Trip15 <END> was identified as a specific interacting factor with <START:ggp> ICSBP <END> in <START:ana> yeast cells <END> , which was also confirmed by in vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and by coimmunoprecipitation studies in <START:ana> COS7 cells <END> . 
<START:ggp> Trip15 <END> was recently identified as a component of the <START:ggp> COP9/signalosome ( CSN ) complex <END> composed of eight evolutionary conserved subunits and thus termed <START:ggp> CSN2 <END> . 
This complex has a role in cell-signaling processes , which is manifested by its associated novel kinase activity and by the involvement of its subunits in regulating multiple cell-signaling pathways and cell-cycle progression . 
We show that in vitro association of <START:ggp> ICSBP <END> with the <START:ggp> CSN <END> leads to phosphorylation of <START:ggp> ICSBP <END> at a unique serine residue within its IAD . 
The phosphorylated residue is essential for efficient association with <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> and thus for the repressor activity of <START:ggp> ICSBP <END> exerted on <START:ggp> IRF-1 <END> . 
This suggests that the <START:ggp> CSN <END> has a role in integrating incoming signals that affect the transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> ICSBP <END> . 
Intrathymic T cell development and selection proceeds normally in the absence of glucocorticoid receptor signaling . 
Glucocorticoids are believed to play a role in <START:ana> T cell <END> development and selection , although their precise function is controversial . 
<START:ggp> Glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) <END> -deficient mice were used to directly investigate this problem . 
<START:ana> GR-deficient thymocytes <END> were resistant to dexamethasone-mediated apoptosis , confirming the absence of glucocorticoid responsiveness . 
An absence of GR signaling had no impact on <START:ana> thymocyte <END> development either in vivo or in vitro . 
<START:ana> T cell <END> differentiation , including positive selection , was normal as assessed by normal development of <START:ana> CD4+CD8+ , alphabetaTCR+CD4+ , and alphabetaTCR+CD8+ thymocytes <END> . 
Negative selection , mediated by the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B ( SEB ) , or <START:ggp> anti-CD3/CD28 <END> , was also normal in the absence of GR signaling . 
In contrast to earlier reports , these data demonstrate that GR signaling is not essential for intrathymic <START:ana> T cell <END> development or selection . 
Rapid polarization of <START:ana> Th2 cells <END> during induction of <START:ggp> antigen-specific IgE antibodies <END> in vitro . 
BACKGROUND : <START:ana> Type 2 T-helper cells ( Th2 ) <END> are involved in the regulation of the humoral immune response against antigens and allergens and directly affect which isotype will be produced . 
The mechanism that regulates antigen-specific <START:ggp> IgE <END> secretion and immune deviation is still not known . 
OBJECTIVES : To delineate mechanisms behind antigen-specific IgE secretion we have used in vitro immunization and focused on T-cell phenotype and the activation status of the <START:ggp> transcription factor NFkappaB <END> . 
METHODS : <START:ana> Peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBMC ) <END> from seronegative donors were immunized in vitro with a peptide consisting of both a <START:ana> T-cell <END> and a <START:ana> B-cell <END> epitope . 
RESULTS : Antigen-specific <START:ggp> IgE antibodies <END> could be detected after a primary immunization , during which <START:ana> T-helper cells <END> secreted <START:ggp> type 2 cytokines <END> . 
Specific <START:ggp> IgE <END> was also detected in the secondary immunization , but due to a rapid polarization from Th2 to Th1 phenotype , exogenous <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> was required for the specific <START:ggp> IgE <END> secretion . 
Analysis of NFkappaB activation in <START:ana> B and T cells <END> during primary and secondary immunization showed that <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> could be detected in both <START:ana> B and T cells <END> during primary immunization , but was dependent on exogenous <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> in the secondary immunization . 
CONCLUSION : This is the first evidence of antigen-specific <START:ggp> IgE <END> induction in vitro using <START:ana> naive B cells <END> , demonstrating the involvement of T-helper cell phenotype and <START:ggp> NFkappaB <END> and demonstrates the usefulness of in vitro cultures to study the effect of antigens on <START:ana> human immunocytes <END> . 
Pulmonary function changes and increased <START:ggp> Th-2 cytokine <END> expression and <START:ggp> nuclear factor kB <END> activation in the lung after sensitization and allergen challenge in brown Norway rats . 
BACKGROUND : Our purpose was to evaluate the expression of <START:ana> Th-1 and Th-2 related cytokine mRNA <END> and <START:ggp> nuclear factor ( NF ) kB <END> in the lung tissue of ovalbumin ( OA ) sensitized brown Norway rats ( BNR ) . 
We also evaluated the correlation between bronchial hyperreactivity ( BHR ) and <START:ana> eosinophils <END> with cytokine mRNA expression . 
METHODS : Eight BNR ( weight range 250-350 g ) were sensitized by inhaled OA ( group I ) with a 1-week interval between and then provoked with OA 1 week later . 
Pulmonary function tests ( PFT ) were performed at baseline and 24 h after acetylcholine challenge . 
Eight weight-matched normal BNR served as controls ( group II ) . 
All animals were anesthetized , paralyzed with gallamine , and ventilated via tracheostomy . 
They were given varying doses of acetylcholine ( 25 , 50 , 75 , 100 microg/kg ) injected through a jugular venous catheter . 
Five seconds after acetylcholine injections , PFTs were performed , including a maximal forced expiratory maneuver ( MFEM ) , airway opening pressure ( P ( ao ) ) at tidal breathing and total dynamic lung compliance ( C ( dyn ) ) . 
Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) was then performed with 20 ml normal saline divided into two doses . 
Thereafter , the lungs were removed and examined histologically . 
Total RNA was extracted from lung tissue samples and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers for mRNA of <START:ana> IL-4 <END> , <START:ana> IL-5 <END> , <START:ana> IL-10 <END> , <START:ana> interferon-gamma ( IFNr ) <END> and <START:ana> beta-actine <END> . 
RESULTS : Group I OA treated rats had typical airway obstruction on PFTs and airway inflammation on histological examination . 
Ratios of <START:ana> IL-4 <END> , <START:ana> IL-5 <END> , <START:ana> IL-10 <END> and inducible <START:ana> nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) mRNA <END> levels to <START:ana> beta-actine <END> as measured by densitometry were significantly lower in controls than in OA-sensitized rats . 
The IFNr mRNA to beta-actin ratio was significantly reduced in OA-sensitized rats . 
Group I demonstrated a band shift when compared with group II in electromobility shift assay ( EMSA ) for <START:ggp> NF-kB <END> indicating increased activation of this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> . 
CONCLUSION : <START:ana> Th-2 related cytokine mRNA <END> was increased but <START:ana> Th-1 related cytokine mRNA <END> was decreased in OA-sensitized BNR . 
An increased level of <START:ana> Th-2 related cytokine mRNA <END> correlated with decreased airflow and inflammatory changes . 
These results demonstrate the value of the BNR model for studying allergic asthma at the molecular level . 
3 , 5-Bis ( trifluoromethyl ) pyrazoles : a novel class of NFAT transcription factor regulator . 
A series of bis ( trifluoromethyl ) pyrazoles ( BTPs ) has been found to be a novel inhibitor of cytokine production . 
Identified initially as inhibitors of <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> synthesis , the BTPs have been optimized in this regard and even inhibit <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> production with a 10-fold enhancement over cyclosporine in an ex vivo assay . 
Additionally , the BTPs show inhibition of <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-5 <END> , <START:ggp> IL-8 <END> , and eotaxin production . 
Unlike the <START:ggp> IL-2 <END> inhibitors , cyclosporine and FK506 , the BTPs do not directly inhibit the dephosphorylation of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> by <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
A repression-derepression mechanism regulating the transcription of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in <START:ana> primary T cells <END> . 
BACKGROUND : Despite some controversy regarding the preferential infection and replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) , it appears that <START:ana> primary T lymphocytes <END> , in their quiescent state , are nonpermissive for viral expression and propagation . 
Massive activation of viral gene expression occurs only when the host <START:ana> lymphocyte <END> is activated . 
These observations prompted us to investigate the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 in resting or activated <START:ana> T cells <END> that were isolated from cord blood or adult peripheral blood . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS : To this end , we employed cellular purification and phenotyping techniques , in vitro protein-DNA binding studies , functional transactivation assays using proteins isolated from cord blood or adult peripheral blood <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> , and transfection experiments in <START:ana> primary T cells <END> . 
RESULTS : We showed that transcription from the HIV-1 <START:ggp> long terminal repeat <END> is repressed in <START:ana> resting naive T lymphocytes <END> ; whereas , <START:ana> mitogenically stimulated CD4+ cells <END> form an activator that derepresses transcription . 
Negative and positive regulation act through a <START:ggp> repressor-activator target sequence ( RATS ) <END> , which shares homology with the <START:ggp> interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) <END> <START:ggp> purine-rich response element <END> , through the adjacent binding site of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) <END> , and weakly , through the KB region . 
CONCLUSIONS : This regulation exerted by cellular transcription factors can account for several important features of HIV-1 expression in <START:ana> primary CD4+ cells <END> . 
Tight repression in <START:ana> resting naive T helper cells <END> may be a main cause of viral latency and transcriptional activation accounts for massive viral production in activated <START:ana> T lymphocytes <END> . 
Involvement of <START:ggp> lipopolysaccharide binding protein , CD14 <END> , and <START:ggp> Toll-like receptors <END> in the initiation of innate immune responses by Treponema glycolipids . 
Culture supernatants from Treponema maltophilum associated with periodontitis in humans and Treponema brennaborense found in a bovine cattle disease accompanied with cachexia caused a dose-dependent TNF-alpha synthesis in <START:ana> human monocytes <END> increasing with culture time . 
This activity could be reduced significantly by blocking the <START:ggp> CD14 <END> -part of the <START:ggp> LPS receptor <END> using the <START:ggp> My 4 mAb <END> and by <START:ggp> polymyxin B <END> . 
In the <START:ana> murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 <END> , Treponema culture supernatants induced TNF-alpha secretion in a <START:ggp> LPS binding protein ( LBP ) <END> -dependent fashion . 
To enrich for active compounds , supernatants were extracted with butanol , while whole cells were extracted using a phenol/water method resulting in recovery of material exhibiting a similar activity profile . 
An LPS-LBP binding competition assay revealed an interaction of the treponeme phenol/water extracts with <START:ggp> LBP <END> , while precipitation studies implied an affinity to <START:ggp> polymyxin B <END> and <START:ggp> endotoxin neutralizing protein <END> . 
<START:ana> Macrophages <END> obtained from C3H/HeJ mice carrying a <START:ggp> Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) -4 <END> mutation were stimulated with treponeme extracts for NO release to assess the role of <START:ggp> TLRs <END> in cell activation . 
Furthermore , NF-kappaB translocation in <START:ana> TLR-2-negative Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells <END> was studied . 
We found that phenol/water-extracts of the two strains use <START:ggp> TLRs <END> differently with <START:ana> T. brennaborense-stimulating cells <END> in a TLR-4-dependent fashion , while T. maltophilum-mediated activation apparently involved <START:ggp> TLR-2 <END> . 
These results indicate the presence of a novel class of glycolipids in Treponema initiating inflammatory responses involving <START:ggp> LBP <END> , <START:ggp> CD14 <END> , and <START:ggp> TLRs <END> . 
Integration of <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> and MEF2 signals by the <START:ggp> coactivator p300 <END> during T-cell apoptosis . 
<START:ggp> T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) <END> -induced thymocyte apoptosis is mediated by calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways leading to the transcriptional activation of members of the <START:ggp> Nur77 family <END> . 
The major <START:ggp> calcium- and calcineurin-responsive elements <END> in the <START:ggp> Nur77 promoter <END> are binding sites for <START:ggp> myocyte enhancer factor-2 ( MEF2 ) <END> . 
It has been shown that <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) <END> interacts with <START:ggp> MEF2D <END> and enhances its transcriptional activity , offering a plausible mechanism of activation of <START:ggp> MEF2D <END> by <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> . 
We report here that <START:ggp> NFATp <END> synergizes with <START:ggp> MEF2D <END> to recruit the <START:ggp> coactivator p300 <END> for the transcription of Nur77 . 
Surprisingly , the enhancement of transcriptional activity of <START:ggp> MEF2D <END> by <START:ggp> NFATp <END> does not require its DNA-binding activity , suggesting that <START:ggp> NFATp <END> acts as a coactivator for <START:ggp> MEF2D <END> . 
Transient co-expression of <START:ggp> p300 <END> , <START:ggp> MEF2D <END> , <START:ggp> NFATp <END> and constitutively active <START:ggp> calcineurin <END> is sufficient to recapitulate TCR signaling for the selective induction of the endogenous <START:ggp> Nur77 gene <END> . 
These results implicate <START:ggp> NFAT <END> as an important mediator of T-cell apoptosis and suggest that <START:ggp> NFAT <END> is capable of integrating the calcineurin signaling pathway and other pathways through direct protein-protein interaction with other <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> . 
Induction or suppression of a B cell-specific response to self antigen in vivo is dependent upon <START:ana> dendritic cell <END> activation via the TNF-alpha receptor at the time of antigen uptake . 
In this study we show that the <START:ggp> retinal autoantigen , S-antigen <END> , contains a functional <START:ggp> TNF-alpha homologous domain <END> which stimulates maturation and differentiation of <START:ana> cultured dendritic cells ( DC ) <END> or <START:ana> tissue DC <END> via the <START:ggp> p55 TNF-alpha receptor <END> . 
<START:ana> Tissue DC <END> became more dendritiform in shape , and migrated into culture supernatant . 
<START:ggp> S-antigen <END> also stimulated accumulation of <START:ggp> cell surface MHC class II antigen <END> with a corresponding loss of acidic intracellular vesicles , and induced <START:ana> IL-1beta and IL-12 mRNA <END> expression in <START:ana> cultured bone marrow-derived DC <END> . 
In addition , cultured <START:ana> splenic DC <END> primed immune responses to <START:ggp> S-antigen <END> in vivo in the absence of other , exogenous <START:ggp> cytokine <END> sources . 
<START:ana> DC <END> pulsed with either <START:ggp> retinal S-antigen <END> or another <START:ggp> retinal autoantigen <END> , <START:ggp> interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein ( IRBP ) <END> , were able to stimulate naive T cell proliferation in vitro , but only <START:ggp> S-antigen <END> -pulsed <START:ana> DC <END> were able to induce an immune response in vivo and initiate antibody class switching . 
In contrast , <START:ggp> IRBP <END> -pulsed <START:ana> DC <END> had no detectable in vivo priming effect and IgG antibody levels remained suppressed even after immunization with <START:ggp> IRBP <END> in complete Freund 's adjuvant . 
These results indicate that <START:ana> DC <END> from the same precursor population can either induce or suppress a B cell-specific response to self antigen in vivo , the outcome being dependent upon <START:ana> DC <END> activation at the time of antigen uptake
