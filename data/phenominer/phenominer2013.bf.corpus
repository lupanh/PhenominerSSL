Combined aortic and mitral stenosis in mucopolysaccharidosis type I-S ( Ullrich-Scheie syndrome ).
The genetic mucopolysaccharidosis syndromes ( MPS ) are <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inborn errors of metabolism <END> . Heart valve involvement in MPS is not uncommon but only a few case reports of successful cardiac surgery are available. In particular, reports of combined aortic and mitral stenosis associated with MPS type I-S are very rare. Both type I and type VI MPS are associated with significant left sided valvar heart disease that requires surgical valve replacement because of <START:PHENOTYPE> irregular valve thickening, fibrosis, and calcification <END> . A 35 year old man had severe mitral valve stenosis after successful surgical replacement of a stenotic aortic valve . Valvar heart disease was investigated by cardiac ultrasound and left heart catheterisation. Histomorphological characterisation of the affected mitral valve was performed. The case illustrates typically associated clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac and extracardiac abnormalities <END> found in MPS type I-S .
Cardiac anomalies in the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome .
Diverse cardiac abnormalities have been reported in patients with the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome ( SGBS ), and it is suspected that they are related to the apparently high incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> early death <END> . To clarify the incidence and significance of the various cardiac abnormalities , we reviewed 101 SGBS patients (89 from the literature, 12 new). All were male, except for one clearly affected female patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> translocation X;1 <END> [Punnett, 1994: Am J Med Genet 50: 391-393]. Ninety-six of 99 (97%) patients had the <START:PHENOTYPE> classic phenotype of macrosomia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> typical "coarse" face <END> . Thirty-six patients (36%) had a cardiac abnormality , of whom 26 (26%) had a cardiovascular malformation ( CVM ). After excluding 24 patients with insufficient clinical data, these percentages among the 77 informative cases were 47% and 34%, respectively. When grouped according to a mechanistic classification, most cases (20/ 26, or 77%) were class II CVMs (attributed to <START:PHENOTYPE> altered embryonic intracardiac flow <END> ). Other cardiac abnormalities included cardiomyopathy (n = 4) and <START:PHENOTYPE> electrocardiogram (ECG) conduction <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> rhythm abnormalities <END> (n = 12); three of the affected patients (25%) also had a CVM . Among 92 informative cases , there were 29 (32%) <START:PHENOTYPE> deaths <END> , a figure that excludes seven elective terminations. Among the 25 patients younger than 3 years, <START:PHENOTYPE> death <END> was associated with a cardiac abnormality in six (23%). <START:PHENOTYPE> GPC3 mutation <END> analysis using Southern blot testing and polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed for 37 of 101 (37%) patients . A <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> was detected in 26 of the 37 patients tested (70%), 12 of whom (46%) had a cardiac abnormality . We conclude that cardiac abnormalities of any type are common in SGBS (almost one-half of informative cases ), with CVMs seen in one-third of cases . The <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous ECG abnormalities <END> in this survey must be viewed with caution, since they may represent a genuine component of the syndrome or reporting bias. Determining the true prevalence and natural history of cardiac abnormalities in SGBS will require a larger number of patients and more consistent prospective cardiac evaluations. There are sufficient data to recommend a baseline echocardiogram and ECG in SGBS patients . Data are insufficient to define a <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac phenotype <END> /molecular correlation.
A novel <START:PHENOTYPE> deficiency of mitochondrial ATPase <END> of nuclear origin.
We report a new type of <START:PHENOTYPE> fatal mitochondrial disorder <END> caused by selective <START:PHENOTYPE> deficiency of mitochondrial ATP synthase <END> ( ATPase ). A hypotrophic newborn from a consanguineous marriage presented severe lactic acidosis , cardiomegaly and hepatomegaly and died from heart failure after 2 days. The activity of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase was only 31-34% of the control , both in muscle and heart , but the activities of cytochrome c oxidase , citrate synthase and pyruvate dehydrogenase were normal. Electrophoretic and western blot analysis revealed selective <START:PHENOTYPE> reduction of ATPase complex <END> but <START:PHENOTYPE> normal levels of the respiratory chain complexes I, III and IV <END> . The same selective <START:PHENOTYPE> deficiency of ATPase <END> was found in cultured skin fibroblasts which showed similar <START:PHENOTYPE> decreases in ATPase content, ATPase hydrolytic activity and level of substrate-dependent ATP synthesis <END> (20-25, 18 and 29-33% of the control , respectively). Pulse-chase labelling of patient fibroblasts revealed low incorporation of [(35)S]methionine into assembled ATPase complexes , but increased incorporation into immunoprecipitated ATPase subunit beta , which had a very short half-life. In contrast, no difference was found in the size and subunit composition of the assembled and newly produced ATPase complex . Transmitochondrial cybrids prepared from enucleated fibroblasts of the patient and rho degrees cells derived from 143B . TK(-)human osteosarcoma cells fully restored the ATPase activity, <START:PHENOTYPE> ATP synthesis <END> and ATPase content, when compared with control cybrids. Likewise, the pattern of [(35)S]methionine labelling of ATPase was found to be normal in patient cybrids. We conclude that the generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> deficiency of mitochondrial ATPase <END> described is of nuclear origin and is caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> altered biosynthesis of the enzyme <END> .
Genomic organization and chromosomal localization of the human Coxsackievirus B-adenovirus receptor gene .
Myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) are common causes of morbidity and mortality in children . Many studies have implicated the enteroviruses and, particularly, the Coxsackievirus-B family as etiologic agents of the acquired forms of these diseases . However, we have shown the group-C adenoviruses to be as commonly detected as enteroviruses in the myocardium of children and adults with these diseases . It has remained something of a conundrum why two such divergent virus families cause these diseases . The recent description of the common human Coxsackievirus B-adenovirus receptor ( CAR ) offers at least a partial explanation. In order to characterize the CAR gene , we screened a bacterial artificial chromosomal (BAC) library (RPCI11) using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product derived from the 3' end of the CAR cDNA sequence. This identified 13 BACs that were further characterized by PCR amplification of seven contiguous regions of the entire cDNA sequence. Eleven of the BACs were determined to encode pseudogenes while the other two BACs (131J5 and 246M1) encoded the presumed functional gene . PCR amplification of a monochromosomal hybrid panel indicated the presence of pseudogenes on chromosomes 15, 18, and 21 while the f unctional gene is encoded on chromosome 21 . Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis indicated that the gene is located at 21q11.2 . DNA sequencing of BACs 131J5 and 246M1 revealed the presence of seven exons . The DNA sequences have been determined for each exon-intron boundary , and putative promoter sequences and transcription initiation sites identified. No consensus polyadenylation signal was identified.
CACP , encoding a secreted proteoglycan , is mutated in camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Altered growth and function of synoviocytes <END> , the intimal cells which line joint cavities and tendon sheaths , occur in a number of skeletal diseases . <START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperplasia of synoviocytes <END> is found in both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis , despite differences in the underlying aetiologies of the two disorders . We have studied the autosomal recessive disorder camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome ( CACP ; MIM 208250) to identify biological pathways that lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> synoviocyte hyperplasia <END> , the principal pathological feature of this syndrome . Using a positional-candidate approach, we identified <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations in a gene (CACP) <END> encoding a secreted proteoglycan as the cause of CACP . The CACP protein , which has previously been identified as both ' megakaryocyte stimulating factor precursor ' and ' superficial zone protein ', contains domains that have homology to somatomedin B , heparin-binding proteins , mucins and haemopexins . In addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> expression in joint synovium and cartilage <END> , CACP is expressed in non-skeletal tissues including liver and pericardium . The similarity of CACP sequence to that of other protein families and the <START:PHENOTYPE> expression of CACP in non-skeletal tissues <END> suggest it may have diverse biological activities.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mutations in the cardiac transcription factor NKX2.5 <END> affect diverse <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac developmental pathways <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Heterozygous mutations in NKX2.5 <END> , a homeobox transcription factor , were reported to cause secundum atrial septal defects and result in atrioventricular (AV) conduction block during postnatal life. To further characterize the role of NKX2.5 in <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac morphogenesis <END> , we sought additional <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> in groups of probands with cardiac anomalies and first-degree AV block , idiopathic AV block , or tetralogy of Fallot . We identified 7 novel <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> by sequence analysis of the NKX2.5-coding region in 26 individuals . Associated phenotypes included AV block , which was the primary manifestation of cardiac disease in nearly a quarter of affected individuals , as well as atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defec t. Ventricular septal defect was associated with tetralogy of Fallot or double-outlet right ventricle in 3 individuals . Ebstein's anomaly and other <START:PHENOTYPE> tricuspid valve abnormalities <END> were also present. <START:PHENOTYPE> Mutations in human NKX2.5 <END> cause a variety of cardiac anomalies and may account for a clinically significant portion of tetralogy of Fallot and idiopathic AV block . The coinheritance of <START:PHENOTYPE> NKX2.5 mutations <END> with various <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defects <END> suggests that this transcription factor contributes to diverse <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac developmental pathways <END> .
Severity of hypertension in familial hyperaldosteronism type I : relationship to gender and degree of biochemical disturbance.
In familial hyperaldosteronism type I ( FH-I ), inheritance of a hybrid 11beta-hydroxylase/aldosterone synthase gene causes <START:PHENOTYPE> ACTH-regulated aldosterone overproduction <END> . In an attempt to understand the marked variability in hypertension severity in FH-I , we compared clinical and biochemical characteristics of 9 affected individuals with mild hypertension ( <START:PHENOTYPE> normotensive <END> or onset of hypertension after 15 yr, <START:PHENOTYPE> blood pressure never >160/100 mm Hg <END> , < or = 1 medication required to control hypertension , no history of stroke , age >18 yr when studied) with those of 17 subjects with severe hypertension (onset before 15 yr, or <START:PHENOTYPE> systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> diastolic blood pressure >120 mm Hg <END> at least once, or > or = 2 medications, or history of stroke ). Severe hypertension was more frequent in males (11 of 13 males vs. 6 of 13 females ; P < 0.05). All 4 subjects still <START:PHENOTYPE> normotensive <END> after age 18 yr were females . Of 10 other affected, deceased individuals (7 males and 3 females ) from a single family , all six who died before 60 yr of age (4 by stroke) were males . Biochemical studies were conducted in 6 mild and 16 severe subjects . The 2 groups were similar in terms of <START:PHENOTYPE> urinary sodium excretion <END> . Mild subjects tended, although not significantly, to have <START:PHENOTYPE> lower urinary 18-oxo-cortisol <END> (mean +/- SD, 27.4 +/- 9.0 vs. 35.2 +/- 12.9 nmol/mmol creatinine x day), <START:PHENOTYPE> higher plasma potassium <END> (4.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.4 mmol/L), and <START:PHENOTYPE> lower recumbent (0800 h after overnight recumbency) plasma aldosterone levels <END> (498 +/- 279 vs. 744 +/- 290 pmol/L). Upright (midmorning after 2-3 h of upright posture) plasma aldosterone levels were similar (mild, 485 +/- 150; severe, 474 +/- 188 pmol/L). In 1 normotensive female , upright PRA was much higher, and the upright aldosterone/PRA ratio was much lower than that in the other subjects . The remaining mild subjects had <START:PHENOTYPE> similar upright PRA levels (mild, 2.8 +/- 1.4; severe, 3.7 +/- 3.2 pmol/ L x min) and aldosterone/PRA ratios (mild, 199.5 +/- 133.4; severe, 200.6 +/- 150.9) as severe subjects <END> . During angiotensin II ( AII ) infusion studies (n = 6 mild and 10 severe), performed during recumbency, aldosterone levels were lower in the mild group both basally (404 +/- 144 vs. 843 +/- 498 pmol/L; P < 0.05) and after 60 min AII (2 ng/kg x min; 261 +/- 130 vs. 520 +/- 330 pmol/L; P < 0.05). Aldosterone was unresponsive (rose by <50%) to AII in all subjects . Day curve studies ( blood collected every 2 h for 24 h; n = 2 mild and 7 severe ) demonstrated <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal regulation of aldosterone by ACTH <END> rather than by AII in both groups . In conclusion, in this series of patients with FH-I , males had more severe hypertension , and the degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> hybrid gene-induced aldosterone overproduction <END> may have contributed to the severity of hypertension .
Clinical and molecular genetic spectrum of autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy due to <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations of the lamin A/C gene <END> .
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ) is characterized by early contractures of the elbows and Achilles tendons , <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness <END> , and life-threatening cardiomyopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> conduction blocks <END> . We recently identified LMNA encoding two nuclear envelope proteins , lamins A and C , to be implicated in the autosomal dominant form of EDMD . Here, we report on the variability of the phenotype and spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> LMNA mutations <END> in 53 autosomal dominant EDMD patients (36 members of 6 families and 17 sporadic cases ). Twelve of the 53 patients showed cardiac involvement exclusively, although the remaining 41 all showed muscle weakness and contractures . We were able to identify a common phenotype among the patients with skeletal muscle involvement , consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> humeroperoneal wasting and weakness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scapular winging <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity of the spine <END> , and elbow and Achilles tendon contractures . The disease course was generally slow, but we observed either a <START:PHENOTYPE> milder phenotype <END> characterized by late onset and a mild degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> and contractures or a more <START:PHENOTYPE> severe phenotype <END> with early presentation and a rapidly progressive course in a few cases . <START:PHENOTYPE> Mutation <END> analysis identified 18 <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations in LMNA <END> (i.e., 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> nonsense mutation <END> , 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> deletions of a codon <END> , and 15 <START:PHENOTYPE> missense mutations <END> ). All the <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> were distributed between exons 1 and 9 in the region of LMNA that is common to lamins A and C . <START:PHENOTYPE> LMNA mutations <END> arose de novo in 76% of the cases ; 2 of these <START:PHENOTYPE> de novo mutations <END> were typical hot spots , and 2 others were identified in 2 unrelated cases . There was no clear correlation between the phenotype and type or localization of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations within the gene <END> . Moreover, a marked inter- and intra-familial variability in the clinical expression of <START:PHENOTYPE> LMNA mutations <END> exists, ranging from patients expressing the full clinical picture of EDMD to those characterized only by cardiac involvement , which points toward a significant role of possible modifier genes in the course of this disease . In conclusion, the high proportion of <START:PHENOTYPE> de novo mutations <END> together with the large spectrum of both <START:PHENOTYPE> LMNA mutations <END> and the expression of the disease should now prompt screening for LMNA in familial and sporadic cases of both EDMD and dilated cardiomyopathy associated with conduction system disease .
Two common <START:PHENOTYPE> endoglin mutations <END> in families with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in the Netherlands Antilles: evidence for a founder effect.
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ( HHT ) is an autosomal dominant bleeding disorder characterized by localized angiodysplasia . <START:PHENOTYPE> Mutations <END> in either of two genes, endoglin or ALK-1 , can cause HHT . Both genes encode putative receptors for the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily of ligands . Many <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> in each gene have been identified in HHT kindreds from around the world, and with few exceptions <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> are unique and family specific. The prevalence of HHT in the Leeward Islands of the Netherlands Antilles is possibly the highest of any geographical location. We wished to establish whether this high prevalence is due to a genetic founder effect or to multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> mutational events <END> . HHT kindreds from the Netherlands Antilles and The Netherlands were screened for <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> in the two genes associated with HHT . Haplotype analysis of a 5-cM region on chromosome 9 flanking the endoglin gene revealed three distinct disease haplotypes in the ten Antillean families studied. Seven of these families share a <START:PHENOTYPE> splice-site mutation <END> in exon 1 of endoglin . Two other Antillean families share a <START:PHENOTYPE> missense mutation <END> in exon 9a of endoglin . This <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> was also found in a Dutch family that shares the same disease haplotype as the Antillean families with this <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> . Thus it appears that HHT in the Netherlands Antilles is due to a limited number of ancestral <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> in the endoglin gene , and that one of these <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> was introduced into the African slave population by a Dutch colonist . The limited scope of <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> suggests that a presymptomatic screening program for HHT would be feasible in this population .
Genomic structure of the human plasma prekallikrein gene , identification of allelic variants, and analysis in end-stage renal disease .
Kallikreins are serine proteases that catalyze the <START:PHENOTYPE> release of kinins and other vasoactive peptides <END> . Previously, we have studied one tissue -specific ( H. Yu et al., 1996, J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 7: 2559-2564) and one plasma -specific ( H. Yu et al., 1998, Hypertension 31: 906-911) human kallikrein gene in end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ). Short sequence repeat <START:PHENOTYPE> polymorphisms <END> for the human plasma kallikrein gene ( KLKB1 ; previously known as KLK3 ) on chromosome 4 were associated with ESRD in an African American study population . This study of KLKB1 in ESRD has been extended by determining the genomic structure of KLKB1 and searching for allelic variants that may be associated with ESRD . Exon -spanning PCR primer sets were identified by serial testing of primer pairs designed from KLKB1 cDNA sequence and DNA sequencing of PCR products . Like the rat plasma kallikrein gene and the closely related human factor XI gene , the human KLKB1 gene contains 15 exons and 14 introns . The longest intron , F , is almost 12 kb long. The total length of the gene is approximately 30 kb. Sequence of the 5'-proximal promoter region of KLKB1 was obtained by shotgun cloning of genomic fragments from a bacterial artificial clone containing the KLKB1 gene , followed by screening of the clones using exon 1 -specific probes. Primers flanking the exons and 5'-proximal promoter region were used to screen for allelic variants in the genomic DNA from ESRD patients and controls using the single-strand conformation <START:PHENOTYPE> polymorphism <END> technique. We identified 12 allelic variants in the 5'-proximal promoter and 7 exons . Of note were a common <START:PHENOTYPE> polymorphism <END> (30% of the population) at position 521 of KLKB1 cDNA , which leads to the replacement of asparagine with a serine at position 124 in the heavy chain of the A2 domain of the protein . In addition, an <START:PHENOTYPE> A716C <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polymorphism <END> in exon 7 resulting in the <START:PHENOTYPE> amino acid change <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> H189P <END> in the A3 domain of the heavy chain was observed in 5 patients belonging to 3 ESRD families . A third <START:PHENOTYPE> polymorphism <END> in the coding sequence was a <START:PHENOTYPE> C699A shift <END> that caused an <START:PHENOTYPE> amino acid change <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> H183Q <END> . This allele was observed in 8 cases from 6 ESRD families but was not found in any control DNAs . Individually or combined, the allelic variants observed are not statistically associated with ESRD , though in several cases (e.g., <START:PHENOTYPE> H183Q <END> ) the small number of people in the population carrying these alleles limits our ability to statistically test for significant association with ESRD . Two new CA/GT repeat polymorphic markers , designated KLK3f and KLK3g , that have heterozygosities of 0.65 and 0.84, respectively, were identified within introns M and N . Analysis using the relative predispositional effect technique indicated that the frequencies of alleles 4 and 8 of KLK3f and allele 8 of KLK3g were significantly different between controls and ESRD cases . They accounted for 0.226, 0.096, and 0.313, respectively, in the probands of 166 ESRD families compared to 0.172, 0.066, and 0.244 in 139 healthy race-matched controls ( allele P and total P < 0.05 for all three alleles ). Therefore, although <START:PHENOTYPE> polymorphisms <END> in the coding and 5'-proximal promoter of KLKB1 show no statistically significant association with ESRD in African Americans , there is still evidence for association of this part of chromosome 4 with ESRD . This observation suggests that other sequences within or near KLKB1 , or another gene nearby, may contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> ESRD susceptibility <END> .
Cardiovascular malformations and other cardiovascular abnormalities in neurofibromatosis 1 .
Although it is well recognized that a peripheral vasculopathy may occur in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 ( NF1 ), it is unclear whether <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiovascular abnormalities <END> are more common. We reviewed the frequency of cardiovascular abnormalities , in particular, cardiovascular malformations ( CVMs ), among 2322 patients with definite NF1 in the National Neurofibromatosis Foundation International Database from 1991-98. Cardiovascular malformations were reported in 54/2322 (2.3%) of the NF1 patients , only 4 of whom had Watson syndrome or NF1-Noonan syndrome . There was a predominance of <START:PHENOTYPE> Class II "flow" defects <END> [ Clark , 1995: Moss and Adams ' Heart Disease in Infants , Children , and Adolescents Including the Fetus and Young Adult . p 60-70] (43/54, 80%) among the NF1 patients with CVMs . Pulmonic stenosis , that was present in 25 NF1 patients , and aortic coarctation , that occurred in 5, constitute much larger proportions of all CVMs than expected. Of interest was the paucity of <START:PHENOTYPE> Class I conotruncal defects <END> (2 patients with tetralogy of Fallot ), and the <START:PHENOTYPE> absence of atrioventricular canal <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anomalous pulmonary venous return <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> complex single ventricle <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> laterality defects <END> . Besides the 54 patients with CVMs , there were 27 patients with other cardiac abnormalities (16 with <START:PHENOTYPE> murmur <END> , 5 with mitral valve prolapse , 1 with intracardiac tumor , and 5 with <START:PHENOTYPE> electrocardiogram abnormalities <END> ). No patient in this study had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . There were 16 patients who had a <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral vascular abnormality <END> without an intracardiac CVM , plus an additional 4 patients among those with a CVM who also had a <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral vascular abnormality <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Barth's syndrome-like disorder <END> : a new phenotype with a maternally inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> A3243G substitution of mitochondrial DNA <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> MELAS mutation <END> ).
An Argentine male child died at 4.5 years of age of a lethal mitochondrial disease associated with a <START:PHENOTYPE> MELAS mutation <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> Barth syndrome-like presentation <END> . The child had <START:PHENOTYPE> severe failure to thrive <END> from the early months and for approximately two years thereafter. In addition, the patient had <START:PHENOTYPE> severely delayed gross motor milestones <END> , marked muscle weakness , and dilated cardiomyopathy that progressed to congestive heart failure . He also had <START:PHENOTYPE> persistently elevated urinary levels of 3-methylglutaconic and 2-ethylhydracrylic acids <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> low blood levels of cholesterol <END> . Detailed histopathologic evaluation of the skeletal muscle biopsy showed <START:PHENOTYPE> high activity of succinate dehydrogenase <END> , a generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> decrease of COX activity <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> abundant ragged-red fibers <END> . Electron microscopic studies revealed multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial abnormalities <END> in lymphocytes and monocytes , in the striated muscle , and in the postmortem samples ( muscle , heart , liver , and brain ). Biochemical analysis showed a pronounced and constant lactic acidosis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal urinary organic acid excretion <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> unchanged in the fasting and postprandial states <END> ). In addition, in CSF there was a <START:PHENOTYPE> marked increase of lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate <END> ( beta-HOB ) and also a <START:PHENOTYPE> high systemic ratio beta-HOB/acetoacetate <END> . Enzymatic assay of the respiratory chain in biopsied muscle showed <START:PHENOTYPE> 10% of complex I activity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> 24% of complex IV activity <END> compared with controls . Molecular studies of the mitochondrial genome revealed an <START:PHENOTYPE> A to G mutation at nucleotide pair 3243 in mitochondrial DNA <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> well-known pathogenetic mutation <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> MELAS mutation <END> ) in all the patient's tissues and also in the blood specimens of the probands mother and sibs (4 of 5). The diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> MELAS mutation <END> was reinforced by the absence of an identifiable <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation in the X-linked G4.5 gene <END> of the propositus . The present observation gives additional evidence of the variable clinical expression of <START:PHENOTYPE> mtDNA mutations <END> in humans and demonstrates that all clinical variants deserve adequate investigation to establish a primary defect. It also suggests adding Barth-like syndrome to the list of phenotypes with the <START:PHENOTYPE> MELAS mutation <END> .
Congenital heart disease in maternal phenylketonuria : report from the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study.
The frequency and types of congenital heart disease in offspring from <START:PHENOTYPE> pregnancies <END> in women with hyperphenylalaninemia were examined in the international prospective Maternal Phenylketonuria Collaborative Study. Relationships of congenital heart disease in offspring to the <START:PHENOTYPE> basal blood phenylalanine level <END> in the mother , metabolic control through diet during <START:PHENOTYPE> pregnancy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations <END> in mother and offspring were determined. The 416 offspring from 412 <START:PHENOTYPE> maternal phenylketonuria pregnancies <END> that produced <START:PHENOTYPE> live births <END> and 100 offspring from the 99 control <START:PHENOTYPE> pregnancies <END> were included in this examination. Thirty-four of the 235 offspring (14%; 95% CI, 10.2 to 19.6%) from <START:PHENOTYPE> pregnancies <END> in phenylketonuric women with a <START:PHENOTYPE> basal phenylalanine level > or = 900 microM <END> (15 mg/dL) [ <START:PHENOTYPE> normal blood phenylalanine < 120 microM <END> (2 mg/dL)] and not in metabolic control [ <START:PHENOTYPE> phenylalanine level < or = 600 microM <END> (10 mg/dL)] by the eighth gestational week had congenital heart disease compared with one control offspring (1%) with congenital heart disease . One offspring among the 50 (2%) from mothers with non-phenylketonuria mild hyperphenylalaninemia also had congenital heart disease . Coarctation of the aorta and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were overrepresented compared with expected percentages among those with congenital heart disease in the general population . A <START:PHENOTYPE> basal maternal phenylalanine level > 1800 microM <END> (30 mg/dL) significantly increased the risk for bearing a child with congenital heart disease (p = 0.003). <START:PHENOTYPE> Phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations <END> in the mothers and offspring did not have an independent relationship to congenital heart disease but were related through the basal maternal phenylalanine levels. The data in this study indicate that a <START:PHENOTYPE> basal maternal phenylalanine level of 900 microM <END> may be a threshold for congenital heart disease , that women with the most severe degree of phenylketonuria are at highest risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> bearing such a child <END> , and that prevention of the congenital heart disease requires initiation of the low phenylalanine diet before <START:PHENOTYPE> conception <END> or early in <START:PHENOTYPE> pregnancy <END> with metabolic control no later than the eighth gestational week.
Estimating the efficacy and efficiency of cascade genetic screening.
Screening for genetic variants that predispose individuals or their offspring to disease may be performed at the general population level or may instead be targeted at the relatives of previously identified carriers . The latter strategy has come to be known as "cascade genetic screening." Since the carrier risk of close relatives of known carriers is generally higher than the population risk, cascade screening is more efficient than population screening, in the sense that fewer individuals have to be genotyped per detected carrier . The efficacy of cascade screening, as measured by the overall proportion of carriers detected in a given population , is, however, lower than that of population -wide screening, and the respective inclusion rates vary according to the population frequency and mode of <START:PHENOTYPE> inheritance of the predisposing variants <END> . For <START:PHENOTYPE> dominant mutations <END> , we have developed equations that allow the inclusion rates of cascade screening to be calculated in an iterative fashion, depending upon screening depth and penetrance. For <START:PHENOTYPE> recessive mutations <END> , we derived only equations for the screening of siblings and the children of patients . Owing to their mathematical complexity, it was necessary to study more extended screening strategies by simulation. Cascade screening turned out to result in low inclusion rates (<1%) when aimed at the identification of heterozygous carriers of rare recessive variants . Considerably higher rates are achievable, however, when screening is performed to detect covert homozygotes for <START:PHENOTYPE> frequent recessive mutations <END> with reduced penetrance. This situation is exemplified by hereditary hemochromatosis , for which up to 40% of at-risk individuals may be identifiable through screening of first- to third-degree relatives of overt carriers (i.e., patients ); the efficiency of this screening strategy was found to be approximately 50 times higher than that of population -wide screening. For <START:PHENOTYPE> dominant mutations <END> , inclusion rates of cascade screening were estimated to be higher than for recessive variants . Thus, some 80% of all carriers of the <START:PHENOTYPE> factor V Leiden mutation <END> would be detected if screening were to be targeted specifically at first- to third-degree relatives of patients with venous thrombosis . The relative cost efficiency of cascade as compared with population -wide screening (i.e., the overall savings in the extra managerial cost of the condition) is also likely to be higher for <START:PHENOTYPE> dominant than for recessive mutations <END> . This notwithstanding, once screening has become cost-effective at the population level, it can be expected that cascade screening would only transiently represent an economically viable option.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Altered potassium balance and aldosterone secretion <END> in a mouse model of human congenital long QT syndrome .
The voltage-dependent K(+) channel responsible for the <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly activating delayed K(+) current I(Ks) <END> is composed of pore-forming KCNQ1 and regulatory KCNE1 subunits , which are mutated in familial forms of cardiac long QT syndrome . Because KCNQ1 and KCNE1 genes also are expressed in epithelial tissues , such as the kidneys and the intestine , we have investigated the adaptation of KCNE1-deficient mice to different <START:PHENOTYPE> K(+) and Na(+) intakes <END> . On a normal K(+) diet, homozygous kcne1(-/-) mice exhibit signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic volume depletion <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> fecal Na(+) and K(+) wasting <END> and have <START:PHENOTYPE> lower plasma K(+) concentration <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> higher levels of aldosterone <END> than wild-type mice . Although plasma aldosterone can be suppressed by low K(+) diets or stimulated by low Na(+) diets, a high K(+) diet provokes a <START:PHENOTYPE> tremendous increase of plasma aldosterone levels <END> in kcne1(-/-) mice as compared with wild-type mice (7.1-fold vs. 1.8-fold) despite <START:PHENOTYPE> lower plasma K(+) <END> in kcne1(-/-) mice . This <START:PHENOTYPE> exacerbated aldosterone production <END> in kcne1(-/-) mice is accompanied by an <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormally high plasma renin concentration <END> , which could partly explain the hyperaldosteronism . In addition, we found that KCNE1 and KCNQ1 mRNAs are expressed in the zona glomerulosa of adrenal glands where <START:PHENOTYPE> I(Ks) <END> may directly participate in the <START:PHENOTYPE> control of aldosterone production by plasma K(+) <END> . These results, which show that KCNE1 and <START:PHENOTYPE> I(Ks) <END> are involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> K(+) homeostasis <END> , might have important implications for patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> I(Ks) <END> -related long QT syndrome , because hypokalemia is a well known risk factor for the occurrence of torsades de pointes ventricular arrhythmia .
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum : <START:PHENOTYPE> Point mutations in the ABCC6 gene <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> large deletion including also ABCC1 and MYH11 <END> .
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum ( PXE ) is a mendelian disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> calcification of elastic fibers in skin, arteries, and retina <END> . It results in <START:PHENOTYPE> dermal lesions <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arterial insufficiency <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal hemorrhages <END> , leading to macular degeneration . PXE is transmitted either as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait and several sporadic cases have been observed. <START:PHENOTYPE> Mutations in the ABCC6 gene <END> have been identified very recently in patients . Here, we report on a large Italian family affected by pseudoxanthoma elasticum for which linkage analysis had pointed to a region encompassing markers D16S3069 - D16S405 - D16S3103 ; hemizygosity of marker D16S405 allowed us to detect a <START:PHENOTYPE> submicroscopic deletion of at least 900 kb involving ABCC6, ABCC1, and MYH11 <END> . <START:PHENOTYPE> Mutation <END> analysis on the other allele of the family , as well as on two additional sporadic cases , revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> nonsense (Y227X, R518X, R1164X) and frame-shift (c.960delC) mutations in ABCC6 <END> ( MRP6 ) further confirming the role of this multi-drug resistance gene in the etiology of pseudoxanthoma elasticum . Furthermore, clinical re-examination of members of the family harboring the <START:PHENOTYPE> deletion <END> led to the detection of additional features, potentially caused by the <START:PHENOTYPE> deletion of the MYH11 gene <END> . In the course of the analysis five nonpathogenic variants were found in ABCC6 : <START:PHENOTYPE> 1233T>C <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> 1245G>A <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> 1838 T>G <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> V614A <END> ), <START:PHENOTYPE> 1890C>G <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> 3506+83C>A <END> .

Identification of <START:PHENOTYPE> connexin43 (alpha1) gap junction gene mutations <END> in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).
Gap junction channels formed by the connexin43 protein are considered to play crucial roles in <START:PHENOTYPE> development <END> and function because they allow the direct <START:PHENOTYPE> cell-to-cell exchange of molecules <END> that mediate multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> signaling events <END> . Previous results have shown that connexin43 channels are intricately gated by <START:PHENOTYPE> phosphorylation <END> and that disruption of this <START:PHENOTYPE> regulation <END> gives rise to severe heart malformations and <START:PHENOTYPE> defects of laterality <END> in human , chick and frog . Here we report the identification of <START:PHENOTYPE> connexin43 gene mutations <END> that represent a minor population of connexin43 alleles , which could be reliably detected by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to visualize normal and mutant DNAs that were separately sequenced. In contrast, sequencing of total PCR products without DGGE-pre-selection failed to consistently identify these <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> . Forty-six controls and 20 heart transplant recipients were examined in this study. In the latter group , 14 children had hypoplastic left heart syndrome ( HLHS ) in which <START:PHENOTYPE> connexin43 gene defects <END> were detected in eight. The remaining six transplant patients with HLHS and all controls showed <START:PHENOTYPE> no defects <END> . All eight HLHS children with <START:PHENOTYPE> gene defects <END> had the same four <START:PHENOTYPE> substitutions <END> : two that were <START:PHENOTYPE> silent polymorphisms <END> , and two that were <START:PHENOTYPE> missense, replacing arginine codons at positions 362 and 376 with codons for glutamines <END> . All four of these <START:PHENOTYPE> substitutions <END> are identical to the nucleotide sequence of the connexin43 pseudogene , suggesting the possibility of an <START:PHENOTYPE> illicit recombination <END> . A breakpoint region was identified 5' to the mutation site in a 63bp domain that is 100% identical in the gene and pseudogene . Results from in vitro <START:PHENOTYPE> phosphorylation <END> indicate that the <START:PHENOTYPE> absence of arginines 362 and 376 <END> completely abolishes <START:PHENOTYPE> phosphorylation in the connexin43 channel regulation domain <END> suggesting a possible mechanism for the pathologies associated with HLHS .
Ritscher-Schinzel cranio-cerebello-cardiac (3C) syndrome : report of four new cases and review.
Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome , also known as the 3C syndrome , is a rare, autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> craniofacial, cerebellar, and cardiac anomalies <END> . <START:PHENOTYPE> Cardiac manifestations <END> include ventricular septal defect , atrial septal defect , tetralogy of Fallot , double outlet right ventricle , hypoplastic left heart , aortic stenosis , pulmonic stenosis and other <START:PHENOTYPE> valvular anomalies <END> . Central nervous system anomalies include Dandy-Walker malformation , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar vermis hypoplasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> enlargement of the cisterna magna <END> . Craniofacial abnormalities seen are cleft palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular coloboma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent occiput <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , hypertelorism , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> and micrognathia . Dandy-Walker malformation , <START:PHENOTYPE> posterior fossa cyst <END> , hydrocephalus and congenital heart defect are common <START:PHENOTYPE> malformations <END> that may occur in isolation or as a part of many syndromes . Accurate genetic diagnosis and counseling require detailed analysis of the external as well as the internal anatomy and knowledge of the relative frequencies of various <START:PHENOTYPE> malformations <END> in syndromes that may have overlapping <START:PHENOTYPE> clinical signs <END> . We have had the opportunity recently to study four cases of the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome . A review of all reported cases is presented and an attempt made to define the minimum diagnostic criteria for the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome . Of the nine <START:PHENOTYPE> craniofacial anomalies <END> commonly reported as a part of the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome , we consider two i.e., cleft palate and <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular coloboma <END> , to be readily and objectively ascertainable. The other seven <START:PHENOTYPE> craniofacial traits <END> , however, are somewhat subjective, require expert interpretation and are sometimes difficult to ascertain in a newborn or stillborn fetus . These are <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent occiput <END> , hypertelorism , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> and micrognathia . At least four of these were present in all cases that had a secure diagnosis of the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome . Thus, the criteria we propose to establish the diagnosis of the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome in a chromosomally normal sporadic case are the presence of cardiac malformation other than isolated patent ductus arteriosus , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar malformation <END> , and cleft palate or <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular coloboma <END> or four of the following seven findings: <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent occiput <END> , hypertelorism , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , and micrognathia .
Interaction of alpha(1)-Na,K-ATPase and Na,K,2Cl-cotransporter genes in human essential hypertension .
Essential hypertension is a common disease the genetic determinants of which have been difficult to unravel because of its clinical heterogeneity and complex, multifactorial, polygenic etiology. Based on our observations that alpha(1)-Na,K-ATPase ( ATP1A1 ) and renal-specific, bumetanide-sensitive Na,K,2Cl-cotransporter ( NKCC2 ) genes interactively increase susceptibility to hypertension in the Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive (Dahl S) rat model , we investigated whether parallel molecular genetic mechanisms might exist in human essential hypertension in a relatively genetic homogeneous cohort in northern Sardinia. Putative ATP1A1 - NKCC2 gene interaction was tested by comparing hypertensive patients ( <START:PHENOTYPE> blood pressure [BP] >165/95 mm Hg <END> ) with normotensive controls age >60 years with <START:PHENOTYPE> BP <140/85 mm Hg <END> . Genotype analysis with microsatellite markers revealed conformation to Hardy-Weinberg proportions for 6 alleles of both ATP1A1 ( D1S453 ) and NKCC2 ( NKCGT7 ) markers, respectively. Two-by-six chi(2) analysis of alleles identified overrepresentation of ATP1A1 No. 4 and NKCC2 No. 4 alleles , respectively, in hypertensives compared with controls . With a <START:PHENOTYPE> qualitative trait <END> framework, single- gene analysis detected association of both the ATP1A1 No. 4 allele (P=0.004, chi(2)=8.094, df=1) and the NKCC2 No. 4 allele (P=0.0002, chi(2)=14.279, df=1) with moderate to severe hypertension . Digenic analysis revealed that ATP1A1 No. 4 - NKCC2 No. 4 allele interaction increases susceptibility to hypertension (P<0.0001, chi(2)=22.3, df=1) beyond levels obtained in single- gene analysis. Analysis was also performed in a <START:PHENOTYPE> quantitative trait <END> framework with BP as the continuous <START:PHENOTYPE> trait <END> parameter. Digenic analysis of ATP1A1 No. 4 - NKCC2 No. 4 allele interaction revealed significant association with systolic (1-way ANOVA, P=0.000076) and diastolic (P=0.00099) BP. Interaction was corroborated by 2x2 factorial ANOVA for interaction (systolic BP interaction term, P<0.05, diastolic BP interaction term, P=0.035). The data are compelling that ATP1A1 and NKCC2 genes are candidate interacting hypertension-susceptibility loci in human essential hypertension and affirm gene interaction as an important genetic mechanism underlying hypertension susceptibility. Although corroboration in other cohorts and identification of <START:PHENOTYPE> functionally significant mutations <END> are imperative next steps, the data provide a <START:PHENOTYPE> genotype <END> -stratification scheme, with 4-fold predictive value (odds ratio, 4.28; 95% confidence interval, 2.29 to 8.0), which could help decipher the complex genetics of essential hypertension .
Chromosome 17 and the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene in human essential hypertension .
Essential hypertension is a <START:PHENOTYPE> common multifactorial trait <END> that results in a significantly increased risk for heart attack and stroke . The condition has a genetic basis, although at present the number of genes is unknown. In order to identify such genes , we are utilising a linkage scanning approach using microsatellite markers and affected sibships. Here we provide evidence for the location of at least one hypertension susceptibility locus on chromosome 17 . Analysis of 177 affected sibpairs gave evidence for significant excess allele sharing to D17S949 (SPLINK: P=0.0029; MAPMAKER SIBS: P=0.0033; ASPEX: P=0.0061; GENEHUNTER: P=0.0096; ANALYZE (SIBPAIR): P=0.0025) on 17q22-24 , with significant allele sharing also indicated for an additional marker , D17S799 (SPLINK: P=0.025; MAPMAKER SIBS: P=0.025) located close to the centromere . Since these two genomic regions are well separated, our results indicate that there may be more than one chromosome 17 locus affecting human blood pressure. Moreover, further investigation of this chromosome , utilizing a <START:PHENOTYPE> polymorphism <END> within the promoter of the iNOS candidate gene , NOS2A , revealed both increased allele sharing among sibpairs (SPLINK: P=0.02; ASPEX: P=0.00004) and positive association (P=0.034) of NOS2A to essential hypertension . Hence these results indicate that chromosome 17 and, more specifically, the NOS2A gene may play a role in human essential hypertension .
Quantitative-trait loci influencing body -mass index reside on chromosomes 7 and 13 : the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute Family Heart Study.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> is a risk factor for many chronic diseases , including glucose intolerance , lipid disorders , hypertension , and coronary heart disease . Even though the body -mass index (BMI) is a <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous phenotype <END> reflecting the amount of fat, lean mass, and body build , several studies have provided evidence of one or two major loci contributing to the variation in this complex <START:PHENOTYPE> trait <END> . We sought to identify loci with potential influence on BMI in the data obtained from National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute Family Heart Study. Two complementary samples were studied: (a) 1,184 subjects in 317 sibships , with 243 markers typed by the Utah Molecular Genetics Laboratory (UMGL) and (b) 3,027 subjects distributed among 401 three-generation families , with 404 markers typed by the Mammalian Genotyping Service (MGS). A genome scan using a variance-components-based linkage approach was performed for each sample , as well as for the combined sample , in which the markers from each analysis were placed on a common genetic map. There was strong evidence for linkage on chromosome 7q32.3 in each sample : the maximum multipoint LOD scores were 4.7 (P<10-5) at marker GATA43C11 and 3.2 (P=.00007) at marker D7S1804 , for the MGS and UMGL samples , respectively. The linkage result is replicated by the consistent evidence from these two complementary subsets . Furthermore, the evidence for linkage was maintained in the combined sample , with a LOD score of 4.9 (P<10-5) for both markers , which map to the same location. This signal is very near the published location for the leptin gene , which is the most prominent candidate gene in this region . For the combined-sample analysis, evidence of linkage was also found on chromosome 13q14 , with D13S257 (LOD score 3.2, P=.00006), and other, weaker signals (LOD scores 1.5-1.9) were found on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 14, and 15 .
A genome -wide scan for coronary heart disease suggests in Indo-Mauritians a susceptibility locus on chromosome 16p13 and replicates linkage with the metabolic syndrome on 3q27 .
Prevalence of coronary heart disease ( CHD ), of type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) and of the metabolic syndrome are in Mauritius amongst the highest in the world. As T2DM and CHD are closely associated and have both a polygenic basis, we conducted a 10 cM genome scan with 403 microsatellite markers in 99 independent families of North-Eastern Indian origin including 535 individuals . Families were ascertained through a proband with CHD before 52 years of age and additional sibs with myocardial infarction ( MI ) or T2DM . Model-free two-point and multipoint linkage analysis were performed using the Mapmarker- Sibs (MLS) and maximum-likelihood-binomial (MLB) programs for autosomal markers and the Aspex program for chromosome X markers . In a second step, additional markers were studied to increase the genetic map density in three regions on chromosomes 3, 8 and 16 where initial indication for linkage was found. Our data show suggestive linkage with CHD on chromosome 16p13-pter with the MLS statistics at 8.69 cM (LOD = 3.06, P = 0.00017) which partially overlaps with a high pressure ( HBP ) peak. At the same locus , a nominal indication for linkage with T2DM was found in 35 large T2DM Pondicherian families also having Indian origin. With respect to region 8q23 , we found suggestive linkage with T2DM (LOD = 2.55, P = 0.00058) as well as with HBP . On 3q27 , we replicated previous indication for linkage found in Caucasians (for the metabolic syndrome and for diabetes ) according to the categorized trait for CHD and MI with the MLB statistics (LOD = 2.13, P = 0.0009). The genome scan also revealed nominal evidence of linkage with CHD on 10q23 (LOD = 2.06, P = 0.00188). Interestingly, we detected in the same region overlapping linkages with three QTLs : age of onset of CHD (LOD = 2.03), HDL cholesterol (LOD = 1.48) and LDL / HDL ratio (LOD = 1.34). Ordered-subset analysis based on family body mass index ranking replicated finding on 2q37 for T2DM (at Calpain 10 locus ). These results show the first evidence for susceptibility loci that predispose to CHD , T2DM and HBP in the context of the metabolic syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> CFC1 mutations <END> in patients with transposition of the great arteries and double-outlet right ventricle .
Recent investigations identified <START:PHENOTYPE> heterozygous CFC1 mutations <END> in subjects with heterotaxy syndrome , all of whom had congenital cardiac malformations , including malposition of the great arteries . We hypothesized that a subset of patients with similar types of congenital heart disease ---namely, transposition of the great arteries and double-outlet right ventricle , in the <START:PHENOTYPE> absence of laterality defects <END> ---would also have <START:PHENOTYPE> CFC1 mutations <END> . Our analysis of the CFC1 gene in patients with these cardiac disorders identified two <START:PHENOTYPE> disease-related mutations <END> in 86 patients . The present study identifies the first <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal single-gene defect <END> for these cardiac malformations and indicates that some cases of transposition of the great arteries and double-outlet right ventricle can share a common genetic etiology with heterotaxy syndrome . In addition, these results demonstrate that the <START:PHENOTYPE> molecular pathway <END> involving CFC1 plays a critical role in <START:PHENOTYPE> normal and abnormal cardiovascular development <END> .
Malignancy of recurrent, early-onset major depression : a family study.
Coordinated efforts to identify susceptibility genes for unipolar major depressive disorder ( MDD ) and related disorders are now underway. These studies have focused on recurrent, early-onset MDD (RE- MDD ), the most heritable form of this disorder . The goal of this study was to characterize the burden of MDD and other mood disorders , comorbid mental disorders , and excess mortality in RE-MDD families . A total of 81 families were identified through probands over the age of 18, who met criteria for recurrent (> or = 2 episodes), early-onset (< or = 25 years), nonpsychotic, unipolar MDD (RE- MDD ), and included 407 first-degree relatives and 835 extended relatives . Psychiatric diagnoses for probands and their family members who provided blood samples were formulated from structured personal interviews, structured family history assessments, and available medical records. The remaining family members who participated and those who were deceased were evaluated through the family history method augmented by available medical records. Best estimate diagnoses were made during a consensus conference according to established diagnostic criteria. Approximately half of the first-degree relatives and a quarter of extended relatives of RE-MDD probands suffered from at least one mood disorder , typically MDD . As commonly observed for other oligogenic, multifactorial disorders , the severity of MDD reflected by age at onset and number of <START:PHENOTYPE> episodes <END> attenuated with increasing familial/genetic distance from the proband . A substantial fraction of RE-MDD probands and their first-degree relatives met diagnostic criteria for additional psychiatric disorders that include <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent disturbances of mood <END> . The deceased relatives of RE-MDD probands died at a median age that was 8 years earlier than for the local population ; over 40% died before reaching age 65. These differences in mortality statistics resulted from a shift toward younger ages at <START:PHENOTYPE> death <END> across the lifespan, including a fivefold increase in the proportion of individuals who died in the first year of life. Several-fold increases in the proportion of <START:PHENOTYPE> deaths <END> by suicide, homicide, and liver disease were observed among the relatives of RE-MDD probands . However, the rank order of the three most common causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> death <END> - heart disease , cancer , and stroke -remained unchanged and differences in the proportions of <START:PHENOTYPE> deaths <END> from the remaining causes were small. RE- MDD is a strongly familial condition with a high rate of psychiatric comorbidity, whose malignant effects have a significant negative impact on the health and <START:PHENOTYPE> longevity <END> of patients and their family members .
Cholesterol and development: the RSH ("Smith-Lemli-Opitz") syndrome and related conditions.
The half-century of lipophobia in the United States may be abating with some return of sanity on the discussion of health and dietary fat [ Taubes , 2001]. The youngest victims of this collective, decades long madness are those infants deprived for one reason or another of breast milk . They are unable to speak for themselves at a time of greatest need for cholesterol during <START:PHENOTYPE> growth <END> , the most critical period of <START:PHENOTYPE> myelination of central and peripheral nervous system <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> formation of bone and bile, and of every steroid hormone <END> . Some of the commercial formulas they are fed contain only 1 or 2 mg of cholesterol per 100 g edible portion contrasted with almost 14 mg in breast milk . One can only hope that the confidence in their endogenous ability to synthesize sufficient amounts of cholesterol is not misplaced. Pediatric pathology has learned that when this endogenous ability fails during <START:PHENOTYPE> embryogenesis <END> on the basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> in the <START:PHENOTYPE> postsqualene biosynthesis of cholesterol <END> , a startling variety of developmental pathology may present itself ranging from lethal forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> "idiopathic" hydrops <END> , microcephaly with cerebral dysgenesis and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysmyelinization <END> , agenesis of corpus callosum , cerebellar vermis dysgenesis , cataracts , cleft palate , many different forms of congenital heart defect , pyloric stenosis and/or Hirschsprung dysganglionosis , adrenal (cortical) insufficiency , cholestatic liver disease , limb malformations , and genital ambiguity in genetic males . Population genetic considerations suggest a hypothetical birth prevalence of the RSH (so-called Smith-Lemli-Opitz) syndrome , the commonest of these <START:PHENOTYPE> Garrodian errors of cholesterol biosynthesis <END> , of 1/2500; since only about 1/15,000 to 1/20,000 homozygotes are <START:PHENOTYPE> liveborn <END> and biochemically confirmed, over 80% prenatal or perinatal mortality must occur and deserves the most discerning of services from birth attendants , perinatologists , neonatologists , and fetal/pediatric pathologists . An easy, reliable, economical biochemical test for the presence of 7-dehydrocholesterol is available and the <START:PHENOTYPE> commonest mutation <END> , the <START:PHENOTYPE> IVS8-1G-->C mutation <END> , is quickly and reliably tested for molecularly. Thus, the successful diagnosis, even after <START:PHENOTYPE> death <END> , will contribute substantially to correct genetic counseling, carrier detection, prenatal diagnosis, and treatment in those known to be affected prenatally andplanned to be <START:PHENOTYPE> liveborn <END> . Thus, developmental pathology plays an integral, vital role in preventive medicine.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Chromosome 3 duplication q21 <END> leads to <START:PHENOTYPE> qter deletion p25 <END> leads to pter syndrome in children of carriers of a <START:PHENOTYPE> pericentric inversion inv(3) <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> p25q21 <END> ).
Close phenotypic similarity between two cases carrying a <START:PHENOTYPE> rec(3) dup q,inv(3) <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> p25q21 <END> ), 12 additional infants from the same inv (3)(p25q21) kindred who lived less than 1 year, and eight cases studied in other medical centers has led us to postulate the existence of a distinct chromosome 3 duplication-deletion syndrome . In the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> trisomy for (3)q21 <END> leads to qter and <START:PHENOTYPE> monosomy for (3)p25 <END> leads to pter , the <START:PHENOTYPE> facial dysmorphy <END> is unique: a <START:PHENOTYPE> distorted head shape <END> due to irregular cranial sutures , <START:PHENOTYPE> thick low eyebrows <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long eyelashes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> persistent lanugo <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> distended veins on the scalp <END> , hypertelorism , <START:PHENOTYPE> oblique palpebral fissures <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> very short nose with a broad depressed bridge <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding maxilla <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thin upper lip <END> , micrognathia , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> short webbed neck <END> . Port-wine stains , congenital glaucoma , <START:PHENOTYPE> cloudy corneas <END> , cleft palate and harelip also occur frequently. Each infant has <START:PHENOTYPE> difficulty sucking and swallowing <END> . <START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital anomalies of the cardiovascular system, of midgut rotation, and of the urogenital system <END> are noted for the infants who died neonatally. Most frequent is a ventricular septal defect , followed by atrial septal defect , patent ductus arteriosus , patent foramen ovale , and coarctation of the aorta . Omphalocele , umbilical hernia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperplastic kidneys <END> , polycystic kidneys , double ureter , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydro-ureter <END> , hydronephrosis , and undescended testes often occur. The extremities are short in proportion to the length of the trunk . <START:PHENOTYPE> Clinodactyly <END> , coxa valga , talipes , and spina bifida are frequently observed.
Presence of the d8/17 B-cell marker in children with rheumatic fever in Israel.
A genetic predisoposition to rheumatic fever ( RF ) has been suspected by several researchers . Ten years ago, using monoclonal antibodies , the B-cell alloantigen D8/17 was identified in 90-100% of patients with RF . The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the marker is found in patients with RF in Israel, where the population is made up of diverse ethnic groups . The Schneider Children's Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Israel, was the setting for this study. The population included 22 children with RF and nine ethnically matched, disease-free individuals who served as controls . Each of the patients and controls were tested for the B-cell antigen with flow cytometry assay by using monoclonal antibodies . The main outcome measure was the difference in the presence of the D8/17 B-cell marker between the patients with RF and the controls . The mean percentage of B-cells expressing the marker was 11.5 +/- 2.9 in the patients and 4.24 +/- 2.7 in the controls (P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of the marker by ethnic origin. The present results support earlier studies suggesting that D8/17 is a disease-specific marker with a world-wide distribution which may potentially serve as an additional diagnostic tool in patients with suspected RF .
Grouping of multiple-lentigines/LEOPARD and Noonan syndromes on the PTPN11 gene .
Multiple-lentigines (ML)/LEOPARD (multiple lentigines, electrocardiographic-conduction abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary stenosis, abnormal genitalia, retardation of growth, and sensorineural deafness) syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant condition <END> --characterized by lentigines and caf au lait spots , <START:PHENOTYPE> facial anomalies <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac defects <END> --that shares several clinical features with Noonan syndrome ( NS ). We screened nine patients with ML/LEOPARD syndrome (including a mother-daughter pair ) and two children with NS who had multiple caf au lait spots , for <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations in the NS gene, PTPN11 <END> , and found, in 10 of 11 patients , one of two new <START:PHENOTYPE> missense mutations, in exon 7 or exon 12 <END> . Both <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> affect the PTPN11 phosphotyrosine phosphatase domain , which is involved in <30% of the <START:PHENOTYPE> NS PTPN11 mutations <END> . The study demonstrates that ML/LEOPARD syndrome and NS are <START:PHENOTYPE> allelic disorders <END> . The detected <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> suggest that distinct molecular and pathogenetic mechanisms cause the <START:PHENOTYPE> peculiar cutaneous manifestations <END> of the ML/LEOPARD-syndrome subtype of NS .
The role of hyperhomocysteinemia and <START:PHENOTYPE> methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation <END> in patients with retinal artery occlusion .
Hyperhomocysteinemia has been established as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases . The aim of the present study was to investigate whether hyperhomocysteinemia and/or homozygosity for the <START:PHENOTYPE> methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation <END> are associated with an increased risk for retinal artery occlusion ( RAO ).
Assessment and evaluation of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies with autonomic and neurophysiological examinations.
The five different types of the rare hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies ( HSAN ) are classified by their mode of <START:PHENOTYPE> inheritance <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pathology <END> , natural history, <START:PHENOTYPE> biochemical, neurophysiologic and autonomic abnormalities <END> . Clinically, the different types of HSANs can be identified by a detailed history and examination and 'bedside' tests of <START:PHENOTYPE> sympathetic or parasympathetic function <END> such as <START:PHENOTYPE> active standing, <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> metronomic breathing <END> or the <START:PHENOTYPE> Valsalva maneuver <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory and motor nerve conduction <END> studies, quantitative sensory testing of <START:PHENOTYPE> thermal and vibratory perception <END> , and the analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudomotor function <END> by recordings of the <START:PHENOTYPE> sympathetic skin response <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> SSR <END> ) or the <START:PHENOTYPE> sweat output <END> during quantitative <START:PHENOTYPE> sudomotor axon reflex <END> testing (QSART). The slowly progressive, symmetrical HSAN type I manifests between the second and fourth decade with <START:PHENOTYPE> ulcers or mutilations of the lower extremities <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low normal sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities <END> , but <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal warm, cold and heat pain perception <END> and distal anhidrosis . In HSAN type II , symptoms occur already in infancy, <START:PHENOTYPE> trophic alterations <END> affect fingers and toes . There are acral anhidrosis and various <START:PHENOTYPE> autonomic dysfunctions <END> such as tonic pupils , <START:PHENOTYPE> eating and swallowing difficulties <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic fever <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> profound hypotonia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> episodes of apnea <END> . <START:PHENOTYPE> Sensory perception <END> is severely impaired and accounts for <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated vibratory but also thermal perception thresholds <END> . <START:PHENOTYPE> Sensory nerve conduction <END> is highly abnormal while <START:PHENOTYPE> motor nerve conduction <END> studies are almost normal. Type III , the autosomal recessive familial dysautonomia ( FD ), is the most common of the HSANs . FD is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> pronounced autonomic, primarily sympathetic dysregulation <END> with severe orthostatic hypotension , <START:PHENOTYPE> repeated episodes of autonomic crises with excessive arterial hypertension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> profuse sweating <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> skin blotching <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> puffy hands <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> behavioral abnormalities <END> . FD manifests only in children of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry . Cardinal findings are <START:PHENOTYPE> diminished deep tendon reflexes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> absence of overflow tears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> absence of fungi-form papillae of the tongue <END> and of <START:PHENOTYPE> axon flare response following intradermal histamine injection <END> . Thermal and vibratory testing show <START:PHENOTYPE> pronounced impairment of temperature and pain but also of vibratory perception <END> . Children with HSAN IV , ' <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis <END> ' experience <START:PHENOTYPE> repeated episodes of high fevers during high environmental temperature <END> due to anhidrosis . The anhidrosis of the <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratotic skin <END> accounts for <START:PHENOTYPE> absence of the SSR <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> lack of sweat output during QSART <END> . The patients ' <START:PHENOTYPE> insensitivity to superficial as well as deep, visceral pain <END> can be demonstrated e. g. by quantitative heat pain testing. Patients develop <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mutilations <END> e. g. of the tip of their tongue , they might have <START:PHENOTYPE> severe burn injuries <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple, unnoticed fractures with neuropathic joints <END> . Children with the very rare HSAN type V respond normally to tactile, vibratory or thermal stimuli, but have a <START:PHENOTYPE> selective loss of pain perception <END> with otherwise normal neurological examination. Painful stimuli reveal no signs of discomfort.
Cardiovascular consequences of <START:PHENOTYPE> early-onset growth hormone excess <END> .
Acromegaly has relevant effects on the cardiovascular system , but few data deal with the early effects of <START:PHENOTYPE> GH and IGF-I excess <END> . To study the early stage of acromegalic cardiomyopathy and give indirect evidence of the mechanisms underlying GH and IGF-I action on the human heart , 25 patients with uncomplicated acromegaly [15 young subjects with short-term (< or =5 yr) disease and 10 with long-term (>5 yr) disease ] and 25 sex- and age-matched controls were studied. Cardiovascular risk parameters were studied by standard methods; <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac morphology <END> by M-mode and Doppler echocardiography, cardiac function at rest and at peak exercise by equilibrium radionuclide angiography, and vascular disease at common carotid arteries by Doppler ultrasonography. In the patient group these measurements were repeated after 6 months of treatment with octreotide-LAR (20-40 mg, im, every 28 d). Glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin , insulin , low density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglycerides , and fibrinogen levels were higher, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower in acromegalic patients than in controls . Resting blood pressure was similar in patients and controls , whereas heart rate at rest and systolic blood pressure at peak exercise were higher in the patients . The left ventricular mass index was higher in acromegalic patients than in controls (123.3 +/- 8.9 vs. 81.5 +/- 4.3 g/m(2); P < 0.001); seven patients had left ventricular hypertrophy . Diastolic function was similar in the two groups . The ejection fraction at rest, but not at peak exercise, was significantly increased in the patients compared with controls . As a consequence the exercise-induced changes in the ejection fraction were lower in patients than controls (8.7 +/- 1.1% vs. 21.9 +/- 3.5%; P < 0.001). At common carotid ultrasonography, young patients with acromegaly had <START:PHENOTYPE> increased diastolic peak velocity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> increased intima media thickness <END> , even if neither patient nor controls had <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerotic plaques <END> . Six months after OCT-LAR treatment, GH and IGF-I levels remarkably decreased in all patients ; 8 (53.3%) achieved disease control. Insulin , total cholesterol , and fibrinogen levels reduced, whereas high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased. Both at rest and at peak exercise, heart rate significantly decreased, whereas systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not change. The left ventricular mass index was significantly reduced, but it was still higher than the control value (101.6 +/- 3.5 g/m(2); P < 0.01). The left ventricular ejection fraction at rest was significantly reduced, but its response at peak exercise was increased (16.3 +/- 2.4%), becoming similar to the control value. At common carotids , the <START:PHENOTYPE> intima media thickness of right and left arteries <END> was significantly reduced as was the diastolic peak velocity without any change in systolic peak velocity. <START:PHENOTYPE> Short-term GH excess <END> , despite causing <START:PHENOTYPE> enhanced cardiac performance at rest <END> , reduces cardiac performance on effort and impairs <START:PHENOTYPE> vascular morphology <END> . These deleterious effects of early-onset acromegaly are ameliorated by suppressing GH / IGF-I levels for 6 months.
Pax3-FKHR knock-in mice show <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental aberrations <END> but do not develop tumors .
Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is a pediatric disease specified by the <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent chromosome translocations <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> t(2;13) <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> t(1;13) <END> . These <START:PHENOTYPE> translocations <END> result in the formation of the PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR fusion genes , which are thought to play a causal role in the genesis of this disease . Although PAX3-FKHR exhibits <START:PHENOTYPE> transforming <END> activity in immortalized fibroblast cell lines , a direct role of this fusion protein in <START:PHENOTYPE> tumorigenesis <END> in vivo has not been shown. We determined whether <START:PHENOTYPE> expression of Pax3-FKHR <END> in the mouse germ line would render these animals prone to the development of rhabdomyosarcomas . By targeting FKHR cDNA sequences into the Pax3 locus of embryonic stem cells , we used these cells to generate mice carrying a Pax3-FKHR knock-in allele . Despite <START:PHENOTYPE> low expression of the knock-in allele <END> , heterozygous offspring of Pax3-FKHR chimeric mice showed <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental abnormalities <END> . These included <START:PHENOTYPE> intraventricular septum defects <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tricuspid valve insufficiency <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragm defects <END> , which caused congestive heart failure leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> perinatal death <END> . In addition, Pax3-FKHR heterozygous offspring displayed <START:PHENOTYPE> malformations of some but not all hypaxial muscles <END> . However, neither newborn heterozygous pups nor their chimeric parents showed any signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> malignancy <END> . We conclude that the Pax3-FKHR allele causes <START:PHENOTYPE> lethal developmental defects <END> in knock-in mice but might be insufficient to cause muscle tumors .
Omapatrilat --the story of Overture and Octave.
At the American College of Cardiology in March two major trials were presented. The publicity surrounding the two could not have been more different. The LIFE demonstrated clear superiority of losartan -based therapy over atenolol -based therapy for the treatment of hypertension . It was published the same week in the Lancet and received major press coverage all over the world. The OVERTURE ( Omapatrilat Versus Enalapril Randomized Trial of Utility in Reducing Events) study in contrast received a subdued reception, very little publicity and is yet to be published. 5770 NYHA class II-IV heart failure patients ( <START:PHENOTYPE> LVEF<or=30% <END> , recent heart failure hospital admission) were randomised and uptitrated to either 10 mg BD of Enalapril or 40 mg once a day Omapatrilat . The primary end-point of all cause mortality or heart failure related hospitalisation did not differ significantly: 914/2884 for Enalapril and 914/2886 for Omapatrilat (hazard ratio 0.94, CI's 0.86-1.03, P=0.187). Mortality was also similar: 509 for Enalapril and 477 for Omapatrilat (hazard ratio 0.94, CI's 0.83-1.07, P=0.339). Omapatrilat was as good as Enalapril but not better. The worrying trend was however, that angioedema was more common with Omapatrilat ; 24 (0.8%) versus 14 cases (0.5%). The OCTAVE ( Omapatrilat Cardiovascular Treatment Assessment Versus Enalapril ) study was also presented at this time. 25,267 hypertensives were randomised to Omapatrilat or enalapril and a difference of approximately 3 mmHg in favour of Omapatrilat was seen. Significantly more cases of angioedema were seen with Omapatrilat , 274 (2.17%) compared to 86 (0.68%) with enalapril . Overall <START:PHENOTYPE> death <END> rates were similar, 0.18% for enalapril and 0.15% for Omapatrilat . All <START:PHENOTYPE> adverse events <END> were similar, 51.0% for Omapatrilat and 50.4% for enalapril . The rates of angioedema were much higher in blacks , 5.54% for Ompatrilat and 1.62% for enalapril and for smokers , 3.93% for Omapatrilat and 0.81% for enalapril . We were left with a drug that was, for heart failure , not superior to an ACE inhibitor already off patent, and, as an anti- hypertensive , with an angioedema rate more than double that of an ACE inhibitor in a large head to head comparison. The medical community will be watching to make sure these data are published in full in the medical literature in a timely fashion, in the order of end-points specified in the protocol and with appropriate emphasis on the logical points of presentation.
Interaction between smoking and the <START:PHENOTYPE> stromelysin-1 (MMP3) gene 5A/6A promoter polymorphism <END> and risk of coronary heart disease in healthy men .
Smoking is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease ( CHD ), but this risk may be modified by an individual's genotype . A common functional <START:PHENOTYPE> 5A/6A polymorphism <END> in the promoter of the stromelysin-1 ( matrix metalloproteinase 3 , MMP3 ) gene has been identified. The 6A allele has been consistently associated with faster progression of angiographically determined CHD , while the 5A allele has recently been associated with risk of acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) in patients with unstable angina . To date there has been no prospective study of the relationship of this <START:PHENOTYPE> genotype <END> to CHD risk in smokers and non-smokers . DNA was available from 2,743 middle-aged men , free of CHD at baseline, recruited through nine general practices in the UK for prospective surveillance. To date there have been almost 24,000 person -years of follow-up with 125 CHD events (fatal and non-fatal MI , <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden coronary death <END> , need for coronary artery surgery or new <START:PHENOTYPE> major ECG Q-wave abnormality <END> ). Men with events were each matched for age, practice and cholesterol level with three healthy men . Smoking habit was determined by questionnaire. <START:PHENOTYPE> 5A/6A genotype <END> was determined using a heteroduplex generator method. Associations between <START:PHENOTYPE> genotype <END> and disease outcome, according to smoking status, were assessed using conditional logistic regression. Overall, current smoking was associated with a relative risk (RR) of 1.99 (95% CI 1.30-3.06) as compared with never-smokers and ex-smokers combined (p&0.002). In non-smoking men , and after adjustment for conventional risk factors, compared with the 5A5A group , the RR was 1.37 (0.64-2.94) in those with the <START:PHENOTYPE> genotype 5A6A <END> and 3.02 (1.38-6.61) in those with the <START:PHENOTYPE> genotype 6A6A <END> . Smoking increased risk 1.4 fold in the 5A6A group to 1.91 (1.84-4.36), by 1.3 fold in the 6A6A group to 4.01 (1.57-10.24), but by 3.81 fold (1.54-9.40) in the 5A5A group (smoking- <START:PHENOTYPE> genotype <END> interaction p = 0.01). The data indicate a key role for stromelysin in the <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerotic process <END> . Men with the <START:PHENOTYPE> stromelysin genotype 5A5A <END> represent 29% of the general population , and their high risk, if smokers, provides a further strong argument for smoking avoidance.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion <END> and phenotypic features in 30 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> conotruncal heart defects <END> .
This report describes the <START:PHENOTYPE> dysmorphic features <END> and frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> 22q11.2 deletion <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> del22q11 <END> ) in 30 Turkish patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> conotruncal heart defects <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> CTHDs <END> ). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> deletions in the 22q11.2 region <END> in nine (30%) individuals . The <START:PHENOTYPE> CTHDs <END> in this group were tetralogy of Fallot (four cases ), double-outlet right ventricle ( DORV ) (two cases ), transposition of great arteries (two cases ), and ventricular septal defect ( VSD ) associated with other <START:PHENOTYPE> CTHDs <END> (one case ). The frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> del22q11 <END> in the study group was relatively high because many of the patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> dysmorphic findings <END> also had cardiac anomalies involving the pulmonary artery , ductus arteriosus , or the aortic arch and its main branches . Twenty of the 30 patients exhibited several <START:PHENOTYPE> dysmorphic findings <END> . Two of the nine patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> del22q11 <END> exhibited <START:PHENOTYPE> no apparent dysmorphic features <END> other than <START:PHENOTYPE> sacral dimple <END> . Interestingly, one of the patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> del22q11 <END> had a phenotypic appearance similar to that seen in oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum ( OAVS ). This individual had <START:PHENOTYPE> left microtia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> atresia of the external meatus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular asymmetry <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral facial nerve paralysis <END> . His <START:PHENOTYPE> mental development <END> was normal and there were <START:PHENOTYPE> no abnormalities on ophthalmological examination <END> . The <START:PHENOTYPE> CTHDs <END> in this patient were <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> dextrocardia , DORV , pulmonary stenosis , and VSD . Radiographs of this patient showed platybasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> complete fusion of C2-C3 <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> posterior fusion of the T1-T2 vertebrae <END> . This particular case indicates that the <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotypic features <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> del22q11 <END> and OAVS may overlap.
<START:PHENOTYPE> KCNQ1 gain-of-function mutation <END> in familial atrial fibrillation .
Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is a common cardiac arrhythmia whose molecular etiology is poorly understood. We studied a family with hereditary persistent AF and identified the <START:PHENOTYPE> causative mutation (S140G) in the KCNQ1 <END> ( KvLQT1 ) gene on chromosome 11p15.5 . The KCNQ1 gene encodes the pore-forming alpha subunit of the cardiac I(Ks) channel ( KCNQ1/KCNE1 ), the KCNQ1/KCNE2 and the KCNQ1/KCNE3 potassium channels . Functional analysis of the <START:PHENOTYPE> S140G mutant <END> revealed a gain-of-function effect on the KCNQ1/KCNE1 and the KCNQ1/KCNE2 currents, which contrasts with the dominant negative or loss-of-function effects of the <START:PHENOTYPE> KCNQ1 mutations <END> previously identified in patients with long QT syndrome . Thus, the <START:PHENOTYPE> S140G mutation <END> is likely to initiate and maintain AF by <START:PHENOTYPE> reducing action potential duration and effective refractory period in atrial myocytes <END> .
KLOTHO allele status and the risk of early-onset occult coronary artery disease .
We previously identified a functional variant of KLOTHO (termed " KL-VS "), which harbors two <START:PHENOTYPE> amino acid substitutions <END> in complete linkage disequilibrium and is associated with reduced <START:PHENOTYPE> human longevity <END> when in homozygosity. Klotho-deficient mice display extensive arteriosclerosis when fed a normal diet, suggesting a potent <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic predisposition <END> . To determine whether klotho influences atherosclerotic risk in humans , we performed cross-sectional studies to assess the association between the KL-VS allele and occult coronary artery disease ( CAD ) in two independent samples of apparently healthy siblings of individuals with early-onset (age <60 years) CAD ( SIBS-I [N=520] and SIBS-II [N=436]). Occult CAD was defined as the occurrence of a <START:PHENOTYPE> reversible perfusion defect <END> during exercise thallium scintigraphy and/or as an <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal result of an exercise electrocardiogram <END> ( SIBS-I , n=97; SIBS-II , n=56). In SIBS-I , the KL-VS allele conferred a relative odds of 1.90 (95% confidence interval 1.21-2.98) for occult CAD , after adjusting for familial intraclass correlations (P<.005). Logistic regression modeling, incorporating known CAD risk factors, demonstrated that the KL-VS allele is an independent risk factor (P<.019) and that the imposed risk of KL-VS allele status is influenced by modifiable risk factors. Hypertension (P<.022) and <START:PHENOTYPE> increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels <END> (P<.022) mask or reduce the risk conferred by the KL-VS allele , respectively, whereas current smoking (P<.004) increases the risk. Remarkably concordant effects of the KL-VS allele and modifying factors on the risk of occult CAD were seen in SIBS-II . These results demonstrate that the KL-VS allele is an independent risk factor for occult CAD in two independent high-risk samples . Modifiable risk factors, including hypertension , smoking status, and HDL-C level, appear to influence the risk imposed by this allele .
<START:PHENOTYPE> KCNQ1 mutations <END> in patients with a family history of lethal cardiac arrhythmias and <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden death <END> .
Long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) is the prototype of the <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac ion channelopathies <END> which cause <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden death <END> . LQT1 , due to <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations of KCNQ1 <END> ( KVLQT1 ), is the most common form. This study describes the <START:PHENOTYPE> genotype <END> - <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotype <END> characteristics in 10 families with <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations of KCNQ1 <END> , including 5 <START:PHENOTYPE> novel mutations <END> . One hundred and two families with a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> lethal cardiac events <END> , 55 LQTS , 9 Brugada syndrome , 18 idiopathic ventricular fibrillation ( IVF ), and 20 acquired LQTS , were studied by <START:PHENOTYPE> single-strand conformational polymorphism <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> SSCP <END> ) and DNA sequence analyzes. Families found to have <START:PHENOTYPE> KCNQ1 mutations <END> were phenotyped using ECG parameters and <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac event <END> history, and <START:PHENOTYPE> genotype <END> - <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotype <END> correlation was performed. No <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> were found in Brugada syndrome , IVF , or acquired LQTS families . Ten out of 55 LQTS families had <START:PHENOTYPE> KCNQ1 mutations <END> and 62 carriers were identified. <START:PHENOTYPE> Mutations <END> included <START:PHENOTYPE> G269S in domain S5 <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> W305X, G314C, Y315C, and D317N in the pore region <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> A341E and Q357R in domain S6 <END> ; and <START:PHENOTYPE> 1338insC, G568A and T587M mutations in the C-terminus <END> . <START:PHENOTYPE> W305X <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> G314C <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Q357R <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> 1338insC <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> G568A <END> , appeared to be novel <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> . Gene carriers were 26 +/- 19 years (32 females ). Baseline QTc was 0.47 +/- 0.03 s (range 0.40-0.57 s) and 40% had <START:PHENOTYPE> normal to borderline QTc <END> (< or = 0.46 s). <START:PHENOTYPE> Typical LQT1 T wave patterns <END> were present in at least one affected member of each family , and in 73% of all affected members . A history of <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac events <END> was present in 19/62 (31%), 18 with <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , 2 with aborted cardiac arrest (ACA) and six with <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden death <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> SD <END> ). Two out of 6 <START:PHENOTYPE> SDs <END> (33%) occurred as the <START:PHENOTYPE> first symptom <END> . No difference in <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotype <END> was evident in <START:PHENOTYPE> pore vs. non-pore mutations <END> . <START:PHENOTYPE> KCNQ1 mutations <END> were limited to LQTS families . All five novel <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> produced a <START:PHENOTYPE> typical LQT1 phenotype <END> . Findings emphasize (1) <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced penetrance of QTc <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> symptoms <END> , resulting in diagnostic challenges, (2) the problem of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden death <END> as the <START:PHENOTYPE> first symptom <END> (33% of those who died), and (3) genetic testing is important for identification of gene carriers with <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced penetrance <END> , in order to provide treatment and to prevent lethal cardiac arrhythmias and <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden death <END> .
A locus for autosomal dominant mitral valve prolapse on chromosome 11p15.4 .
Mitral valve prolapse ( MVP ) is a <START:PHENOTYPE> common cardiovascular abnormality <END> in the United States, occurring in approximately 2.4% of the general population . Clinically, patients with MVP exhibit <START:PHENOTYPE> fibromyxomatous changes in one or both of the mitral leaflets <END> that result in <START:PHENOTYPE> superior displacement of the leaflets into the left atrium <END> . Although often clinically benign, MVP can be associated with important accompanying sequelae , including mitral regurgitation , bacterial endocarditis , congestive heart failure , atrial fibrillation , and even <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden death <END> . MVP is genetically heterogeneous and is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant trait <END> that exhibits both sex- and age-dependent penetrance. In this report, we describe the results of a genome scan and show that a locus for MVP maps to chromosome 11p15.4 . Multipoint parametric analysis performed by use of GENEHUNTER gave a maximum LOD score of 3.12 for the chromosomal region immediately surrounding the <START:PHENOTYPE> four-marker haplotype D11S4124-D11S2349-D11S1338-D11S1323 <END> , and multipoint nonparametric analysis (NPL) confirms this finding (NPL=38.59; P=.000397). <START:PHENOTYPE> Haplotype <END> analysis across this region defines a 4.3-cM region between the markers D11S1923 and D11S1331 as the location of a new MVP locus , MMVP2 , and confirms the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder . The discovery of genes involved in the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis <END> of this common disease is crucial to understanding the marked variability in disease expression and mortality seen in MVP .
Familial mitral valve prolapse associated with short stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> characteristic face <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden death <END> .
Mitral valve prolapse ( MVP ) is frequently a <START:PHENOTYPE> familial disorder <END> but in few of these inherited cases it does form a prominent component of a multiple congenital anomaly (MCA) syndrome . We report a family in which eight individuals in four generations were affected by a <START:PHENOTYPE> dominantly inherited disorder <END> involving MVP , short stature , a <START:PHENOTYPE> dolicocephalic face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly angulated ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thin upper lip <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> small mandible <END> . The proband presented with infective mastoiditis , bacterial endocarditis , and a supraventricular tachycardia . One other family member also had infective mastoiditis and bacterial endocarditis and both the proband's mother and grandmother died suddenly at the age of 30 and 25 years, respectively.
NFATc3 and NFATc4 are required for <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac development <END> and mitochondrial function.
Activation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) family of transcription factors is associated with changes in <START:PHENOTYPE> gene expression <END> and myocyte function in adult cardiac and skeletal muscle . However, the role of NFATs in normal <START:PHENOTYPE> embryonic heart development <END> is not well characterized. In this report, the function of NFATc3 and NFATc4 in <START:PHENOTYPE> embryonic heart development <END> was examined in mice with targeted disruption of both nfatc3 and nfatc4 genes . The nfatc3-/-nfatc4-/- mice demonstrate <START:PHENOTYPE> embryonic lethality <END> after embryonic day 10.5 and have <START:PHENOTYPE> thin ventricles <END> , pericardial effusion , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> reduction in ventricular myocyte proliferation <END> . Cardiac mitochondria are swollen with <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal cristae <END> , indicative of <START:PHENOTYPE> metabolic failure <END> , but hallmarks of <START:PHENOTYPE> apoptosis <END> are not evident. Furthermore, enzymatic activity of complex II and IV of the respiratory chain and mitochondrial oxidative activity are reduced in nfatc3-/-nfatc4-/- cardiomyocytes . <START:PHENOTYPE> Cardiac-specific expression of constitutively active NFATc4 <END> in nfatc3-/-nfatc4-/- embryos prolongs <START:PHENOTYPE> embryonic viability <END> to embryonic day 12 and preserves <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular myocyte proliferation <END> , compact zone density, and <START:PHENOTYPE> trabecular formation <END> . The rescued embryos also maintain cardiac mitochondrial ultrastructure and complex II enzyme activity. Together, these data support the hypothesis that loss of NFAT activity in the heart results in a <START:PHENOTYPE> deficiency in mitochondrial energy metabolism <END> required for <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac morphogenesis and function <END> .
Novel <START:PHENOTYPE> deletions in MYH7 and MYBPC3 <END> identified in Indian families with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mutations <END> causing familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) have been described in at least 11 genes encoding cardiac sarcomeric proteins . In this study, three previously unknown deletions have been identified in the human cardiac genes coding for beta-myosin heavy chain ( MYH7 on chromosome 14 ) and myosin-binding protein-C ( MYBPC3 on chromosome 11 ). In family MM , a <START:PHENOTYPE> 3-bp deletion in MYH7 <END> was detected to be associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of glutamic acid in position 927 (DeltaE927) of the myosin rod <END> . In two other families ( HH and NP , related by a common founder ) a <START:PHENOTYPE> 2-bp loss in codon 453 (exon 16) of MYBPC3 <END> was identified as the presumable cause of a <START:PHENOTYPE> translation reading frame shift <END> . Taken together 15 living mutation carriers were investigated. Six deceased family members (with five cases of premature sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) in families MM and NP ) were either obligate or suspected mutation carriers . In addition to these <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> a <START:PHENOTYPE> 25-bp deletion in intron 32 of MYBPC3 <END> was identified in family MM (five carriers ) and in a fourth family ( MiR , one HCM patient , three deletion carriers ). In agreement with the <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of the regular splicing branch point in the altered intron 32 <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> splicing deficiency <END> was observed in an exon trapping experiment using MYBPC3 exon 33 as a test substrate. Varying disease profiles assessed using standard clinical, ECG and echocardiographic procedures in conjunction with <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> analysis led to the following conclusions: (1) In family MM the <START:PHENOTYPE> DeltaE927 deletion in MYH7 <END> was assumed to be associated with complete penetrance. Two cases of reported SCD might have been related to this <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> . (2) The two families , HH and NP , distantly related by a common founder , and both suffering from a <START:PHENOTYPE> 2-bp deletion in exon 16 of MYBPC3 <END> differed in their <START:PHENOTYPE> average phenotypes <END> . In family NP , four cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac death <END> were documented, whereas no <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac-related death <END> was reported from family HH . These results support the notion that <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations in HCM genes <END> may directly determine disease penetrance and severity; however, a contribution of additional, unidentified factors ( genes ) to the <START:PHENOTYPE> HCM phenotype <END> can-at least in some cases -not be excluded. (3) The <START:PHENOTYPE> deletion in intron 32 of MYBPC3 <END> was seen in two families , but in both its relation to disease was not unequivocal. In addition, this <START:PHENOTYPE> deletion <END> was observed in 16 of 229 unrelated healthy individuals of the population of the South Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It was not seen in 270 Caucasians from Russia and western Europe. Hence, it is considered to represent a regional <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic polymorphism <END> restricted to southern India. The association of the <START:PHENOTYPE> deletion <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> altered splicing <END> in transfected cells suggests that this <START:PHENOTYPE> deletion <END> may create a " modifying gene ", which is per se not or only rarely causing HCM , but which may enhance the <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotype of a mutation responsible for disease <END> .
Johnson-McMillin syndrome , a neuroectodermal syndrome with conductive hearing loss and microtia : report of a new case .
In 1983, Johnson et al. described 16 related individuals with alopecia , anosmia or hyposmia , conductive hearing loss , microtia and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> atresia of the external auditory canal <END> , and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Other <START:PHENOTYPE> less constant manifestations <END> included <START:PHENOTYPE> facial asymmetry <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> , cleft palate , and <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal stenosis <END> . An isolated case was reported later ( Johnston et al. [1987: Am J Med Genet 26: 925-927]) and thereafter an affected mother and son ( Hennekam and Holtus [1993: Am J Med Genet 47: 714-716]). We describe an additional unrelated female patient with features resembling those of the previously reported cases . She presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth deficiency <END> , microcephaly , alopecia , bilateral microtia with <START:PHENOTYPE> canal atresia <END> , conductive hearing loss , partial left facial palsy , posterior cleft palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> left choanal stenosis <END> , tetralogy of Fallot , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and right thumb polydactyly . Because the <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotypic abnormalities <END> in this syndrome affect the brain , facial structures , ectoderm and its derivatives , <START:PHENOTYPE> outflow tract of the heart <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Rathke's pouch derivatives <END> , this has suggested to previous authors etiologic involvement of the ectoderm and neuroectoderm of the first and second branchial arches , Rathke's pouch , and the diencephalon . Microtia with conductive hearing loss differentiates the condition from other <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasias <END> . In the initial report, females appeared somewhat less affected than males , and there was <START:PHENOTYPE> male-to-male transmission <END> . The mother of our patient manifests <START:PHENOTYPE> subtle features <END> , which suggest she may be a mildly affected female . Additionally, there is a family history of early-onset alopecia in the maternal grandfather's relatives .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Sexual dimorphism <END> in the growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor axis at <START:PHENOTYPE> birth <END> .
In rodents and humans there is a sexually dimorphic pattern of <START:PHENOTYPE> GH secretion <END> that influences the serum concentration of IGF-I . Pattern differences can be identified in children , but it is not known how early this difference is established. We studied the plasma concentrations of IGF-I , IGF-II , I GF-binding protein-3 ( BP-3 ), and GH in cord blood taken from the offspring of 1650 <START:PHENOTYPE> singleton Caucasian pregnancies <END> born at term and related these values to <START:PHENOTYPE> birth <END> weight, length, and head circumference. <START:PHENOTYPE> Pregnancies <END> complicated by <START:PHENOTYPE> preterm delivery <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> antepartum hemorrhage <END> , pregnancy-induced hypertension , <START:PHENOTYPE> preeclampsia <END> , or gestational diabetes and where cigarette smoking continued were excluded, resulting in a cohort of 987. Cord plasma concentrations of IGF-I , IGF-II , and IGFBP-3 were influenced by factors influencing birth size: <START:PHENOTYPE> gestational age <END> at <START:PHENOTYPE> delivery <END> , mode of <START:PHENOTYPE> delivery <END> , maternal height, and parity of the mother . Plasma GH concentrations were inversely related to the plasma concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 ; 10.2% of the variability in cord plasma IGF-I concentration and 2.7% for IGFBP-3 was explained by sex of the offspring and parity. None of the factors, apart from maternal height, influenced cord serum IGF-II concentrations (adjusted r(2) = 1%). Sex of the baby , mode of <START:PHENOTYPE> delivery <END> , and parity influenced cord serum GH concentrations (adjusted r(2) = 2.6%). <START:PHENOTYPE> Birth <END> weight, length, and head circumference measurements were greater in males than females (P < 0.001). Mean cord plasma concentrations of IGF-I ( males , 66.4 +/- 1.2 micro g/liter; females , 74.5 +/- 1.3 micro g/liter; P < 0.001) and IGFBP-3 ( males , 910 +/- 13 micro g/liter; females 978 +/- 13 micro g/liter; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in males than females . Cord plasma GH concentrations were higher in males than females ( males , 30.0 +/- 1.2 mU/liter; females , 26.9 +/- 1.1 mU/liter; P = 0.05), but no difference was noted between the sexes for IGF-II ( males , 508 +/- 6 micro g/liter; females , 519 +/- 6 micro g/liter; P = NS). After adjustment for gestational age, parity, and maternal height, cord plasma concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 along with sex explained 38.0% of the variability in <START:PHENOTYPE> birth <END> weight, 25.0% in <START:PHENOTYPE> birth <END> length, and 22.7% in head circumference. These data demonstrate that in a group of singleton Caucasian babies born at term, cord plasma IGF-I , IGFBP-3 , and GH concentrations relate to <START:PHENOTYPE> birth <END> size, with evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> sexual dimorphism <END> in the GH - IGF axis.
Ex vivo gene therapy of familial hypercholesterolemia .
Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant disorder <END> caused by a <START:PHENOTYPE> deficiency in the receptor <END> that clears low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) from the serum (reviewed in Ref. 1 and 2). Patients with one abnormal LDL receptor allele have <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate elevations in plasma LDL <END> and suffer premature coronary artery disease ( CAD ). Approximately 5% of all patients under 45 who have had a myocardial infarction carry this <START:PHENOTYPE> trait <END> . Patients with two abnormal LDL receptor genes ( homozygous deficient patients ) have severe hypercholesterolemia and life-threatening coronary artery disease in childhood. Strategies for treating patients with FH are directed at lowering the plasma level of LDL . In heterozygotes , this is accomplished through the administration of drugs that stimulate the <START:PHENOTYPE> expression of LDL receptor from the normal allele <END> (2). This therapeutic approach is not effective in the treatment of homozygous deficient patients , especially those that retain <START:PHENOTYPE> less than 2% of residual LDL receptor activity <END> . Partial amelioration of hyperlipidemia has been achieved in some homozygous deficient patients by diverting the <START:PHENOTYPE> portal circulation <END> through a portacaval anastomosis (3) and by chronic plasmapheresis therapy (4). A more direct approach has been to correct the <START:PHENOTYPE> deficiency of hepatic LDL receptor <END> by transplanting a liver that expresses <START:PHENOTYPE> normal levels of LDL receptor <END> . Three patients that survived this procedure normalized their serum LDL-cholesterol (5-9). We have used an authentic animal model for FH , the Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic rabbit ( WHHL ), to develop gene therapies for the homozygous form of FH (10-13). The WHHL rabbit has a mutation in its LDL receptor gene which renders the receptor completely dysfunctional (12) leading to severe hypercholesterolemia , diffuse atherosclerosis , and premature death. The potential efficacy of gene therapy for FH is supported by a series of studies we have performed in the WHHL rabbit in which we have achieved metabolic improvement (14-18). Liver tissue was removed from WHHL rabbits and used to isolate hepatocytes and establish primary cultures. A functional rabbit LDL receptor gene was transduced into a high proportion of hepatocytes using recombinant retroviruses , and the genetically corrected cells were transplanted into the animal from which they were derived. Transplantation of the genetically corrected, autologous hepatocytes was associated with a 30-40% decrease in serum cholesterol that persisted for the duration of the experiment (4 months, Ref. 18). Recombinant derived LDL receptor RNA was detected in liver for at least 6 months. There was no apparent immunological response to the recombinant derived LDL receptor .(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Down's syndrome : an <START:PHENOTYPE> atheroma <END> -free model?
Postmortem examination of five institutionalised patients with Down's syndrome ( DS ) aged 40-66 years showed a <START:PHENOTYPE> complete absence of atheroma <END> , while a similar number of mental defectives with DS were found to have <START:PHENOTYPE> mild or severe atheroma <END> . Previous investigation of risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> atheroma <END> in 70 patients with DS and 70 age-and sex-matched mental defectives living in the same institution showed <START:PHENOTYPE> significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures <END> in the DS group , with the exception of systolic pressure in men under 40. Fasting serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were similar in the two groups , but triglyceride concentrations were significantly lower than in normal people without a history of vascular disease . These unexplained observations may be relevant in further studies of the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis of atheroma <END> .
Identification and functional analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> ZIC3 mutations <END> in heterotaxy and related congenital heart defects .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mutations in the zinc finger transcription factor ZIC3 <END> cause X-linked heterotaxy and have also been identified in patients with isolated congenital heart disease ( CHD ). To determine the relative contribution of <START:PHENOTYPE> ZIC3 mutations <END> to both heterotaxy and isolated CHD , we screened the coding region of ZIC3 in 194 unrelated patients , including 61 patients with classic heterotaxy , 93 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> heart defects <END> characteristic of heterotaxy , and 11 patients with situs inversus totalis . Five novel <START:PHENOTYPE> ZIC3 mutations <END> in three classic heterotaxy kindreds and two sporadic CHD cases were identified. None of these alleles was found in 97 ethnically matched control samples . On the basis of these analyses, we conclude that the phenotypic spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> ZIC3 mutations <END> should be expanded to include affected females and CHD not typical for heterotaxy . This screening of a cohort of patients with sporadic heterotaxy indicates that <START:PHENOTYPE> ZIC3 mutations <END> account for approximately 1% of affected individuals . <START:PHENOTYPE> Missense and nonsense mutations <END> were found in the highly conserved zinc finger-binding domain and in the N-terminal protein domain . Functional analysis of all currently known <START:PHENOTYPE> ZIC3 point mutations <END> indicates that <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations in the putative zinc finger DNA binding domain and in the N-terminal domain <END> result in <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of reporter gene transactivation <END> . It is surprising that transfection studies demonstrate <START:PHENOTYPE> aberrant cytoplasmic localization <END> resulting from <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations between amino acids 253-323 of the ZIC3 protein <END> , indicating that the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis of a subset of ZIC3 mutations <END> results at least in part from <START:PHENOTYPE> failure of appropriate nuclear localization <END> . These results further expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> ZIC3 mutations <END> and provide initial mechanistic insight into their functional consequences.
The HLA-DRB1 locus as a genetic component in giant cell arteritis . Mapping of a disease-linked sequence motif to the antigen binding site of the HLA-DR molecule .
Giant cell arteritis ( GCA ) is a granulomatous vasculitis affecting persons over 50 years of age. The <START:PHENOTYPE> inflammatory infiltrate <END> , which is targeted at the aorta and its proximal branches , includes activated CD4+ helper T cells , histiocytes , and giant cells . To investigate whether the <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic polymorphism of the HLA-DRB1 genes <END> contributes to the <START:PHENOTYPE> local accumulation of activated T cells <END> , we have analyzed both HLA-DRB1 alleles in a cohort of 42 patients with biopsy-proven GCA . The majority of patients (60%) expressed the B1*0401 or B1*0404/8 variant of the <START:PHENOTYPE> HLA-DR4 haplotype <END> , both of which also represent the major genetic factors underlying the disease association in RA . GCA patients <START:PHENOTYPE> negative for the disease-linked HLA-DR4 alleles <END> were characterized by a <START:PHENOTYPE> nonrandom distribution of HLA-DRB1 alleles <END> . Sequence comparison among the allelic products identified in the GCA cohort demonstrated heterogeneity for the <START:PHENOTYPE> sequence polymorphism of the third hypervariable region <END> ( HVR ), but homology for the polymorphic residues within the HVR2 of the HLA-DRB1 gene . The GCA patients shared a sequence motif spanning amino acid positions 28-31 of the HLA-DR beta 1 chain . In the structural model for HLA-DR molecules , this sequence motif can be mapped to the antigen-binding site of the HLA complex , suggesting a crucial role of <START:PHENOTYPE> antigen selection and presentation <END> in GCA . In contrast, the <START:PHENOTYPE> sequence polymorphism <END> linked to RA has been mapped to the HVR3 of the HLA-DRB1 gene and translates into a distinct domain of the HLA-DR molecule , the alpha-helical loop surrounding the antigen-binding groove . A consecutive case series study demonstrated that GCA and RA rarely co-occurred, supporting the interpretation that distinct functional domains of the HLA-DR molecule are implicated in the pathomechanisms of these two autoimmune diseases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital disorder of oxygen sensing <END> : association of the <START:PHENOTYPE> homozygous Chuvash polycythemia VHL mutation <END> with thrombosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> vascular abnormalities <END> but not tumors .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Adaptation to hypoxia <END> is critical for <START:PHENOTYPE> survival <END> and regulates multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> processes <END> , including <START:PHENOTYPE> erythropoiesis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculogenesis <END> . Chuvash polycythemia is a <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoxia-sensing disorder <END> characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> homozygous mutation (598C>T) of von Hippel-Lindau gene <END> ( VHL ), a negative regulator of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoxia sensing <END> . Although endemic to the Chuvash population of Russia, this <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> occurs worldwide and originates from a single ancient event. That <START:PHENOTYPE> VHL 598C>T <END> homozygosity causes <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated normoxic levels of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), serum erythropoietin and hemoglobin <END> is known, but the <START:PHENOTYPE> disease phenotype <END> has not been documented in a controlled manner. In this matched cohort study, <START:PHENOTYPE> VHL 598C>T <END> homozygosity was associated with vertebral hemangiomas , varicose veins , <START:PHENOTYPE> lower blood pressures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations <END> (P <.0005), as well as <START:PHENOTYPE> premature mortality related to cerebral vascular events <END> and peripheral thrombosis . Spinocerebellar hemangioblastomas , renal carcinomas , and pheochromocytomas typical of classical VHL syndrome were not found, suggesting that <START:PHENOTYPE> overexpression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF <END> is not sufficient for <START:PHENOTYPE> tumorigenesis <END> . Although hemoglobin -adjusted serum erythropoietin concentrations were approximately 10-fold higher in VHL 598C>T homozygotes than in controls , <START:PHENOTYPE> erythropoietin response to hypoxia <END> was identical. Thus, Chuvash polycythemia is a distinct VHL syndrome manifested by thrombosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> vascular abnormalities <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intact hypoxic regulation <END> despite <START:PHENOTYPE> increased basal expression of hypoxia-regulated genes <END> .
Effective long-term control of <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac events <END> with beta-blockers in a family with a <START:PHENOTYPE> common LQT1 mutation <END> .
The congenital long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) is characterized by a <START:PHENOTYPE> prolonged QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram <END> and an increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent syncope <END> and sudden cardiac death . <START:PHENOTYPE> Mutations in seven genes <END> have been identified as the molecular basis of LQTS . beta-blockers are the treatment of choice to reduce <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac symptoms <END> . However, long-term follow-up of genotyped families with LQTS has been rarely reported. We have clinically followed a four-generation family with LQTS being treated with beta-blocker therapy over a period of 23 years. Seven family members were carriers of two <START:PHENOTYPE> amino acid alterations in cis (V254M-V417M) in the cardiac potassium channel gene KCNQ1 <END> . Voltage-clamp recordings of mutant KCNQ1 protein in Xenopus oocytes showed that only the V254M mutation reduced the IKs current and that the effect of the V417M variant was negligible. The family exhibited the <START:PHENOTYPE> complete clinical spectrum of the disease <END> , from asymptomatic patients to victims of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden death <END> before beta-blocker therapy. There was <START:PHENOTYPE> no significant reduction in QTc <END> (556 +/- 40 ms(1/2) before therapy, 494 +/- 20 ms(1/2) during 17 years of treatment; n = 5 individuals ). Of nine family members , one female died suddenly before treatment, three females of the second generation were <START:PHENOTYPE> asymptomatic <END> , and four individuals of the third and fourth generation were symptomatic. All mutation carriers were treated with beta-blockers and remained asymptomatic for a follow-up up to 23 years. Long-term follow-up of a LQT1 family with a <START:PHENOTYPE> common mutation (V254M) <END> being on beta-blocker therapy was effective and safe. This study underscores the importance of long-term follow-up in families with <START:PHENOTYPE> specific LQT mutations <END> to provide valuable information for clinicians for an appropriate antiarrhythmic treatment.
In vitro expression studies of a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation delta299 <END> in a patient affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> apparent mineralocorticoid excess <END> .
Apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome ( AME ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive disorder <END> that results in low renin hypertension and other <START:PHENOTYPE> characteristic clinical features <END> . Typical patients present with severe hypertension , hypokalemia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> undetectable aldosterone <END> . Most patients also have <START:PHENOTYPE> low birth weight <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , and nephrocalcinosis . The <START:PHENOTYPE> 11betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11betaHSD2) defect <END> is documented by demonstrating a <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to convert cortisol to cortisone <END> . Here, we report a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> typical phenotypic features of AME <END> who does not carry any of the previously described <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations in the HSD11B2 gene <END> . This female patient from a consanguineous Pakistani family presented at age 9 yr. She had a <START:PHENOTYPE> low birth weight <END> compared with her siblings and presented with hypertension (225/120 mm Hg), <START:PHENOTYPE> low plasma renin activity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> suppressed aldosterone <END> , and bilateral nephrocalcinosis . Echocardiogram did not reveal left ventricular hypertrophy , and baseline ophthalmological evaluation did not demonstrate hypertensive retinopathy . However, at age 12 yr, she developed mild to moderate hypertensive retinopathy . Biochemical analysis showed an <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated urinary cortisol to cortisone metabolites ratio <END> ( tetrahydrocortisol and 5alpha-tetrahydrocortisol / tetrahydrocortisone ) of 28 (normal, 0.66-2.44). She had a <START:PHENOTYPE> cortisol secretion rate of 0.43 mg/d <END> (normal, 5-25 mg/d). Sequence analysis of the HSD11B2 gene revealed a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> homozygous delta299 mutation in exon 5 <END> . In vitro expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells revealed that this mutation resulted in no activity.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency <END> , clinical, biochemical and genetic aspects.
The carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase ( CACT ) is one of the components of the <START:PHENOTYPE> carnitine cycle <END> . The <START:PHENOTYPE> carnitine cycle <END> is necessary to shuttle long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol into the intramitochondrial space where <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids <END> takes place. The oxidation of fatty acids yields acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) units , which may either be degraded to CO(2) and H (2)O in the <START:PHENOTYPE> citric acid cycle <END> to produce ATP or converted into ketone bodies which occurs in liver and kidneys . Metabolic consequences of a defective CACT are <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoketotic hypoglycaemia <END> under fasting conditions, <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperammonemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated creatine kinase and transaminases <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dicarboxylic aciduria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> very low free carnitine <END> and an <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal acylcarnitine profile with marked elevation of the long-chain acylcarnitines <END> . <START:PHENOTYPE> Clinical signs and symptoms <END> in CACT deficient patients , are a combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> energy depletion <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> endogenous toxicity <END> . The predominantly affected organs are brain , heart and skeletal muscle , and liver , leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> neurological abnormalities <END> , cardiomyopathy and arrythmias , <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal muscle damage <END> and liver dysfunction . Most patients become symptomatic in the neonatal period with a <START:PHENOTYPE> rapidly progressive deterioration <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> high mortality rate <END> . However, presentations at a later age with a <START:PHENOTYPE> milder phenotype <END> have also been reported. The therapeutic approach is the same as in other <START:PHENOTYPE> long-chain fatty acid disorders <END> and includes intravenous glucose (+/- insulin ) administration to maximally inhibit <START:PHENOTYPE> lipolysis <END> and subsequent <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty acid oxidation <END> during the <START:PHENOTYPE> acute deterioration <END> , along with other measures such as <START:PHENOTYPE> ammonia detoxification <END> , depending on the clinical features. Long-term strategy consists of avoidance of fasting with frequent meals and a special diet with restriction of long-chain fatty acids . Due to the <START:PHENOTYPE> extremely low free carnitine concentrations <END> , carnitine supplementation is often needed. Acylcarnitine profiling in plasma is the assay of choice for the diagnosis at a metabolite level. However, since the acylcarnitine profile observed in CACT-deficient patients is identical to that in CPT2-deficient patients , definitive identification of <START:PHENOTYPE> CACT-deficiency <END> in a certain patient requires determination of the activity of CACT . Subsequently, mutational analysis of the CACT gene can be performed. So far, 9 different <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> have been identified in the CACT gene .
Molecular and functional analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> SLC25A20 mutations <END> causing <START:PHENOTYPE> carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency <END> .
The enzyme carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase ( CACT ) is involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria. <START:PHENOTYPE> CACT deficiency <END> is a <START:PHENOTYPE> life-threatening, recessively inherited disorder of lipid beta-oxidation <END> which manifests in early infancy with hypoketotic hypoglycemia , cardiomyopathy , liver failure , and muscle weakness . We report here the clinical, biochemical, and molecular features of six CACT-deficient patients from Italy, Spain, and North America who exhibited significant clinical heterogeneity. In five patients ( Patients 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 ) the disease manifested in the neonatal period, while the remaining patient ( Patient 3 ), the younger sibling of an infant who had died with clinical suspicion of <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty acid oxidation defect <END> , has been treated since <START:PHENOTYPE> birth <END> and was clinically asymptomatic at 4.5 years of age. Patients 1 and 4 were deceased within 6 months from the onset of this study, while the remaining four are still alive at 8, 4.5, 3.5, and 2 years, respectively. Sequence analysis of the CACT gene ( SLC25A20 ) disclosed five novel <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> and three previously reported <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> . Three patients were homozygous for the identified <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> . Two of the novel <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> c.718+1G>C <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> c.843+4_843+50del <END> ) altered the donor splice site of introns 7 and 8 , respectively. The <START:PHENOTYPE> 47-nt deletion in intron 8 <END> caused both <START:PHENOTYPE> skipping of exon 8 <END> only and <START:PHENOTYPE> skipping of exons 6-8 <END> . Four <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> [[ <START:PHENOTYPE> c.159dupT;c.163delA <END> ] ([ <START:PHENOTYPE> p.Gly54Trp;p.Thr55Ala <END> ]) <START:PHENOTYPE> c.397C>T <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> p.Arg133Trp <END> ), <START:PHENOTYPE> c.691G>C <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> p.Asp231His <END> ), and <START:PHENOTYPE> c.842C>T <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> p.Ala281Val <END> )] resulted in <START:PHENOTYPE> amino acid substitutions <END> affecting evolutionarily conserved regions of the protein . Interestingly, one of these <START:PHENOTYPE> exonic mutations <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> p.Ala281Val <END> ) was associated with a <START:PHENOTYPE> splicing defect <END> also characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> skipping of exons 6-8 <END> . The deleterious effect of the <START:PHENOTYPE> p.Arg133Trp substitution <END> was demonstrated by measuring CACT activity upon expression of the normal and the mutant protein in E. coli and functional reconstitution into liposomes. Combined analysis of clinical, biochemical, and molecular data failed to indicate a correlation between the <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotype <END> and the <START:PHENOTYPE> genotype <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Decreased mechanical stiffness <END> in LMNA-/- cells is caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> defective nucleo-cytoskeletal integrity <END> : implications for the development of laminopathies .
Laminopathies comprise a group of inherited diseases with variable <START:PHENOTYPE> clinical phenotypes <END> , caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations in the lamin A/C gene <END> ( LMNA ). A prominent feature in several of these diseases is <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle wasting <END> , as seen in Emery-Dreifuss muscle dystrophy , dilated cardiomyopathy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy . Although the mechanisms underlying this <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotype <END> remain largely obscure, two major working hypotheses are currently being investigated, namely, <START:PHENOTYPE> defects in gene regulation <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormalities in nuclear architecture <END> causing <START:PHENOTYPE> cellular fragility <END> . In this study, using a newly developed cell compression device we have tested the latter hypothesis. The device allows controlled application of mechanical load onto single living cells , with simultaneous visualization of <START:PHENOTYPE> cellular deformation <END> and quantitation of resistance. With the device, we have compared wild-type (MEF+/+) and LMNA knockout (MEF-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ), and found that MEF-/- cells show a <START:PHENOTYPE> significantly decreased mechanical stiffness <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> significantly lower bursting force <END> . Partial rescue of the <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotype <END> by transfection with either lamin A or lamin C prevented gross <START:PHENOTYPE> nuclear disruption <END> , as seen in MEF-/- cells , but was unable to fully restore <START:PHENOTYPE> mechanical stiffness <END> in these cells . Our studies show a direct correlation between <START:PHENOTYPE> absence of LMNA proteins <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nuclear fragility in living cells <END> . Simultaneous recordings by confocal microscopy revealed that the nuclei in MEF-/- cells , in contrast to MEF+/+ cells , exhibited an <START:PHENOTYPE> isotropic deformation upon indentation <END> , despite an <START:PHENOTYPE> anisotropic deformation of the cell <END> as a whole. This <START:PHENOTYPE> nuclear behaviour <END> is indicative for a <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of interaction of the disturbed nucleus with the surrounding cytoskeleton <END> . In addition, careful investigation of the three-dimensional organization of actin -, vimentin - and tubulin -based filaments showed a <START:PHENOTYPE> disturbed interaction of these structures in MEF-/- cells <END> . Therefore, we suggest that in addition to the <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of nuclear stiffness <END> , the <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of a physical interaction between nuclear structures (i.e. lamins) and the cytoskeleton <END> is causing <START:PHENOTYPE> more general cellular weakness <END> and emphasizes a potential key function for lamins in <START:PHENOTYPE> maintaining cellular tensegrity <END> .
Identification of a <START:PHENOTYPE> KCNE2 gain-of-function mutation <END> in patients with familial atrial fibrillation .
Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. We first reported an <START:PHENOTYPE> S140G mutation of KCNQ1 <END> , an alpha subunit of potassium channels , in one Chinese kindred with AF . However, the <START:PHENOTYPE> molecular defects <END> and cellular mechanisms in most patients with AF remain to be identified. We evaluated 28 unrelated Chinese kindreds with AF and sequenced eight genes of potassium channels ( KCNQ1 , HERG , KCNE1 , KCNE2 , KCNE3 , KCNE4 , KCNE5 , and KCNJ2 ). An <START:PHENOTYPE> arginine-to-cysteine mutation at position 27 (R27C) of KCNE2 <END> , the beta subunit of the KCNQ1-KCNE2 channel responsible for a <START:PHENOTYPE> background potassium current <END> , was found in 2 of the 28 probands . The <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> was present in all affected members in the two kindreds and was absent in 462 healthy unrelated Chinese subjects . Similar to <START:PHENOTYPE> KCNQ1 S140G <END> , the <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> had a gain-of-function effect on the KCNQ1-KCNE2 channel ; unlike <START:PHENOTYPE> long QT syndrome-associated KCNE2 mutations <END> , it did not alter <START:PHENOTYPE> HERG-KCNE2 current <END> . The <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> did not alter the functions of the HCN channel family either. Thus, <START:PHENOTYPE> KCNE2 R27C <END> is a <START:PHENOTYPE> gain-of-function mutation <END> associated with the initiation and/or maintenance of AF .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Genetic variation at the locus <END> encompassing 11-beta hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase accounts for <START:PHENOTYPE> heritability in cortisol precursor (11-deoxycortisol) urinary metabolite excretion <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Genetic variation in the gene <END> encoding aldosterone synthase ( CYP11B2 ) has previously been shown to be associated with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy . The <START:PHENOTYPE> intermediate phenotype <END> most consistently associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> variation at this locus <END> is that of <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated plasma 11-deoxycortisol <END> ( S ). However, in normal subjects , aldosterone synthase does not metabolize S , which is converted to cortisol ( F ) by the enzyme 11 beta hydroxylase , encoded by the gene CYP11B1 , which lies adjacent to CYP11B2 on chromosome 8 . It is possible that the quantitative trait locus for the <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotype <END> is within CYP11B1 and that linkage disequilibrium across the extended locus could account for these observations. However, <START:PHENOTYPE> variation across the whole CYP11B1/B2 locus <END> had not been extensively characterized with respect to these <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotypes <END> . We genotyped six <START:PHENOTYPE> polymorphisms in the CYP11B2 gene <END> and three <START:PHENOTYPE> polymorphisms in the CYP11B1 gene <END> in 248 Caucasian nuclear families comprising 1428 individuals . We measured plasma levels of S and F in 460 individuals from 86 families and <START:PHENOTYPE> urinary excretion <END> rates of tetrahydrodeoxycortisol ( THS ) and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone in 573 individuals from 105 families . We examined heritability of the <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotypes <END> and their association with <START:PHENOTYPE> genotypes and haplotypes at this locus <END> . All <START:PHENOTYPE> steroid phenotypes <END> except urinary tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone were highly heritable (P < 0.00001). There was strong linkage disequilibrium across the CYP11B1/B2 locus . There was modest evidence for association between <START:PHENOTYPE> polymorphisms of CYP11B2 <END> and plasma levels of S (P = 0.02 for <START:PHENOTYPE> T4986C polymorphism <END> ) and the plasma S to F ratio, reflecting the activity of 11-beta hydroxylase (P = 0.01 for <START:PHENOTYPE> T4986C polymorphism <END> ). There was strong evidence for association between <START:PHENOTYPE> polymorphisms of both CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 <END> and urinary THS , which was strongest for the <START:PHENOTYPE> CYP11B1 exon 1 polymorphism <END> (P = 0.00002). Addition of other marker data to CYP11B1 exon 1 did not improve the fit of a log-linear model. <START:PHENOTYPE> Genotype at CYP11B1 <END> explained approximately 5% of the variance in <START:PHENOTYPE> urinary THS excretion <END> in the population . Thus, it is likely that linkage disequilibrium between causative CYP11B1 variants and <START:PHENOTYPE> CYP11B2 polymorphisms <END> account for the previous observations. Further fine-mapping studies across the CYP11B1 locus are required to localize the causative variant(s) for the <START:PHENOTYPE> biochemical phenotype <END> ; this may also identify susceptibility alleles for hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy .
Genetic heterogeneity in LEOPARD syndrome : two families with <START:PHENOTYPE> no mutations in PTPN11 <END> .
LEOPARD syndrome ( lentigines , <START:PHENOTYPE> electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities <END> , ocular hypertelorism , pulmonary stenosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal genitalia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retardation of growth <END> , and sensorineural deafness ) is an autosomal dominant condition. The <START:PHENOTYPE> main clinical features <END> include multiple lentigines , <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiovascular defects <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> facial anomalies <END> , some of which are shared with Noonan syndrome ( NS ). Recent reports have shown that LEOPARD syndrome can be caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations in PTPN11 <END> , the gene in which <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> can produce NS . Here we report the findings of <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> screening and linkage analysis of PTPN11 in three families with LEOPARD syndrome . We identified a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> in one family . The <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> 1529A>C <END> ) substitutes proline for glutamine at amino acid 510 ( <START:PHENOTYPE> Gln510Pro <END> ). <START:PHENOTYPE> No variations in sequence <END> were observed in the other two families , and negative LOD scores excluded linkage to the PTPN11 locus , showing that LEOPARD syndrome is genetically heterogeneous.
The secreted glycoprotein lubricin protects cartilage surfaces and inhibits <START:PHENOTYPE> synovial cell overgrowth <END> .
The long-term integrity of an articulating joint is dependent upon the nourishment of its cartilage component and the <START:PHENOTYPE> protection of the cartilage surface from friction-induced wear <END> . <START:PHENOTYPE> Loss-of-function mutations in lubricin <END> (a secreted glycoprotein encoded by the gene PRG4 ) cause the human autosomal recessive disorder camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome ( CACP ). A major feature of CACP is <START:PHENOTYPE> precocious joint failure <END> . In order to delineate the mechanism by which lubricin protects joints , we studied the <START:PHENOTYPE> expression of Prg4 mRNA during mouse joint development <END> , and we created lubricin-mutant mice . Prg4 began to be expressed in surface chondrocytes and synoviocytes after <START:PHENOTYPE> joint cavitation <END> had occurred and remained strongly expressed by these cells postnatally. Mice lacking lubricin were viable and fertile. In the newborn period, their joints appeared normal. As the mice aged, we observed <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal protein deposits on the cartilage surface <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> disappearance of underlying superficial zone chondrocytes <END> . In addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> cartilage surface changes <END> and subsequent <START:PHENOTYPE> cartilage deterioration <END> , intimal cells in the synovium surrounding the joint space became hyperplastic, which further contributed to <START:PHENOTYPE> joint failure <END> . Purified or recombinant lubricin inhibited the <START:PHENOTYPE> growth of these synoviocytes <END> in vitro. Tendon and tendon sheath involvement was present in the ankle joints , where <START:PHENOTYPE> morphologic changes and abnormal calcification of these structures <END> were observed. We conclude that lubricin has multiple functions in articulating joints and tendons that include the <START:PHENOTYPE> protection of surfaces <END> and the <START:PHENOTYPE> control of synovial cell growth <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Phenotypes with GATA4 or NKX2.5 mutations <END> in familial atrial septal defect .
Recently, GATA4 and NKX2.5 were reported as the disease genes of atrial septal defect ( ASD ) but the relationship between the locations of their <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotypes <END> is not clear. We analyzed <START:PHENOTYPE> GATA4 and NKX2.5 mutations <END> in 16 familial ASD cases , including four probands with atrioventricular conduction disturbance ( AV block ) and two with pulmonary stenosis ( PS ), by PCR and direct sequencing, and examined their <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotypes <END> clinically. Five <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> , including two <START:PHENOTYPE> GATA4 and three NKX2.5 mutations <END> , were identified in 31.3% of the probands with ASD , and three of them were novel. The two <START:PHENOTYPE> GATA4 mutations <END> in the probands without AV block were <START:PHENOTYPE> S52F <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> E359Xfs <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> c.1075delG <END> ) that was reported previously, and three <START:PHENOTYPE> NKX2.5 mutations <END> in the probands with AV block were <START:PHENOTYPE> A88Xfs <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> c.262delG <END> ), <START:PHENOTYPE> R190C <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> T178M <END> . Additionally, we observed some <START:PHENOTYPE> remarkable phenotypes <END> , i.e., dextrocardia with <START:PHENOTYPE> E359Xfs <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> c.1075delG <END> ) and cribriform type ASD with <START:PHENOTYPE> R190C <END> , both of which are expected to be clues for further investigations. Furthermore, progressive, most severe AV block was closely related with a <START:PHENOTYPE> missense mutation in a homeodomain <END> or with a <START:PHENOTYPE> nonsense/frame-shift mutation of NKX2.5 <END> for which classification has not been clearly proposed. This pinpoints essential sites of NKX2.5 in the <START:PHENOTYPE> development of the conduction system <END> .
Fatal congenital heart glycogenosis caused by a recurrent activating <START:PHENOTYPE> R531Q mutation <END> in the gamma 2-subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase ( PRKAG2 ), not by <START:PHENOTYPE> phosphorylase kinase deficiency <END> .
Fatal congenital nonlysosomal cardiac glycogenosis has been attributed to a subtype of <START:PHENOTYPE> phosphorylase kinase deficiency <END> , but the underlying genes and <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> have not been identified. Analyzing four sporadic, unrelated patients , we found <START:PHENOTYPE> no mutations either in the eight genes <END> encoding phosphorylase kinase subunits or in the two genes encoding the muscle and brain isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase . However, in three of five patients , we identified identical <START:PHENOTYPE> heterozygous R531Q missense mutations of the PRKAG2 gene <END> , which encodes the gamma 2-subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase , a key regulator of energy balance. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant R531Q mutant protein showed <START:PHENOTYPE> >100-fold reduction of binding affinities for the regulatory nucleotides AMP and ATP <END> but an <START:PHENOTYPE> enhanced basal activity and increased phosphorylation of the alpha -subunit <END> . Other <START:PHENOTYPE> PRKAG2 missense mutations <END> were previously identified in patients with autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome , characterized by juvenile-to-adult clinical onset, <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate cardiac glycogenosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> disturbed excitation conduction <END> , risk of sudden cardiac death in midlife, and <START:PHENOTYPE> molecular perturbations <END> that are similar to--but less severe than--those observed for the <START:PHENOTYPE> R531Q mutation <END> . Thus, <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent heterozygous R531Q missense mutations in PRKAG2 <END> give rise to a massive nonlysosomal cardiac glycogenosis of fetal symptomatic onset and rapidly fatal course, constituting a genotypically and clinically distinct variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome . <START:PHENOTYPE> R531Q <END> and other <START:PHENOTYPE> PRKAG2 mutations <END> enhance the basal activity and <START:PHENOTYPE> alpha -subunit phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase <END> , explaining the dominant nature of <START:PHENOTYPE> PRKAG2 disease mutations <END> . Since not all cases displayed <START:PHENOTYPE> PRKAG2 mutations <END> , fatal congenital nonlysosomal cardiac glycogenosis seems to be genetically heterogeneous. However, the existence of a <START:PHENOTYPE> heart-specific primary phosphorylase kinase deficiency <END> is questionable, because <START:PHENOTYPE> no phosphorylase kinase mutations <END> were found.
A <START:PHENOTYPE> Kir2.1 gain-of-function mutation <END> underlies familial atrial fibrillation .
The inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir2.1 mediates the <START:PHENOTYPE> potassium I(K1) current in the heart <END> . It is encoded by KCNJ2 gene that has been linked to Andersen's syndrome . Recently, strong evidences showed that Kir2.1 channels were associated with mouse atrial fibrillation ( AF ), therefore we hypothesized that KCNJ2 was associated with familial AF . Thirty Chinese AF kindreds were evaluated for <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations in KCNJ2 gene <END> . A <START:PHENOTYPE> valine-to-isoleucine mutation at position 93 (V93I) of Kir2.1 <END> was found in all affected members in one kindred . This valine and its flanking sequence is highly conserved in Kir2.1 proteins among different species. Functional analysis of the <START:PHENOTYPE> V93I mutant <END> demonstrated a gain-of-function consequence on the <START:PHENOTYPE> Kir2.1 current <END> . This effect is opposed to the loss-of-function effect of previously reported <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> in Andersen's syndrome . <START:PHENOTYPE> Kir2.1 V93I mutation <END> may play a role in initiating and/or maintaining AF by increasing the activity of the inward rectifier K(+) channel .
CDG-IL : an infant with a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation in the ALG9 gene <END> and additional <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotypic features <END> .
We describe the second case of congenital disorder of glycosylation type IL ( CDG-IL ) caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> deficiency of the ALG9 a1,2 mannosyltransferase enzyme <END> . The female infant 's features included <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , seizures , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse brain atrophy with delayed myelination <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , pericardial effusion , cystic renal disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatosplenomegaly <END> , esotropia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> inverted nipples <END> . Lipodystrophy and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysmorphic facial features <END> were absent. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed <START:PHENOTYPE> volume loss in the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed myelination <END> . Laboratory investigations revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> low levels of multiple serum proteins <END> including antithrombin III , factor XI , and cholesterol . <START:PHENOTYPE> Hypoglycosylation <END> was confirmed by the typical CDG type 1 pattern of serum transferrin analyzed by isoelectric focusing. A <START:PHENOTYPE> defect in the ALG9 enzyme <END> was suggested by the <START:PHENOTYPE> accumulation of the DolPP-GlcNAc2Man6 and DolPP-GlcNAc2Man8 <END> in the patient's fibroblasts and confirmed by <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> analysis: the patient is homozygous for the <START:PHENOTYPE> ALG9 mutation <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> p.Y286C <END> . The causal effect of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> was shown by complementation assays in alg9 deficient yeast cells. The child described here further delineates the clinical spectrum of CDG-IL and confirms the significant clinical overlap amongst CDG subtypes.
Diversity and functional consequences of <START:PHENOTYPE> germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations <END> in human disease .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Germline mutations in PTPN11 <END> , the gene encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 , cause Noonan syndrome ( NS ) and the clinically related LEOPARD syndrome ( LS ), whereas <START:PHENOTYPE> somatic mutations in the same gene <END> contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemogenesis <END> . On the basis of our previously gathered genetic and biochemical data, we proposed a model that splits <START:PHENOTYPE> NS- and leukemia-associated PTPN11 mutations <END> into two major classes of <START:PHENOTYPE> activating lesions <END> with differential perturbing effects on <START:PHENOTYPE> development <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hematopoiesis <END> . To test this model, we investigated further the diversity of <START:PHENOTYPE> germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations <END> , delineated the association of those <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> with disease , characterized biochemically a panel of mutant SHP-2 proteins recurring in NS , LS , and leukemia , and performed molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural effects of selected <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> . Our results document a strict correlation between the identity of the <START:PHENOTYPE> lesion <END> and disease and demonstrate that <START:PHENOTYPE> NS-causative mutations <END> have less potency for promoting SHP-2 gain of function than do <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia-associated ones <END> . Furthermore, we show that the <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent LS-causing Y279C and T468M amino acid substitutions <END> engender <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of SHP-2 catalytic activity <END> , identifying a previously unrecognized behavior for this class of <START:PHENOTYPE> missense PTPN11 mutations <END> .
The biochemical, clinical, and genetic features of type III hyperlipoproteinemia .
The clinical and biochemical features of type III hyperlipoproteinemia are described in 49 patients from 23 to 70 years of age. An <START:PHENOTYPE> increase in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) of abnormal chemical composition <END> was the basis for diagnosis. The untreated patients all had hypercholesterolemia and hyperglyceridemia , and, on the average, <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased concentrations of both low- and high-density lipoproteins <END> . Seventy-four percent had xanthomas , and classic " xanthoma striata palmaris" was found in more than half. Twenty-seven percent had ischemic heart disease , detected earlier in men than in women . Twenty-seven percent had peripheral vascular disease (compared to 4% of subjects with type II hyperlipoproteinemia ). Twenty-five of 35 subjects achieved <START:PHENOTYPE> normal lipid levels <END> with dietary therapy alone. Analysis of 29 kindred showed hyperlipidemia in half of adult blood relatives ; half of these had type III , the remainder usually had sample endogenous hyperglyceridemia (type IV) . Only 2 of 55 children less than 20 years of age were affected, both with type IV .
<START:PHENOTYPE> PTPN11 (Shp2) mutations <END> in LEOPARD syndrome have dominant negative, not activating, effects.
Multiple lentigines/LEOPARD syndrome ( LS ) is a <START:PHENOTYPE> rare, autosomal dominant disorder <END> characterized by Lentigines , <START:PHENOTYPE> Electrocardiogram abnormalities <END> , Ocular hypertelorism , Pulmonic valvular stenosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> Abnormalities of genitalia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Retardation of growth <END> , and Deafness . Like the more common Noonan syndrome ( NS ), LS is caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> germ line missense mutations in PTPN11 <END> , encoding the protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 . Enzymologic, structural, cell biological, and mouse genetic studies indicate that NS is caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> gain-of-function PTPN11 mutations <END> . Because NS and LS share several features, LS has been viewed as an NS variant. We examined a panel of <START:PHENOTYPE> LS mutants <END> , including the two most common alleles . Surprisingly, we found that in marked contrast to <START:PHENOTYPE> NS, LS mutants <END> are catalytically defective and act as <START:PHENOTYPE> dominant negative mutations <END> that interfere with <START:PHENOTYPE> growth factor/Erk-mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated signaling <END> . Molecular modeling and biochemical studies suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> LS mutations <END> contort the Shp2 catalytic domain and result in open, inactive forms of Shp2 . Our results establish that the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis of LS and NS <END> is distinct and suggest that these disorders should be distinguished by mutational analysis rather than clinical presentation.
Andersen-Tawil syndrome : prospective cohort analysis and expansion of the <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotype <END> .
Andersen-Tawil syndrome ( ATS ) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental, cardiac, and neuromuscular abnormalities <END> . Approximately 70% of patients have <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations in KCNJ2 <END> , resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> dysfunction of the inward-rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 <END> . Variable expression complicates the diagnosis of ATS , which in many cases , is not made until years after the <START:PHENOTYPE> first recognized symptom <END> . To better define the distinctive <START:PHENOTYPE> clinical features <END> of ATS and facilitate earlier diagnosis, we conducted a prospective, standardized evaluation of 10 subjects with confirmed <START:PHENOTYPE> KCNJ2 mutations <END> . Detailed anthropometric, neurological, and cardiac evaluations were performed. Using this approach, we identified novel <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal and dental findings <END> and proposed additional diagnostic criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> ATS dysmorphology <END> .
Antithrombin and its deficiency states.
Antithrombin is the most important physiological proteinase inhibitor of thrombin and other coagulation proteinases . It is a single chain glycoprotein of MW 58,200 which has sequence homology with alpha 1-antitrypsin and other members of the serpin superfamily of inhibitors . Two functional domains of importance have been identified, the reactive centre that interacts with the proteinase and a heparin binding domain . Failure to maintain an adequate level of functional antithrombin in plasma results in an increased risk of thromboembolism : <START:PHENOTYPE> deficiency <END> can be inherited or acquired. There is still uncertainty regarding the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> inherited deficiency <END> and the prevalence of thrombosis in affected individuals . The <START:PHENOTYPE> production of antithrombin <END> is under the <START:PHENOTYPE> control of a single gene <END> which is localized on chromosome 1q 23-25 . Characterization of the coding sequence , which is distributed over seven exons , has allowed the analysis of the molecular basis for <START:PHENOTYPE> inherited antithrombin deficiency <END> . To date more than 100 cases have been successfully investigated at the gene and/or protein sequence level and 40 novel <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> have been identified. <START:PHENOTYPE> Mutations <END> causing <START:PHENOTYPE> amino acid substitutions <END> solely affecting the heparin binding site have thus far been located primarily at the N-terminal region of the molecule , residues 7-129 ; this region has been postulated to align as a positive groove in the molecule that forms the primary contact region for the essential antithrombin binding pentasaccharide of heparin . Not all the residues in which <START:PHENOTYPE> substitutions <END> have been found are basic and some serve to maintain the <START:PHENOTYPE> conformation of nearby basic regions <END> . Examples of this are provided by the <START:PHENOTYPE> Pro-41 to Leu mutation <END> and a recently investigated <START:PHENOTYPE> mutant <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Leu-99 to Phe <END> . The <START:PHENOTYPE> reactive site defects <END> are an interesting group, including those that alter P1, P1' and P12-P10 residues . Perhaps more <START:PHENOTYPE> remote mutations <END> can also be included such as <START:PHENOTYPE> Pro-429 to Leu <END> . The <START:PHENOTYPE> P1 and P1' mutations <END> directly block interaction of the proteinase with anti-thrombin , while P12-P10 mutants (which have <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> affecting serpin strand s4A ) enable the substrate reaction to proceed to completion, i.e. the antithrombin-thrombin complex is not stabilized and the mutant inhibitor is transformed into a substrate . The effect of the <START:PHENOTYPE> Pro-429 to Leu substitution <END> is <START:PHENOTYPE> impairment of the reactive site and heparin binding <END> , and the finding that this variant is not completely recognized by some MAbs implies a <START:PHENOTYPE> conformational change at the C terminus <END> . Another group (nine cases ) of interesting <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> is emerging, that has its <START:PHENOTYPE> primary defect in or near serpin strand 1C <END> , amino acid sequence 402-407 .(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
LEOPARD syndrome : clinical diagnosis in the first year of life.
LEOPARD syndrome ( LS ) is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple lentigines <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> caf-au-lait spots <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> electrocardiographic-conduction abnormalities <END> , ocular hypertelorism / obstructive cardiomyopathy , pulmonary stenosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormalities of the genitalia in males <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retardation of growth <END> , and deafness . LS shares many features with Noonan syndrome ( NS ), in which <START:PHENOTYPE> lentigines <END> and deafness are usually not present. Molecular studies have shown that LS and NS are <START:PHENOTYPE> allelic disorders <END> , caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> different missense mutations in PTPN11 <END> , a gene encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 located at chromosome 12q22-qter . The clinical diagnosis of LS is generally difficult in the first months of life because the <START:PHENOTYPE> distinctive lentigines <END> are generally not present at <START:PHENOTYPE> birth <END> and develop during childhood. From January 2002 to December 2004, we suspected LS clinically in 10 patients admitted to our genetic counseling services in the first 12 months of life. A <START:PHENOTYPE> PTPN11 gene mutation <END> was detected in 8/10 (80%) patients . In one patient without a <START:PHENOTYPE> PTPN11 mutation <END> a subsequent clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) was made, following the evaluation of the mother , who had previously undiagnosed classic NF1 . The age of LS patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> PTPN11 mutation <END> ranged between 1 and 11 months (mean age +/- SD 7.5 +/- 3.96 months). Review of the clinical characteristics of patients with LS confirmed by molecular study during the first year of life demonstrates that the diagnosis of LS in the first months of age can be clinically suspected in patients presenting with three main features, that is, <START:PHENOTYPE> characteristic facial features <END> (100%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) (87%), and cafe-au-lait spots (75%). <START:PHENOTYPE> Characteristic facial features <END> can be mild or severe, and consist of hypertelorism , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysmorphic ears <END> . The clinical suspicion of LS may be confirmed by molecular screening for <START:PHENOTYPE> PTPN11 mutations <END> . An early diagnosis of the disease is useful for the prospective care of associated medical problems and for precise genetic counseling.
Targeting C-reactive protein for the treatment of cardiovascular disease .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Complement-mediated inflammation <END> exacerbates the <START:PHENOTYPE> tissue injury of ischaemic necrosis <END> in heart attacks and strokes , the most common causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> death <END> in developed countries. <START:PHENOTYPE> Large infarct size <END> increases immediate morbidity and mortality and, in survivors of the <START:PHENOTYPE> acute event <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> larger non-functional scars <END> adversely affect long-term prognosis. There is thus an important unmet medical need for new cardioprotective and neuroprotective treatments. We have previously shown that human C-reactive protein ( CRP ), the classical acute-phase protein that binds to ligands exposed in damaged tissue and then activates complement , increases myocardial and cerebral infarct size in rats subjected to coronary or cerebral artery ligation, respectively. Rat CRP does not activate rat complement , whereas human CRP activates both rat and human complement . Administration of human CRP to rats is thus an excellent model for the actions of endogenous human CRP . Here we report the design, synthesis and efficacy of 1,6-bis(phosphocholine)-hexane as a specific small-molecule inhibitor of CRP . Five molecules of this palindromic compound are bound by two pentameric CRP molecules , crosslinking and occluding the ligand-binding B-face of CRP and blocking its functions. Administration of 1,6-bis(phosphocholine)-hexane to rats undergoing acute myocardial infarction abrogated the increase in infarct size and cardiac dysfunction produced by injection of human CRP . Therapeutic inhibition of CRP is thus a promising new approach to cardioprotection in acute myocardial infarction , and may also provide neuroprotection in stroke . Potential wider applications include other <START:PHENOTYPE> inflammatory, infective and tissue-damaging conditions <END> characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> increased CRP production <END> , in which <START:PHENOTYPE> binding of CRP <END> to exposed ligands in damaged cells may lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> complement-mediated exacerbation of tissue injury <END> .
Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced expression of vinculin <END> in the intercalated disc.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mutations in the cardiac-specific insert of vinculin <END> , metavinculin , rarely cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) and dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ). Subsequently, a <START:PHENOTYPE> missense mutation in the ubiquitously expressed vinculin <END> was discovered in a patient with obstructive HCM . Microscopic examination of both myectomy specimens from patients bearing <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic defects in metavinculin and vinculin <END> showed a <START:PHENOTYPE> marked reduction of vinculin/metavinculin expression in the intercalated disc <END> , but <START:PHENOTYPE> normal expression in the Z-disc <END> . Given that distinct functional domains were altered by the <START:PHENOTYPE> metavinculin and vinculin mutations <END> , we hypothesized that the <START:PHENOTYPE> intercalated disc-specific reduction of vinculin <END> may stem from <START:PHENOTYPE> left ventricular tract obstruction <END> in general rather than rarely observed <START:PHENOTYPE> perturbations in VCL-encoded vinculin <END> . To test this hypothesis, we examined the localization of vinculin / metavinculin in hypertrophied human heart tissue from patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiovascular conditions <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obstruction <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hemodynamic overload <END> using an immunohistochemistry approach. Tissue specimens derived from patients with obstructive HCM and aortic stenosis ( AS ) showed a <START:PHENOTYPE> universal defect of vinculin/metavinculin expression in the intercalated disc <END> but <START:PHENOTYPE> preserved expression in the cardiac Z-disc <END> , whereas tissue specimens derived from patients with either DCM , hypertensive heart disease ( HTN ), or pulmonary hypertension ( PHTN ) exhibited <START:PHENOTYPE> normal expression of vinculin/metavinculin in both the Z- and the intercalated disc <END> despite being associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophy <END> . Results of this study suggest that cardiac hypertrophy may be associated with different <START:PHENOTYPE> expression of the marker vinculin/metavinculin <END> depending on the underlying pathophysiology; <START:PHENOTYPE> hemodynamic overload <END> may not affect the localization whereas obstructive disease substantially reduces the <START:PHENOTYPE> expression of vinculin <END> preferentially in the intercalated disc.
Chondromodulin-I maintains <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac valvular function <END> by preventing <START:PHENOTYPE> angiogenesis <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> avascularity of cardiac valves <END> is abrogated in several valvular heart diseases ( VHDs ). This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying <START:PHENOTYPE> valvular avascularity <END> and its correlation with VHD . Chondromodulin-I , an antiangiogenic factor isolated from cartilage , is abundantly expressed in cardiac valves . Gene targeting of chondromodulin-I resulted in <START:PHENOTYPE> enhanced Vegf-A expression, angiogenesis, lipid deposition and calcification in the cardiac valves <END> of aged mice . Echocardiography showed <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic valve thickening <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> calcification <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> turbulent flow <END> , indicative of <START:PHENOTYPE> early changes <END> in aortic stenosis . Conditioned medium obtained from cultured valvular interstitial cells strongly inhibited <START:PHENOTYPE> tube formation and mobilization of endothelial cells <END> and induced their <START:PHENOTYPE> apoptosis <END> ; these effects were partially inhibited by chondromodulin-I small interfering RNA . In human VHD , including cases associated with infective endocarditis , rheumatic heart disease and atherosclerosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> VEGF-A expression <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> neovascularization <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> calcification <END> were observed in areas of <START:PHENOTYPE> chondromodulin-I downregulation <END> . These findings provide evidence that chondromodulin-I has a pivotal role in maintaining <START:PHENOTYPE> valvular normal function <END> by preventing <START:PHENOTYPE> angiogenesis <END> that may lead to VHD .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> G534E polymorphism of the gene <END> encoding the factor VII-activating protease is associated with cardiovascular risk due to <START:PHENOTYPE> increased neointima formation <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> G534E polymorphism (Marburg I [MI]) of factor VII-activating protease <END> ( FSAP ) is associated with carotid stenosis and cardiovascular disease . We have previously demonstrated that FSAP is present in <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerotic plaques <END> and it is a potent inhibitor of <START:PHENOTYPE> vascular smooth muscle proliferation and migration <END> in vitro. The effect of wild-type (WT)- and MI-FSAP on <START:PHENOTYPE> neointima formation <END> in the mouse femoral artery after <START:PHENOTYPE> wire-induced injury <END> was investigated. Local application of WT-FSAP led to a 70% <START:PHENOTYPE> reduction in the neointima formation <END> , and this effect was dependent on the protease activity of FSAP . MI-FSAP did not inhibit <START:PHENOTYPE> neointima formation <END> in vivo. This is due to a <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced proteolytic activity of MI-FSAP <END> , compared to WT-FSAP , toward platelet-derived growth factor BB , a key mediator of <START:PHENOTYPE> neointima development <END> . The inability of MI-FSAP to inhibit <START:PHENOTYPE> vascular smooth muscle accumulation <END> explains the observed linkage between the <START:PHENOTYPE> MI-polymorphism <END> and increased cardiovascular risk. Hence, FSAP has a protective function in the vasculature , and analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> MI polymorphism <END> is likely to be clinically relevant in <START:PHENOTYPE> restenosis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital myocardial sympathetic dysinnervation <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> CMSD <END> )--a <START:PHENOTYPE> structural defect <END> of idiopathic long QT syndrome .
Concerning the pathogenetic mechanism of idiopathic long QT syndrome ( LQTS ), the hypothesis of a <START:PHENOTYPE> specific sympathetic imbalance <END> has gained general acceptance, but its validity has never been proven. To test this hypothesis I-123-MIBG , an analogue of norepinephrine and guanethidine , was used to provide scintigraphic display of the efferent <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac sympathetic innervation <END> . Twelve members of four LQTS families (mean age 38.2 +/- 17.2 years, eight males ) and eight healthy volunteers (mean age 48.2 +/- 13.3 years, five males ) were studied by means of I-123-MIBG single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). A quantitative analysis of all scans was performed. All scans of the healthy volunteers show a <START:PHENOTYPE> uniform tracer uptake <END> with sometimes <START:PHENOTYPE> slightly decreased activity in the apex <END> . (1) All patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> QTc greater than 440 msec <END> (n = 5); (2) all, who had suffered from at least one episode of torsade de pointes , ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) or <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> (n = 5); and (3) all symptomatic patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> QTc prolongation <END> (n = 4) have <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced or abolished (P less than 0.02) MIBG uptakes in the inferior and inferior septal parts of the left ventricle <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital myocardial sympathetic dysinnervation <END> [ <START:PHENOTYPE> CMSD <END> ]). Additionally, one female without <START:PHENOTYPE> symptoms <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> QTc prolongation <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> LQT <END> ) shows an <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal MIBG SPECT <END> similar to the one of her daughter , who has <START:PHENOTYPE> LQT <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> symptoms <END> . One male without <START:PHENOTYPE> LQT <END> , who had suffered from VF shows <START:PHENOTYPE> CMSD <END> similar to his father , who has <START:PHENOTYPE> LQT <END> , but no <START:PHENOTYPE> symptoms <END> . All members of the families with <START:PHENOTYPE> normal MIBG SPECTs <END> have neither <START:PHENOTYPE> LQT <END> nor <START:PHENOTYPE> symptoms <END> . In all families <START:PHENOTYPE> CMSD <END> fulfills the criteria of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal-dominant inheritance <END> . <START:PHENOTYPE> Normal QTc-interval <END> predicted only in 57% <START:PHENOTYPE> normal cardiac sympathetic innervation <END> in the present LQTS families . Therefore, quantitative I-123- MIBG SPECT enables to identify <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial sympathetic dysinnervation <END> as <START:PHENOTYPE> structural defect <END> in LQTS . <START:PHENOTYPE> CMSD <END> is associated with and without <START:PHENOTYPE> LQT <END> and presents a pattern of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal-dominant inheritance <END> . <START:PHENOTYPE> LQT at rest or during exercis <END> e was specific (100%), but less sensitive (63%) in the assessment of <START:PHENOTYPE> CMSD <END> than I-123-MIBG SPECT.
From molecular variant to disease : initial steps in evaluating the association of transthyretin M119 with disease .
Traditionally, clinical research has sought to determine the molecular basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> clinical signs and symptoms <END> . Increasingly, the traditional process will be reversed, as many structural protein variants are elucidated as a result of powerful PCR-based methods. Herein we describe a variant of transthyretin ( TTR ) found by direct genomic sequencing and illustrate the utility of PASA (PCR amplification of specific alleles ) in the initial characterization of such variants . TTR is an intriguing protein of unknown function, but deposition of mutant TTR produces familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy ( FAP ). We identify a carrier of a variant TTR in which threonine119 is changed to methionine ( <START:PHENOTYPE> T119----M <END> ). T119 is invariant in five mammalian species , suggesting that this residue is important for normal protein function. To determine the frequency of the M119 variant , individuals of northern- and western-European descent were rapidly screened by generating a PASA assay for the sequence change. Four additional individuals were found to be heterozygous for the <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> , for a total of five M119 alleles in 1,666 genes (1/333). Clinical records, initial clinical interviews, and family history of these patients hint at a high frequency of early-onset venous insufficiency and perhaps mild renal dysfunction . <START:PHENOTYPE> Haplotype <END> analysis on the heterozygotes could be performed, despite the absence of samples from relatives , by performing "double PASA." The <START:PHENOTYPE> haplotype <END> data suggest that the M119 variant derives from a common ancestor . The putative functional deficiency caused by TTR M119 should be most marked in the homozygotes , who can be calculated to occur in 1/100,000 conceptions. If viable, these individuals may provide important clues about the physiological role of TTR . Although the nature (if any) of disease caused by TTR M119 remains to be defined, the genetic and clinical data indicate that this <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> does not cause FAP . Future family studies can determine whether the heterozygous state for TTR M119 cosegregates with a disease or <START:PHENOTYPE> trait <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Deficiency of Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 <END> affects <START:PHENOTYPE> platelet responses <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombus growth <END> .
Platelets are critical for <START:PHENOTYPE> normal hemostasis <END> . Their <START:PHENOTYPE> deregulation <END> can lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> bleeding <END> or to arterial thrombosis , a primary cause of heart attack and ischemic stroke . Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 ( SHIP1 ) is a 5-phosphatase capable of dephosphorylating the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate second messenger into phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate . SHIP1 plays a critical role in <START:PHENOTYPE> regulating the level of these 2 lipids in platelets <END> . Using SHIP1-deficient mice , we found that its loss affects <START:PHENOTYPE> platelet aggregation in response to several agonists <END> with minor effects on <START:PHENOTYPE> fibrinogen binding <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> beta(3) integrin tyrosine phosphorylation <END> . Accordingly, SHIP1-null mice showed <START:PHENOTYPE> defects in arterial thrombus formation in response to a localized laser-induced injury <END> . Moreover, these mice had a <START:PHENOTYPE> prolonged tail bleeding time <END> . Upon stimulation, SHIP1-deficient platelets showed <START:PHENOTYPE> large membrane extensions <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormalities in the open canalicular system <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> dramatic decrease in close cell-cell contacts <END> . Interestingly, SHIP1 appeared to be required for <START:PHENOTYPE> platelet contractility <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombus organization <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> fibrin clot retraction <END> . These data indicate that SHIP1 is an important element of the platelet signaling machinery to support <START:PHENOTYPE> normal hemostasis <END> . To our knowledge, this is the first report unraveling an important function of SHIP1 in the <START:PHENOTYPE> activation of hematopoietic cells <END> , in contrast to its well-documented role in the <START:PHENOTYPE> negative regulation of lymphocytes <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Targeted deletion of titin N2B region <END> leads to <START:PHENOTYPE> diastolic dysfunction <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac atrophy <END> .
Titin is a giant protein that is in charge of the assembly and passive mechanical properties of the sarcomere. Cardiac titin contains a unique N2B region , which has been proposed to modulate elasticity of the titin filament and to be important for <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophy signaling <END> and the <START:PHENOTYPE> ischemic stress response <END> through its binding proteins FHL2 and alphaB-crystallin , respectively. To study the role of the titin N2B region in <START:PHENOTYPE> systole and diastole of the heart <END> , we generated a knockout (KO) mouse deleting only the N2B exon 49 and leaving the remainder of the titin gene intact. The resulting mice survived to adulthood and were fertile. Although KO hearts were small, they produced <START:PHENOTYPE> normal ejection volumes <END> because of an <START:PHENOTYPE> increased ejection fraction <END> . FHL2 protein levels were significantly reduced in the KO mice , a finding consistent with the <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced size of KO hearts <END> . Ultrastructural analysis revealed an increased extension of the remaining spring elements of titin ( tandem Ig segments and the PEVK region ), which, together with the <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced sarcomere length <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> increased passive tension <END> derived from skinned cardiomyocyte experiments, translates to <START:PHENOTYPE> diastolic dysfunction <END> as documented by echocardiography. We conclude from our work that the titin N2B region is dispensable for <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac development <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> systolic properties <END> but is important to integrate <START:PHENOTYPE> trophic and elastic functions <END> of the heart . The N2B-KO mouse is the first titin -based model of <START:PHENOTYPE> diastolic dysfunction <END> and, considering the high prevalence of diastolic heart failure , it could provide future mechanistic insights into the disease process.
Familial neonatal Marfan syndrome due to parental mosaicism of a <START:PHENOTYPE> missense mutation in the FBN1 gene <END> .
We present a family in which three siblings were born with neonatal Marfan syndrome ( MFS ) to unaffected parents . The clinical findings included <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> loose skin <END> , ectopia lentis , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic root dilatation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency <END> , and pulmonary emphysema . All three siblings died due to <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiorespiratory insufficiency <END> by 2-4 months of age. Screening of the FBN1 gene showed the <START:PHENOTYPE> heterozygous c.3257G > A (p.Cys1086Tyr) mutation <END> in the proband . Mosaicism of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mutation <END> was demonstrated in the somatic cells and in the germ line of the father . Although three examples of parental mosaicism for classical MFS were demonstrated previously, this is the first report of familial occurrence of neonatal MFS due to a <START:PHENOTYPE> heterozygous mutation in FBN1 <END> . In conclusion, the <START:PHENOTYPE> p.Cys1086Tyr mutation in FBN1 <END> is consistently associated with neonatal MFS . Parental mosaicism should always be kept in mind when counseling families with MFS .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Genotype <END> - <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotype <END> correlation and therapeutic rationale in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis .
Familial hyperkalemic periodic paralysis ( PP ) is a dominantly inherited muscle disease characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> attacks of flaccid weakness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> intermittent myotonia <END> . Some patients experience <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle stiffness <END> that is aggravated by cold and exercise, bordering on the diagnosis of paramyotonia congenita . Hyperkalemic PP and paramyotonia congenita are allelic diseases caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> gain-of-function mutations of the skeletal muscle sodium channel, Nav1.4 <END> , which is essential for the <START:PHENOTYPE> generation of skeletal muscle action potentials <END> . In this review, the functional and clinical consequences of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> and therapeutic strategies are reported and the differential diagnoses discussed. Also, the question is addressed of whether hyperkalemic PP is truly a different entity than normokalemic PP . Additionally, the differential diagnosis of Andersen-Tawil syndrome in which hyperkalemic PP attacks may occur will be briefly introduced. Last, because hyperkalemic PP has been described to be associated with an <START:PHENOTYPE> R83H mutation of a MiRP2 potassium channel subunit <END> , evidence refuting disease -causality in this case will be discussed.
Further delineation of the <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotype <END> resulting from <START:PHENOTYPE> BRAF or MEK1 germline mutations <END> helps differentiate cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome from Costello syndrome .
Because Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome has significant phenotypic overlap with Costello syndrome , it may be difficult to establish the diagnosis on a clinical basis. The recent discoveries of <START:PHENOTYPE> germline HRAS mutations <END> in patients with Costello syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations in BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2 <END> in CFC syndrome uncovered the biologic mechanism for the <START:PHENOTYPE> shared phenotypic findings <END> based on the close interaction of the affected gene products within the <START:PHENOTYPE> MAP kinase pathway <END> . We evaluated a series of patients who were either clinically diagnosed with Costello syndrome , or in whom the diagnoses of both Costello and CFC syndromes were considered. After excluding <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations in HRAS <END> , we identified eight <START:PHENOTYPE> changes in BRAF and five in MEK1 <END> . Five <START:PHENOTYPE> mutations <END> are novel, and all changes occurred de novo among those triads tested. A review of the <START:PHENOTYPE> clinical abnormalities <END> showed important differences between patients with either a <START:PHENOTYPE> BRAF or MEK1 mutation <END> , and those previously reported with an <START:PHENOTYPE> HRAS mutation <END> . Statistical significance was achieved, despite the relatively small number of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> BRAF and MEK1 mutations <END> reported here, for <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> growth hormone deficiency <END> and the presence of more than one papilloma , which were less common in CFC compared to HRAS mutation positive patients . Although both CFC and Costello syndrome are characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac abnormalities <END> in about three-fourths of patients , the pattern of congenital heart defects ( CHD ), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ), and tachycardia differs somewhat. CHD , especially pulmonic stenosis associated with a secundum-type atrial septal defect , are more common in CFC than Costello syndrome (P = 0.02). Atrial tachycardia is less frequent in CFC patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> BRAF or MEK1 mutations <END> , compared to Costello syndrome patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> HRAS mutation <END> (P = 0.04). <START:PHENOTYPE> Chaotic atrial rhythm <END> or multifocal atrial tachycardia was observed only in Costello syndrome . Malignant tumors have been viewed as characteristic for Costello syndrome due to <START:PHENOTYPE> HRAS mutations <END> , however, we report here on a <START:PHENOTYPE> MEK1 mutation <END> in a patient with a malignant tumor , a hepatoblastoma . Although this indicates that the presence of a tumor is not specific for Costello syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> HRAS mutation <END> , it is noteworthy that the tumor histology differs from those commonly seen in Costello syndrome . Based on these clinical differences we suggest that patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> BRAF and MEK mutations <END> should be diagnosed with CFC syndrome , and the diagnosis of Costello syndrome be reserved for patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> HRAS mutations <END> .
Fibromuscular dysplasia .
Fibromuscular dysplasia ( FMD ), formerly called fibromuscular fibroplasia , is a group of nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory arterial diseases that most commonly involve the renal and carotid arteries . The prevalence of symptomatic renal artery FMD is about 4/1000 and the prevalence of cervicocranial FMD is probably half that. Histological classification discriminates three main subtypes, intimal, medial and perimedial, which may be associated in a single patient . Angiographic classification includes the multifocal type, with <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple stenoses <END> and the <START:PHENOTYPE> 'string-of-beads' appearance <END> that is related to medial FMD , and tubular and focal types, which are not clearly related to <START:PHENOTYPE> specific histological lesions <END> . Renovascular hypertension is the <START:PHENOTYPE> most common manifestation <END> of renal artery FMD . <START:PHENOTYPE> Multifocal stenoses <END> with the <START:PHENOTYPE> 'string-of-beads' appearance <END> are observed at angiography in more than 80% of cases , mostly in women aged between 30 and 50 years; they generally involve the middle and distal two-thirds of the main renal artery and in some case also renal artery branches . Cervicocranial FMD can be complicated by dissection with <START:PHENOTYPE> headache <END> , Horner's syndrome or stroke , or can be associated with intracerebral aneurysms with a risk of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage . The etiology of FMD is unknown, although various hormonal and mechanical factors have been suggested. <START:PHENOTYPE> Subclinical lesions <END> are found at arterial sites distant from the <START:PHENOTYPE> stenotic arteries <END> , and this suggests that FMD is a systemic arterial disease . It appears to be familial in 10% of cases . Noninvasive diagnostic tests include, in increasing order of accuracy, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography. The gold standard for diagnosing FMD is catheter angiography, but this invasive procedure is only used for patients in whom it is clinically pertinent to proceed with revascularization during the same procedure. Differential diagnosis include <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerotic stenoses <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> stenoses <END> associated with vascular Ehlers-Danlos and Williams' syndromes , and type 1 neurofibromatosis . Management of cases with renovascular hypertension includes antihypertensive therapy, percutaneous angioplasty of <START:PHENOTYPE> severe stenoses <END> , and reconstructive surgery in cases with complex FMD that extends to segmental arteries . The therapeutic options for securing ruptured intracerebral aneurysms are microvascular neurosurgical clipping and endovascular coiling. <START:PHENOTYPE> Stenosis progression <END> in renal artery FMD is slow and rarely leads to ischemic renal failure .
