Ritscher-Schinzel cranio-cerebello-cardiac ( 3C ) syndrome : report of four new cases and review .
Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome , also known as the 3C syndrome , is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome characterized by craniofacial , cerebellar , and cardiac anomalies .
Cardiac manifestations include <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> double outlet right ventricle <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic left heart <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic stenosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonic stenosis <END> and other valvular anomalies .
Central nervous system anomalies include <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> , cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and enlargement of the cisterna magna .
Craniofacial abnormalities seen are <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular coloboma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent occiput <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> posterior fossa cyst <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> and congenital heart defect are common malformations that may occur in isolation or as a part of many syndromes .
Accurate genetic diagnosis and counseling require detailed analysis of the external as well as the internal anatomy and knowledge of the relative frequencies of various malformations in syndromes that may have overlapping clinical signs .
We have had the opportunity recently to study four cases of the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome .
A review of all reported cases is presented and an attempt made to define the minimum diagnostic criteria for the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome .
Of the nine craniofacial anomalies commonly reported as a part of the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome , we consider two i.e. , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular coloboma <END> , to be readily and objectively ascertainable .
The other seven craniofacial traits , however , are somewhat subjective , require expert interpretation and are sometimes difficult to ascertain in a newborn or stillborn fetus .
These are prominent forehead , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent occiput <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
At least four of these were present in all cases that had a secure diagnosis of the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome .
Thus , the criteria we propose to establish the diagnosis of the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome in a chromosomally normal sporadic case are the presence of cardiac malformation other than isolated patent ductus arteriosus , cerebellar malformation , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular coloboma <END> or four of the following seven findings : prominent forehead , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent occiput <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .

Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> and the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> .
International Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> Pancreatitis <END> Study Group . Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> is an autosomal-dominant disease , with a variable expression and an estimated penetrance of 80% .
The gene for this disease has recently been mapped to chromosome 7q35 , and the defect is believed to be caused by a mutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene .
Acute attacks of <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> begin early in life and the disease often progresses to chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
Although the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> is thought to be increased in more common types of chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> , the frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> in the inherited type of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> is uncertain .
The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> and other tumors in patients with hereditary form of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
To determine the natural history of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> , we invited all members of the American Pancreatic Association and the International Association of Pancreatology to participate in a longitudinal study of this rare form of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
The initial criteria for patient eligibility were as follows : early age ( < or = 30 years ) at onset of symptoms , positive family history , and absence of other causes .
From April 1995 through February 1996 , 37 physicians from 10 countries contributed medical records of 246 ( 125 males and 121 females ) patients thought to have hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> as the most likely diagnosis .
This group included 218 patients where the diagnosis appeared to be highly probable and 28 additional patients where the diagnosis of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> was less certain : 25 patients who had relatively late onset of disease and a positive family history and three patients with onset of disease before age 30 years but with an uncertain family history .
We reviewed all causes of death and compared the observed to the expected frequency of cancer in this historical cohort of patients with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
The strength of the association between <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> was estimated by the standardized incidence ratio ( SIR) , which is the ratio of observed <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cases in the cohort to the expected pancreatic cancers in the background population , adjusted for age , sex , and country .
The mean age ( + /- standard deviation [ SD] ) at onset of symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> was 13 .9 +/- 12 .2 years .
Compared with an expected number of 0.15 0 , eight pancreatic adenocarcinomas developed ( mean age +/- SD at diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> : 56 .9 +/- 11 .2 years ) during 8531 person-years of follow-up , yielding an SIR of 53 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 23-105 ) .
The frequency of other tumors was not increased : SIR = 0.7 ( 95 % CI = 0.3-1.6 ) .
Eight of 20 reported deaths in the cohort were from <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> .
Thirty members of the cohort have already been tested for the defective hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> gene : all 30 carry a mutated copy of the trypsinogen gene .
The transmission pattern of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> was known for 168 of 238 patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> and six of eight with <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> .
Ninety-nine of the 238 patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> and six of the patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> inherited the disease through the paternal side of the family .
The estimated cumulative risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> to age 70 years in patients with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> approaches 40% .
For patients with a paternal inheritance pattern , the cumulative risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> is approximately 75 % .
Patients with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> have a high risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> several decades after the initial onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
A paternal inheritance pattern increases the probability of developing <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> .
Johnson-McMillin syndrome , a neuroectodermal syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> : report of a new case .
In 1983 , Johnson et al . described 16 related individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> or hyposmia , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> atresia of the external auditory canal <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism <END> inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern . Other less constant manifestations included <START:PHENOTYPE> facial asymmetry <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and choanal stenosis .
An isolated case was reported later ( Johnston et al . [ 1987 : Am J Med Genet 26 : 925-927] ) and thereafter an affected mother and son ( Hennekam and Holtus [ 1993 : Am J Med Genet 47 : 71 4-716] ) .
We describe an additional unrelated female patient with features resembling those of the previously reported cases .
She presented with intrauterine <START:PHENOTYPE> growth deficiency <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral microtia <END> with canal atresia , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> , partial left <START:PHENOTYPE> facial palsy <END> , posterior <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , left choanal stenosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> , developmental delay , and right <START:PHENOTYPE> thumb polydactyly <END> .
Because the phenotypic abnormalities in this syndrome affect the brain , facial structures , ectoderm and its derivatives , outflow tract of the heart , and Rathke 's pouch derivatives , this has suggested to previous authors etiologic involvement of the ectoderm and neuroectoderm of the first and second branchial arches , Rathke 's pouch , and the diencephalon .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microtia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> differentiates the condition from other ectodermal dysplasias .
In the initial report , females appeared somewhat less affected than males , and there was male-to-male transmission .
The mother of our patient manifests subtle features , which suggest she may be a mildly affected female .
Additionally , there is a family history of early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> in the maternal grandfather 's relatives .

Japanese family with <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> central hypoventilation <END> .
The authors describe the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the Fukuoka 1 family , the first Japanese family recognized to have hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> , and central <START:PHENOTYPE> alveolar hypoventilation <END> .
The pedigree contains 14 family members spanning four generations , with five affected individuals .
All available medical records were collected for affected members , including autopsy results .
The inheritance pattern was <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> .
The average age at onset of symptoms was 41 years .
All patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bradykinesia <END> , and resting and postural <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Bradykinesia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> developed in the proband at age 43 years .
He responded to levodopa in the initial stage only .
A year later , he had <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> central hypoventilation <END> leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> .
Symptoms developed in his cousin at age 38 years .
The proband 's father developed a resting <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> at age 43 years .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> was initially responsive to levodopa therapy , but the disease was relentlessly progressive , leading to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> bradykinesia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> , and respiratory distress .
He died of <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> at age 49 years .
Autopsy showed marked neuronal loss and gliosis in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus .
Lewy bodies , neurofibrillary tangles , senile plaques , and other abnormal structures were not seen in the cortical and subcortical regions .
The Fukuoka 1 family shares many clinical and pathologic features with five previously reported kindreds from North America and Europe , suggesting that this syndrome has a worldwide distribution and can occur in different ethnic populations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> in patients with angelman syndrome caused by deletion of the chromosome 15q11 -13 .
Angelman syndrome ( AS ) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> speech disorder <END> , stereotyped jerky movements , and a peculiar behavioral profile , with a happy disposition and outbursts of laughter .
Most patients with AS present with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and suggestive electroencephalographic patterns , which may be used as diagnostic criteria .
To study <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and response to treatment in a series of patients with AS determined by deletion .
Parent and caregiver interview and medical record review .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> Center at the University of SÃ£o Paulo . Nineteen patients with AS determined by deletion of chromosome 15q11 -13 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> severity , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> evolution , and response to antiepileptic drug treatment .
All patients with AS in this group had generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and 10 ( 53% ) also had partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Main <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> types were atypical absences and myoclonic and tonic-clonic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Mean age at onset was 1 year 1 month .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> aggravated by fever occurred in 10 patients ( 53% ) and status epilepticus in 16 ( 84% ) .
Eighteen patients ( 95% ) had previous or current history of daily <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , of which 14 ( 64% ) had disabling <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> types were observed in 13 patients ( 53% ) .
History of refractory <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> was reported in 16 patients ( 84% ) .
Parents reported improvement , characterized by decrease in <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> frequency or <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> control , at the mean age of 5.3 years .
Therefore , most of these patients had a period of refractory <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ; however , improvement occurred during late childhood and puberty .
The best therapeutic response was obtained with valproic acid alone or in association with phenobarbital or clonazepam .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> was aggravated by carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , and vigabatrin .
Patients with AS with deletion have <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with early onset and stereotyped electroclinical profile regarding <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> type , severity , and response to antiepileptic drug treatment .
Another feature of AS is the age-related improvement , even in refractory cases , during late childhood and puberty .
These characteristics are not specific to this syndrome but , when inserted in the proper clinical context , may anticipate diagnosis .
We believe that AS should be considered a differential diagnosis in developmentally delayed infants with severe , generalized , cryptogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ; however , a proper electroclinical delineation of each genetic group is mandatory .
Epidemiological , clinical , paraclinical and molecular study of a cohort of 102 patients affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> from Alsace , Eastern France : implications for clinical management .
While Friedreich 's <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( FRDA ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> telangiectasia ( AT ) are known to be the two most frequent forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> ( ARCA) , knowledge on the other forms of ARCA has been obtained only recently , and they appear to be rarer .
Little is known about the epidemiological features and the relative frequency of the ARCAs and only few data are available about the comparative features of ARCAs .
We prospectively studied 102 suspected ARCA cases from Eastern France ( including 95 from the Alsace region ) between 2002 and 2008 .
The diagnostic procedure was based on a sequential strategic scheme .
We examined the clinical , paraclinical and molecular features of the large cohort of patients and compared features and epidemiology according to molecular diagnosis .
A molecular diagnosis could be established for 57 patients ; 36 were affected with FRDA , seven with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> plus <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 2 ( AOA2 ) , four with AT , three with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> plus <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 1 ( AOA1 ) , three with Marinesco-SjÃ¶gren syndrome , two with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> of Charlevoix-Saguenay ( ARSACS) , one with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with vitamin E deficiency ( AVED ) and one with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> type 2 ( ARCA2 ) .
The group of patients with no identified mutation had a significantly lower spinocerebellar degeneration functional score corrected for disease duration ( SDFS/DD ratio ; p = 0.002 ) and comprised a significantly higher proportion of cases with onset after 20 years ( p < 0.01 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Extensor plantar reflexes <END> were rarer and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> was more frequent in the group of patients with a known non-Friedreich ARCA compared to all other patients ( p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0003 , respectively ) .
Lower limb <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> and electroneuromyographic evidences of <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral neuropathy <END> were more frequent in the Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> group than in the group with a known non-Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and were more frequent in the later group than in the group with no identified mutation ( p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01 , respectively ) .
The overall prevalence of ARCA in Alsace is 1/ 19,000 .
We can infer the prevalence of FRDA in Alsace to be 1/50 ,000 and infer that AT is approximately eight times less frequent than FRDA .
MSS , AOA2 and ARSACS appear only slightly less frequent than AT. Despite the broad variability of severity , Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> patients are clinically distinct from the other forms of ARCA .
Patients with no identified mutation have more often a pure cerebellar degenerative disease or a spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> phenotype .
It appears that ARCA cases can be divided into two major groups of different prognosis , an early-onset group with a highly probable genetic cause and an adult-onset group with better prognosis for which a genetic cause is more difficult to prove but not excluded .
ARCAs are rare , early-disabling and genetically heterogeneous diseases dominated by FRDA .
Several of the recently identified ARCAs , such as AVED , ARSACS , AOA1 , AOA2 and MSS , have a prevalence close to AT and should be searched for extensively irrespective of ethnic origins .
The strategic scheme is a useful tool for the diagnosis of ARCAs in clinical practice .
The Perlman familial <START:PHENOTYPE> nephroblastomatosis <END> syndrome .
In 1973 , Perlman et al described a familial syndrome of bilateral renal hamartomas with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> nephroblastomatosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrosomia <END> , islet cell hypertrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> unusual facies <END> , and early lethality .
Two additional sibs were recently reported by Neri et al [ 1984 ] .
We report on two sibs with <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> , fetal <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal muscular hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> visceromegaly <END> , and subsequent development of <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> in one of them .
Delineated features of this syndrome include <START:PHENOTYPE> visceromegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrosomia <END> , renal hamartomas , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephroblastomatosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> in males , <START:PHENOTYPE> unusual facial appearance <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> , fetal <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> but do not include hemihypertrophy , omphalocele or umbilical abnormalities , aniridia , or other conditions known to be associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> .
This condition should be considered primarily in the differential diagnosis of fetal <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> without <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops <END> and possibly in the differential diagnosis of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> , or nephromegaly .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> ( XLAG ) : clinical , magnetic resonance imaging , and neuropathological findings .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> is a newly recognized syndrome responsible for a severe neurological disorder of neonatal onset in boys .
Based on the observations of 3 new cases , we confirm the phenotype in affected boys , describe additional MRI findings , report the neuropathological data , and show that carrier females may exhibit neurological and magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities .
In affected boys , consistent clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> are intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> of neonatal onset , severe hypotonia , poor responsiveness , genital abnormalities , and early death .
On magnetic resonance imaging , a gyration defect consisting of anterior <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> and posterior <START:PHENOTYPE> agyria <END> with a moderately thickened brain cortex , dysplastic basal ganglia and complete <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> are consistently found .
Neuropathological examination of the brain shows a trilayered cortex containing exclusively pyramidal neurons , a neuronal migration defect , a disorganization of the basal ganglia , and gliotic and spongy white matter .
Finally , females related to affected boys may have mental retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and they often display <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> .
These findings expand the phenotype of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> , may help in the detection of carrier females in affected families , and give arguments for a semidominant <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> mode of inheritance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Omphalocele <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> in Europe : a survey of 3 million births 198 0-199 0 .
EUROCAT Working Group .
A total of 732 cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> and 274 cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> was registered in 21 regional registers in Europe ( EUROCAT registers ) during the period 198 0-199 0 .
The total prevalence rates were 2.52 per 10,000 for <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> and 0.94 per 10,000 for <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> .
There was significant heterogeneity in total prevalence rates among regions for <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> .
Consistently higher than average total prevalence rates of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> were found in the five centers of the British Isles .
This was in large part linked to the association between <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> and neural tube defects .
A significant female excess among the cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> associated with neural tube defects , in comparison with an insignificant male excess for other cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , was observed .
Geographical differences in the total prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> are partly explained by differences in maternal age distributions in the populations surveyed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Omphalocele <END> was an isolated malformation in 46 % of cases ; <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> was isolated in 79 % of cases .
The average birthweight and gestational age of both isolated and multiply malformed cases of both <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> were low , especially for multiply malformed cases , and to a greater extent for isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> than for isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> .
Prenatal diagnosis leading to termination of pregnancy was reported in 33.2% of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> and in 26.5 % of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> cases , demonstrating the considerable impact of current prenatal screening programs .
On the basis of clinical manifestations , epidemiologic characteristics , and the presence and type of additional malformations , <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> can be considered heterogeneous conditions .
New <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , acquired micrencephaly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> .
We report on 4 generations in a family with 3 living males , 3 males who died in infancy , and 3 females with neurologic impairment and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ( ACC ) .
Manifestations in the surviving males include severe acquired micrencephaly , mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> limb contractures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , tapered digits with hyperconvex nails , a characteristic face with <START:PHENOTYPE> large eyes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent supraorbital ridges <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophris <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad alveolar ridges <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Urologic anomalies include <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> .
Two affected females were less severely impaired and continued to be socially responsive as adults , but had <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic quadriplegia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
One obligate heterozygote was retarded with emotional problems while another obligate carrier female and her daughter were clinically normal .
Pedigree analysis suggested <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked inheritance <END> with variable expression in females .
These findings are inconsistent with the well-described <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> conditions with ACC including FG syndrome and Aicairdi syndrome .
ACC has not been described in Coffin-Lowry syndrome , a condition with similar clinical findings , which also demonstrates marked variability of expression in carrier females .
In order to assist in carrier determination , brain imaging studies and DNA linkage analysis of the affected relatives was performed .
We found a spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> with the most severe manifestations in the most severely affected males .
DNA analysis using a series of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> probes suggests linkage with a LOD score of 1.26 at theta = 0 to a region between p 11 .3 and p 21.3 .
HLA DQB1* 0602 is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> in 509 narcoleptic patients .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Narcolepsy <END> is a sleep disorder associated with HLA DR15 ( DR2 ) and DQB1* 0602 .
We HLA typed 509 patients enrolled in a clinical trial for the drug modafinil and analyzed the results in relation to <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> , a symptom of <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> characterized by muscle weakness triggered by emotions .
The patients were either subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> who had a mean sleep latency ( SL ) of less than 8 minutes and two or more sleep onset rapid eye movement ( REM ) periods ( SOREMPs ) during a multiple sleep latency test , or narcoleptic patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> but with a mean SL shorter than 5 minutes and two or more SOREMPs .
The respective values of DRB1*15 ( DR2 ) and DQB1* 0602 as markers for <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> were first compared in different ethnic groups and in patients with and without <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> .
DQB1* 0602 was found to be a more sensitive marker for <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> than DRB1*15 across all ethnic groups .
DQB1* 0602 frequency was strikingly higher in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> versus patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> ( 76 .1 % in 421 patients versus 40 .9% in 88 patients ) .
Positivity was highest in patients with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> ( 94.8% ) and progressively decreased to 54 .2% in patients with the mildest <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> .
A voluntary 5 0-item questionnaire focusing on <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> was also analyzed in 212 of the 509 HLA-typed patients .
Subjects with definite <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> as observed by an experienced clinician were more frequently HLA DQB1* 0602-positive than those with doubtful <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> , and the manifestations of <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> were clinically more typical in DQB1* 0602-positive patients .
These results show that the HLA association is as tight as previously reported ( 85-95% ) when <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> is clinically typical or severe .
We also found that patients with mild , atypical , or no <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> have a significantly increased DQB1* 0602 frequency (40-60% ) in comparison with ethnically matched controls ( 24% ) .
These results could be explained by increased disease <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> in the noncataplexy group or by a direct effect of the HLA DQB1* 0602 genotype on the clinical expression of <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> .
Genitopatellar syndrome : a new condition comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> absent patellae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scrotal hypoplasia <END> , renal anomalies , facial dysmorphism , and mental retardation .
We report on the association of <START:PHENOTYPE> absent patellae <END> , genital and renal anomalies , dysmorphic features , and mental retardation in seven children (six boys and one girl ) belonging to five unrelated families .
Flexion deformities of the knees and hips with <START:PHENOTYPE> club feet <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> absent patellae <END> were consistently observed and <START:PHENOTYPE> scrotal hypoplasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> were present in all boys ( 6/6 ) .
Dysmorphic features included a <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse face <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> large nose <END> with a <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> . Other features included renal anomalies ( <START:PHENOTYPE> multicystic kidneys <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> , 7/7) , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ( 4/7) , <START:PHENOTYPE> swallowing difficulties <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> ( 4/7) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> ( 3/7 ) .
Bilateral hypoplasia of the ischia and brachydactyly were also consistently observed ( 5/5 ) .
In two out of seven cases , prenatal ultrasound detection of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and renal anomalies led to termination of the pregnancy at 27 weeks .
Three children died during the first years of life and the remaining two who survived exhibit severe <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
High resolution cytogenetic studies performed on lymphocytes or fibroblasts or both were normal in all cases .
Recurrence in two families suggests an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance .
We propose that this unusual association , similar to that observed in a 4 year old boy by Goldblatt et al , represents a new syndrome distinct from previously reported hypoplastic patella syndromes .
Clinical manifestations in 105 persons with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome .
Nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome ( NBCC ; Gorlin syndrome ) , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder linked to 9q22.3-q31 , and caused by mutations in PTC , the human homologue of the Drosophila patched gene , comprises multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> keratocysts of the jaw <END> , palmar/plantar pits , spine and rib anomalies and calcification of the falx cerebri .
We reviewed the findings on 105 affected individuals examined at the NIH since 1985 .
The data included 48 males and 57 females ranging in age from 4 months to 87 years .
Eighty percent of whites ( 71 /90 ) and 38 % ( 5 /13 ) of African-Americans had at least one <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> ( BCC) , with the first tumor occurring at a mean age of 23 ( median 20) years and 21 ( median 20) years , respectively .
Excluding individuals exposed to radiation therapy , the number of BCCs ranged from 1 to > 1,000 ( median 8 ) and 1 to 3 ( median 2) , respectively , in the 2 groups .
Jaw cysts occurred in 78 /105 ( 74% ) with the first tumor occurring in 80% by the age of 20 years .
The number of total jaw cysts ranged from 1 to 28 ( median 3 ) . <START:PHENOTYPE> Palmar pits <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> plantar pits <END> were seen in 87% .
Ovarian fibromas were diagnosed by ultrasound in 9/52 ( 17% ) at a mean age of 30 years .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Medulloblastoma <END> occurred in 4 patients at a mean age of 2.3 years .
Three patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> or palate .
Physical findings include " <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse face <END> " in 54% , relative <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> in 5 0% , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> in 42% , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> in 27% , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus deformity <END> in 13% , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel deformity <END> in 11 % .
Important radiological signs included calcification of the falx cerebri in 65 % , of the tentorium cerebelli in 20% , bridged sella in 68 % , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid ribs <END> in 26% , <START:PHENOTYPE> hemivertebrae <END> in 15 % , fusion of the vertebral bodies in 10% , and flame shaped lucencies of the phalanges , metacarpal , and carpal bones of the hands in 30% .
Several traits previously considered components of the syndrome ( including short fourth metacarpal , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , cervical ribs and <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida <END> occulta ) were not found to be significantly increased in the affected individuals .
This study delineates the frequency of the clinical and radiological anomalies in NBCC in a large population of US patients and discusses guidelines for diagnosis and management .
The clinical features and classification of the <START:PHENOTYPE> late onset <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxias .
A study of 11 families , including descendants of the 'the Drew family of Walworth ' .
The clinical features of 11 families containing 73 individuals with dominantly inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> late onset <END> are described .
Many of the patients had physical signs in addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , which included <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> supranuclear ophthalmoplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal dysfunction <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinal degeneration <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and deafness .
These associated features were generally very variable within members of the same family .
Intrafamilial correlation of age of onset and an analysis of clustering of clinical features within families using X2 tests suggested that there was little evidence of genetic heterogeneity in the eight kindreds where <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal signs <END> were found in affected individuals .
One of these families contained descendants of the ' Drew family of Walworth ' described by Ferguson and Critchley in 1929.
The three other families contained patients with clinically distinct syndromes which were : <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinal degeneration <END> ; a later onset ( over 60 years ) ' pure ' cerebellar syndrome ; and an <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> disorder associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and deafness .
A simple classification of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxias is proposed and discussed in relation to previous attempts to classify these disorders on clinical and pathological grounds .
Mutations affecting G-protein subunit Î±11 in <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> .
Familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with three variants : types 1 , 2 , and 3 . Type 1 is due to loss-of-function mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor , a guanine nucleotide-binding protein ( G-protein )-coupled receptor that signals through the G-protein subunit Î±11 ( GÎ±11 ) .
Type 3 is associated with adaptor-related protein complex 2 , sigma 1 subunit ( AP2S1 ) mutations , which result in altered calcium-sensing receptor endocytosis .
We hypothesized that type 2 is due to mutations effecting GÎ±11 loss of function , since GÎ±11 is involved in calcium-sensing receptor signaling , and its gene ( GNA11 ) and the type 2 locus are colocalized on chromosome 19p13.3 .
We also postulated that mutations effecting GÎ±11 gain of function , like the mutations effecting calcium-sensing receptor gain of function that cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> type 1 , may lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> .
We performed GNA11 mutational analysis in a kindred with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> type 2 and in nine unrelated patients with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> who did not have mutations in the gene encoding the calcium-sensing receptor ( CASR ) or AP2S1 .
We also performed this analysis in eight unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> who did not have CASR mutations .
In addition , we studied the effects of GNA11 mutations on GÎ±11 protein structure and calcium-sensing receptor signaling in human embryonic kidney 293 ( HEK293 ) cells .
The kindred with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> type 2 had an in-frame deletion of a conserved GÎ±11 isoleucine ( Ile200del) , and one of the nine unrelated patients with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> had a missense GNA11 mutation ( Leu135Gln ) .
Missense GNA11 mutations ( Arg181Gln and Phe341 Leu ) were detected in two unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> ; they were therefore identified as having <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> type 2 . All four GNA11 mutations predicted disrupted protein structures , and assessment on the basis of in vitro expression showed that familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> type 2-associated mutations decreased the sensitivity of cells expressing calcium-sensing receptors to changes in extracellular calcium concentrations , whereas <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> type 2-associated mutations increased cell sensitivity .
GÎ±11 mutants with loss of function cause familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> type 2 , and GÎ±11 mutants with gain of function cause a clinical disorder designated as <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> type 2 .

Benign <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome of neuronal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
We present a kindred with a previously undescribed combination of neuronal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
The propositus , a 72 -year-old man , had <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , peripheral neuropathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> orthostatic hypotension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> central hypoventilation <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Peripheral electrophysiologic studies showed features of an axonal neuropathy.
The electroencephalogram showed intermittent 2 to 4 Hz activity symmetrically in the hemispheres .
Several family members in 3 generations had <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , neuropathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> although not all of the features were consistently present .
Survival past the 7th decade was common .
Autopsy in 2 affected members revealed the neuropathy to be axonal in type and showed mild to moderate loss of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and pigmentary loss with <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> in the substantia nigra .
This is a unique , benign , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome which shows complete penetrance , variable expression , and both central and peripheral nervous system involvement .
Early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular motor apraxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> : the aprataxin gene mutations .
Early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> is regarded as a variant form of Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> in Japan .
Early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular motor apraxia <END> have been considered as the same clinical entity because of the recent identification of a common mutation in the aprataxin gene .
A new clinical entity named early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular motor apraxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> ( EAOH ) has been proposed to explain these two diseases .
To disclose the clinical features of EAOH and to identify the mutations in the aprataxin gene in six patients in four Japanese families with EAOH .
The clinical features , laboratory findings , sural nerve biopsy results , and brain MRI or CT findings for these patients were evaluated , and molecular analysis was performed , which involved sequencing of the aprataxin gene directly or use of the subcloning method .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebellar ataxia <END> and peripheral neuropathy were noted in all six patients . <START:PHENOTYPE> Ocular motor apraxia <END> was observed in five patients ; two of these patients had obvious head thrust .
Choreiform movements of the limbs and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deterioration <END> were observed in five patients .
Although foot deformity was noted in five patients , kyphoscoliosis was noted only in one patient .
In all patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> were evident , and brain MRI or CT showed marked cerebellar atrophy.
Nerve biopsy revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> depletion of large myelinated fibers <END> in three of the five patients examined .
Molecular analysis of the aprataxin gene revealed an insertion mutation ( ins T at nt167 ) and two missense mutations ( A-to-G transition at nt80 and C-to-T transition at nt95 , the former being novel ) .
We found clinical heterogeneity in the patients with EAOH in this study .
With the disease course , the choreiform movements tended to reduce in degree , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> became evident .
Molecular analysis identified one insertion and two missense mutations including a novel missense one , which was located at a highly conserved amino acid residue in the aprataxin gene product .
Hereditary endotheliopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> ( HERNS ) .
We describe a Chinese American family with a hereditary syndrome consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> , affecting 11 members spanning three generations .
Ophthalmologic evaluations revealed macular <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> with capillary dropout and perifoveal microangiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> telangiectases <END> .
Several members had renal abnormalities with <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Initial manifestations were <START:PHENOTYPE> visual impairment <END> and renal dysfunction ; neurologic deficits occurred in the third or fourth decade of life .
Symptoms included migraine-like headache , psychiatric disturbance , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiparesis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> apraxia <END> .
Neuroimaging consistently demonstrated contrast-enhancing subcortical lesions with surrounding <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> .
Ultrastructural studies showed distinctive multilaminated vascular basement membranes in the brain and in other tissues , including the kidney , stomach , appendix , omentum , and skin .
Genetic analysis ruled out linkage to the CADASIL locus on chromosome 19 . Distinct from CADASIL , hereditary endotheliopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> ( HERNS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> multi-infarct syndrome with systemic involvement .
Limb pterygium syndromes : a review and report of eleven patients .
Conditions with limb pterygia and congenital contractures were reviewed as part of a study of over 350 infants with <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> .
Emphasis was placed on inheritance and variability of distinct pterygium conditions .
Eleven patients with limb pterygia were recognized in our study and are described here .
Seven of the 350 patients with congenital contractures had the autosomal recessively inherited multiple pterygium syndrome ( Patients 1-7 ) .
Three of the seven are sibs , a fourth was born to consanguineous parents , and three were chance isolated cases .
These seven had multiple joint webs , unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> finger contractures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rocker bottom feet <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> antimongoloid slant of palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthal folds <END> , highly arched palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
There is intrafamilial variability .
Three patients from one family had a lethal multiple pterygium syndrome .
Two were monozygotic twins .
They had webbing and contractures of the elbows , knees , neck , and fingers , calcaneovalgus deformity of the feet , and an unusual facial appearance : <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , flat nose , <START:PHENOTYPE> antimongoloid slant of palpebral fissures <END> , apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> .
One had a <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
Internal malformations included : bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> , small heart , absence of the appendix , and attenuation of the ascending and transverse colon .
One sporadic case of lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> popliteal pterygium <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> facial clefts <END> was studied .
Multiple anomalies included : <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum <END> , upslanting palpebral fissures , hypoplasia of nasal cartilages , frenula , clefts into the oropharynx lateral to the mouth , apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> with slit-like canals , large popliteal pterygia , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> with fusion of all digits in hands and feet , and hypoplastic labia .
Meckel syndrome in the Hutterite population is actually a Joubert-related cerebello-oculo-renal syndrome .
Meckel syndrome ( MKS ) is a rare lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by the presence of occipital <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalocele <END> , cystic kidneys , fibrotic changes of the liver and polydactyly .
Joubert syndrome ( JS)-related disorders ( JSRDs ) or cerebello-oculo-renal syndromes ( CORS ) are a group of recessively inherited conditions characterized by a molar tooth sign ( MTS ) on cranial MRI , a set of core clinical features (developmental delay/mental retardation , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , episodic breathing abnormalities , abnormal eye movements ) and variable involvement of other systems including renal , ocular , central nervous system , craniofacial , hepatic , and skeletal .
A significant clinical overlap between MKS and JSRD/CORS has been recognized in the literature .
We describe a group of 10 Hutterite patients , of which 7 had been previously diagnosed with MKS , with a JSRD .
Clinical features include variable early mortality , cognitive handicap , a characteristic dysmorphic facial appearance , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , abnormal breathing pattern , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , and MTS on MRI . Additional features include occipital <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalocele <END> , posterior fossa fluid collections resembling <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , and renal disease .
This JSRD is a recognizable dysmorphic syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deep-set eyes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arched eyebrows <END> with medial sparseness , square nasal tip , <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> with tented upper lip , <START:PHENOTYPE> open mouth <END> with down-turned corners , and <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> .
Renal disease is present in 70 % of patients and is characterized by cystic kidneys , abnormalities in renal function and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
Homozygous deletions of NPHP1 and the known loci for JS/JSRD and MKS were excluded by identity-by-descent mapping studies suggesting that this condition in the Hutterites represents yet another locus for a JSRD .

Familial Del(18p ) syndrome .
We report on sibs and their mother , all with del(18p ) .
The propositus , an 11-month-old , had <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> round face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , upturned nostrils , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> , redundant skin around the neck , <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> .
The elder sister , a two and 7/12-year-old , had <START:PHENOTYPE> round face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , narrow and <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> , redundant skin around the neck , short fingers , and hypoplastic genitalia .
Their mother had <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , prominent columella , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , wide mouth , <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malaligned teeth <END> , and clinodactyly of the fifth fingers .
Serial photographs of the mother showed that the characteristic <START:PHENOTYPE> round face <END> in infancy changed to long face with age .
The present report suggests that the mother with del(18p ) may be fertile , and proper genetic counseling and long follow-up is necessary for the patient with del(18p ) syndrome .

Clinical and genetic comparisons of patients with cystic fibrosis , with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> .
We set out to determine if the clinical course or genetic profiles of patients with cystic fibrosis who had <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> differed from those of other patients with cystic fibrosis .
Since 1950 we have followed 158 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> among 1175 patients with cystic fibrosis ( 13.4% ) .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> had lower birth weight (3026 +/- 610 gm ) than patients with no <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> ( 3169 +/- 534 gm ; p less than 0.008 ) ; the deficit was especially evident in female patients .
Survival in the first year of life increased from 55 % in those born between 1958 and 1972 to 96 % in those born between 1973 and 1987 .
Since 1973 the median survival of male and female patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> was similar to that in female patients with no <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> ( 21 years ) , whereas 78 % of males with no <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> survived to this age ( p less than 0.0001 ) .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> born before 1972 had lower weight and height percentiles at age 13 years compared with patients with no <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> , but this difference was not as apparent in patients born after 1973 .
There were no differences between the two groups in forced vital capacity , forced expiratory volume in 1 second , or forced expiratory flow in the middle half of forced vital capacity .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a younger age than did patients with no <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> ( 4.2 0 +/- 4.67 vs 7.18 +/- 5 .19 years ) , but there was no difference in age of acquisition of P . cepacia .
In families in which the first child had <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> , 29% of subsequent siblings with cystic fibrosis had <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> , compared with 6% of siblings born to families in which the first child did not have <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> .
Allelic frequencies and haplotypic variants for cystic fibrosis chromosomes with respect to DNA markers closely linked to the cystic fibrosis locus were similar in families with cystic fibrosis with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> and those with no <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> .
These findings suggest that patients with cystic fibrosis and those without <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> do not have major intrinsic differences and that the previously poor outlook in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> has improved greatly .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spastic paraplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( SPAR ) : a novel genetic disorder .
To describe a kindred with a dominantly inherited neurologic disorder manifested either as uncomplicated <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Neurologic examinations and molecular genetic analysis ( exclusion of known SCA and HSP genes and loci ; and trinucleotide repeat expansion detection [ RED] ) were performed in six affected and four unaffected subjects in this family .
MRI , electromyography ( EMG) , and nerve conduction studies were performed in three affected subjects .
The phenotype of this dominantly inherited syndrome varied in succeeding generations .
Pure <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> was present in the earliest generation ; subsequent generations had <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
MRI showed marked atrophy of the spinal cord in all patients and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> in those with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
Laboratory analysis showed that the disorder was not caused by mutations in genes that cause SCA-1 , SCA-2 , SCA-3 , SCA-6 , SCA-7 , SCA-8 , and SCA-12 ; not linked to other known loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( SCA-4 , SCA-5 , SCA-10 , SCA-11 , SCA-13 , SCA-14 , and SCA-16 ) ; and not linked to known loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( HSP ) ( SPG-3 , SPG-4 , SPG-6 , SPG-8 , SPG-9 , SPG-10 , SPG-12 , and SPG-13 ) or autosomal recessive HSP SPG-7 . Analysis of intergenerational differences in age at onset of symptoms suggests genetic anticipation .
Using RED , the authors did not detect expanded CAG , CCT , TGG , or CGT repeats that segregate with the disease .
The authors describe an unusual , dominantly inherited neurologic disorder in which the phenotype ( pure <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> or spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with variable <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ) differed in subsequent generations .
The molecular explanation for apparent genetic anticipation does not appear to involve trinucleotide repeat expansion .
X-linked myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> : mutation in the homeobox gene ARX . To describe a new syndrome of X-linked myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> ( XMESID) and identify the gene defect underlying this disorder .
The authors studied a family in which six boys over two generations had intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> using a validated <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> questionnaire , clinical examination , and EEG studies .
Previous records and investigations were obtained .
Information on <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> disorders was obtained on 271 members of the extended family .
Molecular genetic analysis included linkage studies and mutational analysis using a positional candidate gene approach .
All six affected boys had <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonic seizures <END> and TC S ; two had infantile spasms , but only one had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypsarrhythmia <END> .
EEG studies show diffuse background slowing with slow generalized spike wave activity .
All affected boys had moderate to profound <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperreflexia <END> was observed in obligate carrier women .
A late-onset progressive spastic ataxia in the matriarch raises the possibility of late clinical manifestations in obligate carriers .
The disorder was mapped to Xp11 .2-22.2 with a maximum lod score of 1.8 . As recently reported , a missense mutation (1058 C>T/ P353L ) was identified within the homeodomain of the novel human Aristaless related homeobox gene ( ARX ) .
XMESID is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> in boys .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperreflexia <END> is found in carrier women .
XMESID is associated with a missense mutation in ARX .
This disorder is allelic with X-linked infantile spasms ( ISSX ; MIM 308350 ) where polyalanine tract expansions are the commonly observed molecular defect .
Mutations of ARX are associated with a wide range of phenotypes ; functional studies in the future may lend insights to the neurobiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonic seizures <END> and infantile spasms .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> associated with adrenocortical insufficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> , and neurological abnormalities .
We report on two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> , adrenocortical insufficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
The parents and three sibs are unaffected .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Achalasia <END> , adrenocortical insufficiency , and <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> comprise a recently characterized familial multisystem disorder of unknown cause .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Achalasia <END> has also been described in association with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in one family and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in another .
The above reports and these sibs may represent variants of a single pleiotropic recessive gene .
We suggest that abnormalities of the central nervous system are a manifestation of the <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> , adrenocortical insufficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> syndrome .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder of pyogenic sterile <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> gangrenosum , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acne <END> : PAPA syndrome .
To describe a multigenerational family with transmission of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterized by pyogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> gangrenosum , and severe cystic <START:PHENOTYPE> acne <END> .
We present a detailed case report of a 39-year-old man with arthritic changes in several joints , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> gangrenosum , and cystic <START:PHENOTYPE> acne <END> .
Several relatives from three generations of his family underwent clinical and genetic investigations .
The findings in this kindred are reported .
Ten affected family members in three generations manifested variable expression of a pauciarticular , nonaxial , destructive , corticosteroid-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> that began in childhood ; <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> gangrenosum ; and severe cystic <START:PHENOTYPE> acne <END> in adolescence and beyond .
Other less commonly associated features included adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , abscess formation at the site of parenteral injections , and cytopenias attributable to sulfonamide medications .
Laboratory evaluation was nondiagnostic .
Genetic studies excluded linkage to the major histocompatibility locus .
The acronym of PAPA syndrome ( pyogenic sterile <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> gangrenosum , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acne <END> ) is suggested for this newly recognized pleiotropic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder .
The nature of the genetic alteration in PAPA syndrome is unknown .
Parental age in <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Of 104 children with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> born between 1945 and 1970 , we studied the age of their parents at the birth and compared this age with the mean age of parents at the birth of their children during the same period in The Netherlands .
The mean age of fathers at the birth of their children with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( 33.7 years ) was significantly higher than the mean age of fathers at the birth of their children in the general population (32.5 years ) ( P less than .05 , one sided ) .
Similarly , the mean age of mothers at the birth of their children with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( 31.2 years ) was significantly higher than the mean age of mothers at the birth of their children in the general population ( 29.5 years ) ( P less than .05 , one sided ) .
We further analyzed this parental age factor by measuring the relative risk of age groups and comparing the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> in the various parental age groups with the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> in the total population .
Mothers 35 years of age or older had a relative risk of 1.7 to have a child with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> compared with mothers in the population in general ( P = .006 , one sided ) .
Similarly , fathers 50 years of age or older had a relative risk of 5. 0 to have a child with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> compared with fathers in the population in general ( P = .04 , one sided ) .
No parental age effect was found in children with nonhereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
We conclude that a high paternal and a high maternal age are significant risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Basal cell carcinoma <END> of the eyelid associated with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome .
To describe the ophthalmic and systemic features in a series of patients initially seen with eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> associated with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome .
Retrospective noncomparative case series .
Of 105 consecutive patients with eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> managed at an Ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> Oncology <END> Center between January 1973 and December 1999 , four patients with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome were identified .
The ophthalmic and systemic features , management , and outcome of patients with eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> associated with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome were analyzed .
The published literature on Gorlin-Goltz syndrome , specifically related to genetics , systemic features , ophthalmic associations , and prophylactic management strategies , was reviewed .
Response of the eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> to treatment and the final systemic condition were the main outcome measures .
All four patients had a family history of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome .
The systemic manifestations included multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> in all the patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> or increased occipitofrontal circumference in three patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> palmar pits <END> in two patients , odontogenic keratocyst in one patient , ectopic calcification in one patient , and bifid rib in one patient .
The mean age at the detection of the first <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> was 30 years ( range , 16-38 years ) .
All four patients had multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> on the face and elsewhere .
The eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> was advanced with orbital infiltration in three patients , one of whom opted for palliative radiotherapy , whereas the other two underwent orbital exenteration .
The fourth patient , who had localized recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> in the upper eyelid , was treated with excision and eyelid reconstruction .
At the final follow-up ( mean , 41 months) , eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> was cured in three patients and stable in one patient .
No patient had life-threatening sequelae of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome .
Gorlin-Goltz syndrome is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> predisposition syndrome that may be associated with eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> .
The associated systemic findings may be a clue to the diagnosis of this condition .
It is important to recognize Gorlin-Goltz syndrome when a patient has multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> or when a young patient with eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> is seen by an ophthalmologist , because lifelong monitoring is essential for patient management .
van den Ende-Gupta syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , and congenital contractures : clinical delineation and recurrence in brothers .
We describe two Hispanic brothers born to unrelated parents with van den Ende-Gupta syndrome ( VDEGS) , a distinctive combination of characteristic dysmorphic features , skeletal abnormalities , and cerebellar hyperplasia .
This syndrome was previously delineated by van den Ende et al . [ 1992 : Am J Med Genet 42:467-469 ] and Gupta et al . [ 1995 : J Med Genet 32:8 09-812 ] , with additional reports by Phadke et al . [ 1998 : Am J Med Genet 77 :16-18 ] and Bistritzer et al . [ 1993 : Clin Genet 44 :15 - 19 ] .
This is the fifth report of VDEGS , which is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic alae nasi <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic maxilla <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> everted lower lip <END> , slender and elongated hands and feet , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , self-limiting joint contractures , and distinctive skeletal findings .
This report of affected siblings , and a previous report of double second cousins born to consanguineous parents [Bistritzer et al . [ 1993 : Clin Genet 44 :15 - 19] ] , suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
This brings to eight , the total number of reported cases , derived from six families , three of which are consanguineous .
It is important to distinguish VDEGS from Marden-Walker syndrome ( MWS ) since both syndromes include <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , and congenital contractures .
Both syndromes are inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> fashion , but VDEGS lacks severe mental retardation , serious brain malformations , microcephaly , failure to thrive , and severe joint limitation , which are consistently present in MWS .
Of particular importance , MWS may be associated with cerebellar malformations such as Dandy-Walker malformation , while the brothers reported herein with VDEGS both demonstrated distinctive cerebellar enlargement , a new finding for this disorder .
While , congenital contractures with <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> are features commonly seen in several other delineated syndromes , such as congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> ( CCA ) syndrome , characteristic facial features ( <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent ears <END> , and everted lower lip) , distinguish VDEGS from other syndromes associated with CCA , including CCA .

Probable exclusion of GLC1A as a candidate <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> gene in a family with middle-age-onset primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
To determine whether an adult-onset variety of primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in family UM:POAG1 is linked to the previously mapped GLC1A juvenile-onset primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> locus on chromosome 1q or whether linkage can be excluded .
Microsatellite repeat markers from the 9 cM D1S196 to D1S218 interval containing the GLC1A gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from DNA samples collected from 11 members of one sibship in family UM:POAG1 .
Haplotype analysis was carried out , including calculation of the probability that the observed data would have been obtained if the underlying cause of primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in this family were a defect in a gene located in the tested interval .
Linkage analysis was carried out under an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model for GLC1A <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
In family UM:POAG1 , primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> was diagnosed in six surviving and one deceased member of a sibship of 13 individuals during the fifth or sixth decade of life .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Glaucoma <END> in this family has a later average age at diagnosis and significantly less elevation in intraocular pressure than GLC1A <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> so far described .
Haplotype analysis , using a population prevalence up to 0.9% , shows that it is unlikely that the reported data would have been observed if primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in this pedigree were due to the GLC1A locus on chromosome 1q21-q31 .
Linkage analysis under the juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model allowed exclusion of linkage across the entire GLC1A genetic inclusion interval , with a maximum lod score in the interval of -3.28 .
The most likely interpretation of these observations is that a defect in the GLC1A <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> gene is not responsible for adult-onset primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in family UM:POAG1 .
This suggests the existence of at least two primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> genes , the previously reported GLC1A gene on chromosome 1q and another gene located elsewhere in the genome .
Diagnosis of UM:POAG1 <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> between 42 and 57 years of age also raises questions regarding the relation of the <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> present in this family to the common later-age-onset form of the disease .
MBTPS2 mutation causes BRESEK/BRESHECK syndrome .
BRESEK/BRESHECK syndrome is a multiple congenital malformation characterized by brain anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> , skeletal deformities , ear or eye anomalies , and renal anomalies or small kidneys , with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> .
This syndrome has only been reported in three male patients .
Here , we report on the fourth male patient presenting with brain anomaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , growth retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> , vertebral ( skeletal ) anomaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> , low-set and <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and small kidneys .
These manifestations fulfill the clinical diagnostic criteria of BRESHECK syndrome .
Since all patients with BRESEK/BRESHECK syndrome are male , and X-linked syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis with atrichia and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> is sometimes associated with several features of BRESEK/BRESHECK syndrome such as <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , vertebral and renal anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> , we analyzed the causal gene of <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis with atrichia and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> syndrome , MBTPS2 , in the present patient and identified an p.Arg429His mutation .
This mutation has been reported to cause the most severe type of <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis with atrichia and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> syndrome , including neonatal and infantile death .
These results demonstrate that the p.Arg429His mutation in MBTPS2 causes BRESEK/BRESHECK syndrome .

New <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> syndrome with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> severely impaired vision <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing defect <END> , epileptic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , restricted joint mobility , and early death .
A family with an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome involving seven children in two generations is reported .
The syndrome includes <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> severely impaired vision <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> , a severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , epileptic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , restricted movement of the large joints , and death in infancy or early childhood .
We conclude that this is a distinct , previously unrecognized <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome .
Michels syndrome , Carnevale syndrome , OSA syndrome , and Malpuech syndrome : variable expression of a single disorder ( 3MC syndrome ) ?
We report on a 3-year-old girl with Michels syndrome , a rare condition characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> , cleft lip/palate , abnormal supra-umbilical abdominal wall , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deficiency <END> .
The phenotypic findings are compared with the six previously reported Michels cases , and with patients referred to as Carnevale , OSA , and Malpuech syndromes .
Michels syndrome is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> anterior chamber anomalies <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> .
Carnevale syndrome shows <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> synophrys , large and fleshy ears , and lozenge-shaped diastasis around the umbilicus .
OSA syndrome resembles Carnevale , with humeroradial synostoses , and spinal anomalies as extra features .
Malpuech syndrome shows IUGR , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> , hypospadias , renal anomalies , and caudal appendage .
All are <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
Despite the presence of apparently distinctive key features , it appears that these four entities share multiple similarities in the facial Gestalt and the pattern of MCA . Those similarities lead us to postulate that they belong to the same spectrum , which could be referred to as " 3MC syndrome " ( Malpuech-Michels-Mingarelli-Carnevale syndrome ) .

An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of joint contractures , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcytic anemia <END> , and panniculitis-associated lipodystrophy.
Genetic lipodystrophies are rare disorders characterized by partial or complete loss of adipose tissue and predisposition to insulin resistance and its complications such as diabetes mellitus , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , hepatic steatosis , acanthosis nigricans , and polycystic ovarian syndrome .
The objective of the study was to report a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> syndrome .
We report the detailed phenotype of two males and one female patient , 26-34 yr old , belonging to two pedigrees with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome presenting with childhood-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> , severe joint contractures , erythematous skin lesions , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcytic anemia <END> .
Other variable clinical features include <START:PHENOTYPE> hypergammaglobulinemia <END> , hepatosplenomegaly , generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> basal ganglia calcification <END> .
None of the patients had diabetes mellitus or acanthosis nigricans .
Two had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> and all had low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol .
Skin biopsy of an erythematous nodular skin lesion from one of the patients revealed evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> panniculitis <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> initially affected the upper body but later became generalized involving abdomen and lower extremities as well .
We conclude that these patients represent a novel autoinflammatory syndrome resulting in joint contractures , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcytic anemia <END> , and panniculitis-induced lipodystrophy.
The molecular genetic basis of this disorder remains to be elucidated .
Vitrectomy in eyes with unsuspected <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
To analyze patient management and prognosis after vitrectomy in eyes with unsuspected <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Retrospective , noncomparative case series .
Eleven consecutive patients who had undergone vitrectomy on an eye with unsuspected <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
The two main outcome measures were ultimate patient management and the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> metastasis .
Of more than 900 consecutive patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> managed on the Ocular Oncology Service at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia , 11 ( 1% ) had prior vitrectomy in an eye with viable tumor before referral to us for suspected <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
The main preoperative diagnoses included <START:PHENOTYPE> vitreous hemorrhage <END> in seven patients ( 64% ) , toxocariasis in two patients ( 18% ) , toxoplasmosis in one patient ( 9% ) , and endophthalmitis in one patient ( 9% ) .
In no case was <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> suspected before vitrectomy .
The mean patient age at vitrectomy was 6 years .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinoblastoma <END> was later suspected during vitrectomy in two patients ( 18% ) , on cytologic examination of the vitrectomy specimen in eight patients ( 73% ) , and after referral in one patient ( 9% ) .
The mean interval between vitrectomy and referral to us was 23 days .
On examination , the globe was classified as Reese-Ellsworth group Vb in all 11 patients (100% ) .
Anterior chamber tumor cells were clinically visible in four eyes ( 36% ) , hyphema in two eyes ( 18% ) , and iris neovascularization in two eyes ( 18% ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinoblastoma <END> cells were visualized in the vitreous in seven eyes ( 64% ) and not visualized in four eyes ( 36% ) that had vitreous blood .
Enucleation was necessary in all 11 patients (100% ) .
Adjuvant treatment was delivered in 10 patients ( 91% ) , using orbital radiotherapy in nine patients ( 82% ) and chemotherapy in nine patients ( 82% ) .
Histopathologic evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> invasion was documented in the episclera ( two eyes ; 18% ) , anterior chamber ( seven eyes ; 64% ) , iris ( five eyes ; 45% ) , ciliary body ( five eyes ; 45% ) , choroid ( three eyes ; 27% ) , and optic nerve ( four eyes ; 36% ; prelaminar , two eyes ; postlaminar , two eyes ) .
The vitrectomy ports , Tenon 's fascia , cut end of the optic nerve , and orbit were free of tumor .
Of the 10 patients who received prophylactic chemotherapy , radiotherapy , or both in addition to enucleation for prevention of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> metastasis , none ( 0% ) experienced metastasis or orbital recurrence during the mean follow-up of 7 years ( range , 0.2-24 years ) from the time of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> diagnosis .
However , one patient was referred to us after the development of metastatic <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , and despite aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy after enucleation , died 24 months later .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinoblastoma <END> may present with atypical features such as <START:PHENOTYPE> vitreous hemorrhage <END> or signs of vitreous inflammation , particularly in older children .
Vitrectomy should be avoided in these cases until the possibility of underlying <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> is excluded .
If vitrectomy is performed in an eye with unsuspected <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , enucleation combined with adjuvant chemotherapy , radiotherapy , or both without delay is advised to prevent systemic tumor dissemination .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> ( SEMDJL ) : clinical and radiological findings in a Guatemalan patient .
We report on a patient of Guatemalan descent whose physical and radiological findings are consistent with a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> ( SEMDJL ) .
This is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal dysplasia <END> with short limbs , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , high dorsal <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> .
Most described patients with SEMDJL are from the Afrikaans-speaking communities of South Africa .
Patients with SEMDJL have an <START:PHENOTYPE> oval face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent eyes <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> .
Our patient 's height and weight were below the fifth centile .
She had <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent eyes <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , a narrow , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , pectus carinatum , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and hyperextensibility and instability of most joints , with limited extension and supination of her elbows .
A review of her roentgenograms showed severe <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , poorly developed ischial , iliac , and pubic bones , a " bat-like " appearance of the iliac bones , "dysplastic " acetabulum , minimal metaphyseal and epiphyseal abnormalities at the knees , deformation of the proximal femoral metaphyses , and generalized brachydactyly of the hands and feet .
This disorder may be more common than previously thought , and the diagnosis should be considered in any child with a dwarfing condition and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogenitalism <END> : report and review of Micro syndrome .
We report on a 7-month-old boy with Micro syndrome who was referred for assessment of mental-motor retardation and reduced vision with cataract .
The characteristics of Micro syndrome are <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , agenesis /hypoplasia of the corpus callosum , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogenitalism <END> .
The differential diagnosis includes cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome ( COFS) ; a syndrome involving cataract , arthrogryposis , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> ( CAMAK ) ; a syndrome with cataract , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> ( CAMFAK ) ; Martsolf syndrome ; Neu-Laxova syndrome ; Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome ; and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome .
Till date , no renal malformations have been reported in Micro syndrome .
Our patient had fusion of the lower poles of the kidneys and his left kidney was ectopic .
Ocular findings are the most reliable neonatal diagnostic signs of Micro syndrome .
MinÃ¶r anomalies in Micro syndrome may be subtle and therefore not of significant diagnostic value .
Micro syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
Till date , most reported cases have been in individuals of Muslim origin .
In countries with high rates of consanguineous marriage , such as Turkey , it is important that physicians be able to recognize this syndrome .
Micro syndrome should be considered in any infant with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Intractable diarrhea <END> of infancy with facial dysmorphism , <START:PHENOTYPE> trichorrhexis nodosa <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> .
A 3-year-old girl had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> intractable diarrhea <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> trichorrhexis nodosa <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> .
This patient was referred to the pediatric dermatology clinic for lifelong <START:PHENOTYPE> brittle hair <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> brittle hair <END> microscopically demonstrated <START:PHENOTYPE> trichorrhexis nodosa <END> .
The girl also had facial dysmorphism , with a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> and cheeks , broad <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nose <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> .
She had a history of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> intractable diarrhea <END> since 2 weeks of age and <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> requiring lifelong total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hepatomegaly <END> was noted and prompted liver biopsy which demonstrated <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> .
Mental retardation and developmental delay was also found upon examination .
This child may be included in the syndrome of intractable infant <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , an entity known in the gastroenterology literature but yet not reported in the dermatologic literature .
Dermatologists should be aware of this syndrome in which <START:PHENOTYPE> trichorrhexis nodosa <END> is commonly seen .
Child with manifestations of dermotrichic syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis-alopecia-photophobia ( IFAP ) syndrome .
We report on a boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , follicular <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , hypohydrosis , enamel dysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> aganglionic megacolon <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> , vertebral , renal and other anomalies , and a normal chromosome constitution .
The clinical findings include all the features that dermotrichic and <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis-alopecia-photophobia ( IFAP ) syndrome have in common and in addition those that characterize IFAP syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent respiratory infections <END> , etc.) , those that are present only in dermotrichic syndrome ( nail anomalies , hypohydrosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> megacolon <END> , vertebral defects , etc. ) and additional ones (enamel dysplasia , renal anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> , etc. ) . Two maternal uncles were referred as being affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> suggesting <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> transmission .
Various hypotheses concerning the relationship between the 2 syndromes and the present case are discussed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> preauricular tags <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> in three unrelated patients : a <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibulofacial dysostosis <END> distinct from Treacher Collins syndrome .
Treacher Collins syndrome ( TCS , OMIM 154500 ) is a well-defined <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibulofacial dysostosis <END> characterized by symmetric facial anomalies consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> malar hypoplasia <END> , coloboma of the lower eyelid , dysplastic ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and deafness .
Other mandibulofacial dysostoses ( MDs ) such as Toriello ( OMIM 301950 ) , Bauru ( OMIM 604830) , Hedera-Toriello-Petty ( OMIM 608257 ) , and Guion-Almeida ( OMIM 61 0536 ) syndromes are less well characterized and much rarer .
Here we describe three unrelated patients showing clinical features overlapping with TCS , but who in addition have <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and a distinct facial gestalt .
Because of the distinct ear anomalies and the hearing loss a HOXA2 mutation was taken into account .
CHARGE syndrome was discussed because of ear anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> in our patients .
But mutational analyses including sequencing of the TCOF1 , the HOXA2 , and the CHD7 genes , deletion screening of the TCOF1 gene as well as genomewide array analyses revealed normal results .
We suggest that these three patients have a new type of <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibulofacial dysostosis <END> .
As all three cases are sporadic and both sexes are affected the pattern of inheritance might be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
Identification of additional patients will allow to further delineate the phenotype , to assign the inheritance pattern and to identify the molecular basis .
A new acro-cranio-facial dysostosis syndrome in sisters .
Two sisters born to consanguineous parents had a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> acrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , high nose bridge and <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , abnormal external ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> preauricular pits <END> , sensorineural and <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive deafness <END> , proximally placed first toes and digitalized thumbs , bulbous digits , <START:PHENOTYPE> metatarsus adductus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> .
Radiological abnormalities included <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , increased mandibular angle and antegonial notching of mandible ; hypoplastic first metacarpals and metatarsals ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic distal phalanges <END> ; partial duplication of the distal phalanx of the thumb ; malformed malleus and incus ; tall lumbar vertebrae , increased interpedicular distance , and posterior scalloping ; flared iliac wings , narrow supraacetabular regions , acetabular "dysplasia, " and coxa valga .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> is suggested .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistant diabetes <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovaries <END> , hypogonadism , <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinopathy <END> , labyrinthine deafness , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Two sibs , whose parents are first cousins , had diabetes mellitus with hyperinsulinism , insensitive insulin receptors , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> .
Both patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinopathy <END> , secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , labyrinthine deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and cerebral atrophy.
They were disproportionately short with relatively broad hands and feet and slightly <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse face <END> .
The young woman had <START:PHENOTYPE> secondary amenorrhea <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovaries <END> and the boy <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism <END> .
This appears to be the second family with a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder differing from AlstrÃ¶m syndrome by the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and absence of renal insufficiency .
Impaired insulin receptor binding and <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovaries <END> are described as part of this syndrome .
Atlastin1 mutations are frequent in young-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> paraplegia <END> .
Hereditary spastic paraplegias are disorders that are very <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> , both clinically and genetically .
The atlastin1 gene has recently been implicated in SPG3A , a form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pure spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> paraplegia <END> .
Atlastin1 mutations have been identified in 8 families so far . To determine the relative frequency , phenotype , and mutation spectrum of SPG3A in patients with pure <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> paraplegia <END> and onset before age 20 years .
We sequenced the atlastin1 gene in a large series of patients ( 31 families ) in which mutations in the spastin gene , corresponding to the frequent SPG4 locus , had previously been excluded .
The phenotype was compared with 126 SPG4 patients .
We identified 12 families ( 39% ) including 34 patients with 9 different missense atlastin1 mutations , 7 of which are newly described .
The main clinical characteristic of these SPG3A patients was pure spasticity with very young onset of symptoms ( mean age , 4.6 +/- 3.9 years ) and slow progression .
However , additional signs such as decreased vibration sense and wasting in lower limbs , <START:PHENOTYPE> sphincter disturbances <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> were found in a minority of patients .
In addition , several gene carriers were clinically affected but still asymptomatic ( n = 5 ) or had no clinical signs ( n = 2) , indicating <START:PHENOTYPE> incomplete penetrance <END> .
Compared with patients from other families meeting the same diagnostic criteria ( 43 patients ) and families with SPG4 ( 126 patients) , the major form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> paraplegia <END> , SPG3A patients had earlier symptom onset , less frequently <START:PHENOTYPE> increased reflexes <END> in the upper limbs , decreased vibration sense in the lower limbs , and fewer <START:PHENOTYPE> sphincter disturbances <END> , but more frequently observed wasting in the lower limbs and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
These particularities , as well as frequent abnormal motor evoked potentials , could help identify patients to be screened for atlastin1 gene mutations .
This study enables us to estimate the frequency of the SPG3A mutations in France at 39% in families with young-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> paraplegia <END> after exclusion of SPG4 cases .
So far , most mutations have been private , although they were all found in exons 7 , 8 , 12 , and 13 . These exons should be given priority when performing molecular diagnoses for SPG3A .
Recessive inheritance of diabetes : the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and deafness .
A few rare syndromes have been delineated in which <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> is inherited in association with other conditions .
This paper describes five patients , including four siblings in one family , who have <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and deafness ( the DIDMOAD syndrome ) .
The parents of both families are normal but are first cousins .
All the patients have insulin-dependent <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> with a typical juvenile-onset .
The onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> was insidious and the symptoms could easily have been ascribed to poor control of <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> .
The importance of diagnosing <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> is that all these patients had dilatation of the urinary tract varying from mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hydroureter <END> to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> and this improved with treatment of the <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> .
It is suggested that patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> should have regular screening tests for <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> since it is likely that they represent cases of the full syndrome with incomplete clinical expression .
The occurrence of this rare syndrome in four siblings of unaffected parents indicates that the syndrome is due to a recessive gene , but the pathogenesis is unknown .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular prognathism <END> with eye and skin anomalies ( MOMES syndrome ) : a newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
We report two daughters of a Thai family affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , delayed speech , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , craniofacial manifestations , and ocular anomalies .
Craniofacial manifestations included <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , maxillary hypoplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular prognathism <END> , and crowding of teeth .
Ocular anomalies consisted of <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharoptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased visual acuity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> abducens palsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperopic astigmatism <END> , and accommodative <START:PHENOTYPE> esotropia <END> .
Chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> , lateral deviation of the great toes , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cone-shaped epiphyses <END> of the toes were observed .
The disorder is suggested to be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
The combination of findings found in our patients has not hitherto been described .

Visual acuity in children with coloboma : clinical features and a new phenotypic classification system .
The aims of this study were to describe the clinical features and biometric findings in the eyes of children with coloboma and to develop a classification of coloboma that correlates with visual function .
Retrospective observational case series .
One hundred thirteen children and young adults ( 48 female , 65 male ) aged 0 to 20 years with 196 eyes having coloboma .
Children with coloboma were recruited from schools for the blind , integrated education programs , schools for the mentally handicapped , community-based rehabilitation services , and hospital clinics in Andhra Pradesh , India , between January 1998 and January 1999 .
Visual function was assessed , including distance and near visual acuity ( VA) , and navigational vision .
The corneal diameter and axial length of eyes were measured wherever possible .
Anatomic site of coloboma , association with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> , VA , presence of navigational vision and reading vision .
Of 196 eyes with colobomatous malformations , 11 had <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> with cyst , and 185 eyes had coloboma ( associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> in 155 eyes and with a normal corneal diameter in 30 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microphthalmos <END> was present in 72 of the 185 eyes with coloboma , of which 71 of 72 also had <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> .
The prognosis for vision depended on the phenotype of the better eye .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microphthalmos <END> with cyst had the worst prognosis ( VA < 3/60 , 100% ; reading and navigational vision , 0% ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcornea <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> had a worse prognosis than <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> without <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> ( VA < 3/6 0 : 66 .7% vs . 23.3% ; unable to read N1 0 : 66 .7% vs . 34.1 % ; no navigational vision : 30.6 % vs . 6.73% ) .
Simple coloboma ( no <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> ) had the best prognosis ( VA < 3/6 0 : 6.7% ; able to read N1 0 : 93.3% ; navigational vision : 100% ) .
A corneal diameter <6 mm had a poor visual prognosis , whereas a corneal diameter >1 0 mm had a good prognosis .
A phenotypic classification of coloboma is proposed , which in this study showed a good correlation with visual acuity , reading , and navigational vision .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microphthalmos <END> with cyst had the worst prognosis , coloboma with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> a poor prognosis , coloboma with only <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> had an intermediate prognosis , and simple coloboma had the best prognosis .
A syndrome of primary combined <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , growth failure and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> .
A male infant with primary combined <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with marked <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , and growth failure of prenatal onset is presented .
He developed progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> in the 3rd year of life and died at 42 months from disseminated aspergillosis .
Laboratory studies and post mortem examination failed to reveal any known aetiology for his disorder .
Hreidarsson et al . [3 ] previously described a syndrome of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> and growth failure in three boys , with similar clinical and laboratory findings .
Although extensive immunological investigations were not performed in those previous patients , recurrent infections in two of them are suggestive of <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> .
In the light of the immunological findings in our patient , we propose that the condition of the four patients belongs to the same syndrome , which has to be considered as a primary combined <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> syndrome .
This syndrome can be distinguished from the other known <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> syndromes by its associated characteristic features , namely <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , growth failure of prenatal onset and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> .
Missense mutations in ITPR1 cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
Congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> is characterized by early gross <START:PHENOTYPE> motor delay <END> , hypotonia , gait <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysmetria <END> .
The clinical presentation remains fairly stable and may be associated with cerebellar atrophy.
To date , only a few families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> have been reported .
Linkage to 3pter was demonstrated in one large Australian family and this locus was designated spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 29.
The objective of this study is to describe an unreported Canadian family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and to identify the underlying genetic causes in this family and the original Australian family .
Exome sequencing was performed for the Australian family , resulting in the identification of a heterozygous mutation in the ITPR1 gene .
For the Canadian family , genotyping with microsatellite markers and Sanger sequencing of ITPR1 gene were performed ; a heterozygous missense mutation in ITPR1 was identified .
ITPR1 encodes inositol 1 ,4,5-trisphosphate receptor , type 1 , a ligand-gated ion channel that mediates calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum .
Deletions of ITPR1 are known to cause spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 15 , a distinct and very slowly progressive form of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> with onset in adulthood .
Our study demonstrates for the first time that , in addition to spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 15 , alteration of ITPR1 function can cause a distinct congenital nonprogressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ; highlighting important <START:PHENOTYPE> clinical heterogeneity <END> associated with the ITPR1 gene and a significant role of the ITP R1- related pathway in the development and maintenance of the normal functions of the cerebellum .
Dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> : a syndrome caused by a missense mutation in OPA1 .
To describe the clinical features of and identify the disease-causing mutation in a large Utah family segregating a dominantly inherited syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> .
Observational case series .
Thirty individuals at risk for a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> in a single family underwent clinical examinations and venipuncture .
Linkage analysis and mutation screening of the <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> 1 gene ( OPA1 ) were performed .
Eighteen individuals demonstrated characteristics of the syndrome .
Genetic analysis identified a G-->A substitution at nucleotide position 1334 in exon 14 of OPA1 causing an arginine-to-histidine change ( R445H ) in all affected members of the family .
This change segregated with the disease phenotype in the study family with a LOD score of 7. 02 at theta ; = 0 and was not found in 200 normal control subjects .
Analysis of an unrelated Belgian family with a similar phenotype revealed the same R445H mutation segregating with the disease phenotype .
This study describes a mutation in OPA1 causing a unique syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> .
These results expand the spectrum of human disease associated with mutations of OPA1 and indicate that ophthalmologists caring for patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> should inquire about possible associated hearing loss .
Although OPA1 is a nuclear gene , the gene product localizes to mitochondria , suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction may be the final common pathway for many forms of syndromic and nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , hearing loss , and external <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> .
Very few patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> have been described .
Information about clinical course , familial studies or evolution after renal transplantation is very scant .
We have studied eight patients with this syndrome who belong to five different families .
The mean age at diagnosis was 15 +/- 7 years ( 5 to 25 years ) .
The primary clinical data were polyuria-polydipsia ( 8 cases) , ocular abnormalities (5 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent urinary tract infections <END> (5 ) and recurrent renal colics with stone passage (2 ) .
Bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> was observed in all cases .
Every patient showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> ( 1 .1 +/- 0.2 mg/dl ) with inappropriately high urinary magnesium ( Mg ) excretions (7 0 +/- 17 mg/day ) , Mg clearances ( 4.4 +/- 1.2 ml/m ) and Mg fractional excretions ( 16 .2 +/- 7.1% ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypercalciuria <END> was present in every case except in those with advanced renal insufficiency .
Serum parathormone levels were abnormally high .
Serum calcium ( Ca) , phosphorus and potassium , and urinary excretions of uric acid and oxalate were normal .
Neither chronic oral Mg administration nor thiazide diuretics normalized serum Mg levels or urinary Ca excretions , respectively .
Follow-up was 6 +/- 4.5 years .
Renal function worsened in every case with six patients starting on chronic dialysis after 4.3 +/- 3.8 years .
The progression rate of renal insufficiency correlated with the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> .
Five patients have received a kidney graft , and their serum Mg and urinary Ca have always been within normal values after transplantation .
Twenty-six members of four of the affected families were studied : none of them showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> , renal insufficiency or <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> .
However , eleven cases ( 42% ) had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and four of them presented with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> renal stones <END> .
Two family members had medullary sponge kidneys .
In conclusion , progression to renal insufficiency is common in this syndrome ; oral Mg and thiazide diuretics are ineffective to correct abnormalities .
After kidney graft , tubular handling of Mg and Ca was normal .
A striking incidence ( 42% ) of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> was found in the familial study .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Glutaric aciduria <END> type II: review of the phenotype and report of an unusual glomerulopathy.
A male infant with <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> II secondary to electron transfer flavoprotein : ubiquinone oxidoreductase deficiency is compared to previously reported cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> II. A common pattern of anomalies in patients with malformations ( 8 /16 ) includes <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large anterior fontanelle <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> malformed ears <END> .
Abnormalities such as hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral gliosis <END> , heterotopias , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic periportal necrosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidneys <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> genital defects <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> II are reminiscent of those in Zellweger syndrome , whereas elevations of glutaric , ethylmalonic , adipic , and isovaleric acids are quite distinctive .
A unique ultrastructural alteration of the glomerular basement membrane was observed in the proposita .
This manifestation may represent an early stage in renal cyst formation and provide a diagnostic criterion for <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> II when enzyme studies are unavailable .
Ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 2 : clinical , biological and genotype/phenotype correlation study of a cohort of 90 patients .
Ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 2 ( AOA2 ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disease due to mutations in the senataxin gene , causing progressive cerebellar ataxia with peripheral neuropathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> , occasional <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> and elevated alpha-feto-protein ( AFP ) serum level .
We compiled a series of 67 previously reported and 58 novel ataxic patients who underwent senataxin gene sequencing because of suspected AOA2 .
An AOA2 diagnosis was established for 90 patients , originating from 15 countries worldwide , and 25 new senataxin gene mutations were found .
In patients with AOA2 , median AFP serum level was 31. 0 microg/l at diagnosis , which was higher than the median AFP level of AOA2 negative patients : 13.8 microg/l , P = 0.0004 ; itself higher than the normal level ( 3.4 microg/l , range from 0.5 to 17. 2 microg/l ) because elevated AFP was one of the possible selection criteria .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Polyneuropathy <END> was found in 97.5 % of AOA2 patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> in 96% , occasional <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> in 51 % , pyramidal signs in 20.5% , <START:PHENOTYPE> head tremor <END> in 14% , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> in 13.5% , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> in 12 .3% and <START:PHENOTYPE> chorea <END> in 9.5 % . No patient was lacking both peripheral neuropathy and cerebellar atrophy.
The age at onset and presence of occasional <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> were negatively correlated to the progression rate of the disease ( P = 0.03 and P = 0.009 , respectively) , whereas <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> was positively correlated to the progression rate ( P = 0.03 ) .
An increased AFP level as well as <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> seem to be stable in the course of the disease and to occur mostly at or before the onset of the disease .
One of the two patients with a normal AFP level at diagnosis had high AFP levels 4 years later , while the other had borderline levels .
The probability of missing AOA2 diagnosis , in case of sequencing senataxin gene only in non-Friedreich ataxia non-ataxia-telangiectasia ataxic patients with AFP level > or =7 microg/l , is 0.23% and the probability for a non-Friedreich ataxia non-ataxia-telangiectasia ataxic patient to be affected with AOA2 with AFP levels > or =7 microg/l is 46 % .
Therefore , selection of patients with an AFP level above 7 microg/l for senataxin gene sequencing is a good strategy for AOA2 diagnosis .
Pyramidal signs and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> were more frequent and disease was less severe with missense mutations in the helicase domain of senataxin gene than with missense mutations out of helicase domain and deletion and nonsense mutations ( P = 0.001 , P = 0.008 and P = 0.01 , respectively ) .
The lack of pyramidal signs in most patients may be explained by masking due to severe motor neuropathy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> ( MELAS ) : adolescent onset with severe cerebral edema .
A 19-year-old woman with long-standing <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral cataracts <END> and mild clumsiness , presented with acute focal edema in the left temperoparieto-occipital area which required surgical decompression as a life-saving measure .
Investigation revealed a persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidemia <END> and evidence of many ragged red fibres in a skeletal muscle biopsy specimen , suggesting a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> ( MELAS ) syndrome .
The patient developed two further <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> over a short period .
One sibling died at the age of 14 years with a progressive neurological illness characterised by seizures , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , ataxia , myoclonus and <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive dementia <END> .
The diagnosis of MELAS syndrome should be considered in young people presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> that fail to conform to a given vascular territory , particularly if they have long-standing minor neurological abnormalities or a family history of obscure early onset neurological disease .
The different clinical pictures in the two affected siblings in this family suggest that MELAS syndrome is part of a spectrum of inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> cytopathies rather than a discrete disease entity .
Cardiac involvement in <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> : specific myocardiopathy or consequence of <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic hypertension <END> ?
To evaluate the relative contributions of past or present GH hypersecretion and of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> to the cardiac abnormalities present in <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> , we have studied the serum GH and insulin-like growth factor I concentrations , systolic and diastolic blood pressures , and morphological and functional cardiac indexes as measured by echocardiography-Doppler , in 39 patients with active or cured <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> , 16 hypertensive controls , and 17 normotensive controls .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertension <END> was present in 42.8 % of patients with active <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> and in 28.0% of patients in which <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> was cured .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertension <END> was independently related to an increase in indexes of cardiac morphology ( left ventricular mass , left ventricular posterior wall thickness , interventricular septum thickness , relative wall thickness with respect to the diastolic diameter of the left ventricle , and left atrial end-systolic diameter ) , systolic function ( stroke volume , fractional shortening , and end-systolic stress ) , and diastolic function ( isovolumic relaxation time and maximal late diastolic flow velocity ) and to a reduction in the early to late maximal diastolic flow velocity ratio .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Acromegaly <END> was related to an increase in left ventricular mass , stroke volume , cardiac output , and isovolumic relaxation time , which were independent from the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
End-systolic stress was reduced by <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> .
In the five patients in which active <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> was successfully treated , left ventricular mass and left ventricular posterior wall thickness were reduced 1 yr later .
In conclusion , the asymptomatic morphological and functional cardiac abnormalities present in acromegalic patients are independently related to <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , pointing to the existence to a specific acromegalic myocardiopathy that might be aggravated by the coexistence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
Premature <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> associated with monogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> .
The common <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> syndrome , with obesity , <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslipidemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperglycemia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , is associated with increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> .
Early <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> in rare monogenic forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , however , has not been extensively documented .
Cardiovascular end points were thus evaluated in subjects with Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy ( FPLD ) due to mutations at LMNA codon 482 .
FPLD subjects >/=35 years old were stratified by genotype for either the LMNA R482Q or R482W mutation .
Twenty-three subjects were heterozygous mutation carriers , and 17 were R482/R482 homozygous family control subjects .
All LMNA mutation carriers had FPLD with <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> .
In addition , LMNA mutation carriers had significantly more type 2 diabetes , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslipidemia <END> than normal family control subjects .
Eight LMNA mutation carriers had coronary heart disease ( CHD) , compared with 1 normal control subject ( OR 5 .9 , 95 % CI 1.2 to 30.2 ) .
Six LMNA mutation carriers had CHD end points before age 55 years , and 4 of these , all women , had been hospitalized for CABG surgery between the ages of 35 and 54 years .
Rare LMNA mutations that underlie FPLD with <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> are also associated with early CHD , notably in women .
This suggests that abnormalities of the nuclear envelope can result in a phenotype that recapitulates most of the important attributes of the common <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> syndrome , including accelerated cardiovascular disease .
FPLD thus appears to be an appropriate human monogenic model for the common <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> syndrome .
A common MUC5B promoter polymorphism and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
The mutations that have been implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> account for only a small proportion of the population risk .
Using a genomewide linkage scan , we detected linkage between idiopathic interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> and a 3.4-Mb region of chromosome 11p15 in 82 families .
We then evaluated genetic variation in this region in gel-forming mucin genes expressed in the lung among 83 subjects with familial interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> , 492 subjects with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> , and 322 controls .
MUC5B expression was assessed in lung tissue .
Linkage and fine mapping were used to identify a region of interest on the p-terminus of chromosome 11 that included gel-forming mucin genes .
The minor-allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rs3570595 0 , located 3 kb upstream of the MUC5B transcription start site , was present at a frequency of 34% among subjects with familial interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> , 38 % among subjects with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> , and 9% among controls ( allelic association with familial interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> , P=1.2Ã—10( -15 ) ; allelic association with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> , P=2.5 Ã—10( -37) ) .
The odds ratios for disease among subjects who were heterozygous and those who were homozygous for the minor allele of this SNP were 6.8 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI] , 3.9 to 12.0 ) and 20.8 ( 95 % CI , 3.8 to 113.7) , respectively , for familial interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> and 9. 0 ( 95 % CI , 6.2 to 13.1 ) and 21.8 ( 95 % CI , 5 .1 to 93.5 ) , respectively , for idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
MUC5B expression in the lung was 14 .1 times as high in subjects who had idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> as in those who did not ( P< 0.001 ) .
The variant allele of rs35705950 was associated with up-regulation in MUC5B expression in the lung in unaffected subjects ( expression was 37. 4 times as high as in unaffected subjects homozygous for the wild-type allele , P< 0.001 ) .
MUC5B protein was expressed in lesions of idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
A common polymorphism in the promoter of MUC5B is associated with familial interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> and idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
Our findings suggest that dysregulated MUC5B expression in the lung may be involved in the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .

The rational clinical examination .
Does this patient have <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> ?
The association between <START:PHENOTYPE> digital clubbing <END> and a host of diseases has been recognized since the time of Hippocrates .
Although the features of advanced <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> are familiar to most clinicians , the presence of early <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> is often a source of debate .
To perform a systematic review of the literature for information on the precision and accuracy of clinical examination for <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> .
The MEDLINE database from January 1966 to April 1999 was searched for English-language articles related to <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> .
Bibliographies of all retrieved articles and of standard textbooks of physical diagnosis were also searched .
Studies selected for data extraction were those in which quantitative or qualitative assessment for <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> was described in a series of patients .
Sixteen studies met these criteria and were included in the final analysis .
Data were extracted by both authors , who independently reviewed and appraised the quality of each article .
Data extracted included quantitative indices for distinguishing clubbed from normal digits , precision of clinical examination for <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> , and accuracy of <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> as a marker of selected diseases .
The profile angle , hyponychial angle , and phalangeal depth ratio can be used as quantitative indices to assist in identifying <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> .
In individuals without <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> , values for these indices do not exceed 176 degrees , 192 degrees , and 1.0 , respectively .
When clinicians make a global assessment of <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> at the bedside , interobserver agreement is variable , with kappa values ranging between 0.39 and 0.90 . Because of the lack of an objective diagnostic criterion standard , accuracy of physical examination for <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> is difficult to determine .
The accuracy of <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> as a marker of specific underlying disease has been determined for lung cancer ( likelihood ratio , 3.9 with phalangeal depth ratio in excess of 1.0 ) and for inflammatory bowel disease ( likelihood ratio , 2.8 and 3.7 for active Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis , respectively , if <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> is present ) .
We recommend use of the profile angle and phalangeal depth ratio as quantitative indices in identifying <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> .
Clinical judgment must be exercised in determining the extent of further evaluation for underlying disease when these values exceed 180 degrees and 1.0 , respectively .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperthyroidism <END> in McCune-Albright syndrome with a review of thyroid abnormalities sixty years after the first report .
We present a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> associated with McCune-Albright syndrome ( MAS ) .
MAS is a sporadic genetic disease characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> polyostotic fibrous dysplasia <END> , cafe au lait cutaneous spots and endocrinopathies ( peripheral <START:PHENOTYPE> precocious puberty <END> , thyroidopathies , <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> , etc. ) .
It is caused by an activating mutation of the gene for the Gs alpha membrane-associated protein , which mediates the thyrotropin ( TSH)-induced and other hormone-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase .
A 13-month-old girl was diagnosed with MAS .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Precocious puberty <END> was treated initially with testolactone and later with oophorectomy .
Subclinical <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> was detected biochemically at birth , and 10 months later , it became clinically evident , albeit mild , with absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> .
A concomitant liver dysfunction precluded treatment with thionamides and she was sporadically treated with beta-blockers .
The combination of increased free thyroxine ( T4 ) and triiodothyronine ( T3 ) with low plasma thyrotropin ( TSH ) levels in the absence of thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies persisted until the age of 6 years , when she was referred to our unit .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperthyroidism <END> was then clinically evident with cardiac hyperactivity , and it was cured with administration of radioiodine ( 131I ) .
Thyroid disease is the second most common endocrinopathy associated with MAS , and since 1936 , 63 cases of thyroidopathies have been described , including 19 nodular ( 14 with and 5 without <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> ) and 23 diffuse (2 0 with and 3 without <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> ) goiters , and 18 cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> without <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> .
The previously described somatic activating mutation of the gs alpha gene in the ovaries , the liver and the peripheral blood of our patient , in the absence of stigmata , autoimmunity might be incriminated for the secretory and mitotic activation of the thyroid gland .
We suggest the treatment of choice of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> in MAS patients should be 131I administration because : (a ) <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> is very likely to recur after withdrawal of antithyroid medication ; (b ) the morbidity of these patients is elevated ; (c ) oophorectomized patients do not need to be advised to avoid procreation during the months after 131I administration ; and (d ) finally , even in the usual cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> in childhood , 131I treatment is becoming more popular worldwide .
Analysis of the phenotypic abnormalities in lymphoedema-distichiasis syndrome in 74 patients with FOXC2 mutations or linkage to 16q24.
Lymphoedema-distichiasis syndrome ( LD ) ( OMIM 153400 ) is a rare , primary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> of pubertal onset , associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> .
Causative mutations have now been described in FOXC2 , a forkhead transcription factor gene .
Numerous clinical associations have been reported with this condition , including congenital heart disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> varicose veins <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and spinal extradural cysts .
We report clinical findings in 74 affected subjects from 18 families and six isolated cases .
All of them were shown to have mutations in FOXC2 with the exception of one family who had two affected subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> and linkage consistent with the 16q24 locus .
The presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> was highly penetrant .
Males had an earlier onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> and a significantly increased risk of complications .
Lymphatic imaging confirmed the earlier suggestion that LD is associated with a normal or increased number of lymphatic vessels rather than the hypoplasia or aplasia seen in other forms of primary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Distichiasis <END> was 94.2% penetrant , but not always symptomatic .
Associated findings included <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> ( 31% ) , congenital heart disease ( 6.8% ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ( 4% ) . Other than <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> , the most commonly occurring anomaly was <START:PHENOTYPE> varicose veins <END> of early onset ( 49% ) .
This has not been previously reported and suggests a possible developmental role for FOXC2 in both venous and lymphatic systems .
This is the first gene that has been implicated in the aetiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> varicose veins <END> .
Unlike previous publications , the thorough clinical characterisation of our patients permits more accurate prediction of various phenotypic abnormalities likely to manifest in subjects with FOXC2 mutations .
Worldwide variation in prevalence of symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , and atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> : ISAAC .
The International Study of <START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> and Allergies in Childhood ( ISAAC ) Steering Committee .
Systematic international comparisons of the prevalences of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and other allergic disorders in children are needed for better understanding of their global epidemiology , to generate new hypotheses , and to assess existing hypotheses of possible causes .
We investigated worldwide prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , and atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> .
We studied 463 ,801 children aged 13-14 years in 155 collaborating centres in 56 countries .
Children self-reported , through one-page questionnaires , symptoms of these three atopic disorders .
In 99 centres in 42 countries , a video <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> questionnaire was also used for 304 ,796 children .
We found differences of between 20-fold and 60-fold between centres in the prevalence of symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , and atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> , with four-fold to 12-fold variations between the 10th and 90th percentiles for the different disorders .
For <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> symptoms , the highest 12-month prevalences were from centres in the UK , Australia , New Zealand , and Republic of Ireland , followed by most centres in North , Central , and South America ; the lowest prevalences were from centres in several Eastern European countries , Indonesia , Greece , China , Taiwan , Uzbekistan , India , and Ethiopia .
For allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , the centres with the highest prevalences were scattered across the world .
The centres with the lowest prevalences were similar to those for <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> symptoms .
For atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> , the highest prevalences came from scattered centres , including some from Scandinavia and Africa that were not among centres with the highest <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> prevalences ; the lowest prevalence rates of atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> were similar in centres , as for <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> symptoms .
The variation in the prevalences of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , and atopic-eczema symptoms is striking between different centres throughout the world .
These findings will form the basis of further studies to investigate factors that potentially lead to these international patterns .
Subtelomeric deletions of chromosome 6p : molecular and cytogenetic characterization of three new cases with phenotypic overlap with Ritscher-Schinzel ( 3C ) syndrome .
We have identified six children in three families with subtelomeric deletions of 6p25 and a recognizable phenotype consisting of ptosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> posterior embryotoxon <END> , optic nerve abnormalities , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> patent ductus arteriosus <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
There is considerable clinical overlap between these children and individuals with the Ritscher-Schinzel ( or cranio-cerebello-cardiac ( 3C) ) syndrome ( OMIM #220210 ) .
Clinical features of 3C syndrome include craniofacial anomalies ( <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , prominent forehead and occiput , foramina parietalia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular colobomas <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , narrow or <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> ) , cerebellar malformations ( variable manifestations of a <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> with moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ) , and cardiac defects ( primarily septal defects ) .
Since the original report , over 25 patients with 3C syndrome have been reported .
Recessive inheritance has been postulated based on recurrence in siblings born to unaffected parents and parental consanguinity in two familial cases .
Molecular and cytogenetic mapping of the 6p deletions in these three families with subtelomeric deletions of chromosome 6p have defined a 1.3 Mb minimally deleted critical region .
To determine if 6p deletions are common in 3C syndrome , we analyzed seven unrelated individuals with 3C syndrome for deletions of this region .
Three forkhead genes ( FOXF1 and FOXQ1 from within the critical region , and FOXC1 proximal to this region ) were evaluated as potential candidate disease genes for this disorder .
No deletions or disease-causing mutations were identified .
Familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
Mild expression of the gene in heterozygotes and severe expression in homozygotes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> was found in a kindred with neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> primary hyperparathyroidism <END> , previously judged to be an autosomal recessive trait .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> was documented in eight members representing three generations .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> was documented at an age as early as one week .
In seven adults presumed to be heterozygotes , urinary calcium levels were in the same range as for familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
An additional adult member ( who previously underwent parathyroidectomy for neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> primary hyperparathyroidism <END> ) showed an abnormality in renal clearance of calcium and sodium characteristic of combined familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> and surgical hypoparathyroidism .
Parathyroidectomy in three hypercalcemic members did not cause normocalcemia .
Unlike other kindreds with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> in whom <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> is consistent over time and moderate in heterozygotes , this kindred was characterized by heterozygotes showing <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> that was intermittent and mild .
The consanguineous parents of the two previously described severely affected neonates were judged to be heterozygotes for familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
In conclusion , (1 ) a gene presenting as familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> can be expressed as <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> that is intermittent and very mild in heterozygotes ; (2 ) such a gene can cause neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> primary hyperparathyroidism <END> in homozygotes .
Significant overlap and possible identity of <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> capillary malformation and <START:PHENOTYPE> megalencephaly <END> polymicrogyria-polydactyly <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> syndromes .
We report on three patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> , and additional anomalies seen in <START:PHENOTYPE> megalencephaly <END> polymicrogyria-polydactyly <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( MPPH ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> capillary malformation ( MCM ) syndromes .
Based on their characteristic brain malformations they were originally diagnosed with MPPH .
In one patient the phenotype evolved during early infancy , and ultimately resulted in a diagnosis of MCM .
A second was prenatally diagnosed with MPPH , but postnatally visualized capillary malformations led to a diagnosis of MCM .
In a third , the original MPPH diagnosis was reconsidered after a critical review revealed additional subtle findings suggestive of MCM . Characteristic brain malformations are thought to distinguish between MPPH with perisylvian <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> , and MCM with <START:PHENOTYPE> megalencephaly <END> with Chiari 1 malformation . However , <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> was reported in a significant number of patients with MCM .
Conversely , upon review of imaging studies of patients with MPPH , we noted progressive crowding of the posterior fossa and acquired tonsillar herniation , a process deemed characteristic for MCM .
Thus , neither <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> nor acquired tonsillar herniation are distinguishing features , and occur in both disorders .
In addition to brain abnormalities , shared findings include <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> , coarse facial features and <START:PHENOTYPE> postaxial polydactyly <END> .
Facial nevus flammeus and <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis marmorata <END> are most noticeable in infancy , and ligamentous laxity and redundant soft tissue are somewhat subjective findings .
While asymmetric <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> is considered typical for MCM , it is not universally present .
These variable and subtle findings can be identified in patients with MPPH .
We propose that MPPH and MCM may not represent distinct entities and that the term MPPH-CM syndrome be used to describe this spectrum .
A syndrome of hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , delayed and dysharmonic skeletal maturation , and congenital fibre type disproportion .
Three unrelated Puerto Rican boys , ranging in age from 3 to 4 years , had marked , central , non-progressive hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic constipation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> severe psychomotor retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> or abnormal electroencephalograph or both , <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal dermatoglyphics <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> , dysharmonic skeletal maturation , and preponderance and larger size of type 2 muscle fibres .
Additional findings included narrow , <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent nasal root <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> distended abdomen <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> drooling <END> from <START:PHENOTYPE> open mouth <END> .
Two of the three patients also had <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tapered fingers <END> .
Birth weight , postnatal physical growth , and head size were average .
Family and gestational histories and laboratory evaluations were normal .
The combination of features observed in the three boys appears to be distinct and to represent a new syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> malformation complexes explained by abnormal embryonic body curvature .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> malformation complexes characteristically have severe cardiovascular defects and visceral heterotaxy .
We examined the hypothesis that the conditions may arise from an altered timing of development of embryonic body curvature : delayed in <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> , accelerated in <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> .
The morphologic features of the 25 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and 15 with <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> autopsied at The Johns Hopkins Hospital were determined .
The time of appearance of various morphologic features and the evolution of body curvature was studied in 351 staged serially sectioned human embryos of The Carnegie Embryological Collection .
All <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> patients had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> atrioventricular canal <END> malformations .
Bilateral trilobed lungs were found in 12 patients .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> patients had severe interatrial septal defects in 10 patients ; but <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defects <END> in only six .
Bilateral bilobed lungs were seen in five patients .
Comparison of the time of appearance of anatomic structures in normal embryos with the observed malformations suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> complexes originate in stages 13 to 15 .
The observations are consistent with the concept that the malformations in <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> can be explained by minor alterations in the sequence of development of embryonic body curvature relative to organ maturation .
Lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> with contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> and soft tissue bleeding due to a novel homozygous fibulin-4 gene mutation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cutis laxa <END> is characterised by redundant , inelastic skin with deep wrinkling and additional variable systemic involvement .
Mutations in fibulin-4 ( EFEMP2 ) and fibulin-5 ( FBLN5 ) were described to be causative for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> type 1 in a few families each .
The female patient was born to healthy consanguineous parents .
Pregnancy was remarkable for <START:PHENOTYPE> fetal overgrowth <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> oligohydramnios <END> .
The newborn girl showed extreme <START:PHENOTYPE> bradycardia <END> and died perinatally .
Apart from <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> of hands and feet with contractures of the third to fifth finger , medial rotation of feet , spina bifida of the os sacrum , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and facial dysmorphism were noted .
Autopsy showed collapsed lungs with hypoplastic diaphragm and signs of cervical soft tissue bleedings due to fragility of vessels .
Histologic examination showed fragmentation of elastic fibres with formation of cystic cavities in the medial layer of the aorta and central lung vessels .
Sequencing of the elastin , fibulin-4 and fibulin-5 genes revealed a homozygous missense mutation ( p.Cys267Tyr ) in the fibulin-4 gene in the patient .
Our observation increases the number of cases with fibulin-4 mutations to three and extends the phenotypic spectrum of fibulin-4 mutations by <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> .
Is <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> associated with oculocutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> a " coincidence syndrome " ?
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hearing impairment <END> is frequently found associated with pigmentary disorders in many syndromes .
However , total oculocutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> ( OCA ) associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> has been described only once , by Ziprkowski and Adam ( Arch Dermatol 89:151 -155 , 1964 ) in an inbred family .
A syndrome associating <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and OCA was suggested by the authors , but two separate recessive genes segregating in this inbred group were also proposed later by Fraser ( OMIM # 220900 ) .
Combined <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and total OCA were also observed by us in a family originally reported to be nonconsanguineous but in which haplotyping showed evidence of a common ancestry : the proband was affected by both diseases , one of his sisters had only OCA and another sister had only <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
Both the proband and his deaf sister were found to be homozygotes for the 35delG mutation ( GJB2 gene) , the most frequent cause of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
Linkage analysis with markers close to the four known OCA loci excluded linkage to OCA1 , OCA2 , and OCA3 , and homozygosity in markers near OCA4 locus was observed .
Sequencing of the corresponding gene ( MATP ) revealed a c.1121delT mutation , which leads to a stop codon at position 397 ( L374fsX397 ) .
Clearly , the combined occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> in this pedigree was due to mutations in two different genes , showing <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
We speculate that the putative syndrome reported by Ziprkowski and Adam might have resulted from the co-occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> in the same pedigree , as suggested by Fraser .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> : phenotypic differences in genetically defined subtypes ?
Seventy-seven families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> were analyzed for the CAG repeat expansions causing spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( SCA ) types 1 , 2 , 3 , and 6 .
The SCA1 mutation accounted for 9% , SCA2 for 10% , SCA3 for 42% , and SCA6 for 22% of German <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> families .
Seven of 27 SCA6 patients had no family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
Age at onset correlated inversely with repeat length in all subtypes .
Yet the average effect of one CAG unit on onset age was different for each SCA subtype .
We compared clinical , electrophysiological , and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) findings to identify phenotypic characteristics of genetically defined SCA subtypes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Slow saccades <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyporeflexia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> action tremor <END> proposed SCA2 .
SCA3 patients frequently developed <START:PHENOTYPE> diplopia <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> or pronounced peripheral neuropathy , and impaired temperature discrimination , apart from <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
SCA6 presented with a predominantly cerebellar syndrome and patients often had onset after 55 years of age .
SCA1 was characterized by markedly prolonged peripheral and central motor conduction times in motor evoked potentials .
MRI scans showed pontine and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> in SCA1 and SCA2 .
In SCA3 , enlargement of the fourth ventricle was the main sequel of atrophy.
SCA6 presented with pure <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> on MRI . However , overlap between the four SCA subtypes was broad .
Effect of family history , body-fat distribution , and reproductive factors on the risk of postmenopausal <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
A family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> reflects shared cultural factors , genetic predisposition , or both .
There is evidence that the estimated risk associated with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> increases multiplicatively in combination with other risk factors .
We examined the combined effect of family history and anthropometric and reproductive factors on the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in postmenopausal women .
Using data from a prospective cohort study , we studied 37 ,105 women 55 to 69 years of age to determine whether known risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> are modified by a reported family history at the time of entry into the study .
During the first 4 years of follow-up , 493 new breast cancers were diagnosed .
The association of the waist-to-hip ratio ( the circumference of the waist divided by that of the hips ) with the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> was limited predominantly to women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> ; the age-adjusted relative risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> for the women above the fourth quintile for waist-to-hip ratio as compared with those below the first quintile was 3.2 in women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and 1.2 for women without such a family history .
An interaction was observed between a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and the number of live-born children ; the protective effect of higher parity was observed primarily among women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Similarly , the age-adjusted relative risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> associated with a late age at first pregnancy ( i .e. , greater than or equal to 30 years ) was 5.8 for women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and 2.0 for women without such a family history .
The increase in the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> associated with a high waist-to-hip ratio , low parity , or greater age at first pregnancy is more pronounced among women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
These findings suggest etiologic differences between familial <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and the sporadic form .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lissencephaly <END> has been described in over 10 distinct malformation syndromes .
Recently , we have recognized 5 children from four unrelated families with an almost identical disorder comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with a posterior-to-anterior gradient and only moderate increase in thickness of the cortex , <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> , neonatal-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , hypothalamic dysfunction including deficient temperature regulation , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> in genotypic males .
Our observation of 5 affected males in one of these families is consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> pattern of inheritance .
However , it differs in many regards from the <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked form <END> of isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> sequence that is associated with mutations of the XLIS ( DCX ) gene .
Therefore , we propose that this disorder comprises a new <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> malformation syndrome , which we refer to as <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> ( XLA-G ) .

A new <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> transfer RNAPro gene mutation associated with myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> and other neurological features .
Pathogenic mutations of the human <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome are associated with well-characterized , progressive neurological syndromes , with mutations in the transfer RNA genes being particularly prominent .
To describe a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> transfer RNA( Pro ) gene mutation in a woman with a myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with ragged-red fibers-like disease .
Design , Setting , and Patient Case report of a 49-year-old woman presenting with a myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with ragged-red fibers-like disease comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonic jerks <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , and proximal <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> .
Histochemical analysis of a muscle biopsy revealed numerous cytochrome-c oxidase-deficient , <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> , while biochemical studies indicated decreased activity of respiratory chain complex I . Molecular investigation of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA revealed a new heteroplasmic mutation in the TpsiC stem of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> transfer RNA( Pro ) gene that segregated with cytochrome-c oxidase deficiency in single muscle fibers .
Our case serves to illustrate the ever-evolving phenotypic spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA disease and the importance of performing comprehensive <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genetic studies in the absence of common <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations .
Mutations in the gene encoding neutrophil elastase in congenital and cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> and cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> are disorders of neutrophil production predisposing patients to <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent bacterial infections <END> .
Recently the locus for autosomal dominant cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> was mapped to chromosome 19p13.3 , and this disease is now attributable to mutations of the gene encoding neutrophil elastase ( the ELA2 gene ) .
The authors hypothesized that congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is also due to mutations of neutrophil elastase .
Patients with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , or Shwachman-Diamond syndrome were referred to the Severe Chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> Neutropenia <END> International Registry .
Referring physicians provided hematologic and clinical data .
Mutational analysis was performed by sequencing polymerase chain reaction ( PCR )-amplified genomic DNA for each of the 5 exons of the neutrophil ELA2 gene and 20 bases of the flanking regions .
RNA from bone marrow mononuclear cells was used to determine if the affected patients expressed both the normal and the abnormal transcript .
Twenty-two of 25 patients with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> had 18 different heterozygous mutations .
Four of 4 patients with cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> and 0 of 3 patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome had mutations .
For 5 patients with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> having mutations predicted to alter RNA splicing or transcript structure , reverse transcriptase-PCR showed expression of both normal and abnormal transcripts .
In cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , the mutations appeared to cluster near the active site of the molecule , whereas the opposite face was predominantly affected by the mutations found in congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
This study indicates that mutations of the gene encoding neutrophil elastase are probably the most common cause for severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> as well as the cause for sporadic and autosomal dominant cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in predicting ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> in patients with cerebrovascular disease .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> or transient ischemic attack are at high risk of another <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> , and there is need for improved strategies to predict recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
To assess the prognostic value of levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( sVCAM-1 ) , N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP) , C-reactive protein , homocysteine , renin , and lipids and lipoprotein particle concentration and size in patients with previous <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> or transient ischemic attack .
A nested case-control study of participants of the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> Stroke <END> Study was performed .
The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> Stroke <END> Study was a placebo-controlled trial of a perindopril erbumine-based , blood pressure-lowering regimen that reduced ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> risk by 24% among individuals with previous <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> or transient ischemic attack .
Each of 252 patients who experienced ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> during a mean follow-up of 3.9 years was matched to 1 to 3 control patients .
Matching variables were age , sex , treatment allocated , region , and most recent qualifying event at randomization . Risk of ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> predicted by baseline levels of sVCAM-1 , NT-proBNP , C-reactive protein , homocysteine , renin , and lipids and lipoprotein particle concentration and size .
Levels of sVCAM-1 and NT-proBNP predicted recurrent ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
The odds ratio for patients in the highest , as compared with the lowest , quarter was 2.24 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.35-3.73 ) for sVCAM-1 level and 1.62 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.98-2.69 ) for NT-proBNP level , after adjustment for matching and other risk factors .
Patients in the highest quarters for both sVCAM-1 and NT-proBNP levels had 3.6 times the risk of recurrent ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> compared with patients in the lowest quarters for both biologic markers .
Level of sVCAM-1 was similarly predictive of ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> in patients allocated to placebo and perindopril-based therapy .
Baseline plasma levels of C-reactive protein , homocysteine , renin , and lipids and lipoprotein particle concentration and size did not predict recurrent ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> risk .
Measurement of sVCAM-1 and NT-proBNP levels provides prognostic information for recurrent ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> beyond traditional risk factors .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Polyhydramnios <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> fetal overgrowth <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> : prenatal ultrasound findings of Costello syndrome .
Costello syndrome is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome consisting of dysmorphic facies , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Complications include <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> , and benign and malignant tumors .
This report describes a new case of Costello syndrome in a preterm infant born at 27 weeks gestation and diagnosed with Costello syndrome at 7 weeks of life who died at 6 months of age due to cardiac and pulmonary complications .
In addition , data were compiled from parent surveys including growth parameters on 16 infants who were subsequently diagnosed with Costello syndrome and had mutation confirmation .
The most common prenatal findings in the literature and in this cohort were <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> fetal overgrowth <END> with relative <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> .
Based on this study , ultrasound identification of <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> in the context of prenatal <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> , especially with relative <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , needs to raise the possibility of a diagnosis of Costello syndrome in the fetus because of the life-threatening cardiac complications that may occur early in the newborn period .
A new Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with craniofacial characteristics , <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple congenital contractures <END> , progressive joint and skin laxity , and multisystem fragility-related manifestations .
We previously described two unrelated patients showing characteristic facial and skeletal features , overlapping with the kyphoscoliosis type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ( EDS ) but without lysyl hydroxylase deficiency [Kosho et al . (2005 ) Am J Med Genet Part A 138 A:282-287 ] .
After observations of them over time and encounter with four additional unrelated patients , we have concluded that they represent a new clinically recognizable type of EDS with distinct craniofacial characteristics , <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple congenital contractures <END> , progressive joint and skin laxity , and multisystem fragility-related manifestations .
The patients exhibited strikingly similar features according to their age : craniofacial , <START:PHENOTYPE> large fontanelle <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , short and <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , short nose with hypoplastic columella , low-set and rotated ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , thin vermilion of the upper lip , small mouth , and micro-retrognathia in infancy ; slender and asymmetric face with protruding jaw from adolescence ; skeletal , congenital contractures of fingers , wrists , and hips , and <START:PHENOTYPE> talipes equinovarus <END> with anomalous insertions of flexor muscles ; progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> dislocations <END> ; slender and/or cylindrical fingers and progressive talipes valgus and cavum or planus , with diaphyseal narrowing of phalanges , metacarpals , and metatarsals ; pectus deformities ; <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> or kyphoscoliosis with decreased physiological curvatures of thoracic spines and tall vertebrae ; cutaneous , progressive hyperextensibility , <START:PHENOTYPE> bruisability <END> , and fragility with atrophic scars ; fine palmar creases in childhood to acrogeria-like prominent wrinkles in adulthood , recurrent subcutaneous infections with fistula formation ; cardiovascular , cardiac valve abnormalities , recurrent large subcutaneous hematomas from childhood ; gastrointestinal , <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> , diverticula perforation ; respiratory , ( hemo )pneumothorax ; and ophthalmological , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , refractive errors .

Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , Down syndrome-like facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> : two additional cases .
An apparently new syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , Down syndrome-like facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> was described by Gripp et al . 1996 .
The authors reported on two unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , distinctive facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and skeletal changes .
We report on two additional patients with findings most similar to the reported patients by Gripp et al . 1996 , including <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral congenital cataracts <END> , hearing loss , craniofacial abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , skeletal abnormalities , and developmental delay .
Both of the patients reported herein had chromosome microarray analysis , which showed normal results in Patient 2 but abnormal results in Patient 1 and his mother who both had a chromosome 11q25 subtelomere deletion .
Patient 1 and his mother 's findings are atypical for the common findings reported in Jacobsen syndrome ( 11 q terminal deletion syndrome ) , and consistent with the patients reported by Gripp et al . 1996 .
The etiology for these cases has been unknown .
The microarray results on Patient 1 suggest that the other patients with findings of developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , and similar craniofacial features may have either a microdeletion of chromosome 11q terminal region or haploinsufficiency of a gene localized to this region .

Families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> brachydactyly type E , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
Rare , monogenic forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> may give insight into novel mechanisms relevant to essential <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> with brachydactyly has been documented in a single Turkish kindred ; the gene was mapped to chromosome 12p. To describe the molecular genetics of additional families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly .
Case series .
Tertiary care medical centers .
An 11-member Canadian family and a 7-member U.S . family , neither of Turkish background , with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and type E brachydactyly .
Clinical evaluation , genotyping , and haplotype analyses .
The mode of inheritance , the type E brachydactyly , and the propensity for stroke were consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> with brachydactyly .
The same markers on chromosome 12p cosegregated with the phenotype in the families .
A haplotype analysis strongly supported the conclusion that these families have a molecular defect in the same gene .
The syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly is not confined to patients of Turkish origin .
All persons with brachydactyly should have their blood pressure measured , and the syndrome should be considered if <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> is found .
MICRO syndrome : an entity distinct from COFS syndrome .
Children born with the findings of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , cataracts and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> can result not only from a prenatal viral infection , but also from an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Mendelian disorders .
We present three pairs of affected siblings with MICRO syndrome , who were born with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , and cataracts .
MICRO syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome consisting of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , cortical dysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , cataracts , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , hypotonic diplegia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogenitalism <END> .
At birth , MICRO syndrome resembles Cerebro-Oculo-Facio-Skeletal ( COFS ) syndrome , but it differs in the lack of the rapidly progressive neurologic features leading to severe brain atrophy with calcifications .
Patients with MICRO syndrome manifest frontal cortical dysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of the corpus callosum <END> , cortical blindness with <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , profound <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and progressive joint contractures with growth failure .
COFS syndrome shares also many clinical and cellular similarities with Cockayne syndrome ( CS) , and cultured cells in both conditions demonstrate hypersensitivity to ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation due to impaired nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) .
NER studies in cultured fibroblasts from MICRO patients give normal results , so MICRO syndrome should be considered in children with features resembling COFS syndrome and CS , but who have normal NER . MICRO should be distinguished from other similar clinical disorders with normal NER by the presence of significant visual impairment and cortical blindness despite early surgery for <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , frontal polymicrogyria , <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> , and cortical atrophy by MRI .

[ Juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> : a new syndrome ] .
Predisposition is responsible for approximately 5 0 % of age-related <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
Investigation of inherited forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> provides the opportunity to identify the genes that may play a role in age-related <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> as well .
We describe the phenotype of a Swiss family with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> .
11 of 17 family members in three generations underwent ophthalmic assessment and urine analysis .
Medical records or questionnaires were evaluated in the remaining six cases . Eleven family members had progressive juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> .
Eight affected members available for clinical examination had bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , not associated with microphthalmos .
Furthermore , renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> was demonstrated in six of these persons .
The mode of inheritance is autosomal-dominant .
We have defined a new syndrome , consisting of the association of juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> .
The pattern of inheritance is autosomal-dominant .
Genotyping is ongoing .
Location and type of mutation in the LIS1 gene do not predict phenotypic severity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lissencephaly <END> is a neuronal migration disorder leading to absent or reduced gyration and a broadened but poorly organized cortex .
The most common form of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> is isolated , referred as classic or type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> is mostly associated with a heterozygous deletion of the entire LIS1 gene , whereas intragenic heterozygous LIS1 mutations or hemizygous DCX mutations in males are less common .
Eighteen unrelated patients with type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> were clinically and genetically assessed .
In addition , patients with subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> ( n = 1 ) or <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> ( n = 2 ) were included .
Fourteen new and seven previously described LIS1 mutations were identified .
We observed nine truncating mutations ( nonsense , n = 2 ; frameshift , n = 7) , six splice site mutations , five missense mutations , and one in-frame deletion .
Somatic mosaicism was assumed in three patients with partial subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> in the occipital-parietal lobes or mild <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> .
We report three mutations in exon 11 , including a frameshift which extends the LIS1 protein , leading to type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> and illustrating the functional importance of the WD domains at the C terminus .
Furthermore , we present two patients with novel LIS1 mutations in exon 10 associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> type a . In contrast to previous reports , our data suggest that neither type nor position of intragenic mutations in the LIS1 gene allows an unambiguous prediction of the phenotypic severity .
Furthermore , patients presenting with mild cerebral malformations such as subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> should be considered for genetic analysis of the LIS1 gene .
Transient RLS during pregnancy is a risk factor for the chronic idiopathic form .
Pregnancy is a risk factor for transient <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> , which usually recovers during the postdelivery period .
The goal of the present survey is to investigate whether <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> during pregnancy represents a risk factor for later development of <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> .
A long-term follow-up study , planned as an extension of a previous survey on <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> during pregnancy , was carried out .
After a mean interval of 6.5 years , 207 parous women were contacted again to compare the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> among subjects who never experienced the symptoms with those who reported <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> during the previously investigated pregnancy .
Seventy-four women who experienced <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> during previous pregnancy , and 133 who did not , were included in the study .
The incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> was 56 % person/year in women who experienced the transient pregnancy <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> form , and 12 .6 % person/year in subjects who did not , with a significant 4-fold increased risk of developing chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> in women who presented <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs <END> in the previous pregnancy .
Considering further new pregnancies during the follow-up period , the <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs <END> symptoms reappeared in 58 % of the cases , while they emerged for the first time in only 3% of women who had never experienced <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> .
The transient pregnancy <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> form is a significant risk factor for the development of a future chronic idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> form , and for a new transient symptomatology in a future pregnancy .
ASPM mutations identified in patients with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Human <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( MCPH ) is a heterogeneous disorder with at least six genetic loci ( MCPH1-6) , with MCPH5 , caused by ASPM mutation , being the most common .
Despite the high prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with frequent <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> has been excluded from the ascertainment of MCPH .
Here , we report a pedigree with multiple affected individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
To identify the gene responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in this pedigree .
Clinical assessments of three patients and brain MRIs of two patients were obtained .
Genome-wide linkage screen with 10 k SNP microarray , fine mapping with microsatellite markers , and mutational analysis of the genomic DNA were performed on the pedigree .
We found that the family was linked to the MCPH5 locus on chromosome 1q31.2-q32 .1 .
We screened ASPM and identified a previously unreported nonsense mutation that introduced a premature stop codon in exon 18 of the ASPM gene .
We thus expand the clinical spectrum of ASPM mutations by showing that they can occur in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and that the history of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> alone should not necessarily preclude the diagnosis of primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome consisting of posterior <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> , retinitis pigmentosa , <START:PHENOTYPE> foveoschisis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic disc drusen <END> is caused by a MFRP gene mutation .
To describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of a new ophthalmic syndrome , which consists of posterior <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> , retinitis pigmentosa , <START:PHENOTYPE> foveoschisis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic disc drusen <END> , that segregates as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait in a family with four affected siblings .
The membrane-type frizzled-related protein ( MFRP ) and CEH10 homeodomain-containing homolog ( CHX10 ) genes , previously implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> forms of nanophthalmos/microphthalmos , were analyzed as candidate genes for this novel disease .
Complete ophthalmologic examinations were performed in four affected siblings and their parents .
Ophthalmologic manifestations , fundus photographs , ultrasonographic ( US ) assessment , electroretinography ( ERG) , fluorescein retinal angiography ( FA) , Goldmann kinetic perimetry ( GKP) , and optical coherence tomography ( OCT) , as well as mutational status of MFRP and CHX10 genes in genomic DNA .
In all affected siblings , ophthalmologic examination demonstrated normal horizontal corneal diameters and high hyperopia ; funduscopy , ERG , and FA evidenced a progressive retinal dystrophy compatible with retinitis pigmentosa ; A- and B-mode ultrasonography revealed decreased axial eye length and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic disc drusen <END> ; OCT showed localized macular retinoschisis .
MFRP molecular analysis disclosed a one base pair insertion in exon 5 ( c.498_499insC ) in all affected individuals , a mutation that predicts a truncated protein ( P165fsX198 ) .
Both parents were heterozygous for this mutation .
A distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ophthalmic syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> , retinitis pigmentosa , <START:PHENOTYPE> foveoschisis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic disc drusen <END> is described .
We demonstrated that this clinical association is caused by a mutation in MFRP , a gene previously implicated in isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> nanophthalmos <END> .
Our data indicate that defects in MFRP could be responsible for syndromic forms of microphthalmos/retinal degeneration and that this gene is necessary for photoreceptor maintenance .
High <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> and glaucoma susceptibility the Beijing Eye Study . To evaluate whether marked <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , compared with moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> and low <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , is associated with a higher prevalence of glaucomatous optic nerve damage .
Population-based cross-sectional study .
Four thousand four hundred thirty-nine of 5324 subjects 40 years or older were invited to participate ( response rate , 83.4% ) .
The group was stratified according to refractive error into high <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> > -8 diopters [D] ) , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( <-6 to -8 D) , moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( <-3 to -6 D) , low <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( <-0.5 to -3 D) , emmetropia ( - 0.5 to + <2 D) , and hyperopia ( > + 2 D ) subgroups .
Morphologic assessment of optic disc monoscopic photographs .
Morphologic optic disc parameters and intraocular pressure ( IOP ) .
For 4319 ( 97.3% ) subjects ( 8484 eyes) , optic disc photographs were evaluated .
Prevalence of glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy as defined by the glaucomatous optic nerve head appearance did not vary significantly ( P = 0.77 ; odds ratio [ OR] , 1.2 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI] , 0.38-3.81 ) between the highly myopic group and the group with marked <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> .
In both refractive groups combined , glaucoma frequency seemed to be higher ( P = 0.075 ; OR , 2.28 ; 95 % CI , 0.99-5.25 ) higher than in the group with moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ; it was significantly ( P = 0.001 ; OR , 3.5 ; 95 % CI , 1.71 -7.25 ) higher than in the group with low <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ; significantly ( P< 0.001 ; OR , 7.56 ; 95 % CI , 3.98-14 .35 ) higher than in the group with emmetropia ; and significantly ( P = 0.005 ; OR , 4.23; 95 % CI , 1.57-11 .45 ) higher than in the group with hyperopia .
Glaucoma frequency did not vary significantly between the hyperopic group and the emmetropic group ( P = 0.17 ) , the group with low <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( P = 0.83) , and the group with moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( P = 0.32 ) .
Intraocular pressure did not vary significantly ( P> 0.10 ) between any of the subgroups .
Similar results were obtained for the frequency of glaucoma defined as glaucomatous optic disc appearance and visual field defects .
In binary logistic regression analysis , presence of glaucoma was significantly associated with the myopic refractive error ( P< 0.001 ) , age ( P< 0.001 ) , and IOP ( P< 0.001 ) .
Marked to high <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> with a myopic refractive error exceeding -6 D may be a risk factor associated with glaucomatous optic neuropathy.
New RAB3GAP1 mutations in patients with Warburg Micro Syndrome from different ethnic backgrounds and a possible founder effect in the Danish .
Warburg Micro Syndrome is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , microcornia , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , cortical dysplasia , in particular <START:PHENOTYPE> corpus callosum hypoplasia <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic diplegia <END> , and hypogonadism .
We have found five new mutations in the RAB3GAP1 gene in seven patients with suspected Micro Syndrome from families with Turkish , Palestinian , Danish , and Guatemalan backgrounds .
A thorough clinical investigation of the patients has allowed the delineation of symptoms that are consistently present in the patients and may aid the differential diagnosis of Micro Syndrome for patients in the future .
All patients had postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , micropthalmia , microcornia , <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral congenital cataracts <END> , short palpebral fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and congenital hypotonia with subsequent spasticity .
Only one patient had <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> at birth , highlighting the fact that congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> is not a consistent feature of Micro syndrome .
Analysis of the brain magnetic resonance imagings ( MRIs ) revealed a consistent pattern of polymicrogyria in the frontal and parietal lobes , wide sylvian fissures , a thin <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic corpus callosum <END> , and increased subdural spaces .
All patients were homozygous for the mutations detected and all mutations were predicted to result in a truncated RAB3GAP1 protein .
The analysis of nine polymorphic markers flanking the RAB3GAP1 gene showed that the mutation c.141 0C> A ( p.Tyr470X) , for which a Danish patient was homozygous , occurred on a haplotype that is shared by the unrelated heterozygous parents of the patient .
This suggests a possible founder effect for this mutation in the Danish population .
Oto-facio-osseous-gonadal syndrome : a new form of syndromic deafness ?
In this study , we report on two brothers , born to consanguineous parents , with a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , low nasal root , hypoplastic alae and round tip to the nose , low-set <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow thorax <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> genu valgum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> wormian bones <END> , fusion of carpal bones , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfeet <END> .
This combination of anomalies appears to be a previously undescribed syndrome , with probable <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> DNA deletions in <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> and Kearns-Say re syndrome .
We investigated the correlations of deletions of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA in skeletal muscle with clinical manifestations of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathies , a group of disorders defined either by biochemical abnormalities of mitochondria or by morphologic changes causing a ragged red appearance of the muscle fibers histochemically .
We performed genomic Southern blot analysis of muscle <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA from 123 patients with different <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathies or encephalomyopathies .
Deletions were found in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA of 32 patients , all of whom had <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
Some patients had only ocular myopathy , whereas others had Kearns-Say re syndrome , a multisystem disorder characterized by ophthalmoplegia , <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinopathy <END> , heart block , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
The deletions ranged in size from 1.3 to 7. 6 kilobases and were mapped to different sites in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA , but an identical 4.9-kilobase deletion was found in the same location in 11 patients .
Biochemical analysis showed decreased activities of NADH dehydrogenase , rotenone-sensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase , succinate-cytochrome c reductase , and cytochrome c oxidase , four enzymes of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> respiratory chain containing subunits encoded by <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA .
We conclude that deletions of muscle <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA are associated with ophthalmoplegia and may result in impaired <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> function .
However , the precise relation between clinical and biochemical phenotypes and deletions remains to be defined .
Mendelian inheritance of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
Previous studies have demonstrated familial clustering of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
To define the nature of this familial aggregation and to assess whether Mendelian inheritance can explain <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> clustering , proportional hazards and segregation analyses were performed on 691 families ascertained through a single <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> proband .
The proportional hazards analyses revealed that two factors , early age at onset of disease in the proband and multiple affected family members , were important determinants of risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> in these families .
Furthermore , segregation analyses revealed that this clustering can be best explained by <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> of a rare ( q = 0.0030 ) high-risk allele leading to an early onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
The estimated cumulative risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> for carriers revealed that the allele was highly penetrant : by age 85 , 88 % of carriers compared to only 5 % of noncarriers are projected to be affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
The best fitting <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model further suggested that this inherited form of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> accounts for a significant proportion of early onset disease but overall is responsible for a small proportion of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> occurrence ( 9% by age 85 ) . These data provide evidence that <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> is inherited in Mendelian fashion in a subset of families and provide a foundation for gene mapping studies of heritable <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
Characterization of genes involved in inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> could provide important insight into the development of this disease in general .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Exstrophy <END> of the cloaca and <START:PHENOTYPE> exstrophy <END> of the bladder : two different expressions of a primary developmental field defect .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Exstrophy <END> of the bladder ( EB ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> exstrophy <END> of the cloaca ( EC ) are generally recognizable as distinct clinical entities .
In patients with EB , the posterior bladder wall is exposed through a midline defect of the abdomen .
The umbilicus is inferiorly displaced and located close to the superior margin of the exstrophic bladder .
Genital abnormalities are common in boys and girls who may present <START:PHENOTYPE> epispadias <END> and a small , split phallus or a split clitoris , a <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid uterus <END> , and a duplicate or exstrophic vagina .
In contrast to classic EB , EC is commonly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , spinal defects , and incompletely formed external genitalia and is always associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> .
Some authors state that EC and EB constitute two distinct disorders , but others consider them part of a " continuum , " representing different levels of severity within the same spectrum .
The use of the acronym OEIS to refer to the combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> exstrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , and spinal defects , in our opinion , has not helped to clarify the clinical definition , pathogenesis , or cause of this multiple congenital anomaly ( MCA ) pattern , mostly because the term makes no distinction between EC or EB . Here we present the epidemiological analysis of a group of characteristics in infants with EC and infants with EB to determine if they constitute two different entities .
We also analyze if the different combinations of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , and spinal defects are more frequent in infants with EC than in infants with MCA patterns other than EC and EB .
The prevalence in our data for EC was 1:200,233 live births and 1:35 ,597 for EB .
The clinical analysis indicated that the study defects ( <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , spine defects , spina bifida , and <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> ) tend to occur together in the same child with a higher frequency if the child has the EC defect than in infants with MCA patterns that did not include EC or EB . Our findings of low birth weight , twinning , single umbilical artery , and preferentially associated malformations suggest that EC is the result of damage occurring very early in development and that EC and EB are two different expressions of a primary polytopic developmental field defect .

An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> syndrome of hypotrichosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodysplasia <END> , hyperkeratosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , catartact , and other manifestations .
We describe a 20-year-old woman with <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized trichodysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dry skin <END> with scaling , hyperchromic spots on limbs , hyperkeratosis ( particularly intense on soles) , <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatoglyphic abnormalities <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodysplasia <END> , shortness of stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> unusual facial appearance <END> , minor malformations of limbs , bilateral nuclear <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> entropion <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> trichiasis <END> , etc .
The condition is probably due to an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> gene .
The patient is the only affected member in a sibship of four whose parents are second cousins .
Resolution of the two loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , AN1 and AN2 , to a single locus on chromosome 11p13 .
Two distinct loci have been proposed for <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> ; AN1 for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> on chromosome 2p and AN2 for the <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> in the WAGR contiguous gene syndrome on chromosome 11p13 .
In this report , the kindred segregating for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , which suggested linkage to acid phosphatase-1 ( ACP1 ) and led to the assignment of the AN1 locus on chromosome 2p , has been updated and expanded .
Linkage analysis between the <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> phenotype and ACP1 does not support the original linkage results , excluding linkage up to theta = 0.17 with Z = -2 . Tests for linkage to other chromosome 2p markers .
APOB , D2S71 , D2S5 , and D2S1 , also excluded linkage to <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
Markers that have been isolated from the chromosome 11p13 region were then analyzed in this <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> family .
Two RFLPs at the D11S323 locus give significant evidence for linkage .
The PvuII polymorphism detected by probe p5S1.6 detects no recombinants , with a maximum lod score of Z = 6 .97 at theta = 0.00 .
The HaeIII polymorphism detected by the probe p5BE1.2 gives a maximum lod score of Z = 2.57 at theta = 0.00 . Locus D11S325 gives a lod score of Z = 1.53 at theta = 0.00 . These data suggest that a locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> ( AN1 ) on chromosome 2p has been misassigned and that this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> family is segregating for an <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> mutation linked to markers in the 11p13 region .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> with isolated C3 deposits : a new entity which shares common genetic risk factors with haemolytic uraemic syndrome .
Abnormal control of the complement alternative pathway ( CAP ) ( factor H , factor I and membrane cofactor protein ( MCP ) deficiencies ) is a well established risk factor for the occurrence of haemolytic uraemic syndrome ( HUS ) .
In some instances , HUS may be associated with an unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> with isolated C3 deposits ( <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 ) .
We determined whether HUS and <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 share common genetic susceptibility factors .
We identified 19 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 .
We measured levels of circulating complement components , performed assays for the detection of C3 nephritic factor ( C3NeF ) and screened factor H , factor I and MCP coding genes for the presence of mutations .
Patients were divided in two groups based on renal pathology findings : group I ( n = 13 ) had typical features of type I membranoproliferative <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 with membranoproliferative <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> ( MPGN) ) and group II ( n = 6 ) was characterised by mesangial and epimembranous C3 deposits in the absence of mesangial proliferation ( <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 without MPGN ) .
Mutations in complement regulatory genes were detected in 4/6 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 without MPGN ( heterozygous mutations in factor H gene ( two patients ) with low factor H antigenic level in one case , heterozygous mutations in factor I gene ( two patients) ) and in only 2/13 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 with MPGN ( heterozygous mutations in factor H gene ( one patient ) and double heterozygous mutation in CD 46 gene ( one patient) ) .
In contrast , C3NeF was present in 5/13 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 with MPGN and in 2/6 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 without MPGN , one of whom had a factor H mutation .
HUS and <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 without MPGN share common genetic risk factors .
Constitutional or acquired dysregulation of the CAP is probably associated with a wide spectrum of diseases , ranging from HUS to <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 with MPGN .
Identical twins who are discordant for Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy.
Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> is a maternally inherited form of <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> that is associated with several <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations .
These <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations are not the sole determinants of <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> , as epigenetic factors may play a pathogenetic role .
To clarify the role of these factors , we studied two visually discordant twins and determined their zygosity and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genotype .

The monozygous twin brothers have remained discordant for the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> for 6 1/2 years despite harboring the identical homoplasmic 4216 , 13708 , and 11778 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations .
The patients are visually discordant despite being genetically identical at the nuclear and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> levels .
Epigenetic factors are important determinants of <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> in Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> in these brothers .
Among those factors studied in these patients , a substantial difference was noted in regard to occupational exposure to toxic substances .
Epigenetic factors that may influence the clinical expression of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations associated with Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> should be systematically studied .
Risk-factor intervention strategies should be formulated and implemented .
A distinctive <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> disproportionate short stature <END> with short long bones , brachydactyly , and hypotrichosis in two consanguineous Arab families .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Disproportionate short stature <END> is a heterogeneous group of hereditary disorders , which are classified according to their mode of inheritance , their clinical skeletal and non-skeletal manifestations , and their radiological characteristics .
Herein , we inform on eight individuals with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> disproportionate short stature <END> from two unrelated consanguineous families of Arab-Muslim ancestry .
The adult height of the affected individuals is between 112 cm and 127 cm , and is due to pre- and post-natal growth retardation , which probably manifests as early as the second trimester of pregnancy .
At a young age , the phenotype is characterized by a short stature , a relatively <START:PHENOTYPE> large head <END> , and a long <START:PHENOTYPE> triangular face <END> , and this phenotype later evolves to one with in which the head is relatively small , the mandible is large and pointy .
The affected individuals have normal cognitive abilities and lack any neurological deficits .
Other typical features include a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent nose <END> , a voice with an unusual high-pitched sound , relatively <START:PHENOTYPE> small ears <END> , clinodactyly , brachydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> small hands <END> , hypoplastic fingernails , a <START:PHENOTYPE> waddling gait <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> post-pubertally .
Typical skeletal changes include short long bones , especially the femurs and humeri , with mild metaphyseal changes and very <START:PHENOTYPE> short femoral necks <END> .
After due consideration of the other hereditary causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> disproportionate short stature <END> and close examination of the pedigrees of the two families , we concluded that these eight individuals have the same hitherto unreported form of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> disproportionate short stature <END> that is inherited in the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode .

Micro syndrome .
Three affected children from an inbred family had <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , retinal dystrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic nerve atrophy <END> , hypothalamic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogenitalism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> .
The disorder is presumably <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ; no identical syndrome has been described , but we consider syndromes with similar features .
Further delineation of the G syndrome : a manageable genetic cause of infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> .
Three families including five subjects with the G or Opitz-Frias syndrome are added to 23 published cases who had <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> ; characteristics of the two affected relatives were added to 19 well documented published reports .
The data from index cases support the concept of the G syndrome as a constellation of midline defects , which include <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> ( 89% ) , oesophageal dysmotility ( 69% ) , laryngotracheal clefts ( 44% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid uvula <END> ( 34% ) , heart defects ( 29% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> (100% of males) , renal or <START:PHENOTYPE> ureteral anomalies <END> ( 42%) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( 38% ) .
Affected relatives , often identified by <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , had a much lower incidence of associated defects and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
They provide a more rounded but still biased view of a syndrome compatible with normal intelligence and life span .
The data do not support a highly characteristic face in the G syndrome , which discriminates it from the phenotypically similar BBB syndrome .
The variable expressivity and five cases of male to male transmission observed in 18 families are consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Vigilance for the morphological characteristics of G syndrome in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> is underscored by the potential for normal development with appropriate intervention .
Environmental risk factors and clinical phenotype in familial and <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> primary <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> .
Although environmental and genetic factors may contribute to the etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> , their relative contribution in causing familial and <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> is unknown .
First-degree relatives of 122 patients with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> were examined with a validated 2-step diagnostic procedure , including a screening questionnaire and examination of some relatives .
Examiners were blinded to the questionnaire data for family history of probands .
Data for demographic and clinical features , prior ophthalmologic complaints , and nondecaffeinated coffee intake were collected from probands before family investigation .
Dystonia was diagnosed in 27 relatives from 23 families (20% rate of family history for dystonia ) .
No significant differences were found between familial and <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases in the frequency of coffee drinking and eye diseases or in sex , age at onset , or tendency to spread .
Multivariable conditional logistic analysis testing of 67 case patients and 127 family-matched unaffected siblings yielded a significant positive association between <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> and prior eye diseases ( adjusted odds ratio [ OR] 2.5 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 .1-6 .1 ; p = 0.03 ) and a significant inverse association between case status and ever coffee drinking ( adjusted OR 0.23; 95 % CI 0.1- 0.8 ; p = 0.02 ) .
The new information from this large family-based study on primary <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> strongly supports eye diseases and coffee as risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> .
The finding that the 2 environmental exposures exerted a similar influence on familial and <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> , together with the convergent phenotypic expression in familial and <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases , implies that familial and <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> probably share a common etiologic background .

A broad clinical spectrum .
To describe the spectrum of illnesses associated with Escherichia coli O15 7 : H7 infections .
Described an outbreak that showed the broad spectrum of these infections .
Reviewed the clinical findings in the other eight major outbreaks reported between 1982 and 1986 .
Also reviewed reports of sporadic cases .
Outbreaks in communities , nursing homes , a day care center , and a kindergarten .
Persons identified in outbreaks of E . coli O15 7 : H7 infections .
Escherichia coli O15 7 : H7 infection causes bloody <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> ( hemorrhagic colitis ) , nonbloody <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> , and thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> .
Infection can be asymptomatic , can involve extraintestinal sites , and can be fatal .
Bloody <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> is the commonest symptom .
Most patients have severe abdominal cramps ; <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> is documented in less than half .
Findings from fecal leukocyte examinations often suggest a noninfectious cause .
Results of radiologic and colonoscopic examinations can be consistent with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease or ischemic colitis .
Patients at the extremes of age are at increased risk for E . coli O15 7 : H7-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> , thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> , and death .
Antimicrobial agents have not been shown to modify the illness , but there are few data on individual agents .
Infection with E . coli O15 7 : H7 should be considered in all patients with bloody <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> , or thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> because the infection can masquerade as gastrointestinal bleeding of noninfectious cause , the antecedent <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> may be resolved and forgotten by the time the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> or thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> is diagnosed , and the detection of E . coli O15 7 : H7 requires specific stool culture techniques .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> ureteral triplication <END> and bilateral amastia .
We report a case of <START:PHENOTYPE> ureteral triplication <END> as part of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome comprising bilateral amastia , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> patent ductus arteriosus <END> , dysmorphic <START:PHENOTYPE> low set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> with an antimongoloid slant to the eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> , flat <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , tapered digits , <START:PHENOTYPE> cubitus valgus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> .
Molecular diagnosis of Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> .
The distinction between Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> and diffuse large-B-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> is crucial because these two types of <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> require different treatments .
We examined whether gene-expression profiling could reliably distinguish Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> from diffuse large-B-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> .
Tumor-biopsy specimens from 303 patients with aggressive lymphomas were profiled for gene expression and were also classified according to morphology , immunohistochemistry , and detection of the t(8 ;14 ) c-myc translocation .
A classifier based on gene expression correctly identified all 25 pathologically verified cases of classic Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> .
Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> was readily distinguished from diffuse large-B-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> by the high level of expression of c-myc target genes , the expression of a subgroup of germinal-center B-cell genes , and the low level of expression of major-histocompatibility-complex class I genes and nuclear factor-kappaB target genes .
Eight specimens with a pathological diagnosis of diffuse large-B-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> had the typical gene-expression profile of Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> , suggesting they represent cases of Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> that are difficult to diagnose by current methods .
Among 28 of the patients with a molecular diagnosis of Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> , the overall survival was superior among those who had received intensive chemotherapy regimens instead of lower-dose regimens .
Gene-expression profiling is an accurate , quantitative method for distinguishing Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> from diffuse large-B-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> .

Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> is caused by mutations in the sodium-phosphate cotransporter gene SLC34A3 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypophosphatemia <END> due to isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> results from a heterogeneous group of disorders .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> ( HHRH ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> that is characterized by reduced renal phosphate reabsorption , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> .
It can be distinguished from other forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> by increased serum levels of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
Using SNP array genotyping , we mapped the disease locus in two consanguineous families to the end of the long arm of chromosome 9 .
The candidate region contained a sodium-phosphate cotransporter gene , SLC34A3 , which has been shown to be expressed in proximal tubulus cells .
Sequencing of this gene revealed disease-associated mutations in five families , including two frameshift and one splice-site mutation .
Loss of function of the SLC34A3 protein presumably results in a primary <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular defect <END> and is compatible with the HHRH phenotype .
We also show that the phosphaturic factor FGF23 ( fibroblast growth factor 23) , which is increased in X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> and carries activating mutations in autosomal dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> , is at normal or low-normal serum levels in the patients with HHRH , further supporting a primary renal defect .
Identification of the gene mutated in a further form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> adds to the understanding of phosphate homeostasis and may help to elucidate the interaction of the proteins involved in this pathway .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> owing to <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse mesangial sclerosis <END> : an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
Three sibs born to consanguineous parents had congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> .
Pathology of the kidneys showed <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse mesangial sclerosis <END> with deposits of IgG and C3 in the mesangium and glomerular basement membranes .
All three children died before the age of 3 years .
Of 19 published cases of children with the association of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , only four had histological evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse mesangial sclerosis <END> , and two of their sibs probably had the same disease .
The association of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> owing to congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse mesangial sclerosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and mental retardation appears to be a distinct syndrome with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance .
Renal tubular insufficiency , cholestatic <START:PHENOTYPE> jaundice <END> , and multiple congenital anomalies--a new multisystem syndrome .
We are describing two male siblings with proximal renal tubular insufficiency , cholestatic <START:PHENOTYPE> jaundice <END> , predisposition to infection , and multiple congenital anomalies .
These patients presented in the early neonatal period with <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> , barrel shaped chest , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> simian creases <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> club feet <END> , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hip dislocation <END> , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> conjugated hyperbilirubinemia <END> , repeated infections , and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> .
They died at the age of 2 and of 4 months despite medical therapy .
Findings of renal tubular insufficiency included persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> , phosphaturia , <START:PHENOTYPE> aminoaciduria <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> .
Kidney biopsy , liver biopsy , and a comprehensive immunologic investigation were performed on the first sibling .
Kidney histology was normal except for calcification of some distal tubules .
Liver biopsy revealed paucity of bile ducts , bile stasis , and some inflammatory cell infiltration .
Immunologic investigation suggested a defect in polymorphonuclear cell migration and intracellular killing .
Review of the literature revealed remarkably similar findings in two previously reported male siblings .
These four cases probably represent a previously unrecognized familial syndrome .
The possible etiology and mode of inheritance of this syndrome are discussed , and the association of hepatic and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular dysfunction <END> is reviewed .
Management of ophthalmic complications of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> .
To determine the safety and efficacy of surgical versus medical management in the treatment of ophthalmic complications of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> , and also to document ocular complications of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> other than <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> .
Retrospective case series .
Forty-five patients with ophthalmic complications of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> participated .
Eighty-four surgical procedures were performed on 40 patients .
There were 82 procedures done with the patients under general anesthesia and 2 with the patients under local anesthesia .
Medical therapy was attempted initially in all patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> and was the sole therapy used for five patients .
Complications resulting from medical or surgical treatment and final visual acuity were studied .
All patients had a history of lens subluxation or dislocation .
Fourteen ( 31% ) were receiving dietary treatment at the time of presentation and 29 ( 64% ) were mentally retarded .
Eighty-two procedures were performed with the patients under general anesthesia with 2 surgical complications and 1 postsurgical complication .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lens dislocation <END> into the anterior chamber was the most frequent indication for surgery (5 0% ) followed by pupillary block <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> ( 12% ) .
Prophylactic peripheral iridectomy was not successful in preventing <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> into the anterior chamber in five patients .
Anesthetic precautions such as stockings to prevent deep venous thrombosis , preoperative hydration , or aspirin were given in 85 % of cases .
Other common ophthalmic complications found include <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( 23% ) , iris atrophy ( 21% ) , anterior staphylomas ( 13% ) , lenticular opacities ( 9% ) , and corneal opacities ( 9% ) .
Laser iridectomy was unsuccessful in preventing <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> into the anterior chamber .
With appropriate anesthetic precautions and modern microsurgical techniques , the risks associated with the surgical management of ocular complications of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> are reduced .
Surgical treatment should be considered , especially for cases of repeated <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> into the anterior chamber or pupillary block <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
If a conservative , nonsurgical approach is undertaken , these patients must be observed carefully for repeat episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> .
Split hand/split foot malformation with <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> : first report of families linked to the SHFM1 locus in 7q21 .
Developmental anomalies of the appendicular skeleton are among the most common and easily ascertained birth defects .
Split hand/split foot malformations , distinctive in having deficiency of the central rays , occur as isolated anomalies and as one component of multisystem syndromes .
The clinical and molecular characterization of a new syndrome , found in two unrelated families , consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> split foot <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , is presented here .
As in other split hand/split foot conditions , variable expression and reduced penetrance is notable .
In the larger family , variably expressed <START:PHENOTYPE> split foot <END> malformations were found in 6 of 11 gene carriers .
and mild-to-moderate sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> in 4 . <START:PHENOTYPE> Split hand <END> and cleft lip/palate in one individual and tibial deficiency in another suggest that these malformations are uncommon components of the syndrome .
Ectodermal abnormalities did not occur .
In the second family , variable <START:PHENOTYPE> split foot <END> was observed in 3 of 4 gene carriers , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> was present in 3 . <START:PHENOTYPE> Split hand <END> was only seen in a gene carrier who also had <START:PHENOTYPE> split foot <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
One gene carrier only had <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
The gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> split hand <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> split foot <END> with sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> was linked to markers in 7q21 in both families , with a combined ( maximum LOD score of 4.37 at theta = 0.0 for locus D7S527) at 80% penetrance .
Efforts to identify the responsible gene have not yet been successful .
Neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> , neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and intellectual disability in 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome .
Purpose:Hypocalcemia is a common endocrinological condition in 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome .
Neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> may affect neurodevelopment .
We hypothesized that neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> would be associated with rare , more severe forms of intellectual disability in 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome .Methods:We used a logistic regression model to investigate potential predictors of intellectual disability severity , including neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> , neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and complex congenital heart disease , e.g. , <START:PHENOTYPE> interrupted aortic arch <END> , in 149 adults with 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome .
Ten subjects had moderate-to-severe intellectual disability.Results: The model was highly significant ( P < 0.0001 ) , showing neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( P = 0.0018 ) and neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> ( P = 0.047 ) to be significant predictors of a more severe level of intellectual disability .
Neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were significantly associated with neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> in the entire sample ( P < 0.0001 ) , regardless of intellectual level .
There was no evidence for the association of moderate-to-severe intellectual disability with other factors such as major structural brain malformations in this sample .Conclusion : The results suggest that neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> may increase the risk for more severe intellectual deficits in 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome , likely mediated by neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> .
Neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> often remains unrecognized until the postseizure period , when damage to neurons may already have occurred .
These findings support the importance of early recognition and treatment of neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> and potentially neonatal screening for 22q11 .2 deletions .Genet Med 16 1 , 40-44 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia : clinical characterization of a novel renal phosphate-wasting disorder .
Renal phosphate-wasting disorders are the most common form of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> in western countries .
Although <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> has been described , previous studies included too few affected individuals to adequately characterize the disorder .
We performed clinical and biochemical evaluations of individuals from a large kindred with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia .
We identified 23 affected members in this family , and for some individuals , follow-up was up to 25 yr .
As patients were all members of the same kindred , we had the opportunity to determine the clinical manifestations of the disorder in patients who presumably all have the same genetic mutation .
Affected individuals have isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> and inappropriately normal serum calcitriol concentrations .
The inheritance pattern was consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission with variable penetrance .
The family contained two subgroups of affected individuals .
Group 1 consisted of patients who presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> as adolescents or adults .
These patients presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> bone pain <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , and insufficiency fractures , but did not manifest lower extremity deformity .
Group 2 consisted of patients who presented with phosphate wasting , <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> , and lower extremity deformity as children .
Surprisingly , some individuals in group 2 lost the renal phosphate-wasting defect after puberty .
In conclusion , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia is an inherited disorder of isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> .
The spectrum of disease includes delayed onset of penetrance and loss of the renal phosphate-wasting defect .
Our results have implications in the evaluation of patients who present with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> as either adults or children .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> Kufs ' disease : a cause of early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Kufs ' disease is the rare , adult-onset form of the neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses ( NCL ) .
Two clinical Kufs ' phenotypes have been described , one featuring generalized tonic-clonic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and the other characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant inheritance <END> of Kufs ' disease has been reported for only two families .
The genetic and molecular defects underlying Kufs ' disease are unknown .
We report a third family with apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Kufs ' disease in a family of English ancestry .
Ten individuals ( five men , five women ) have been affected over five generations .
Age of onset typically is in the fourth decade of life and is heralded by <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Clinical and neuropsychological assessments in several affected individuals , however , confirm the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and follow-up evaluations suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> is the primary disabling feature of the illness .
Motor abnormalities also are frequent .
Neuropathological examination ( three cases ) documents the presence of neuronal lipopigment accumulation consistent with NCL .
The combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in this and two other reported families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Kufs ' disease suggest that this entity represents a distinctive clinicopathological entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dementia <END> is prominent but is almost always associated with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and motoric disturbances early in the disease course .
Kufs ' disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of early onset , atypical <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Northern <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome : an inherited childhood onset <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with associated <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deterioration <END> .
A new autosomal recessively inherited disease of the central nervous system involving childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deterioration <END> is described .
Twenty three patients ( 11 males and 12 females ) belonging to 11 families from northern Finland have been identified .
A common ancestor has been found for nine families .
The mean age of onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> was 6.7 years ( range 5-1 0 years ) and the <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> was characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> generalised tonic-clonic seizures <END> increasing in frequency up to puberty .
One third of the patients also had <START:PHENOTYPE> complex partial seizures <END> during childhood .
During young adulthood the epileptic activity began to decrease , but complete remission did not occur .
Electroencephalography showed progressive slowing of the background activity with relatively scanty epileptiform activity .
Out of four ictal recordings the paroxysmal activity was initiated focally in two cases .
Clonazepam and sodium valproate had some antiepileptic effect , clonazepam being the more beneficial of the two .
Mental development , which was originally normal , began to deteriorate two to five years after the onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and the deterioration continued during adulthood in spite of good <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> control , leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> by middle age .
The pathogenesis of the disorder , called the Northern <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome , is unknown .
Linkage analysis using DNA markers linked to the EPM1 gene for progressive myoclonus <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> of Unverricht-Lundborg type showed that the Northern <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome is not allelic to EPM1 .
Mutation in the glutamate transporter EAAT1 causes <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiplegia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Transporters , ion pumps , and ion channels are membrane proteins that regulate selective permeability and maintain ionic gradients across cell membranes .
Mutations in CACNA1A encoding a neuronal calcium channel and ATP1A2 encoding an ion pump cause <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> , hemiplegic <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Mutant gene products of both CACNA1A and ATP1A2 may affect neurotransmission of glutamate , the most abundant excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter .
We examined our patient population with <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> and hemiplegic <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> but with no mutation in either CACNA1A or ATP1A2 .
We looked for mutations in SLC1A3 , which encodes the glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid transporter ( EAAT ) 1 that is important in removing glutamate from the synaptic cleft .
A patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , and alternating <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiplegia <END> has a heterozygous mutation in SLC1A3 that is not present in his asymptomatic parents and controls .
Expression studies of the mutant EAAT1 showed decreased expression of the protein with a markedly reduced capacity for glutamate uptake .
When coexpressed , the mutant EAAT1 decreased the activity of wild-type EAAT1 but not of two other transporters EAAT2 or EAAT3 , suggesting that mutant EAAT1 specifically multimerizes with wild-type EAAT1 to exert its dominant negative effect .
Our data show that a heterozygous mutation in EAAT1 can lead to decreased glutamate uptake , which can contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability to cause <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiplegia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebellar hypoplasia <END> is found in association with a variety of neurologic and systemic disorders .
It is the primary finding in the uncommonly reported condition of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
We describe two siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> documented in both by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and review the clinical features of previously reported cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
The most common findings in this disorder are nonprogressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , strabismus , mental retardation , and speech delay with dysarthria .
Previously reported cases have been confirmed by autopsy , pneumoencephalography , or computed tomographic ( CT) scans .
MRI clearly documents diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> and aids in distinguishing <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> from other disorders .
The pathophysiology of this disorder is uncertain , however , studies of the weaver mutant mouse ( an animal model of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> ) suggest that an abnormality of the Bergmann glia may lead to the observed granule cell layer deficiency in these patients .
This diagnosis should be considered for children with nonprogressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and families should be made aware of the 25% recurrence risk .
Subependymal <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> : a distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal migration disorder <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Subependymal <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> has recently been recognised as a cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , but the clinical and investigational features have not been fully described .
The clinical , psychometric , imaging , and electroencephalographic features of 13 adult patients with subependymal <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> have been reviewed .
Age at <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> onset ranged from 18 months to 20 years ( median 13 years ) .
There were significantly more female ( 12 ) than male (1 ) patients ( p < 0.01 ) .
Diagnosis of subependymal <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> was made by MRI in 11 patients and CT in two .
The heterotopic grey matter was nodular in 11 patients and diffuse in two ; bilateral in eight and unilateral in five .
There were significantly more patients with predominant right than left cerebral hemisphere involvement ( p < 0.01 ) .
The most commonly involved site was the occipital horn of the lateral ventricles (1 0 of 13 patients ) .
Eleven patients presented with partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , 10 of whom also had secondarily generalised <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
The clinical description of the <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> often suggested either an occipital ( four patients ) or temporal ( five patients ) onset .
Two patients presented with absence attacks without clear focal features .
Patients demonstrated normal early milestones ( 12 of 13 patients) , including normal motor development ( all patients ) and average or above average intelligence (1 0 of 13 patients ) .
An EEG examination showed normal background activity in all but two patients , one of whom had large intracranial haematomas .
Epileptiform activity was usually widespread (1 0 of 13 patients ) and in three patients , there was generalised 3-Hz spike and wave activity that had previously led to an erroneous diagnosis of concomitant primary generalised <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in the second decade of life , normal developmental milestones and intelligence , and the finding of an overwhelming female preponderance differentiates subependymal <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> from other cortical dysgeneses .
The female preponderance supports the importance of the X chromosome and sex steroids in the maturation and development of the cerebral cortex .
A point mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> tRNA( Leu ) ( UUR ) gene in MELAS ( <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and strokelike episode ( MELAS ) is a major group of heterogeneous <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disorders .
To identify the defective gene , <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA from a patient with MELAS was sequenced by using amplified DNA fragments as sequencing templates .
In 14 .1 kbp determined out of 16 .6 kbp of the whole <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> gene , at least 21 nucleotides were different from those of a control human <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA .
One of the substitutions was a transition of A to G in the tRNA( Leu ) ( UUR ) gene at Cambridge nucleotide number 3,243 .
This nucleotide is conserved not only in many <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> tRNAs but in most cytosolic tRNA molecules .
An Apa I restriction site was gained by the substitution of this nucleotide .
The Apa I digestion of the amplified DNA fragment revealed that all independent 6 patients had G at nucleotide number 3,243 in their <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNAs , but none of 11 control individuals had G at this position .
This result strongly suggests that the mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> tRNALeu gene causes MELAS .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> tic disorder <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , motor neuron disease , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> : a new syndrome .
We report two brothers who were of consanguineous parents and who displayed a unique association of motor and vocal <START:PHENOTYPE> tics <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , distal <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular atrophy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> .
In the older brother , leg weakness and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle wasting <END> started at age 13 , and he became wheelchair bound at 40 . Electrophysiologic studies and muscle biopsy confirmed diffuse denervation .
Involuntary vocalizations and facial <START:PHENOTYPE> tics <END> began at age 36 , but within 5 years the <START:PHENOTYPE> tics <END> were replaced by progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> with supranuclear ophthalmoparesis .
CSF studies implied impaired central dopamine and serotonin turnover .
In the younger brother , orofacial <START:PHENOTYPE> tics <END> started at age 36 , vocalizations and fasciculations in the legs began 1 year later , and parkinsonian findings were present at age 40 .
This is the first report of an association of Tourettism , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , motor neuron disease , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> occurring as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
Intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> is a subtype of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> GIST <END> and results from a dominant activating mutation in PDGFRA .
Intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> ( Online Mendelian inheritance in Man database number 162220) is an alternate form of <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> .
Patients present with <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromas <END> limited to the intestine in the absence of any other typical features of NF1 and NF2 .
At present , the molecular basis of intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> remains elusive .
The aim of the present study was to find the gene responsible for intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> and to characterize functionally the mutation .
Three candidate genes ( NF1 , KIT, and PDGFRA ) were screened for mutations in 3 sisters diagnosed with intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> .
Five tumors were available for pathologic examination .
Activation ( phosphorylation ) of PDGFRalpha was subsequently tested by Western blot analysis on a transfected 293T and Ba/F3 cell line .
We found an inherited mutation ( Y555C ) in the juxtamembrane domain of PDGFRA in the affected individuals .
The Y555C mutation leads to autophosphorylation and thus activation of PDGFRalpha .
These observations confirm that PDGFRalpha( Y555C ) is an oncogenic kinase .
The clinical phenotype in the reported family resembles the syndrome of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastrointestinal stromal tumors <END> ( familial GIST) .
Somatic activating mutations in KIT and PDGFRA are frequent in <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> GISTs , and mutations in both genes have also been described in familial GISTs .
The tumors in the reported family are morphologically identical to intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromas <END> , but , immunohistochemically , they do not express S100 or any of the known <START:PHENOTYPE> GIST <END> markers .
The inherited PDGFRA mutation in the reported family shows that intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> is allelic to familial <START:PHENOTYPE> GIST <END> caused by PDGRA mutations .
We therefore propose that these tumors be classified as familial KIT-negative <START:PHENOTYPE> gastrointestinal stromal tumors <END> .
Further delineation of deletion 1p36 syndrome in 60 patients : a recognizable phenotype and common cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Deletion 1p36 syndrome is a recently delineated disorder , considered to be the most common subtelomeric microdeletion syndrome ( 1 in 5000 newborns ) .
1p36.3 deletions account for 0.5 % to 1.2% of idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ; thus , knowledge about the condition is important for pediatricians caring for such patients .
Despite 100 reported cases , little is known about its natural history .
Our aim was to delineate the natural history of deletion 1p36 and develop complete and accurate information with which to answer families ' questions in the clinical setting .
We evaluated 60 patients with the 1p36 deletion syndrome ( 41 female , 19 male ) .
All underwent physical and neurologic assessments , and most received a psychological evaluation .
Standard cytogenetics , fluorescence in situ hybridization of the subtelomeric regions , or array comparative genomic hybridization were used for diagnosis .
Fourteen cases were detected by standard cytogenetics , and 46 were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization of the subtelomeric regions or array comparative genomic hybridization .
Occipitofrontal circumference was at < or = 2nd centile in 95 % , and height and weight ranged between the < 3rd and 90th centiles .
All patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> straight eyebrows <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deep-set eyes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , broad nasal root/bridge , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pointed chin <END> . Other features included microbrachycephaly ( 65% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus <END> (5 0% ) , large , late-closing anterior fontanel ( 77% ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated <END> , low-set , abnormal ears (40% ) .
Brachy/camptodactyly and <START:PHENOTYPE> short feet <END> were prominent .
Seventy-one percent exhibited heart defects , including 23% with a " noncompaction cardiomyopathy. "
Fifty-two percent had eye/visual abnormalities , and 64 % had visual inattentiveness .
Twenty-eight percent had <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , 41 % had skeletal anomalies , 25% had abnormal genitalia , and 22% had renal abnormalities .
Eighty-eight percent had central nervous system anomalies , and 44 % had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
All patients demonstrated <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> with poor/absent speech ; 95 % had hypotonia .
Twenty-six percent were able to walk alone , and 47 % had a behavior disorder .
Constant developmental progress was observed in all cases over time .
Noncompaction cardiomyopathy and most <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were controlled by pharmacotherapy .
These 60 patients with deletion 1p36 represent the largest clinical series to date and provide new information on several aspects of this disorder , which is characterized by neurodevelopmental disability and a recognizable pattern of malformation .
Lambotte syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , holoprosencephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , facial anomalies , and early lethality--a new sublethal multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome in four sibs .
We report on an Arabic sibship originating from Morocco in which four children manifest an undiagnosed sublethal multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation ( MCA/MR ) syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> ( IUGR) , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , large soft pinnae , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> or true <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> squint <END> , flat face , unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> hooked nose <END> , very <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow mouth <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retrognathia <END> , and extremely severe neurologic impairment .
One child was stillborn .
Three others died in a cachectic state during their second year .
One child had a severe cerebral malformation compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> semilobar holoprosencephaly <END> . Other inconstant manifestations are <START:PHENOTYPE> anterior chamber cleavage defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> preaxial polydactyly of feet <END> , interventricular septal defect , and atresia of the external auditory meatus .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> is likely .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> with muscle coenzyme Q10 deficiency .
To describe a clinical syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> associated with muscle coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10 ) deficiency .
Muscle CoQ10 deficiency has been reported only in a few patients with a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy characterized by 1 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent myoglobinuria <END> ; 2 ) brain involvement ( <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ) , and 3 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> and lipid storage in the muscle biopsy .
Having found decreased CoQ10 levels in muscle from a patient with unclassified familial <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , the authors measured CoQ10 in muscle biopsies from other patients in whom <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> could not be attributed to known genetic causes .
The authors found muscle CoQ10 deficiency ( 26 to 35 % of normal ) in six patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , pyramidal signs , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
All six patients responded to CoQ10 supplementation ; strength increased , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> improved , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> became less frequent .
Primary CoQ10 deficiency is a potentially important cause of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of this condition because CoQ10 administration seems to improve the clinical picture .
Dubowitz syndrome : long-term follow-up of an original patient .
Dubowitz syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder of growth retardation , characteristic face , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> originally described by Dubowitz [ 1965 ] .
Little information is available on natural history and adulthood in this disorder .
We report on a 30-year-old woman who was one of the first patients to be diagnosed with the condition [ Grosse et al. , 1971 , Z Kinderheilkd 11 0 :175 -187 ] . <START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , leg length discrepancy , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperextensible joints <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida occulta <END> , and absence of anterior cruciate ligaments were present .
Her facial appearance had been modified by several plastic surgery procedures .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Eczema <END> resolved with age , with occasional flareups .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> , headaches , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were additional medical findings .
Speech delays , an unusually soft , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-pitched voice <END> , submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> velopharyngeal insufficiency <END> were noted in childhood .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> was present .
At age 30 years she is living independently in her own apartment and working full-time in a nearby sheltered workshop .
Oculo-facio-cardio-dental ( OFCD ) syndrome .
Oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome consists of (1 ) eye anomalies : <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , or secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , (2 ) facial abnormalities : ( long <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> , pointed nose with cartilages separated at the tip , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , or submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , (3 ) cardiac anomalies : <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> ( ASD) , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> ( VSD) , or floppy mitral valve ; and (4 ) dental abnormalities : canine radiculomegaly , delayed dentition , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> persistent primary teeth <END> , or variable root length .
Other less common findings are : sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> septate vagina <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly of toes <END> 2-3 .
Inheritance may be an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> trait , lethal in the male .
SPONASTRIME dysplasia : report of an 11-year-old boy and review of the literature .
SPONASTRIME ( SPOndylar and NAsal changes , with STRIations of the MEtaphyses ) dysplasia is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> bone disorder first described by Fanconi et al . [ 1983 : Helv Paediatr Acta 38:267-280] .
Radiographic findings include abnormal vertebral bodies with age-dependent changes , and striations of the metaphyses , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and retarded ossification of the carpal bones .
Physical features include severe <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lumbar lordosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal root <END> .
To date , 12 patients from 6 families have been reported .
Four additional patients have been reported with a variant of this condition , which includes <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We report on an 11-year-old boy with features consistent with SPONASTRIME dysplasia .
Height was 106 .1 cm ( -6 SD ) .
He had a coarse appearing face with a <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , short , <START:PHENOTYPE> upturned nose <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> .
Intelligence was normal .
A clinical evaluation at 6 years of age suggested the diagnosis of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia ( SED ) .
However , genetics evaluation at 11 years of age with repeat radiologic studies revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed carpal ossification <END> ( -4 to -5 SD) , <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal irregularities <END> and striations most notably in the distal femurs and the proximal tibias , <START:PHENOTYPE> lumbar lordosis <END> , narrow interpedicular distances of the lumbar spine , and pear-shaped vertebral bodies .
These findings were most consistent with the diagnosis of SPONASTRIME dysplasia , and not SED .
Although radiographic findings of SPONASTRIME dysplasia are distinguishable from SED , the physical appearance may be similar .
Many bone dysplasias have overlapping radiographic findings and clinical presentation but with different recurrence risks , making genetic counseling a challenge .

Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple pterygia <END> , camptodactyly , facial anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic lungs <END> and heart , <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic hygroma <END> , and skeletal anomalies : delineation of a new entity and review of lethal forms of multiple pterygium syndrome .
Three unrelated stillborn infants ( cases 1-3 ) are presented here with a distinct constellation of multiple anomalies : namely , <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple pterygia <END> involving chin-to-sternum , cervical , axillary , antecubital , crural and/or popliteal areas , <START:PHENOTYPE> flexion contractures <END> of multiple joints , small chest , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops <END> , characteristic abnormal facial appearance with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , markedly flattened nasal bridge with hypoplastic nasal alae , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , apparently low-set malformed ears , short neck with a <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic hygroma <END> at the back of the neck and head , and pulmonary and cardiac hypoplasia .
Radiographic studies , in addition , showed scalp <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> , microbrachycephaly , flattened mandibular angle , lack of normal curvature at the cervico-thoracic junction , marked bony fusion of posterior spinous processes of older fetuses ( cases 1 , 2) , thin crowded ribs , markedly hypoplastic scapulae , hypoplastic iliac wings , ischia and pubic bones , undermodeling of tubular bones , and radio-ulnar synostosis .
Histologic studies of the skeletal system showed cartilaginous and bony fusion of the spinous processes ( cases 1 , 2) , fusion of epiphyseal cartilages of distal humerus and proximal ulna , a poorly developed joint space , an abnormal growth plate , and weak safranin staining of the resting cartilages ( cases 1 , 2 ) . To the best of our knowledge , this pattern of anomalies constitutes a previously undescribed syndrome .
Prenatal diagnosis of this entity is possible by ultrasonographic studies on the basis of nonimmune fetal <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic hygroma <END> at the back of the head and neck , diminished fetal activity , short and fixed limbs , and/or maternal <START:PHENOTYPE> hydramnios <END> .
Three additional cases ( cases 4-6 ) are also presented to show a possible heterogeneity of this syndrome .
Coloboma , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> : critical review of the so-called Biemond syndrome type 2 , updated nosology , and delineation of three " new " syndromes .
Biemond syndrome type 2 ( BS2 ) is classically regarded as a recessively inherited condition ( MIM 210350 ) comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , coloboma , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , polydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , and facial dysostosis .
Clinically , the disorder is closely related to Bardet-Biedl syndrome .
Few cases have been reported , most of them before 197 0 .
We present clinical data on three mentally retarded sporadic cases with coloboma , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , and hypogenitalism ( in two of them) , fitting as first glance a diagnosis of BS2 .
A review documents striking clinical variability among the patients said to have BS2 .
We propose a new nosology of those cases and delineate several new clinical forms .
Purported BS2 cases may be divided into : (1 ) Bardet-Biedl syndrome with fortuitous coloboma or aniridia , (2 ) BS2 sensu stricto , a recessively inherited syndrome of sexual infantilism , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , coloboma , and preaxial polydactyly without <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , only known from the original report , (3 ) a " new " dominantly inherited form of colobomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> occasionally associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , to which our observations belong .
(4 ) cytogenetically proven Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome ( one case) , (5 ) an unclassifiable , early lethal familial syndrome resembling Buntinx-Majewski syndrome , and (6 ) a " new " coloboma-zygodactyly-clefting syndrome .
The latter two syndromes may result from chromosomal anomaly .
New form of <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> ( SEMD ) in Jewish family of Iraqi origin .
We report a distinct type of <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> seen in 2 sibs and their second cousin , characterized by early onset severe short stature , small chest , and <START:PHENOTYPE> distended abdomen <END> .
They had <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lumbar lordosis <END> , and marked <START:PHENOTYPE> genu varum <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> fibular overgrowth <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> .
Radiographically , the patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> , initially noted during the first years of life , with central hypoplasia of the vertebral bodies .
At a later age , the vertebrae appear squared with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> interpedicular narrowing <END> .
The long bone changes , which at early age resemble those seen in achondroplasia , later include general <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal irregularities <END> and significant <START:PHENOTYPE> epiphyseal ossification delay <END> .
These patients present a previously undescribed form of <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> , most probably transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> tract .
Steinfeld syndrome : report of a second family and further delineation of a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder .
We report on a fetus with alobar <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> midline cleft lip <END> and palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> absent nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysplastic ears <END> , radial defects , pentalogy of Fallot , unilateral renal aplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> absent gallbladder <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vertebral anomalies <END> , and absence of ribs .
The father had a cleft palate , bilateral colobomas of the iris and retina , a <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid uvula <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vertebral anomalies <END> , and unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hearing loss <END> .
His sister had a cleft lip .
On the basis of this family and the family reported by Steinfeld [ 1982] , this malformation syndrome can be defined as a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome whose main component manifestations are <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> , predominantly radial limb deficiency , heart defects , kidney malformations , absence of gallbladder , and <START:PHENOTYPE> vertebral anomalies <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> associated with ragged-red fibres ( <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> abnormalities ) : disease entity or a syndrome ?
Light-and electron-microscopic studies of two cases and review of literature .
A report is given of an association of dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclonica associated with Friedreich 's <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> in 2 patients .
They had suffered from gradually increasing bursts of <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> since the wage of 14 and childhood , respectively .
The other striking clinical features included generalized convulsions , mental deterioration , intention tremor , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , muscular atrophy and deformity of feet .
Muscle biopsies revealed ragged-red fibres in both cases .
On electron microscopy these fibres contained subsarcolemnal aggregations of abundant abnormal mitochondria with proliferation of inner membranes or paracrystalline inclusions .
One of these patients showed elevated blood lactate and pyruvate with an increased lactate/pyruvate ration , apparently of primary origin .
These 2 cases resemble those reported briefly by Tsairis et al . ( 1974 ) .
An association of dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclonica associated with Friedreich 's <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> in these 2 patients is unlikely to be coincidental but may represent one nosological entity .
This <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome associated with ragged-red fibres is compared with other possibly related <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathies .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinoblastoma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> microdeletion syndrome : clinical characterization and molecular dissection using array CGH .
We describe three patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , dysmorphic features and developmental delay .
Patients 1 and 2 have high and <START:PHENOTYPE> broad forehead <END> , deeply grooved philtrum , thick anteverted lobes and <START:PHENOTYPE> thick helix <END> .
Patient 1 also has dolicocephaly , sacral pit/dimple and toe crowding ; patient 2 shows <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> and short fifth toe .
Both patients have partial agenesis of corpus callosum .
Patient 3 has growth retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , thick lower lip and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
Using array-comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH) , we identified a 13q14 de novo deletion in patients 1 and 2 , while patient 3 had a 7q11 .21 maternally inherited deletion , probably not related to the disease .
Our results confirm that a distinct facial phenotype is related to a 13q14 deletion .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> and malformations without a peculiar facial phenotype may have a different deletion syndrome or a casual association of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Using array-CGH , we defined a critical region for <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and dysmorphic features .
We compared this deletion with a smaller one in a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( case 4 ) and identified two distinct critical regions , containing 30 genes .
Four genes appear to be good functional candidates for the neurological phenotype : NUFIP1 ( nuclear fragile X <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> protein 1 ) , HTR2A ( serotonin receptor 2A) , PCDH8 ( prothocaderin 8 ) and PCDH17 ( prothocaderin 17 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Macrocephaly <END> with hamartomas : Bannayan-Zonana syndrome .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> with mesodermal hamartomas is described as a distinct syndrome in nine individuals from four families .
Constant manifestations include symmetrical <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> without ventricular enlargement , mild neurological dysfunction , and <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth deceleration <END> .
Speech and motor delays observed in all the children were usually well compensated by adulthood .
Two children had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> which may have been related to intracerebral hemorrhage in one .
Mesodermal hamartomas were present in affected persons from all four families , with 60 % of individuals manifesting only discrete <START:PHENOTYPE> lipomas <END> and hemangiomas .
More serious tumors , including intracerebral hemangiomas , hemangiomatous involvement of the bone , and aggressive <START:PHENOTYPE> lipomas <END> occurred in 40% . Other findings that make it possible to delineate a recognizable syndrome include <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> ( 66% ) , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> ( 67% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hyperextensibility <END> (55% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> ( 22%) , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> amblyopia <END> ( 33% ) , and prolonged drooling ( 44% ) .
The Bannayan-Zonana syndrome is an autosomal-dominant trait with male predominance of affected individuals .
Linkage of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> iris hypoplasia <END> to the region of the Rieger syndrome locus ( 4q25 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Iris hypoplasia <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder which is frequently associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
This <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is usually resistant to medical therapy and can lead to blindness .
A large family of Scandinavian descent with a five generation history of <START:PHENOTYPE> iris hypoplasia <END> was studied .
Fifteen individuals were found to have <START:PHENOTYPE> iris hypoplasia <END> , nine of whom had associated <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
In an attempt to identify the chromosomal location of the disease-causing gene , this family was genotyped with short tandem repeat polymorphisms ( STRPs ) known to map to loci previously associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
The juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> locus at 1q25 and a congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> locus on 6p were both statistically excluded .
However , significant linkage was demonstrated at the Rieger syndrome locus at 4q25 .
The highest observed LOD score was 3.70 ( theta = 0 ) and was obtained with marker D4S1616 .
Three recombination events were observed in affected individuals that together demonstrate that the disease-causing gene lies between markers ACT3E03 and D4S1611 , an interval of approximately 7 cM . These results suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> iris hypoplasia <END> and Rieger syndrome are allelic .
LIS1- related isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> : spectrum of mutations and relationships with malformation severity .
With the largest data set of patients with LIS1- related <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , the major cause of posteriorly predominant <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> related to either LIS1 mutation or intragenic deletion , described so far , we aimed to refine the spectrum of neurological and radiological features and to assess relationships with the genotype .
Retrospective study .
Subjects A total of 63 patients with posteriorly predominant <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Of the 63 patients , 40 were found to carry either LIS1 point mutations ( 77 .5% ) or small genomic deletions (20% ) , and 1 carried a somatic nonsense mutation .
On the basis of the severity of neuromotor impairment , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and radiological findings , correlations with the location and type of mutation were examined .
Most patients with LIS1 mutations demonstrated posterior <START:PHENOTYPE> agyria <END> ( grade 3a , 55 .3% ) with thin corpus callosum (5 0% ) and prominent perivascular spaces ( 67 .4% ) .
By contrast , patients without LIS1 mutations tended to have less severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> ( grade 4a , 41 .6% ) and no additional brain abnormalities .
The degree of neuromotor impairment was in accordance with the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , with a high incidence of tetraplegia ( 61 .1% ) .
Conversely , the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> was not determined with the same reliability because 82 .9% had early onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and 48 .7% had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> more often than daily .
In addition , neither the mutation type nor the location of the mutation were found to predict the severity of LIS1- related <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Our results confirm the homogeneity profile of patients with LIS1- related <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> who demonstrate in a large proportion Dobyns <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> grade 3a , and the absence of correlation with LIS1 mutations .
Atrichia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> follicular hyperkeratosis <END> , chronic candidiasis , keratitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> : a severe manifestation of IFAP syndrome ?
A boy with congenital atrichia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicular , keratitis , cutaneous infections and a huge <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> , but without <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is reported .
We believe it represents a new case of a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> syndrome known as <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> syndrome ( IFAP ) .
The differential diagnosis from keratitis <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is discussed .
The cutaneous infections seen in our case suggest the possibility of considering a genetic link between these syndromes .
A missense mutation in CDH3 , encoding P-cadherin , causes <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile macular dystrophy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by early hair loss heralding severe degenerative changes of the retinal macula and culminating in <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> during the second to third decade of life .
Recently , we identified a frameshift mutation in the CDH3 gene encoding P-cadherin as the proximal cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> in four families .
We report here another consanguineous family in which four members were diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile macular dystrophy.
Light and scanning electron microscopy revealed in all patients morphologic hair shaft abnormalities consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> pili torti <END> .
Ocular fundus examination disclosed marked degeneration of the macular pigment epithelium .
Electrophysiologic studies were diagnostic for severe retinal dysfunction .
DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding sequence of CDH3 revealed in all affected individuals a homozygous missense mutation resulting in a single amino acid substitution at position 503 of P-cadherin sequence ( R503H ) .
The mutation completely segregated with the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> phenotype in the family but was not detectable in 83 healthy , unrelated controls .
The amino acid substitution affects a highly conserved residue and is predicted to alter a Ca2+ binding domain of P-cadherin .
This is the first pathogenic missense mutation reported in CDH3 and the second mutation found to underlie <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile macular dystrophy.
Our data establish recessive mutations in CDH3 as the molecular cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> and expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of this intriguing disorder .
New mental retardation syndrome associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular colobomas <END> , cleft palate , and genital , skeletal , and craniofacial abnormalities .
We describe three Canadian brothers of Cree origin , with a previously undescribed pattern of malformation including distinctive craniofacial abnormalities with <START:PHENOTYPE> triangular facies <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , low-set and <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular colobomas <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> with widely separated sutures , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft soft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid scrotum <END> and hypospadius , wide <START:PHENOTYPE> webbed neck <END> , webbed fingers , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> and hypersegmented sternum , and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> .
The presence of normal brain imaging and physical growth distinguishes them from other syndromes with overlapping abnormalities .
This is either an X-linked or <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition .

Diagnostic criteria for Walker-Warburg syndrome .
Walker-Warburg syndrome ( WWS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder manifest by characteristic brain and eye malformations .
We reviewed data on 21 of our patients and an additional 42 patients from the literature .
From this review , we expand the phenotype to include <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> ( CMD ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and/or palate ( CLP) , and revise the diagnostic criteria .
Four abnormalities were present in all patients checked for these anomalies : <START:PHENOTYPE> type II lissencephaly <END> ( 21/21) , cerebellar malformation (20/20) , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal malformation <END> ( 18 /18 ) , and CMD ( 14 /14 ) .
We propose that these comprise necessary and sufficient diagnostic criteria for WWS .
Two other frequently observed abnormalities , ventricular dilatation with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> (20/21 ) and anterior chamber malformation ( 16/21) , are helpful but not necessary diagnostic criteria because they were not constant .
All other abnormalities occurred less frequently .
Congenital macrocephaly with <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( 11 / 19 ) was more common than congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( 3/19 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> (1 0/19 ) was sometimes associated with posterior cephalocele ( 5/21 ) .
Additional abnormalities included slit-like ventricles ( 1/21) , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> ( 8/21) , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular colobomas <END> ( 3/15 ) , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> ( 7/20) , genital anomalies in males ( 5/8 ) , and CLP ( 4/21 ) .
Median survival in our series was 9 months .
A related <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder , Fukuyama <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> , consists of similar but less severe brain changes and CMD . It differs from WWS because of consistently less frequent and severe cerebellar and retinal abnormalities .
We think that WWS is identical to " cerebro-oculo-muscular syndrome " and " muscle , eye , and brain disease. "
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , hypotonia , severe psychomotor retardation , and cerebral malformations : a second family with micro syndrome or a new syndrome ?
We report on four children of both sexes from a highly inbred family with hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic diplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and cerebral malformations .
Six other children may also have been affected .
The differential diagnosis and the possibility of a second family with the micro syndrome are discussed .
Digenic inheritance of early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> : CYP1B1 , a potential modifier gene .
" Early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> " refers to genetically heterogeneous conditions for which <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> manifests at age 5-40 years and for which only a small subset is molecularly characterized .
We studied the role of MYOC , CYP1B1 , and PITX2 in a population ( n=60 ) affected with juvenile or early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> from the greater Toronto area .
By a combination of single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct cycle sequencing , MYOC mutations were detected in 8 ( 13.3% ) of the 60 individuals , CYP1B1 mutations were detected in 3 ( 5% ) of the 60 individuals , and no PITX2 mutations were detected .
The range of phenotypic expression associated with MYOC and CYP1B1 mutations was greater than expected .
MYOC mutations included cases of juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> with or without pigmentary <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and mixed-mechanism <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
CYP1B1 mutations involved cases of juvenile open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , as well as cases of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
The study of a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> showed the segregation of both MYOC and CYP1B1 mutations with disease ; however , in this family , the mean age at onset of carriers of the MYOC mutation alone was 51 years ( range 48-64 years ) , whereas carriers of both the MYOC and CYP1B1 mutations had an average age at onset of 27 years ( range 23-38 years ) ( P=.001 ) .
This work emphasizes the genetic heterogeneity of juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and suggests , for the first time , that (1 ) congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> are allelic variants and (2 ) the spectrum of expression of MYOC and CYP1B1 mutations is greater than expected .
We also propose that CYP1B1 may act as a modifier of MYOC expression and that these two genes may interact through a common pathway .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> , distinctive face , mental retardation , brachydactyly , and genital abnormalities .
We report on three individuals of Muslim Arab origin from a village located in Northern Israel affected by an apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome characterized by distinctive facial phenotype of which the most prominent feature is <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> .
The other clinical features of the syndrome include variable degree of mental retardation , genital abnormalities dominated by <START:PHENOTYPE> short penis <END> , and skeletal abnormalities including chest deformity ( combination of upper <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus carinatum <END> with lower pectus excavatum) , and short palms with broad <START:PHENOTYPE> short fingers <END> .
Affected individuals displayed distinctive facial features including <START:PHENOTYPE> upslanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thick eyebrows <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> wide mouth <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin upper lip <END> and upturned corners of the mouth , widow 's peak , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , and simple ears with fleshy <START:PHENOTYPE> overfolded helices <END> .
This phenotype does not fully meet typical diagnostic features of any known condition .
The expanding phenotype of GLUT1-deficiency syndrome .
Transport of glucose from the bloodstream across the blood-brain barrier to the central nervous system is facilitated by glucose transport protein type 1 ( GLUT1 ) , the first member of the solute carrier family 2 ( SLC2 ) .
Heterozygous mutations in the GLUT1 / SLC2A1 gene , occurring de novo or inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait , result in cerebral energy failure and a clinical condition termed GLUT1-deficiency syndrome ( GLUT1 - DS ) .
Clinical features usually comprise motor and mental <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> infantile onset <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deceleration of head growth <END> often resulting in acquired microcephaly , and a movement disorder with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> .
Subsequent to the delineation of this classic phenotype the variability of signs and symptoms in GLUT1 - DS is being recognized .
Patients with (i ) carbohydrate-responsive symptoms , with ( ii ) predominant <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , but without <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and with ( iii ) paroxysmal exertion-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> dyskinesia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> have been reported .
Common laboratory hallmark in all phenotypes is the reduced glucose level in cerebrospinal fluid with lowered CSF-to-blood glucose ratio .
Treatment with a ketogenic diet results in marked improvement of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and movement disorders .
Type I <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> includes two clinically and genetically distinct entities with either renal or multiple target organ defects .
Type I <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> ( PHA ) is a hereditary disease characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> salt wasting <END> resulting from target organ unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids .
We have studied two kindreds including a total of nine patients with PHA .
In kindred I , the propositus presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal salt wasting <END> in infancy ( <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , short stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyponatremia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> ) and responded dramatically to a high salt diet ( 2.5 g/day ) .
Sodium supplementation was discontinued at the age of two .
In seven additional family members from three generations , clinical expression of PHA varied from asymptomatic to moderate .
In affected members ( propositus , mother , and two brothers ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperaldosteronism <END> persisted over 13 yr ; however , the PRA decreased gradually to near normal values .
Persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperaldosteronism <END> in the face of a decrease in PRA indicated the development of tertiary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperaldosteronism <END> due to autonomously functioning zona glomerulosa .
The pedigree was consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode of transmission with variable expression .
In kindred II , the propositus , who was the product of a consanguineous marriage , developed severe renal salt losing at age 9 days .
She had also increased salivary and sweat electrolytes consistent with PHA resulting from multiple organ unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids .
Life threatening episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> salt wasting <END> recurred beyond the age of 2 yr . At 5 yr of age she still requires high amounts of salt supplements ( 14 g/day ) .
A sister died at 9 days of age with PHA symptoms .
Six close relatives ( parents , three siblings , maternal uncle ) showed no biochemical abnormalities .
This pedigree was consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance .
In view of the findings on these two kindreds and the analysis of those in the literature , we conclude that type I PHA includes two clinically and genetically distinct entities with either renal or multiple target organ defects .
UBE2A deficiency syndrome : Mild to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , absent speech , urogenital , and skin anomalies in male patients .
We describe three patients with a comparable deletion encompassing SLC25A43 , SLC25A5 , CXorf56 , UBE2A , NKRF , and two non-coding RNA genes , U1 and LOC100303728 . Moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> ( ID) , psychomotor retardation , severely impaired/absent speech , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and urogenital anomalies were present in all three patients .
Facial dysmorphisms include ocular hypertelorism , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> .
These clinical features overlap with those described in two patients from a family with a similar deletion at Xq24 that also includes UBE2A , and in several patients of Brazilian and Polish families with point mutations in UBE2A.
Notably , all five patients with an Xq24 deletion have ventricular septal defects that are not present in patients with a point mutation , which might be attributed to the deletion of SLC25A5 .
Taken together , the UBE2A deficiency syndrome in male patients with a mutation in or a deletion of UBE2A is characterized by ID , absent speech , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , urogenital anomalies , frequently including a <START:PHENOTYPE> small penis <END> , and skin abnormalities , which include generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low posterior hairline <END> , myxedematous appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> widely spaced nipples <END> , and hair whorls .
Facial dysmorphisms include a wide face , a <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> large mouth <END> with downturned corners , thin vermilion , and a short , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad neck <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis verticis gyrata <END> of the scalp , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , cataracts , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in two brothers .
We describe the cases of two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , primary <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis verticis gyrata <END> of the scalp , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent supraorbital ridges <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> exotropia <END> , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , cataracts , sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
A review of the literature focusing on the major clinical findings suggests that our cases may represent a hitherto unreported new syndrome .

Role of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> in human disease .
Resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is present in the majority of patients with impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT) or non-insulin-dependent <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> ( NIDDM ) and in approximately 25% of nonobese individuals with normal oral glucose tolerance .
In these conditions , deterioration of glucose tolerance can only be prevented if the beta-cell is able to increase its insulin secretory response and maintain a state of chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> .
When this goal cannot be achieved , gross decompensation of glucose homeostasis occurs .
The relationship between <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , plasma insulin level , and glucose intolerance is mediated to a significant degree by changes in ambient plasma free-fatty acid ( FFA ) concentration .
Patients with NIDDM are also resistant to insulin suppression of plasma FFA concentration , but plasma FFA concentrations can be reduced by relatively small increments in insulin concentration .
Consequently , elevations of circulating plasma FFA concentration can be prevented if large amounts of insulin can be secreted .
If <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> cannot be maintained , plasma FFA concentration will not be suppressed normally , and the resulting increase in plasma FFA concentration will lead to increased hepatic glucose production .
Because these events take place in individuals who are quite resistant to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake , it is apparent that even small increases in hepatic glucose production are likely to lead to significant fasting <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperglycemia <END> under these conditions .
Although <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> may prevent frank decompensation of glucose homeostasis in insulin-resistant individuals , this compensatory response of the endocrine pancreas is not without its price .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , treated or untreated , are insulin resistant , hyperglycemic , and hyperinsulinemic .
In addition , a direct relationship between plasma insulin concentration and blood pressure has been noted .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertension <END> can also be produced in normal rats when they are fed a fructose-enriched diet , an intervention that also leads to the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> .
The development of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> in normal rats by an experimental manipulation known to induce <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> provides further support for the view that the relationship between the three variables may be a causal one.( ABSTR ACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS )
A cytogenetic abnormality and rare coding variants identify ABCA13 as a candidate gene in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , bipolar disorder , and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Schizophrenia <END> and bipolar disorder are leading causes of morbidity across all populations , with heritability estimates of approximately 80% indicating a substantial genetic component .
Population genetics and genome-wide association studies suggest an overlap of genetic risk factors between these illnesses but it is unclear how this genetic component is divided between common gene polymorphisms , rare genomic copy number variants , and rare gene sequence mutations .
We report evidence that the lipid transporter gene ABCA13 is a susceptibility factor for both <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and bipolar disorder .
After the initial discovery of its disruption by a chromosome abnormality in a person with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , we resequenced ABCA13 exons in 100 cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and 100 controls .
Multiple rare coding variants were identified including one nonsense and nine missense mutations and compound heterozygosity /homozygosity in six cases . Variants were genotyped in additional <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , bipolar , <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> ( n > 1600) , and control ( n > 950 ) cohorts and the frequency of all rare variants combined was greater than controls in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ( OR = 1 .93 , p = 0.0057 ) and bipolar disorder ( OR = 2.71 , p = 0.00007 ) .
The population attributable risk of these mutations was 2.2% for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and 4. 0% for bipolar disorder .
In a study of 21 families of mutation carriers , we genotyped affected and unaffected relatives and found significant linkage ( LOD = 4.3 ) of rare variants with a phenotype including <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , bipolar disorder , and major <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> .
These data identify a candidate gene , highlight the genetic overlap between <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , bipolar disorder , and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , and suggest that rare coding variants may contribute significantly to risk of these disorders .
Monogenic nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> : audiological and linkage analysis in a large Greek pedigree .
The aim of our study was to characterize the <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> in a large multigenerational Greek family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> and to perform genetic linkage analysis to known <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> loci and collagen genes .
In addition , we looked for mutations in the NOG gene to rule out congenital stapes ankylosis syndrome .
Audiological analysis of the affected persons was based on multiple linear regression ( MLR ) analysis and construction of age-related typical audiograms ( ARTA ) .
Genotyping of microsatellite DNA polymorphisms for known <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> ( OTSC ) loci or collagen genes and linkage analysis using the MLINK computer program were performed .
The coding region of the NOG gene was screened for mutations by direct DNA sequencing .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> in this family appears in childhood as conductive , but soon becomes mixed .
Because the additional sensorineural component is progressive , this finally has lead to a pure sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> in some family members , as the conductive component is masked .
Audiological analysis showed an age-independent conductive component and a progressive frequency-specific sensorineural component .
Linkage analysis excluded linkage to the four known <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> loci ( OTS C1 , OTSC2 , OTSC3 , and OTSC5 ) , as well as to the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes .
Mutation analysis of the coding region of the NOG gene did not reveal any disease causing mutation .
This study represents the first description of a detailed audiological analysis in a large pedigree segregating <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> as a monogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
Exclusion of the four known <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> loci in this family shows that monogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> is a genetically heterogeneous disease involving at least five different genes .
A mutation in the NOG gene is not the underlying molecular mechanism of the early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> segregating in this family .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ambiguous genitalia <END> associated with skeletal abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> craniostenosis <END> , psychomotor retardation , and facial abnormalities ( SCARF syndrome ) .
We describe 2 male maternal first cousins , 7 years and 7 months old , with a previously unreported pattern of malformations including <START:PHENOTYPE> lax skin <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hyperextensibility <END> , umbilical and inguinal herniae , <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus carinatum <END> , several abnormally shaped vertebrae , <START:PHENOTYPE> enamel hypoplasia <END> and hypocalcification of the teeth , facial abnormalities and wide <START:PHENOTYPE> webbed neck <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> , multiple nodular liver tumors , and mild psychomotor retardation .
The occurrence of 2 male children related through their mothers suggests the possibility of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive inheritance <END> .
It is proposed to call this disorder the SCARF syndrome ( skeletal abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> craniostenosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> , retardation , facial abnormalities ) .
Characterization of a 8q21.11 microdeletion syndrome associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> and a recognizable phenotype .
We report eight unrelated individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> and overlapping submicroscopic deletions of 8q21.11 ( 0.66-13.55 Mb in size ) .
The deletion was familial in one and simplex in seven individuals .
The phenotype was remarkably similar and consisted of a <START:PHENOTYPE> round face <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> full cheeks <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , cornea opacities , an underdeveloped alae , a <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , a cupid 's bow of the upper lip , down-turned corners of the mouth , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , low-set and <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent ears <END> , and mild finger and toe anomalies ( <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> , and broadening of the first rays ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Intellectual disability <END> , hypotonia , decreased balance , sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , and unusual behavior were frequently observed .
A high-resolution oligonucleotide array showed different proximal and distal breakpoints in all of the individuals .
Sequencing studies in three of the individuals revealed that proximal and distal breakpoints were located in unique sequences with no apparent homology .
The smallest region of overlap was a 539.7 kb interval encompassing three genes : a Zinc Finger Homeobox 4 ( ZFHX4) , one microRNA of unknown function , and one nonfunctional pseudogen .
ZFHX4 encodes a transcription factor expressed in the adult human brain , skeletal muscle , and liver .
It has been suggested as a candidate gene for congenital bilateral isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> .
Our results suggest that the 8q21.11 submicroscopic deletion represents a clinically recognizable entity and that a haploinsufficient gene or genes within the minimal deletion region could underlie this syndrome .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Urticaria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthralgia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> without amyloidosis : another variant of the Muckle-Wells syndrome ?
The term Muckle-Wells syndrome ( MWS ) describes an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterised by various combinations of <START:PHENOTYPE> urticaria <END> , sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , amyloidosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthralgia <END> and skeletal abnormalities .
We describe a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> and several symptoms of MWS , but no evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> or amyloidosis .
Since <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> without amyloidosis has never been reported in MWS , but <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is a feature of all reported pedigrees , we conclude that members of this family have a previously unreported inherited predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> urticaria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthralgia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> which is distinct from the MWS phenotype .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small hands <END> and feet , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is linked to Xq28 . Of the gene-rich regions of the human genome , Xq28 is the most densely mapped .
Mutations of genes in this band are responsible for 10 syndromal forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and 5 nonsyndromal forms .
Clinical and molecular studies reported here add an additional syndromic form of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) to this region .
The condition comprises <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small hands <END> and feet , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
One affected male died at age 19 years in status epilepticus , but others have survived to old age .
Carrier females do not have somatic anomalies or <START:PHENOTYPE> mental impairment <END> .
The gene is localized to the terminal 8 Mb of Xq28 with markers distal to DXS8011 showing linkage to the disorder with a lod score of 2.11 at zero recombination .

Clinical features and management issues in Mowat-Wilson syndrome .
Mowat-Wilson syndrome ( MWS ) is a relatively newly described multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome .
Haploinsufficiency of a gene termed ZFHX1B ( also known as SIP1 ) on chromosome 2 is responsible for this condition , and clinical genetic testing for MWS recently became available .
The majority of reports in the literature originate from Northern Europe and Australia .
Here we report our clinical experience with 12 patients diagnosed with MWS within a 2-year period of time in the United States , with particular emphasis on clinical characteristics and management strategies .
Individuals with this condition have characteristic facial features , including <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , medially flared and broad eyebrows , prominent columella , <START:PHENOTYPE> pointed chin <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> uplifted earlobes <END> , which typically prompt the clinician to consider the diagnosis .
Medical issues in our cohort of patients included <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( 75% ) with no predeliction for any particular <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> type ; <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> (6 0 % of our patients studied ) ; congenital heart defects ( 75% ) , particularly involving the pulmonary arteries and/or valves ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> (55 % of males ) ; severely impaired or <START:PHENOTYPE> absent speech <END> (100% of individuals over 1 year of age ) with relatively spared receptive language ; and <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> (5 0% ) or chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> ( 25% ) .
The incidence of MWS is unknown , but based on the number of patients identified in a short period of time within the US , it is likely greatly under recognized .
MWS should be considered in any individual with severely impaired or <START:PHENOTYPE> absent speech <END> , especially in the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and anomalies involving the pulmonary arteries ( particularly <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary artery sling <END> ) or pulmonary valves .

Variable expressivity of the clinical and biochemical phenotype associated with the apolipoprotein E p.Leu149del mutation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Splenomegaly <END> with sea-blue histiocytes , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> is a very rare association that has been described in only one report to date .
The molecular defect in the two reported patients consists in a deletion of a leucine at position 149 in the receptor-binding region of the apoE molecule .
Here , we report on another family in whom the proband and his brother were diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> .
An apoE p.Leu149del mutation was found in both subjects .
A large beta band in the VLDL fraction and elevated VLDL cholesterol-to-plasma triglyceride ratio was observed in the proband only .
Their mother , presenting with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , also carried the same p.Leu149del mutation .
The coexistence of factors facilitating the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> and/or low HDL-cholesterol level could explain why the proband and his brother developed a <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , whereas the mother did not .
Moreover , the presence of an apoE2 allele in the proband likely explains the more severe phenotype we observed in this subject .
In conclusion , the apoE p.Leu149del mutation results in a very striking phenotype including one or all symptoms among <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , and should be considered as a differential diagnosis of storage disorders in the causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> with sea-blue histiocytes .
The gene responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ( CPX ) in a British Columbia native kindred is localized between PGK1 and DXYS1 .
Human craniofacial malformations are a class of common congenital anomalies in which the etiology is heterogeneous and often poorly understood .
To better delineate the molecular basis of craniofacial development , we have undertaken a series of experiments directed toward the isolation of a gene involved in human secondary palate formation .
DNA marker linkage studies have been performed in a large British Columbia ( B.C. ) Native family in which <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> segregates as an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> trait .
We have examined 62 family members , including 15 affected males and 8 obligate carrier females .
A previous clinical description of the clefting defect in this kindred included submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and bifid or absent uvula .
Our recent reevaluation of the family has indicated that <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> ( tongue-tie ) is also a feature of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> in some of the affected males and carrier females .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ankyloglossia <END> has previously been associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> in an Icelandic kindred in which a gene responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ( CPX ) was assigned to the Xq21.3-q22 region between DXYS12 and DXS17 .
For the B.C . kindred reported here , we have mapped the gene responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> to a more proximal position on the X chromosome .
No recombination was observed between B.C . CPX and the DNA marker DXS72 ( peak lod score [Zmax ] = 7.44 at recombination fraction [theta] = .0 ) localized to Xq21.1 .
Recombination was observed between CPX and PGK1 ( Zmax = 7.35 at theta = .03 ) and between CPX and DXYS1 ( Zmax = 5.59 at theta = .04 ) .
These recombination events localize B.C . CPX between PGK1 and DXYS1 in the Xq13-q21.31 region .
Thin-basement-membrane nephropathy in adults with persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Thin-basement-membrane nephropathy , also called benign recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , is characterized by diffuse thinning of the glomerular basement membrane and by <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
To determine the incidence of thin-basement-membrane nephropathy among patients with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , we conducted a prospective study in the nephrology units of three large hospitals in the Netherlands .
Eighty normotensive adults without azotemia underwent renal biopsy because of recurrent macroscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> ( n = 26 ) or persistent microscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> ( n = 54 ) . Idiopathic IgA nephropathy was found in 27 of the 80 patients .
Light microscopical examination showed that 42 patients had normal renal tissue .
The remaining 11 patients had mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis ( n = 5 ) , interstitial nephritis ( n = 3) , or focal global glomerulosclerosis ( n = 3 ) . Tissue from the 42 patients whose renal biopsy specimens were normal when examined with light microscopy was analyzed morphometrically with electron microscopy to determine the thickness of the glomerular basement membrane .
Two subsets of patients were identified by this analysis .
In 18 , thin-basement-membrane nephropathy was found ( mean basement-membrane thickness [ + /- SE] , 191 +/- 28 nm ; normal , 350 +/- 43 nm ) ; all but one of these 18 patients had microscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , which persisted during follow-up ( median duration , 50 months ) .
( Of the 54 patients who presented with microscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , 17 [31 percent ] had thin-basement-membrane nephropathy. )
The thickness of the glomerular basement membrane was normal in the other 24 patients ( 361 +/- 69 nm ) ; during follow-up , <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> disappeared in all 13 of these patients who had macroscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> resolved in 5 of the 11 patients who had microscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
We conclude that in patients with persistent microscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , the incidence of thin-basement-membrane nephropathy is similar to that of idiopathic IgA nephropathy.
Morphometric analysis of the thickness of the glomerular basement membrane should be included in the workup of adults with persistent microscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> that is not of urologic origin .
Brain anomalies , retardation of mentality and growth , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> , skeletal malformations , <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> , ear deformity and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , eye hypoplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and kidney dysplasia/hypoplasia ( BRESEK/BRESHECK ) : new X-linked syndrome ?
Two half brothers ( maternally related ) had a similar syndrome of microhydrocephaly in both brothers and dilatation of the spinal canal with fusion of thalami in one brother .
Primordial growth delay was noted in both brothers , with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in the surviving brother .
Both had <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> with scaling , hyperkeratosis , and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , but normal sweat and sebaceous glands .
Skeletal anomalies included hemivertebrae with abnormal segmentation in one and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> with polydactyly in the other .
Ears were apparently low set , large , and protruding , with mixed <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> in the brother who survived .
Eye anomalies included maldevelopment of one eye in Patient 1 and small optic nerves more noticeable on one side in Patient 2 . Both had <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> and dysplastic/hypoplastic kidneys of varying severity that resulted in the early postnatal death of one sib .
Manifestations present in only one or the other sib included submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , aganglionosis of the rectum and colon , agenesis of one testicle , and single umbilical artery .
This syndrome has not been described previously and may be due to an X-linked mutation .
The acronym BRESEK reflects the common findings , whereas BRESHECK denotes all manifestations of both patients : brain , retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> , skeletal deformities , <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> , ear/eye anomalies , cleft palate/cryptorchidism , and kidney dysplasia/hypoplasia .
In addition to an X-linked mutation , a contiguous gene deletion or maternal mosaicism of an autosomal dominant gene must be considered .
Clinical review : Thyrotoxic <START:PHENOTYPE> periodic paralysis <END> : a diagnostic challenge .
The aim of this article was to review the clinical presentation , pathogenesis , and management of thyrotoxic <START:PHENOTYPE> periodic paralysis <END> ( TPP ) .
A MEDLINE search was conducted for articles published during the last 40 yr based on the key words thyrotoxic <START:PHENOTYPE> periodic paralysis <END> and hypokalemic <START:PHENOTYPE> periodic paralysis <END> .
A total of 281 primary articles and 168 references of the retrieved articles were also reviewed .
TPP is a common complication of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> in Asian men but is increasingly seen in Western countries .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypokalemia <END> and muscle paralysis results from a sudden intracellular shift of potassium and is not due to potassium deficiency .
Clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> in patients with TPP may be subtle .
Immediate potassium supplementation prevents serious cardiopulmonary complications and may hasten the recovery of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> .
Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers can ameliorate and prevent recurrence of the paralytic attacks .
This <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic paralysis <END> will remit with definitive control of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> .
Increased sodium-potassium ATPase pump activity and enhanced insulin response in patients with TPP is postulated to contribute to the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemia <END> .
The genetic predisposition for TPP is not entirely clear .
Association of polymorphisms of the calcium channel alpha1-subunit gene with TPP has been noted .
Due to population mobility , TPP is increasingly common in Western countries .
Early diagnosis and prompt treatment prevent life-threatening complications associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> .
Assaying of thyroid function in patients with hypokalemic paralysis distinguishes TPP from other forms of hypokalemic <START:PHENOTYPE> periodic paralysis <END> .
SLC34A3 mutations in patients with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> predict a key role for the sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaPi-IIc in maintaining phosphate homeostasis .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> ( HHRH ) is a rare disorder of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> that was first described in a large consanguineous Bedouin kindred .
HHRH is characterized by the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> secondary to <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> , radiographic and/or histological evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> , limb deformities , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> bone pain <END> .
HHRH is distinct from other forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> in that affected individuals present with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> due to increased serum 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D levels and increased intestinal calcium absorption .
We performed a genomewide linkage scan combined with homozygosity mapping , using genomic DNA from a large consanguineous Bedouin kindred that included 10 patients who received the diagnosis of HHRH .
The disease mapped to a 1.6-Mbp region on chromosome 9q34 , which contains SLC34A3 , the gene encoding the renal sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaP(i )-IIc.
Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a homozygous single-nucleotide deletion ( c.228delC ) in this candidate gene in all individuals affected by HHRH .
This mutation is predicted to truncate the NaP(i )-IIc protein in the first membrane-spanning domain and thus likely results in a complete loss of function of this protein in individuals homozygous for c.228delC .
In addition , compound heterozygous missense and deletion mutations were found in three additional unrelated HHRH kindreds , which supports the conclusion that this disease is caused by SLC34A3 mutations affecting both alleles .
Individuals of the investigated kindreds who were heterozygous for a SLC34A3 mutation frequently showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> , often in association with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> and/or elevations in 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D levels .
We conclude that NaP(i )-IIc has a key role in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis .
Deletion of the CUL4B gene in a boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , minor facial anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , and ataxia .
The CUL4B gene encodes a member of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex .
Point mutations in CUL4B were identified recently in patients with syndromic X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) .
Here , using oligoarray-based comparative genomic hybridization ( array CGH) , we identified a de novo deletion of the CUL4B gene in a boy with syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , minor facial anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed puberty <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> relative macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gait ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , all manifestations described previously in patients with CUL4B point mutations .
Interestingly , our patient also presented with aortic valvular "dysplasia " and vertebral anomalies similar to those seen in Scheuermann disease , both of which may also be part of this syndrome .
This report further suggests that point mutations and deletions of the CUL4B gene lead to a recognizable phenotype .
The association of facial anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> gait ataxia <END> in a mentally retarded boy should prompt molecular analyses of the CUL4B gene .
A newly recognized neuroectodermal syndrome of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> , deafness , and hypogonadism .
We describe a large , three generation kindred in which 16 individuals were affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , hyposmia or <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive deafness <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> , and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> atresia of the external auditory canal <END> , hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to LH/FSH deficiency , and a greater than normal tendency to <START:PHENOTYPE> dental caries <END> .
Variable manifestations include mild <START:PHENOTYPE> facial asymmetry <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
This seems to be a previously undescribed pleiotropic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait with variable expressivity .
The manifestations can be explained on the basis of involvement of the ectoderm and neuroectoderm of the first and second branchial arches , of Rathke 's pouch , and of the diencephalon .
Clinical and genetic analysis of two Tunisian <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> families .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Otosclerosis <END> is caused by an abnormal bone homeostasis of the otic capsule resulting in a conductive <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> when the free motion of the stapes is compromised .
An additional sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> arises in some patients , most likely due to otosclerotic foci that invade the cochlear endosteum .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Otosclerosis <END> is a very common <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> among Caucasians with a prevalence of about 0.3- 0.4% among white adults .
In the majority of cases , <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> can be considered as a complex disease , caused by both genetic as environmental factors , but <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> exist .
However , families large enough for genetic analysis are very rare and often show <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced penetrance <END> .
To date five loci have been reported , but none of the genes have been cloned yet .
In this study , we analyzed two new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> families from Tunisia , and genotyped them with microsatellite markers for the known loci , the collagen genes COL1A1 and COL1A2 , and NOG gene .
In the family LK , linkage to all known loci was excluded .
However , the family LS shows suggestive linkage to the OTSC3 region on chromosome 6p21.3-p22.3 .
This result points out that , besides the five reported loci , there must be at least one additional locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> ( SEMDJL ) : presentation in two unrelated patients in the United States .
This is a report of two North American patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> , an uncommon <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal dysplasia <END> rarely reported outside of South Africa .
Patients with SEMDJL have vertebral abnormalities and ligamentous laxity that results in spinal misalignment and progressive severe <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , thoracic asymmetry , and respiratory compromise resulting in early death .
Nonaxial skeletal involvement includes elbow deformities with <START:PHENOTYPE> radial head dislocation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dislocated hips <END> , clubbed feet , and tapered fingers with spatulate distal phalanges .
Many affected children have an <START:PHENOTYPE> oval face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat midface <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent eyes <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> .
Palatal abnormalities and congenital heart disease are also observed .
Diagnosis in infancy may be difficult because many of the typical findings are not apparent early and only evolve over time .
We review the physical and radiographic findings in two unrelated patients with this disorder in order to increase the awareness of this disorder , particularly for clinicians outside of South Africa .

von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease in thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> and the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> .
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> and the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> are severe microvascular disorders of platelet clumping with similar signs and symptoms .
Unusually large multimers of von Willebrand factor , capable of agglutinating circulating platelets under high shear stress , occur in the two conditions .
We investigated the prevalence of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease deficiency in patients with familial and nonfamilial forms of these disorders .
Plasma samples were obtained from 53 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> .
Von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease was assayed in diluted plasma samples with purified normal von Willebrand factor as the substrate .
The extent of the degradation of von Willebrand factor was assessed by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gels and immunoblotting .
To determine whether an inhibitor of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease was present , we measured the protease activity in normal plasma after incubation with plasma from the patients .
We examined 30 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> and 23 patients with the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> .
Of 24 patients with nonfamilial thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> , 20 had severe and 4 had moderate protease deficiency during an acute event .
An inhibitor found in 20 of these patients was shown to be IgG in five of five tested plasma samples .
Of 13 patients with nonfamilial <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> , 11 had normal levels of activity of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease during the acute episode , whereas in 2 patients , the activity was slightly decreased .
All 6 patients with familial thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> lacked von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease activity but had no inhibitor , whereas all 10 patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> had normal protease activity .
In vitro proteolytic degradation of von Willebrand factor by the protease was studied in 5 patients with familial and 7 patients with nonfamilial <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> and was normal in all 12 patients .
Nonfamilial thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> is due to an inhibitor of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease , whereas the familial form seems to be caused by a constitutional deficiency of the protease .
Patients with the hemolyticuremic syndrome do not have a deficiency of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease or a defect in von Willebrand factor that leads to its resistance to protease .
Microdeletion/duplication at 15q13.2q13.3 among individuals with features of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and other neuropsychiatric disorders .
Segmental duplications at breakpoints ( BP4-BP5 ) of chromosome 15q13.2q13.3 mediate a recurrent genomic imbalance syndrome associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and/or electroencephalogram ( EEG ) abnormalities .
DNA samples from 1445 unrelated patients submitted consecutively for clinical array comparative genomic hybridisation ( CGH ) testing at Children 's Hospital Boston and DNA samples from 1441 individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> from 751 families in the <START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> Genetic Resource Exchange ( AGRE ) repository .
We report the clinical features of five patients with a BP4-BP5 deletion , three with a BP4-BP5 duplication , and two with an overlapping but smaller duplication identified by whole genome high resolution oligonucleotide array CGH . These BP4-BP5 deletion cases exhibit minor dysmorphic features , significant expressive language deficits , and a spectrum of neuropsychiatric impairments that include <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorder , <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <END> , anxiety disorder , and mood disorder .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cognitive impairment <END> varied from <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate mental retardation <END> to normal IQ with learning disability .
BP4-BP5 covers approximately 1.5 Mb ( chr15 :28.719-30.298 Mb ) and includes six reference genes and 1 miRNA gene , while the smaller duplications cover approximately 500 kb ( chr15 :28.902-29.404 Mb ) and contain three reference genes and one miRNA gene .
The BP4-BP5 deletion and duplication events span CHRNA7 , a candidate gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
However , none of these individuals reported here have <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , although two have an <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal EEG <END> .
The phenotype of chromosome 15q13.2q13.3 BP4-BP5 microdeletion/duplication syndrome may include features of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorder , a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> .
Recognition of this broader phenotype has implications for clinical diagnostic testing and efforts to understand the underlying aetiology of this syndrome .
STAT4 and the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Rheumatoid arthritis <END> is a chronic inflammatory disease with a substantial genetic component .
Susceptibility to disease has been linked with a region on chromosome 2q .
We tested single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in and around 13 candidate genes within the previously linked chromosome 2q region for association with <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
We then performed fine mapping of the STAT1 - STAT4 region in a total of 1620 case patients with established <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> and 2635 controls , all from North America . Implicated SNPs were further tested in an independent case-control series of 1529 patients with early <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> and 881 controls , all from Sweden , and in a total of 1039 case patients and 1248 controls from three series of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .
A SNP haplotype in the third intron of STAT4 was associated with susceptibility to both <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .
The minor alleles of the haplotype-defining SNPs were present in 27% of chromosomes of patients with established <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> , as compared with 22% of those of controls ( for the SNP rs7574865 , P=2.81x10( -7 ) ; odds ratio for having the risk allele in chromosomes of patients vs . those of controls , 1.32 ) .
The association was replicated in Swedish patients with recent-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( P= 0.02 ) and matched controls .
The haplotype marked by rs7574865 was strongly associated with lupus , being present on 31 % of chromosomes of case patients and 22% of those of controls ( P=1.87x10( -9 ) ; odds ratio for having the risk allele in chromosomes of patients vs . those of controls , 1.55 ) .
Homozygosity of the risk allele , as compared with absence of the allele , was associated with a more than doubled risk for lupus and a 60 % increased risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
A haplotype of STAT4 is associated with increased risk for both <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> , suggesting a shared pathway for these illnesses .

Familial cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , epilepsy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> : a distinct clinical entity ?
To describe a European family with cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , epilepsy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , the pedigree of which indicates an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> of the disease .
Clinical , laboratory , neurophysiological , and neuroimaging data were studied .
Institute for research on <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Two siblings ( aged 25 and 28 years ) and their 49-year-old mother had postural and action <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , seizures , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Only <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> was present in the maternal grandmother ( aged 68 years ) .
The electroencephalogram showed diffuse spike-and-wave complexes and/or posterior spikes , and a photoparoxysmal response in the 4 subjects .
The typical electrophysiologic features of cortical reflex myoclonus , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> giant somatosensory evoked potentials <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> enhancement of the C-reflex <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> jerk-locked premyoclonus spikes <END> , were found in all patients .
This syndrome may represent a specific form of familial cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> with a benign form of epilepsy and a new genetic model of cortical hyperexcitability inherited with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mechanism .
Prevalence , genetics , and clinical features of patients carrying podocin mutations in steroid-resistant nonfamilial <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> .
Podocin mutations ( NPHS2 gene ) are responsible for the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> of steroid-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
As a result of a screening for these gene alterations in a cohort of Italian patients with nonfamilial <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> and histologic <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> ( FSGS) , nine patients with NPHS2 gene homozygous or composite heterozygous mutations were found .
In addition to the previously described defects , two novel mutations at exon 4 were identified ( frameshift , L169P ) ; four single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and one dinucleotide repeat were also identified .
On the basis of haplotype analysis , a founder effect was suggested for the 419delG mutation , the most frequently observed in the patients studied .
Patients carrying NPHS2 mutations and without a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> were indistinguishable from those with idiopathic FSGS on the basis of the clinical phenotype .
Two of the nine patients had normal renal function at 3 and 10 yr of age , despite the presence of the <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
The other seven had reached <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal failure <END> at a mean age of 9.6 yr ( range , 4 to 17 yr ) and had received renal allografts .
In those presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal failure <END> , the clinical and laboratory features both before and after transplantation were similar , including the age at onset , the amount of <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , and the absence of any response to steroids and other immunosuppressants .
Finally , two children presented recurrence of mild <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> after transplantation , which promptly remitted after plasmapheresis combined with cyclophosphamide .
These data demonstrate that podocin mutations in nonfamilial cases of steroid-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> are frequent and may be due in one case to a founder effect .
The pretransplantation and posttransplantation outcomes in the group of patients with mutations of the podocin gene are similar to classical idiopathic FSGS , including the possibility of recurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> that is mild and responsive to plasmapheresis .
These observations support a role of molecular screening of the podocin gene in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> before immunosuppressive treatment is started .
Recessive POLG mutations presenting with sensory and ataxic neuropathy in compound heterozygote patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> is a mitochondrial disease characterized by accumulation of multiple large-scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA .
We previously reported missense mutations in POLG , the gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma in two nuclear families compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
Here , we report a novel POLG missense mutation ( R627W ) in a sporadic patient and we provide genetic support that all these POLG mutations are actually causal and recessive .
The novel patient presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory ataxic neuropathy <END> and has the clinical triad of <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory ataxic neuropathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and ophthalmoparesis ( SANDO ) .
This is the first finding of a genetic cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> Sensory Ataxic Neuropathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Dysarthria <END> and Ophthalmoparesis and it implies that this disorder may actually be a variant of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
Sensory neuropathy is the initial feature in Belgian compound heterozygote <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> patients , all carrying the POLG A467T mutation , which occurs at a frequency of 0.6 % in the Belgian population .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Encephalopathy <END> with calcifications of the basal ganglia in children .
A reappraisal of Fahr 's syndrome with respect to 14 new cases .
Calcifications of the basal ganglia are described under the heading of " Fahr 's syndrome " .
The clinical pattern is variable and the syndrome may be sporadic or familial .
This study describes a personal series of 14 cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> calcification of the basal ganglia <END> and reviews the literature cases .
A four-group classification is proposed .
The first group includes <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> or optic atrophy , symmetrical patchy demyelination with calcifications and probable <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Some cases have an early onset , a rapid evolution .
Others have a later onset , longer course and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> .
In the second group , the children suffer from a congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> or a cerebral palsy without clear deterioration , without <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , ocular impairment or persistent CSF abnormalities .
This group has not been reported in the literature .
The cases do not seem to be genetic .
The precise cause in unknown but a sporadic non progressive anoxo-ischemic , or viral prenatal disease is suggested .
In the third group , the association of <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and persistent CSF lymphocytosis , has a high recurrence rate .
The pathogenesis is still a matter of dispute .
The fourth group is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> calcifications of the basal ganglia with or without neurological abnormalities .
Finally calcium metabolism disorders and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy may be associated with calcifications of the basal ganglia .
Isolated and syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> .
The association between <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> and multiple congenital malformations has been well documented over the last century .
Numerous authors have described cases as the <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> syndrome , but recently reports of cases without <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> have led several authors to use the eponymic designation Fraser syndrome .
We have seen seven cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> syndrome , including three sib pairs .
All presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> and bilateral renal agenesis in addition to other characteristic associated malformations .
A literature review showed 124 cases in which 27 demonstrated isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> , while 97 showed a pattern of multiple congenital malformations .
We selected four major and eight minor criteria which enabled us to classify 86 of those cases as having <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> syndrome with 11 remaining unclassified .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cryptophthalmos <END> demonstrates equal sex distribution , occurrence in sibs , consanguinity in families with more than one affected child , and lack of vertical transmission--strongly suggesting <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> sequence was sporadic in 16 cases and familial in 11 .
The familial cases occurred in three families and demonstrated vertical transmission .
The pathogenesis of this syndrome is unknown .
There are similarities to animal models of maternal vitamin A deprivation and defects in programmed cell death .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cryptophthalmos <END> syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases with multiple congenital malformations , especially when they are associated with renal agenesis , even in the absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> .
A new X-linked syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , coloboma , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , and a mutation in the Alpha 4 gene at Xq13 .
We describe two brothers with a unique pattern of malformations that includes coloboma ( iris , optic nerve) , <START:PHENOTYPE> high forehead <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> retrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ( ACC ) .
Both boys have low-set <START:PHENOTYPE> cupped ears <END> with sensorineural hearing loss , normal phallus , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
One brother had <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> and cardiac defects consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> ( VSD ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> patent ductus arteriosus <END> ( PDA ) which resolved spontaneously .
Differential diagnosis between a number of clinical entities was considered , however , because ACC and the distinctive facial features were reminiscent of FG syndrome , DNA was analyzed for markers linked to the FGS1 locus at Xq13-q21 . Notably , the brothers were concordant for markers spanning this presumed FG region , and in both we have identified adjacent alterations ( -57delT and T-55A ) in the Alpha 4 gene located within this interval .
Alpha 4 is a regulatory subunit of the major cellular phosphatase , PP2A , that has recently been shown to interact with MID1 , the product of the gene mutated in X-linked Opitz GBBB syndrome .
The double nucleotide change identified in this family was not observed in 410 control chromosomes , suggesting that it may be a pathogenetic change .
Altered expression of Alpha 4 , through either a change in translational efficiency , mRNA stability or splicing , could explain the clinical phenotype in these boys and the phenotypic overlap with Opitz GBBB syndrome .

Ataxia-pancytopenia : syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic anemia <END> , monosomy 7 , and acute myelogenous leukemia .
In a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> , the proband had <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , developed <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic anemia <END> at age 3 years , and died of <START:PHENOTYPE> acute myelomonocytic leukemia <END> at age 7 . Serial cytogenetic studies of the proband 's hypoplastic bone marrow over a 25-month period revealed progressive expansion of a clone of cells with C( 6 - 12 + X ) monosomy from 33% to 94 % of metaphases .
The missing chromosome by banding was deduced to be No.7 . No increased sensitivity of the patient 's cells was found in response to ultraviolet or ionizing radiation or to mitomycin C . <START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebellar atrophy <END> was confirmed at autopsy . Family studies revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> in the proband 's father and all four siblings .
Two brothers , including one with C-monosomy , died with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic anemia <END> and another brother died with acute myelocytic leukemia .
The only surviving sibling is a 19-year-old sister who has unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> , decreased mitotic activity in bone marrow , and slow progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
The name ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome is proposed to encourage study of additional patients with this disorder , which predisposes to <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> acute leukemia <END> .
Clinical and molecular genetics of primary dystonias .
Primary dystonias are movement disorders with <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> as a major symptom .
They are frequently inherited as Mendelian traits .
There are at least eight clinically distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and two X-linked recessive forms .
In addition , pedigree analyses suggest the occurrence of an autosomal recessive variant .
The clinical classification is increasingly being replaced by a genetic one .
To date gene loci have been identified in at least six <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> forms , i.e. , in idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> ( 9q34) , focal <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> ( 18p ) , adult-onset idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> of mixed type ( 8p21-q22) , dopa-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> ( 14q22.1-q22.2) , and paroxysmal dystonic <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> ( 2q25-q33 ; 1p21-p13.3 ) .
Gene loci in the X-linked recessive forms have been assigned to Xq13.1 in the X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> parkinsonism syndrome and to Xq22 in X-linked sensorineural deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , and mental retardation .
The disease genes have been identified in two <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> forms and in one X-linked recessive form .
Mutations in a gene coding for an ATP-binding protein were detected in idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> ( DYT1 ) , and the GTP cyclohydrolase 1 gene is mutated in dopa-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> ( DYT5 ) .
In sensorineural deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , and mental retardation , mutations were found in the gene DDP coding for a polypeptide of unknown function .
This article reviews the clinical and molecular genetics of primary dystonias , critically discusses present findings , and proposes referring to the known forms , most of which can be distinguished by genetic criteria , as dystonias 1-12 .
Apparent third patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous mastocytosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mastocytosis <END> refers to a heterogeneous group of rare disorders characterized by an abnormal accumulation of mast cells in one or more organ systems .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cutaneous mastocytosis <END> ( CM ) is the most frequent form in children and is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperpigmented macules <END> or papules symmetrically distributed over the trunk , and less so over the limbs , neck , and scalp .
Two published articles have reported on unrelated girls presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> mastocytosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , hearing loss , and hypotonia .
Based on the original observation , this disorder was defined as CM with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> ( OMIM 248910 ) .
Here we report on a girl with similar manifestations who corroborates the existence of this rare disorder .
CM , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> , and/or hearing loss are the minimal diagnostic criteria .
All the known patients were sporadic , but parental consanguinity in the first case argues for a possible autosomal-recessive inheritance .
Cardiac involvement in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> diseases .
A study on 17 patients with documented <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA defects .
Mutations of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA have been demonstrated as causes of human <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> diseases .
While these disorders typically involve multiple organs , the effect of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutations on the heart has not been systematically studied .
We studied <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutations and cardiac changes in 17 patients with Kearns-Say re syndrome ; ocular myopathy ; myoclonus <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with ragged red fibers ( MERRF) ; and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy , encephalopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and strokelike episodes ( MELAS ) .
Cardiac involvement was evaluated by chest radiograph , ECG , His-bundle electrogram , and echocardiogram .
All 3 patients with Kearns-Say re syndrome had large deletions of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA and disturbances in cardiac conduction .
ECG abnormalities were found in 2 of 6 patients with ocular myopathy who showed large deletions of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA .
All 3 patients with MERRF had an A-to-G mutation at nucleotide position 8344 ; 2 had cardiomegaly , asymmetrical septal hypertrophy , and diffuse hypokinesis of the left ventricle .
One patient with asymmetrical septal hypertrophy developed dilated <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> 2 years later .
All 5 patients with MELAS had an A-to-G mutation at nucleotide position 3243 , and 2 had symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with or without abnormal wall motion .
The clinical features of cardiac involvement in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> diseases vary in the different subgroups of these disorders .
Particular <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutations can cause characteristic cardiac abnormalities .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> ( Say syndrome ) .
In 1975 Say et al . ( Humangenetik 26:267-269 ) reported on a new dominantly inherited syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , and hand anomalies in 4 members of a family .
This is a report of a 13-month-old girl with <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , sparse scalp hair , large abnormally shaped ears , small hands with <START:PHENOTYPE> tapering fingers <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> , unusual dermatoglyphics , <START:PHENOTYPE> proximal renal tubular acidosis <END> with cystic dysplasia of the kidneys , and developmental delay .
This case appears to be the second report of this syndrome which presumably occurred as a new mutation in this family .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> congenital non-progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> overlaps with the SCA15 locus .
Most patients with pure nonprogressive congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> have a sporadic form of unknown heredity and etiology .
Several small families have been reported with a dominantly inherited nonprogressive congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( NPCA ) .
The authors ascertained and clinically characterized a four-generation pedigree segregating an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant type <END> of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia <END> associated with cognitive impairment .
Following the exclusion of several SCA localizations ( SCA-1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 17 , IOSCA , and DRPLA) , a genome-wide linkage study was performed .
Examination of the family showed that all affected members had gait <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and cognitive disability with variable features of <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysmetria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysdiadochokinesia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , dystonic movements , and cerebellar hypoplasia on imaging .
Clinical signs of pyramidal tract dysfunction and sensory changes were absent .
A genome-wide search in this family detected linkage to chromosome 3p with a maximum two-point lod score of 4.26 at D3S363 0 .
This localization to the pter is distal to D3S1304 , as defined by a recombination event .
This overlaps with the SCA15 locus , with the critical overlapping region between the microsatellite markers , D3S1304 and D3S1620 ( approximately 8 cM ) . <START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia <END> with or without cerebellar hypoplasia overlaps with the SCA15 locus on chromosome 3pter .
Association of <START:PHENOTYPE> 3-methylglutaconic aciduria <END> with sensori-neural deafness , encephalopathy , and Leigh-like syndrome ( MEGDEL association ) in four patients with a disorder of the oxidative phosphorylation .
In this paper , we describe a distinct clinical subtype of <START:PHENOTYPE> 3-methylglutaconic aciduria <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria <END> is a group of different metabolic disorders biochemically characterized by increased urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid .
We performed biochemical and genetic investigations , including urine organic acid analysis , NMR spectroscopy , measurement of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase activity , cardiolipin levels , OPA3 gene analysis and measurement of the oxidative phosphorylation in four female patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> 3-methylglutaconic aciduria <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria <END> type I , Barth syndrome , and Costeff syndrome were excluded as the activity of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase , the cardiolipin levels , and molecular analysis of the OPA3 gene , respectively , showed no abnormalities .
The children presented with characteristic association of hearing loss and the neuro-radiological evidence of Leigh disease .
They also had neonatal hypotonia , recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidemia <END> , episodes with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> feeding difficulties <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> .
Our patients were further biochemically characterized by a mitochondrial dysfunction and persistent urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid .
Presenilin 1 mutation in an african american family presenting with atypical Alzheimer <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Alzheimer disease <END> ( AD ) is characterized by memory and visuospatial deficits with relative sparing of personality .
Mutations in 3 genes ( presenilin 1 and 2 and amyloid precursor protein ) are associated with presenile AD . Presenilin 1 gene mutations have not been described in African Americans .
We studied an African American family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> rapidly progressive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and psychosis occurring early in the fifth decade of life .
We performed neurologic evaluations , psychometrics , and neuroimaging .
We sequenced the amyloid precursor protein gene , presenilin 1 and 2 , and tau in affected and unaffected family members .
One patient underwent a brain biopsy and subsequent autopsy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Personality change <END> , auditory and visual hallucinations , delusions , <START:PHENOTYPE> memory impairment <END> , word-finding difficulties , and subsequent rigidity , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , and mutism developed in 2 brothers .
Neuropsychometric testing in one was consistent with frontotemporal <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> or atypical AD . Neuroimaging studies showed diffuse cortical involvement .
A clinical diagnosis of familial non-Alzheimer <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> was made .
However , results of temporal lobe biopsy in one revealed amyloid neuritic plaques , and autopsy results confirmed the diagnosis of AD . Gene sequencing revealed a presenilin 1 point mutation ( M139V ) cosegregating with the disease .
A tau polymorphism in exon 7 ( A178T) was found in an affected brother and unaffected relatives .
We report the first documented presenilin mutation in African American patients presenting with early <START:PHENOTYPE> personality change <END> , psychosis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> memory loss <END> with preserved praxis .
The M139V mutation can present differently between kindreds , with some features suggestive of a frontal lobe syndrome .
The M139V mutation can lead to atypical AD , and genetic background may have a role in determining the phenotype of genetically defined AD .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> oculopharyngodistal myopathy in light of distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.
We investigated two Japanese siblings presenting with oculopharyngodistal myopathy , whose healthy parents were consanguineous .
To clarify their disease characteristics , we compared them with four patients with distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> linked to chromosome 9p1-q1 , and 36 patients with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy linked to 14q11 .2-q13 .
The first symptom in the patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> oculopharyngodistal myopathy was weakness of the tibialis anterior muscle .
Their biceps muscles showed initial and advanced myogenic changes , with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> in 3% and 6% of the muscle fibers , respectively .
In contrast , patients with distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> revealed many <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> , on average in 20% of the fibers , and their oculopharyngeal muscles were spared .
None of the patients with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy showed distal dominant weakness and the occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> was rare .
Ultrastructural studies in groups of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> oculopharyngodistal myopathy and distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> disclosed a collection of cytoplasmic filaments of 16-18 nm , but oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy-specific intranuclear inclusions of 8.5 nm were not found .
Thus , the phenotype of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> oculopharyngodistal myopathy is distinct from distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy , but shares some ultrastructural characteristics with distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> and hereditary inclusion body myopathy.
Infantile lethal variant of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome associated with hydrops fetalis .
Simpson-Golabi Behmel syndrome ( SGBS ) is an X-linked disorder characterized by pre- and postnatal macrosomia , minor facial anomalies , and variable visceral , skeletal , and neurological abnormalities .
Since its first description by Simpson et al . [ 1975 : BD:OA XI(2 ):18-24] , a wide clinical range of cases has been reported .
There is great variability in severity , ranging from a mild form associated with long-term survival to an early lethal form with multiple congenital anomalies and <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> .
In 8 reported families , affected individuals died in infancy .
Here we present 4 maternally related , male cousins with a severe variant of SGBS .
One of these males was aborted therapeutically at 19 weeks of gestation following the detection of <START:PHENOTYPE> multicystic kidneys <END> on ultrasound .
The 3 liveborn males were hydropic at birth with a combination of craniofacial anomalies including <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> ; apparently low-set , <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly angulated ears <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> ; short , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> large mouth <END> with thin upper vermilion border ; <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent philtrum <END> ; high-arched or <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> ; redundant skin ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nails <END> ; skeletal defects involving upper and lower limbs ; gastrointestinal and genitourinary anomalies .
All 3 patients were hypotonic and neurologically impaired from birth .
With the exception of a trilobate left lung in one patient , the cardiorespiratory system was structurally normal .
All patients died within the first 8 weeks of life of multiple complications including <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> and sepsis .
Two SGBS kindreds , with moderate expression of the condition , have been mapped to Xq27.
It is not known whether severe , familial cases , such as ours , are genetically distinct from and map to another locus .
Final resolution of the genetic basis of the phenotypic variability in SGBS must await cloning and mutation analysis of the SGBS gene(s ) .
Dysmorphic syndrome of hereditary neuralgic <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophy <END> associated with a SEPT9 gene mutation--a family study .
We report a family in which two siblings presented with an apparent dysmorphic syndrome , including <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , slight <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthal folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microstomia <END> and dysmorphic ears .
One sibling had a <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
Initially , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus <END> inversus syndrome ( BPES ) was suspected ; however , mutation of the FOXL2 gene was not detected .
Moreover , the patients ' father and paternal grandmother had experienced recurrent episodes of unilateral brachial neuritis and were diagnosed to have hereditary neuralgic <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophy <END> ( HNA ) .
HNA is a rare , inherited form of brachial neuritis whose phenotypic spectrum may include <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and other minor dysmorphisms .
HNA maps to chromosome 17q25 and is associated with mutations in the SEPT9 gene .
After confirming a heterozygous SEPT9 mutation ( R88W ) in the father and his mother , it became apparent that the dysmorphic features in the children were part of HNA and that previous complaints of the daughter , erroneously diagnosed as pronatio dolorosa and then epiphysiolysis of the capitellum humeri , were in fact a first neuralgic pain attack .
Both children were shown to have inherited the paternal SEPT9 mutation .
Wider recognition of HNA as a syndromic disorder may facilitate its diagnosis in affected young persons who may not yet have manifested episodes of brachial neuritis .
A new syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and radial synostosis .
A new syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and radial synostosis has been described .
The family history suggests either an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode of inheritance with limited expression in females or X-linkage . Other syndromes with similar phenotypes and modes of inheritance are discussed .
The need for accurate and complete family histories in cases involving <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip/palate <END> is discussed in relation to genetic counselling and recurrent risk estimates .
Anticipation of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> with hypogonadism .
A large Swedish family with members affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> with hypogonadism were followed-up and reviewed .
Hypogonadism included delayed sexual maturation , <START:PHENOTYPE> primary amenorrhea <END> , early menopause , and testicular atrophy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cataracts <END> , cerebellar ataxia , neuropathy , hypoacusia , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , tremor , parkinsonism , <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , and mental retardation were other features observed in this family .
Muscle biopsy samples of advanced cases showed <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> , focal cytochrome c oxidase deficiency , and multiple mtDNA deletions by Southern blot analysis .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode of inheritance was evident with anticipation in successive generations .
Linkage analysis excluded the chromosome 10q23.3-q24.3 region reported as being linked to the disease in a Finnish family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
We report for the first time clinical evidence for anticipation in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
We hypothesize that the nuclear gene causing this enigmatic disorder may be directly influenced by an expansion of an unstable DNA sequence and that the resulting phenotype is caused by a concerted action with multiple deletions of mtDNA .
A further patient with van Maldergem syndrome .
We report on a male patient with the proposed diagnosis of the rare but very distinct entity of van Maldergem syndrome .
His parents are first cousins .
At the age of 4 years the boy presented with severe developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> talipes equinovarus <END> , finger camptodactyly with interphalangeal pterygium , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral microtia <END> , and a dysmorphic facies .
He showed bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus <END> , telecanthus , <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad flat nasal bridge <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dental malocclusion <END> .
The combination of the specific facial features with camptodactyly , interphalangeal pterygium , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> and developmental delay led to the diagnosis of van Maldergem syndrome .
The medical history was further on significant for pharyngeal instability requiring the placement of a tracheostomy tube , an inguinal hernia , hip subluxation , <START:PHENOTYPE> small kidneys <END> and genital abnormalities ( <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid scrotum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> ) .
Due to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> feeding difficulties <END> permanent tube feeding was required .
Metabolic tests ( newborn metabolic screening , 7-dehydrocholesterol , amino acids , organic acids in urine ) and chromosomal analysis ( 45 0-50 0 bands ; 46 , XY ) were normal .
Molecular karyotyping revealed two parental CNVs ( paternal deletion of 9q33.1 ; maternal duplication of 11p15 .1 ) , which are unlikely to contribute to the patient 's phenotype .
Taken together , the report on a further patient with van Maldergem syndrome expands the clinical spectrum of the condition by adding genital malformations , hernia , pharyngeal instability , and subluxation of the hip .

Increased prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in boys who were probands with the FMR1 premutation and co-morbid <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorder .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> are a common co-occurring condition in those with fragile X syndrome ( FXS) , and in those with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorder ( ASD ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> are also associated with ASD in those with FXS .
However , little is known about the rate of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and how commonly these problems co-occur with ASD in boys with the FMR1 premutation .
We , therefore , determined the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and ASD in boys with the FMR1 premutation compared with their sibling counterparts and population prevalence estimates .
Fifty premutation boys who presented as clinical probands ( N = 25) , or non-probands ( identified by cascade testing after the proband was found ) ( N = 25) , and 32 non-carrier controls were enrolled .
History of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> was documented and ASD was diagnosed by standardized measures followed by a team consensus of ASD diagnosis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> ( 28% ) and ASD ( 68% ) were more prevalent in probands compared with non-probands ( 0 and 28% ) , controls ( 0 and 0% ) , and population estimates ( 1 and 1.7% ) . <START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> occurred more frequently in those with the premutation and co-morbid ASD particularly in probands compared with those with the premutation alone ( 25 vs . 3.85% , p = 0.045 ) .
Although cognitive and adaptive functioning in non-probands were similar to controls , non-probands were more likely to meet the diagnosis of ASD than controls ( 28 vs . 0% , p < 0.0001 ) .
In conclusion , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were relatively more common in premutation carriers who presented clinically as probands of the family and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were commonly associated with ASD in these boys .
Therefore , boys with the premutation , particularly if they are probands should be assessed carefully for both ASD and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndrome revisited .
The clinical spectrum of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndromes is highly <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> with respect to organ involvement and severity .
One of the major diagnostic criteria is to detect abnormal elastin fibers .
In several other clinically similar <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndromes , however , the classic histological anomalies are absent , and the definite diagnosis remains uncertain .
In <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> patients mutations have been demonstrated in elastin or fibulin genes , but in the majority of patients the underlying genetic etiology remains unknown .
Recently , we found mutations in the ATP6V0A2 gene in families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> .
This genetic defect is associated with abnormal glycosylation leading to a distinct combined disorder of the biosynthesis of N- and O-linked glycans .
Interestingly , similar mutations have been found in patients with wrinkly skin syndrome , without the presence of severe skin symptoms of elastin deficiency .
These findings suggest that the <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> and wrinkly skin syndromes are phenotypic variants of the same disorder .
Interestingly many phenotypically similar patients carry no mutations in the ATP6V0A2 gene .
The variable presence of protein glycosylation abnormalities in the diverse clinical forms of the wrinkled skin-cutis laxa syndrome spectrum necessitates revisiting the diagnostic criteria to be able to offer adequate prognosis assessment and counseling .
This paper aims at describing the spectrum of clinical features of the various forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndromes .
Based on the recently unraveled novel genetic entity we also review the genetic aspects in <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndromes including genotype-phenotype correlations and suggest a practical diagnostic approach .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Corpus callosum agenesis <END> , facial anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> Robin sequence <END> , and other anomalies : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome ?
We describe findings in four children , three of whom are sibs , who appear to have the same , previously undescribed multiple congenital anomaly ( MCA ) syndrome .
The main manifestations include <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Robin sequence <END> , abnormal ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> redundant neck skin <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> laryngeal anomalies <END> , cardiac defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> short hands <END> , and hypotonia .
The presence of this condition in sibs of each sex suggests that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> is the most likely cause .
A MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome associated with a new point mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA tRNA( Lys ) gene .
Several members of a three-generation kindred from Sardinia were affected by a maternally inherited syndrome characterized by features of both <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> ( MERRF ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> ( MELAS ) .
Clinically , symptoms such as <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , neural deafness and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> were variably associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> and/or migrainous attacks .
Morphologically , numerous MELAS-associated SDH-stained vessels were observed in muscle biopsies , either alone or in combination with <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> , the morphological hallmark of MERRF .
Sequence analysis of the mtDNA tRNA genes revealed the presence of a single , heteroplasmic T- -> C transition at nt 8356 , in the region of the tRNA( Lys ) gene corresponding to the T-psi-C stem .
The T- ->C(8356 ) transition was exclusively found in the maternal lineage of our family , and the relative amount of the mutant mtDNA species in muscle was correlated with the severity of the clinical presentation .
Therefore , we propose that the T- ->C(8356 ) transition is responsible for the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy found in our family , and must be added to the expanding list of the pathogenetically relevant mutations of human mtDNA .
Severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> : inheritance and pathophysiology .
Severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is a heterogeneous disorder of hematopoiesis characterized by a maturation arrest of granulopoiesis at the level of promyelocytes with peripheral blood absolute neutrophil counts below 0.5 x 10/l .
In this review we summarize our current knowledge on inheritance and pathophysiolgy of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
There are two major subtypes of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> as judged by inheritance : autosomal dominant trait defined by neutrophil elastase mutations consisting of 60 % of patients and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait comprising approximately 30% of patients .
This genetic heterogeneity suggests that several pathologic mechanisms may lead to the same phenotype due to downregulation of common myeloid transcription factors .
Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 is the most promising candidate , as its abrogation together with downregulation of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 target genes is compatible with this phenotype .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is considered as a preleukemic syndrome , since after 10 years of observation the cumulative incidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> is 21% .
Acquired granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor mutations are detected in approximately 80% of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> patients who developed acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is a congenital disorder of hematopoiesis inherited by autosomal dominant or recessive traits .
Downregulation of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 is involved in the pathophysiology of all congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> patients .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> patients with acquired granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor mutations define a group with high risk for development of <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> .
OEIS complex associated with chromosome 1p36 deletion : a case report and review .
OEIS complex ( <START:PHENOTYPE> Omphalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Exstrophy <END> of the cloaca , <START:PHENOTYPE> Imperforate anus <END> , and Spine abnormalities ) is a rare defect with estimated incidence of 1 in 200,000 live births .
Most cases are <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> , with no obvious cause .
However , it has been rarely reported in patients with family members having similar malformations or with chromosomal anomalies .
In addition , OEIS complex has been observed in association with environmental exposures , twinning , and in vitro fertilization .
Monosomy 1p36 is the most common terminal deletion syndrome , with a prevalence of 1 in 5 ,000 newborns .
It is characterized by specific facial features , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and heart , skeletal , genitourinary , and neurological defects .
We describe an infant with OEIS complex and 1p36 deletion who had features of both disorders , including <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cloacal exstrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , sacral multiple segmentation , renal malposition and <START:PHENOTYPE> malrotation <END> , genital anomalies , diastasis of the symphysis pubis , microbrachycephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> large anterior fontanel <END> , cardiac <START:PHENOTYPE> septal defects <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rib fusion <END> , a limb deformity , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and typical facial features .
Chromosomal microarray analysis detected a 2.4 Mb terminal deletion of chromosome 1p .
This is the first reported case with OEIS complex in association with a chromosome 1p36 deletion .

A large-scale , consortium-based genomewide association study of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> is influenced by genes and environment ; implicated genes may indicate pathways for therapeutic intervention .
Genetic risk factors may be useful in identifying subtypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and determining whether intermediate phenotypes , such as elevation of the total serum IgE level , are causally linked to disease .
We carried out a genomewide association study by genotyping 10 ,365 persons with physician-diagnosed <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and 16 ,11 0 unaffected persons , all of whom were matched for ancestry .
We used random-effects pooled analysis to test for association in the overall study population and in subgroups of subjects with childhood-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> (defined as <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> developing before 16 years of age ) , later-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , and occupational <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
We observed associations of genomewide significance between <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and the following single-nucleotide polymorphisms : rs3771166 on chromosome 2 , implicating IL1RL1/ IL18 R1 ( P=3Ã—10( âˆ’9) ) ; rs9273349 on chromosome 6 , implicating HLA-DQ ( P=7Ã—10( âˆ’14) ) ; rs1342326 on chromosome 9 , flanking IL33 ( P=9Ã—10( âˆ’10) ) ; rs744910 on chromosome 15 in SMAD3 ( P=4Ã—10( âˆ’9) ) ; and rs2284033 on chromosome 22 in IL2RB ( P=1 .1Ã—10( âˆ’8) ) .
Association with the ORMDL3/GSDMB locus on chromosome 17q21 was specific to childhood-onset disease ( rs2305480 , P=6Ã—10( âˆ’23) ) .
Only HLA-DR showed a significant genomewide association with the total serum IgE concentration , and loci strongly associated with IgE levels were not associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> is genetically heterogeneous .
A few common alleles are associated with disease risk at all ages .
Implicated genes suggest a role for communication of epithelial damage to the adaptive immune system and activation of airway inflammation .
Variants at the ORMDL3/GSDMB locus are associated only with childhood-onset disease .
Elevation of total serum IgE levels has a minor role in the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .

Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , facial and hand abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheoesophageal fistula <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> duodenal atresia <END> , and developmental delay .
We report on six new families ( 12 new patients ) with the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , facial and hand abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheoesophageal fistula <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> duodenal atresia <END> , and developmental delay .
The most common findings were hand abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , short and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nostrils <END> , ear abnormalities , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
Inheritance is <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> .
There is a significant amount of intrafamilial variability especially as it relates to the gastrointestinal findings .
Although the first patients reported , who were very young , did not exhibit any developmental delay , they subsequently did develop learning problems , and 87 % of our 12 patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> or learning difficulties .
Mitochondrial dysfunction in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Impaired mitochondrial function may influence processes highly dependent on energy , such as neurodevelopment , and contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
No studies have evaluated mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) abnormalities in a well-defined population of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
To evaluate mitochondrial defects in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Observational study using data collected from patients aged 2 to 5 years who were a subset of children participating in the Childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> Risk From Genes and Environment study in California , which is a population-based , case-control investigation with confirmed <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> cases and age-matched , genetically unrelated , typically developing controls , that was launched in 2003 and is still ongoing .
Mitochondrial dysfunction and mtDNA abnormalities were evaluated in lymphocytes from 10 children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and 10 controls .
Oxidative phosphorylation capacity , mtDNA copy number and deletions , mitochondrial rate of hydrogen peroxide production , and plasma lactate and pyruvate .
The reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NADH ) oxidase activity ( normalized to citrate synthase activity ) in lymphocytic mitochondria from children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> was significantly lower compared with controls ( mean , 4.4 [95 % confidence interval { CI} , 2.8-6.0] vs 12 [95 % CI , 8-16 ] , respectively ; P = .001 ) .
The majority of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> ( 6 of 10 ) had complex I activity below control range values .
Higher plasma pyruvate levels were found in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> compared with controls ( 0.23 mM [95 % CI , 0.15- 0.31 mM ] vs 0.08 mM [95 % CI , 0.04- 0.12 mM] , respectively ; P = .02 ) .
Eight of 10 cases had higher pyruvate levels but only 2 cases had higher lactate levels compared with controls .
These results were consistent with the lower pyruvate dehydrogenase activity observed in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> compared with controls ( 1. 0 [95 % CI , 0.6-1.4 ] nmol Ã— [min Ã— mg protein] ( -1 ) vs 2.3 [95 % CI , 1.7- 2.9 ] nmol Ã— [min Ã— mg protein] ( -1 ) , respectively ; P = .01 ) .
Children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> had higher mitochondrial rates of hydrogen peroxide production compared with controls ( 0.34 [95 % CI , 0.26- 0.42 ] nmol Ã— [min Ã— mg of protein] ( -1 ) vs 0.16 [95 % CI , 0.12-0.20] nmol Ã— [min Ã— mg protein] ( -1 ) by complex III; P = .02 ) .
Mitochondrial DNA overreplication was found in 5 cases ( mean ratio of mtDNA to nuclear DNA : 239 [95 % CI , 217-239 ] vs 179 [95 % CI , 165 - 193 ] in controls ; P = 10( -4) ) .
Deletions at the segment of cytochrome b were observed in 2 cases ( ratio of cytochrome b to ND1 : 0.8 0 [95 % CI , 0.68- 0.92 ] vs 0.99 [95 % CI , 0.93-1.05 ] for controls ; P = .01 ) .
In this exploratory study , children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> were more likely to have mitochondrial dysfunction , mtDNA overreplication , and mtDNA deletions than typically developing children .
Trilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> : a meta-analysis of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> associated with primary ectopic intracranial <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
To obtain refined knowledge regarding trilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( TRb) , which is a syndrome that consists of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> associated with an intracranial neuroblastic tumor .
Using a systematic literature review , we contacted authors to obtain missing information .
Data from 106 children were used in a meta-analysis including frequency distributions and Kaplan-Meier survival curves .
TRb showed no sex predilection .
Median age at diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> was 5 months ( range , 0 to 29 months ) ; age at diagnosis was younger among 47 children ( 47% ) with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> compared with age at diagnosis among 52 children ( 53% ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( 2 v 6.5 months , P <.0001 ) .
TRb usually affected the second or third generation with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Median time from <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> to TRb was 21 months ( range , 6 months before to 141 months after ) ; time to TRb was longer for 78 ( 77% ) pineal tumors compared with 23 ( 23% ) suprasellar tumors (32 v 6.5 months , P <.0001 ) .
The size ( 27 v 32 mm , P =.57 ) and prognosis ( survival of 9 v 8 months , P = .91 ) of pineal and suprasellar tumors were similar .
TRb was detected earlier ( 1 v 22 months , P =.0007 ) and the child survived longer if neuroimaging was routinely performed ( 16 v 8 months , P =.001 ) , but age at death was similar ( 36 v 37 months , P = .98 ) .
Cumulative 5-year survival ( which was likely to indicate cure ) was 27% ( v 0% ) if screening was undertaken .
All children whose TRb exceeded 15 mm in size died .
The family history , age at diagnosis , and laterality of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> in children with TRb resembled that of ordinary hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Suprasellar TRb were diagnosed earlier , and may arise earlier , than pineal TRb . Screening by neuroimaging could improve the cure rate if cases of TRb were detected when tumors were 15 mm or smaller in size .
Manifestations in four males with and an obligate carrier of the Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome .
Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> recessive condition first described by Lenz in 1955 and comprises of <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , external ear , digital , cardiac , skeletal , and urogenital anomalies .
We present three brothers ( ages 15 years , 9 years , and 18 months ) and a maternal uncle ( age 27 years ) with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed motor development <END> , hypotonia , and moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
They also have abnormally modeled ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , finger and toe <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> , clinodactyly , fetal pads , scoliosis , cardiac , and renal abnormalities .
An obligate carrier had abnormally modeled ears and <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> of the 2nd to 3rd toes bilaterally .
Linkage and haplotype analysis in this family indicates that the gene is located in a 17 .65 -cM region on chromosome region Xq27- Xq28 .
A MELAS-associated ND1 mutation causing leber hereditary optic <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> and spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
To report a novel mutation that is associated with Leber hereditary optic <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> ( LHON ) within the same family affected by spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
Leber hereditary optic <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> is a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disorder characterized by isolated central <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> .
Of patients with LHON , 95 % carry a mutation in 1 of 3 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA-encoded complex I genes .
The complete <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA was screened for mutations in a patient with LHON without 1 of these 3 primary mutations .
The heteroplasmy level and biochemical consequence of the mutation were determined .
A pathogenic 3697G >A/ND1 mutation was detected and seemed associated with an isolated complex I deficiency .
This family has similar clinical characteristics as the previously described families with LHON and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> with an ND6 mutation .
The 3697G >A/ND1 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutation causes the LHON and spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> phenotype in the same family .
This mutation can also cause MELAS syndrome ( which encompasses <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy , encephalopathy , lactic acidosis , and stroke ) , and other genetic factors may contribute to the clinical expression .
Revelation of a new <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutation ( G12147A ) in a MELAS/MERFF phenotype .
A 26-year-old man presented at onset with the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ( MELAS ) and later with a phenotype for MELAS and myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and ragged red fiber disease ( MELAS/MERRF ) .
To identify the possible defects in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome in blood and muscle samples of the patient .
Case study of a patient clinically exhibiting <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> and then <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with myoclonic features , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Research unit of a university hospital .
Electromyographic , morphologic , and biochemical studies of muscle and molecular analysis of blood and muscle to investigate <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( mtDNA ) size and quantity .
Morphologically , we found abnormal <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> proliferation with several cytochrome-c oxidase ( COX)-negative fibers in muscle biopsy specimens ; the analysis of serial sections showed a decreased immunoreactivity for the mtDNA-encoded subunits COXII and , partially , COXI .
Biochemically , we found a partial and isolated COX deficiency .
The complete mtDNA sequence analysis identified 3 sequence changes , 2 of which were reported polymorphisms .
The remaining change , a G12147A transition in the transfer RNA( His ) gene , appeared to be the likely pathogenic mutation .
Our data propose that the G12147A change , the first mutation in the transfer RNA( His ) gene associated with an overlapped MELAS/MERFF phenotype , is the cause of the encephalomyopathy in this patient interfering with the overall <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> protein synthesis .
Hypercalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> , mineral balance , bone histomorphometry , and therapeutic implications of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
A 14-year-old Turkish boy had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> that had been clinically evident since he was 2 years of age .
When he was 5 years of age , he had normal serum calcium and phosphorus levels and <START:PHENOTYPE> increased alkaline phosphatase <END> activity .
Treatment with modest dosages of vitamin D (5000 U/d for 3 weeks ) resulted in hypercalcemia .
At 10 years of age , high-dose vitamin D (40,000 U/d ) plus phosphorus ( 1 .1 g/d ) therapy for 20 days resulted in symptomatic nephrolithiasis .
When , 14 years of age , he had normocalcemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> increased alkaline phosphatase <END> activity , and normal circulating parathyroid hormone concentration .
Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were normal but those of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D were markedly increased .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Rickets <END> and osteopenia were evident on radiographs , and osteomalacia was present on trabecular bone obtained at biopsy .
Balance study results showed increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> , and increased urinary phosphorus excretion .
This patient manifests an unusual form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> in which <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> is a cardinal feature .
In contrast with most varieties of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , this disorder is characterized by appropriately increased production of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D in response to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> .
It is recommended that urinary calcium excretion be assessed in all patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> so that appropriate therapy will be instituted .
3-Methylglutaconic aciduria in the Iraqi-Jewish 'optic atrophy plus ' ( Costeff ) syndrome .
Eleven new patients of Iraqi-Jewish origin with bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , neurological abnormalities ( ' <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> plus ' syndrome ) and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria ( type III) are described .
Clinical abnormalities in decreasing order of frequency were bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal signs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and cognitive deficit .
An association with age was found only for <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal signs <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> frequently led to major disability , in contrast to <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and cognitive deficit .
The combined excretion of 3-methylglutaconic and 3-methylglutaric acid ranged between 9 and 187 mmol/mol creatinine .
The primary enzymatic defect possibly may reside in the mitochondrial respiratory chain .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Proteinuria <END> in a patient with the diaphragmatic hernia-hypertelorism-myopia-deafness syndrome : further evidence that the facio-oculo-acoustico-renal syndrome represents the same entity .
We present a male infant with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> severe myopia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> .
This patient combines features of two distinct genetic conditions , the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> , exomphalos , absent corpus callosum , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> ( MIM 222448 ) , and the facio-oculo-acoustico-renal syndrome ( MIM 227290) , which is characterised by similar anomalies , with the additional finding of <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , but without <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> .
The present observations further suggest that these syndromes are the variable expression of a single <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder .
The cardinal manifestations of Bardet-Biedl syndrome , a form of Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome .
To determine the interfamilial and intrafamilial variation in the expression of the Bardet-Biedl syndrome ( a form of Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome ) , we looked for the five recognized features of the disorder ( <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , polydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and hypogonadism) , plus possible renal manifestations , in some or all of 32 patients with this disorder .
All 28 patients examined had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> , but only 2 had typical <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
Polydactyly was present in 18 of 31 patients , but <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> , brachydactyly , or both were present in all .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> was present in all but 1 of 25 patients .
Only 13 of 32 patients were considered mentally retarded .
Scores on verbal subtests of intelligence were usually lower than scores on performance tasks .
Seven of eight men had <START:PHENOTYPE> small testes <END> and genitalia , which was not due to hypogonadotropism .
All 12 women studied had menstrual irregularities , and 3 had low serum estrogen levels ( 1 of these had hypogonadotropism , and 2 had primary gonadal failure ) .
The remaining women who were of reproductive age had endocrinologic evidence of reproductive dysfunction .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Diabetes mellitus <END> was present in 9 of 20 patients .
Renal structural or functional abnormalities were universal ( n = 21) , and three patients had end-stage renal failure .
We conclude that the characteristic features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome are severe <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> , dysmorphic extremities , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , renal abnormalities , and ( in male patients only ) hypogenitalism .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> , polydactyly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> in female patients are not necessarily present .
A multipedigree linkage study of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> : linkage to Xq13-q21 and evidence for genetic heterogeneity .
A locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> has previously been allocated to the Xq13-q21 region based on linkage studies in two separate pedigrees .
This has been substantiated by the observation of <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> as a clinical feature of male patients with cytogenetically detectable deletions across this region .
The question of a second locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> in this chromosomal region has been raised by the audiologically distinct nature of the <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> in some of the deleted patients compared to that observed in those patients upon whom the linkage data are based .
We have performed detailed clinical evaluation and linkage studies on seven pedigrees with nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and conclude that there is evidence for at least two loci for this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , including one in the Xq13-q21 region .
We have observed different radiological features among the pedigrees which map to Xq13-q21 , suggesting that even among these pedigrees the <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is due to different pathological processes .
Given these findings , we suggest that the classification of nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> based solely on audiological criteria may need to be reviewed .
Familial segregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical ribs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel anomaly <END> , preaxial polydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> anal atresia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> urethral obstruction <END> : a new syndrome ?
In a consanguineous Jewish family originating from Bombay , India , the propositus presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> anal atresia <END> , micropenis , <START:PHENOTYPE> urethral obstruction <END> with secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> prune belly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , patent urachus , and cryptorchidism .
The kidneys were dysplastic and he had the Potter phenotype with limb deformities .
Additional findings included IUGR with microcephaly , congenital heart defects , spinal anomalies , and hypoplastic lungs .
The mother and all three sisters had <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical ribs <END> , and she and one sister had 11 pairs of thoracic ribs .
The other two sisters had chronic immune thrombopenia .
One of those had bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel deformity <END> with homovertebral bones , <START:PHENOTYPE> club feet <END> , and microcephaly and the other sister also had unilateral preaxial hexadactyly .
Although familial segregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical ribs <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel deformity <END> has been reported , the association of the findings in this family is unique and may represent a new syndrome .
X-linked dominant transmission may explain the severe manifestations in the affected male , but other modes of inheritance may also appl y .
New X-linked mental retardation ( XLMR ) syndrome with distinct facial appearance and growth retardation .
We report on 2 brothers and their nephew with an apparently new X-linked mental retardation ( XLMR ) syndrome characterized by a distinct facial appearance , growth retardation , and <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> .
The facial traits included triangular shape ; bifrontal narrowness ; malar flatness ; <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> ; very deeply set eyes ; <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> bulbous nose <END> ; low hairline ; low-set , deeply cupped , and <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding ears <END> ; short ill-defined philtrum ; and thin tented upper lip .
These facial anomalies are particularly striking and recognizable even at birth .
The boys were <START:PHENOTYPE> small for gestational age <END> and remained below -2 SD in growth parameters .
With age , large <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> developed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pectus excavatum <END> was apparent at birth but became more obvious with age .
Global developmental delay was evident in infancy .
The brothers were nonverbal while their nephew spoke simple words .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> esotropia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic diplegia <END> were evident .
They were self-abusive , hyperactive , and poorly coordinated .
CT scans demonstrated atrophic hydrocephalus .
No EEG abnormalities were detected .
Karyotypes were 46 , XY and fragile X negative .
Routine chemistries ; amino , organic , and uronic acids ; oligosaccharides ; lysosomal enzymes ; and very long chain fatty acids were normal .
Remarkable phenotypic similarity between these brothers and their nephew and lack of manifestations in their mothers makes <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive inheritance <END> likely .
This syndrome , which does not appear to have been reported previously , adds to the delineation of XLMR .
Clinicopathologic review of twelve children with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> , and genital abnormalities ( Drash syndrome ) .
The clinicopathologic and radiologic features of 12 children with complete and incomplete forms of Drash syndrome are reported .
Their common denominator was a nephropathy.
Four had the full triad , consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> , and genital abnormalities ; five had <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> and genital abnormalities , and three had <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> .
Of the 11 children who had <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , eight had the <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Of the 10 whose condition progressed to <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal failure <END> , seven were less than 3 years of age .
The histologic features of <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> were favorable in all seven children , and the tumor was bilateral in three .
Of the nine patients who had genital abnormalities , eight had 46 , XY karyotype and either ambiguous genitalia (six patients ) or normal female phenotype ( two ) .
One other patient had a normal 46 , XX female karyotype and phenotype but had both mÃ¼llerian and wolffian structures and a streak ovary .
Nine patients had a distinct pelvicaliceal abnormality not previously reported as a feature of this syndrome . Other congenital abnormalities were aniridia , mental retardation , deafness , nystagmus , and cleft palate .
This syndrome must be considered in any infant with unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , particularly in young phenotypic female infants and in those children with ambiguous genitalia or <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> with an early presentation .
Acute unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> as the first symptom of cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.
Although cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> ( CADASIL ) is considered a cerebrovascular disorder with almost exclusively neurological symptoms , the arteriopathy is generalized and involves choroidal and retinal vasculature as demonstrated by fluorescein angiographic and ocular electrophysiological abnormalities .
The occurrence of acute <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy <END> ( NAION ) has not previously been reported in CADASIL .
To describe acute <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> due to NAION as a possible manifestation of CADASIL .
The patient was a 60-year-old man with subcortical diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> , multi-infarct dementia , tetraparesis , <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> , and a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
We performed clinical and neuro-ophthalmological evaluation , electrophysiological assessment , brain magnetic resonance imaging , and genetic screening for mutations or small deletions of the Notch3 gene , ( causing CADASIL ) .
The patient 's first symptom was acute <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> in the right eye due to NAION at age 27 years , in absence of the common cardiovascular risk factors and before any neurological impairment .
The patient was reevaluated at age 60 years , and neuro-ophthalmological examination showed optic disc atrophy in the right eye with arteriolar narrowing and a reduction in visual acuity in the left eye .
Fluorescein angiography of the right eye showed evidence of persistent peripapillary hypofluorescence with a retinal pigment epithelial windows defect in the inferior temporal area .
Pattern reversal visual evoked potentials were abolished in the right eye .
The P100 latency of the left eye was delayed and reduced in amplitude .
The diagnosis of CADASIL was confirmed by molecular analysis ( heterozygotes for the C406T mutation on exon 3 of the Notch3 gene ) .
There was a family history of cerebrovascular disorders and ocular impairment .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Visual loss <END> due to transient or stable ischemic events involving the optic nerve head should be considered in the CADASIL phenotype .
The possibility of CADASIL should also be evaluated in patients with NAION who do not have cardiovascular risk factors but do have a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
Macrosomia , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and ocular abnormalities ( MOMO syndrome ) in two unrelated patients : delineation of a newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> syndrome .
We describe 2 unrelated patients , a boy and a girl , with an <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> syndrome and the following common characteristics : <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocrania <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , ocular abnormalities ( <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal coloboma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> ) , downward slant of palpebral fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone maturation <END> .
Both cases are of sporadic occurrence with no consanguinity between the parents .
We suggest that this syndrome is due to a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mutation and propose to designate it with the acronym of " MOMO syndrome " ( Macrosomia , <START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Macrocrania <END> , Ocular anomalities .
Germline E-cadherin gene ( CDH1 ) mutations predispose to familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> and colorectal <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Inherited mutations in the E-cadherin gene ( CDH1 ) were described recently in three Maori kindreds with familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> susceptibility in non-Maori populations is due to germline CDH1 mutations .
Therefore , we screened eight familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> kindreds of British and Irish origin for germline CDH1 mutations , by SSCP analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences .
Each family contained : (i ) two cases of gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years ; or ( ii ) three or more cases of gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Novel germline CDH1 mutations ( a nonsense and a splice site ) were detected in two families ( 25% ) .
Both mutations were predicted to truncate the E-cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain .
In one family there was evidence of non-penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> ; thus , in addition to six cases of gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> , a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> at age 30 years .
We have confirmed that germline mutations in the CDH1 gene cause familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> in non-Maori populations .
However , only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by CDH1 mutations .
Loss of E-cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers , and our findings provide evidence that germline CDH1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Thus , CDH1 should be investigated as a cause of inherited susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancers .
Hereditary optic neuropathies share a common <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> coupling defect .
Hereditary optic neuropathies are <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> diseases characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> optic nerve atrophy <END> and impairment of central vision .
We found a common coupling defect of oxidative phosphorylation in fibroblasts of patients affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( mutations of OPA1 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> ( mutations of OPA3 ) , and Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> , a disorder associated with point mutations of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA complex I genes .
Interestingly , the energetic defect was significantly more pronounced in Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> patients with a more complex phenotype , the so-called plus phenotype .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinopathy <END> in a brother-sister pair : evidence for germ line mosaicism and further delineation of the ocular phenotype .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinopathy <END> ( OMIM 156590 ) is an autosomal dominant syndrome , characterized primarily by chorioretinal lesions and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
The phenotype is variable , and has been described in association with retinal dysplasia that can be stable or show progressive degeneration , retinal folds , lymphedema , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We describe two siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and variable retinal and choroidal abnormalities .
Patient 1 has multiple atrophic and dysplastic-appearing lesions of the retina and choroid in each eye .
An ERG at 5 months of age disclosed markedly subnormal scotopic and photopic responses with delayed flicker timing .
Patient 2 has bilateral macular folds with vitreoretinopathy , serous retinal detachments , glaucoma , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> OU . Both have <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with hypotonia and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Chorioretinopathy <END> and retinal folds have been described independently in <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with chorioretinopathy.
The present sibs are the first in whom these features are observed while the parents are normal .
Our findings support an expansion of the ocular phenotype and suggest the existence of germ line mosaicism .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital heart disease <END> in maternal phenylketonuria : report from the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study .
The frequency and types of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> in offspring from pregnancies in women with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphenylalaninemia <END> were examined in the international prospective Maternal Phenylketonuria Collaborative Study . Relationships of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> in offspring to the basal blood phenylalanine level in the mother , metabolic control through diet during pregnancy , and phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations in mother and offspring were determined .
The 416 offspring from 412 maternal phenylketonuria pregnancies that produced live births and 100 offspring from the 99 control pregnancies were included in this examination .
Thirty-four of the 235 offspring ( 14 % ; 95 % CI , 10.2 to 19.6% ) from pregnancies in phenylketonuric women with a basal phenylalanine level > or = 900 microM ( 15 mg/dL ) [normal blood phenylalanine < 120 microM ( 2 mg/dL) ] and not in metabolic control [phenylalanine level < or = 600 microM (1 0 mg/dL) ] by the eighth gestational week had <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> compared with one control offspring ( 1% ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> .
One offspring among the 50 ( 2% ) from mothers with non-phenylketonuria mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphenylalaninemia <END> also had <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> .
Coarctation of the aorta and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were overrepresented compared with expected percentages among those with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> in the general population .
A basal maternal phenylalanine level > 1800 microM (30 mg/dL ) significantly increased the risk for bearing a child with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> ( p = 0.003 ) .
Phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations in the mothers and offspring did not have an independent relationship to <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> but were related through the basal maternal phenylalanine levels .
The data in this study indicate that a basal maternal phenylalanine level of 900 microM may be a threshold for <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> , that women with the most severe degree of phenylketonuria are at highest risk for bearing such a child , and that prevention of the <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> requires initiation of the low phenylalanine diet before conception or early in pregnancy with metabolic control no later than the eighth gestational week .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Megalencephaly <END> and perisylvian <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> postaxial polydactyly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> : a rare brain malformation syndrome associated with mental retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Megalencephaly <END> ( MEG ) or enlarged brain occurs as a mild familial variant with normal brain structure , but otherwise is an uncommon human brain malformation that may be associated with significant developmental and neurological problems .
It has been classified into anatomic and metabolic subtypes .
The clinical findings associated with anatomic <START:PHENOTYPE> megalencephaly <END> have been variable and few distinct subtypes have been described .
We report five unrelated children with severe congenital MEG associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> ( PMG) , <START:PHENOTYPE> postaxial polydactyly <END> ( POLY ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( HYD ) .
The clinical records and brain MRI of five patients have been reviewed .
All patients had striking MEG that was symmetric in three of the five patients , and mildly asymmetric in two .
The birth OFC was between +2 and +4 SD .
The gyral pattern was irregular with microgyri typical of PMG , which was most severe in the perisylvian region in all five patients .
Four of the five had <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> treated with a shunt .
Subsequently , one of the shunted patients had small ventricles while the others had mildly to moderately enlarged lateral ventricles .
Three of the five patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> postaxial polydactyly <END> of all four limbs .
The corpus callosum was dysmorphic in one patient with a fused rostrum and genu , and intact although mildly thin in the others .
None were abnormally thick .
All patients had severe mental retardation ; three had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and another had an epileptiform EEG .
We believe this constellation of findings ( MEG-PMG-POLY-HYD ) comprises a new and distinct malformation syndrome that we designate the MPPH syndrome .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disease associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA heteroplasmy .
A variable combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proximal neurogenic muscle weakness <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory neuropathy <END> occurred in four members of a family and was maternally transmitted .
There was no histochemical evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy.
Blood and muscle from the patients contained two populations of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA , one of which had a previously unreported restriction site for AvaI .
Sequence analysis showed that this was due to a point mutation at nucleotide 8993 , resulting in an amino acid change from a highly conserved leucine to arginine in subunit 6 of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> H(+ )-ATPase .
There was some correlation between clinical severity and the amount of mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA in the patients ; this was present in only small quantities in the blood of healthy elderly relatives in the same maternal line .
Outcome and family study of the subtypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> in the west of Ireland .
The authors sought to clarify differences in outcome and familial psychopathology among the classical subtypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
In the epidemiologically based Roscommon Family Study , personal interviews were conducted with 88 % of traceable living probands ( N = 415 ) an average of 16 years after illness onset and with 86 % of traceable living first-degree relatives ( N = 1 ,753 ) .
Probands meeting the DSM-III-R criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> were subtyped by DSM-III-R and ICD-9 .
By both diagnostic systems , age at onset differed significantly across subtypes , being earliest in the subjects with the hebephrenic and catatonic subtypes and latest in the paranoid subjects .
The probands with the paranoid subtype had substantially better outcome , especially in occupational functioning and capacity for self-care .
The DSM-III-R criteria for paranoid <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> were considerably more successful than the ICD-9 criteria in selecting good-outcome cases .
Neither the risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> nor the risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> spectrum disorders significantly differed in relatives as a function of the proband subtype .
The subtypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> did not " breed true " within families .
Paranoid <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , especially when narrowly defined , as in DSM-III-R , has a substantially better outcome than other subtypes .
From a familial perspective , 1 ) paranoid <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> is not a milder form of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and 2 ) catatonic <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> is probably closely related to typical <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
The subtypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> are not , from a familial perspective , etiologically distinct syndromes .
Fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> : the first account in a family of Chinese descent .
Fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> ( FFI ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disease linked to a mutation in the prion protein gene .
Fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> is characterized by sleep disturbance and loss of neurons , with gliosis in the thalamic nuclei .
To describe the clinical , neurophysiological , radiological , and neuropathological data in a Chinese family with FFI .
Tertiary referral university hospital setting .
Patient 1 was a 36-year-old man who presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> .
In the subsequent 9 months , he developed <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , followed by death .
Patient 2 was the aunt of patient 1 , and presented at the age of 47 years with <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ; her condition declined during a 12-month period .
Genetic analysis was performed , followed by neuropathological and biochemical analysis of the disease-associated form of the prion protein PrPSc on the postmortem brain specimen .
Molecular analysis demonstrated an aspartic acid to asparagine mutation at codon 178 and homozygosity for methionine at codon 129.
Both patients showed severe <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> and prominent gliosis in the thalamus and brainstem involvement , with evidence of astrogliosis in the inferior olivary nucleus .
Patient 1 also had <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> and astrogliosis in the region of the superior colliculus and in the periaqueductal region .
PrPSc was detected on Western blot analysis , and had a wide distribution .
The strongest signals were present in the amygdala , hypothalamus , caudate , parahippocampal gyrus , periaqueductal gray matter , and mediodorsal thalamus .
To our knowledge , this is the first report of FFI in a family of Chinese descent .
This supports the worldwide distribution of FFI , and despite differences in genetic background , the clinical and pathological findings are similar to those found in white patients with FFI .
Three distinct types of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> seen in 6 families .
Six families with <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> ( congenital contractures ) inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> manner are reported .
Family histories from a study of over 350 patients with congenital contractures of the joints ( <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> ) were reviewed and of these , three probands had family histories consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive inheritance <END> .
Three other families were recognized through correspondence .
Three forms of X-linked recessively inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> are described : (1 ) Severe lethal X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> with severe contractures <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> deformities , hypotonia , and death due to respiratory insufficiency within 3 months of birth ( 1 family ) ; (2 ) Moderately severe X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> with severe contractures , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphallus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , inguinal hernias , and normal intelligence ( 2 families ) ; and (3 ) Resolving X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> with mild to moderate contractures at birth which improve dramatically with time ( 2 families and 1 sporadic case ) .
Clinical and Molecular genetics of Stickler syndrome .
Stickler syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder with characteristic ophthalmological and orofacial features , deafness , and arthritis .
Abnormalities of vitreous gel architecture are a pathognomonic feature , usually associated with high <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> which is congenital and non-progressive .
There is a substantial risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> .
Less common ophthalmological features include paravascular pigmented lattice degeneration and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
Non-ocular features show great variation in expression .
Children with Stickler syndrome typically have a <START:PHENOTYPE> flat midface <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , short nose , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
These features can become less pronounced with age .
Midline clefting , if present , ranges in severity from a cleft of the soft palate to <START:PHENOTYPE> Pierre-Robin sequence <END> .
There is joint hypermobility which declines with age .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Osteoarthritis <END> develops typically in the third or fourth decade .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia <END> is often apparent radiologically .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Sensorineural deafness <END> with high tone loss may be asymptomatic or mild .
Occasional findings include slender extremities and long fingers .
Stature and intellect are usually normal .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitral valve prolapse <END> was reported to be a common finding in one series but not in our experience .
The majority of families with Stickler syndrome have mutations in the COL2A1 gene and show the characteristic type 1 vitreous phenotype .
The remainder with the type 2 vitreous phenotype have mutations in COL11A1 or other loci yet to be identified .
Mutations in COL111A2 can give rise to a syndrome with the systemic features of Stickler syndrome but no ophthalmological abnormality .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> phenotype in 22q11 deletion syndrome .
This study investigated the <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> phenotype in 24 subjects with 22q11 deletion syndrome ( 22qDS ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ( 22qDS-schizophrenia) , a rare but relatively homogenous genetic subtype of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> associated with a microdeletion on chromosome 22 . Individuals with 22qDS are at genetically high risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Standard measures of signs , symptoms , and course of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> were assessed in 16 adults with 22qDS-schizophrenia who did not meet criteria for mental retardation and in 46 adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> without evidence of 22qDS from a community familial sample .
There were no significant differences in age at onset , lifetime or cross-sectional core positive and negative schizophrenic symptoms , or global functioning between the two groups of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Patients with 22qDS-schizophrenia had higher excitement subscale scores and less lifetime substance use than the comparison patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , but no significant differences in anxiety-depression symptom severity were found between the groups .
These findings indicate that the core clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> phenotype would not distinguish individuals with a 22qDS subtype from those with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> who did not have the 22qDS subtype .
The results provide further support for the utility of 22qDS-schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental model of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> as well as support for prospective studies of individuals with 22qDS to help identify precursors of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Sister and brother with Vici syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> , and recurrent infections .
A sister and brother with Vici syndrome are described .
They both had oculocutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , and cardiomyopathy.
They were born to healthy unrelated parents , and had postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , profound developmental delay , hypotonia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
The sister had recurrent infections , and died of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> at age 19 months .
The brother is alive at age six months with mild cardiomyopathy , and had a single episode of acute bronchitis at age three months .
Review of the clinical manifestations of the sibs we described and six children reported in the literature indicates that Vici syndrome is a distinct clinical entity .
Its main clinical manifestations include <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , profound developmental delay , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , cardiomyopathy , and recurrent infections .

The syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> presenting without stroke .
To study and describe a large family with the tRNA Leu( UUR ) point mutation at position 3243 in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA , which is associated with the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> .
Survey ; case series .
University hospital inpatient and outpatient neurology department .
Twelve patients from three generations in a family carrying the tRNA Leu( UUR ) point mutation at position 3243 were studied .
Clinical evaluation , muscle biopsy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA point mutation quantitation of the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> in muscle and blood .
Correlation between clinical , pathologic , and genotypic features .
Family members had various combinations of sensorineural hearing loss , retinal pigmentary degeneration , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , hypothalamic hypogonadism , and mild myopathy.
Only one member had a strokelike episode at the age of 46 years .
This patient had the highest point mutation percentage .
This report suggests that this point mutation may not be associated with stroke in all families and that whether patients develop stroke may depend on the percentage of mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA and its tissue distribution .
Prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> in Chamorros on Guam : relationship to age , gender , education , and APOE . To estimate the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and its clinical subtypes among Chamorros on Guam aged 65 years or older and to examine associations with age , gender , education , and APOE genotype .
Chamorros , the indigenous people of Guam , had a high incidence of ALS and parkinsonism-dementia complex ( PDC) , in the 195 0s .
Over the next 50 years , ALS incidence declined markedly , but PDC only slightly .
The prevalence of late life <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> in Chamorros and its relationship to AL S/PDC are unknown .
Island-wide population-based survey of Chamorros aged 65 years or older as of January 1 , 2003 .
Two-stage assessment : cognitive and motor screening , followed by neurologic and psychometric evaluation .
Data were reviewed at consensus conference to make clinical diagnoses .
Of 2 ,78 9 Chamorros aged 65 years or older , 73 % were enrolled ; 27% declined participation , died before contact or screening , or moved off Guam .
The point prevalence of all-cause <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> on February 1 , 2004 , was 12 .2% .
Prevalence data for subtypes were as follows : Guam <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ( clinically equivalent to AD ) , 8.8% ; PDC , 1.5 % ; pure vascular <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , 1.3% ; other , 0.6% .
The prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> rose exponentially with age .
Low education was significantly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , but gender was not .
There was a trend toward higher PDC prevalence among men .
The APOE epsilon4 allele was not associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
The prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> among elderly Chamorros is relatively high .
Guam <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> is the most common diagnosis and exceeds parkinsonism-dementia complex .
Age and low education are strongly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , but gender and APOE epsilon4 are not .
Incidence studies will allow risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> to be clarified .
Muscle 3243A-->G mutation load and capacity of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> energy-generating system .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> energy-generating system ( MEGS ) encompasses the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> enzymatic reactions from oxidation of pyruvate to the export of adenosine triphosphate .
It is investigated in intact muscle mitochondria by measuring the pyruvate oxidation and adenosine triphosphate production rates , which we refer to as the " MEGS capacity. "
Currently , little is known about MEGS pathology in patients with mutations in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA . Because MEGS capacity is an indicator for the overall <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> function related to energy production , we searched for a correlation between MEGS capacity and 3243A-->G mutation load in muscle of patients with the MELAS ( <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ) syndrome .
In muscle tissue of 24 patients with the 3243A-->G mutation , we investigated the MEGS capacity , the respiratory chain enzymatic activities , and the 3243A-->G mutation load . To exclude coinciding mutations , we sequenced all 22 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> transfer RNA genes in the patients , if possible .
We found highly significant differences between patients and control subjects with respect to the MEGS capacity and complex I , III , and IV activities .
MEGS-related measurements correlated considerably better with the mutation load than respiratory chain enzyme activities .
We found no additional mutations in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> transfer RNA genes of the patients .
The results show that MEGS capacity has a greater sensitivity than respiratory chain enzymatic activities for detection of subtle <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial dysfunction <END> .
This is important in the workup of patients with rare or new <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations , and with low mutation loads .
In these cases we suggest to determine the MEGS capacity .
Epstein-Barr virus-induced diseases in boys with the X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome ( XLP ) : update on studies of the registry .
Analyses of 100 subjects with the X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome ( XLP ) in 25 kindreds revealed four major interrelated phenotypes : infectious mononucleosis , malignant B-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> , aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> , and hypogammaglobulinemia .
Eighty-one of the patients died .
Two male subjects were asymptomatic but showed <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> to Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .
Seventy-five subjects had the infectious mononucleosis phenotype and concurrently , 17 subjects of this group had aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> .
All subjects with aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> died within a week .
Aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> did not accompany hypogammaglobulinemia or malignant <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> phenotypes .
Hypogammaglobulinemia had been detected before infectious mononucleosis in three subjects , after infectious mononucleosis in five subjects , and was not associated with infectious mononucleosis in 11 boys with hypogammaglobulinemia .
In nine subjects infectious mononucleosis appeared to have evolved into malignant <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> ; however , the majority of patients with malignant <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> showed no obvious antecedent infectious mononucleosis .
One subject had infectious mononucleosis following recurrent malignant <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> .
Twenty-six of 35 lymphomas were in the terminal ileum .
Results of immunologic and virologic studies of 15 survivors revealed combined variable <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> and deficient antibody responses to EBV-specific antigens .
Mothers of boys with XLP exhibited abnormally elevated titers of antibodies of EBV . Subjects of both sexes with phenotypes of XLP should be investigated for <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> to EBV . Persons with inherited or acquired <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> may be vulnerable to life-threatening EBV-induced diseases .
Use of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> drainage devices in the management of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
To describe intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and visual acuity outcomes after <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> drainage device placement in eyes with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
Retrospective , noncomparative , consecutive , interventional case series .
The medical records of all patients who underwent <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> drainage device placement for the management of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between January 1 , 1989 , and December 31 , 1999 , were reviewed .
The study included eight eyes of five patients with a median age at the time of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> drainage device placement of 92 months ( range , 10- 495 months ) and a median follow-up of 19 months ( range , 11 - 33 months ) .
Preoperatively , the mean IOP was 35 mm Hg using a mean of one antiglaucoma medication .
Postoperatively , the mean IOP was reduced to 14 .9 mm Hg and no patient was using antiglaucoma medication .
Final visual acuity was improved compared with preoperatively in five of eight eyes ( 63% ) and remained unchanged in two eyes ( 25% ) .
Loss of light perception occurred in one eye owing to retinal detachment .
Success rates using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were 100% at 6 months and 88 % at 1 year . <START:PHENOTYPE> Glaucoma <END> drainage device placement for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> achieves IOP control and vision preservation in most patients .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> acro-fronto-facio-nasal dysostosis associated with genitourinary anomalies : a third case report .
We report on a 22-day-old Tunisian boy born to consanguineous ( first-cousin ) parents ( F = 1/16 ) .
The patient presents <START:PHENOTYPE> wide forehead <END> with frontal <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> wide anterior fontanel <END> , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , coloboma of the upper lids , <START:PHENOTYPE> proptosis <END> , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> between fingers 3 and 4 , hypoplastic 3rd , 4th and 5th toes with nail dysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> with cleft glans , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid scrotum <END> .
Brain MRI showed right frontal <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalocele <END> with anomalies of the cortical gyration without any corpus callosum abnormality .
Normal chromosomes and parents ' consanguinity are suggestive of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Facial midline anomalies associated with limb and genitourinary anomalies is very uncommon .
We present the third case reported in the literature .

Guadalajara <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> type III: a new probably <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome .
A Mexican family is presented with the main clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , a distinctive facial appearance because of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , symblepharon and spinal defects . Other clinical manifestations included : multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> nevi <END> , simplified ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> retrognathia <END> , congenital shortness of the sternocleidomastoid muscle , thin hands and feet , a <START:PHENOTYPE> small penis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mild mental retardation <END> .
Radiographic studies revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida occulta <END> at cervical and dorso-lumbar levels , increased bone trabeculae , cortical thickening and <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> .
The presence of five affected members through four generations suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> although no male-to-male transmission was documented .
The authors propose this as a new entity , and have designated it Guadalajara <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> type III.
Myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sideroblastic anemia <END> : a new syndrome .
We describe 2 sibs ( brother and sister ) with myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> sideroblastic anemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> , high philtrum , <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
Very low levels of cytochromes a , b , and c were detected in the patients ' muscle mitochondria .
Deposition of iron within the mitochondria of bone marrow erythroblasts was observed on electron microscopy .
Irregular and enlarged mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions were also seen on electron microscopy of the patients ' muscle specimen .
Examination of DNA from the affected sibs showed no deletions in the mitochondrial DNA nor the mutations identified in the syndromes of mitochondrial myopathy , encephalopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and strokelike episodes ( MELAS ) or myoclonus , and epilepsy associated with rugged-red fibers ( MERRF ) .
Since the parents were first cousins and 2 of 6 sibs ( male and female ) were affected , we suggest that the syndrome expressed by our patients represents a previously unknown <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder that includes mitochondrial myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sideroblastic anemia <END> .
Coeliac disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and cerebral calcifications .
The Italian Working Group on Coeliac Disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> .
There have been anecdotal reports of an association between coeliac disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with cerebral calcifications that resemble those of the Sturge-Weber syndrome .
A series of patients who had <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with calcifications , in whom coeliac disease ( CD ) was incidentally observed , prompted us to study this association . 43 patients ( 15 male , age range 4.6-30.7 years ) were selected from two series . 31 patients with cerebral calcifications of unexplained origin and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ( series A ) underwent intestinal biopsy . 12 patients with CD and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ( series B ) underwent computed tomography.
Antibodies to gluten , folic acid serum concentrations , were measured , and HLA typing was done in most patients .
24 of the series A patients were identified as having CD on the basis of a flat intestinal mucosa ( 15 /22 with a high concentration of serum antigluten ) , and 5 series B patients showed cerebral calcifications , giving a total of 29 cases with the combination of CD , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and cerebral calcifications ( CEC ) .
In 27 of these CEC patients , calcifications were located in the parieto-occipital regions .
Only 2 of the series A patients had gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of intestinal biopsy ; most patients had recurrent diarrhoea , <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> , and other symptoms suggestive of CD in the first 3 years of life .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in CEC patients was poorly responsive to antiepileptic drugs .
Gluten-free diet beneficially affected the course of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> only when started soon after <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> onset .
Cases of "atypical Sturge-Weber syndrome " ( characterised by serpiginous cerebral calcifications and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> without facial port-wine naevus ) should be reviewed , and CD should be ruled out in all cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and cerebral calcifications of unexplained origin .
Delineation of a <START:PHENOTYPE> contiguous gene syndrome <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple exostoses <END> , enlarged <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> craniofacial dysostosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , caused by deletions in the short arm of chromosome 11 . A <START:PHENOTYPE> contiguous gene syndrome <END> due to deletions of the proximal short arm of chromosome 11 is described in eight patients belonging to four families .
The main clinical features are <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple exostoses <END> , enlarged <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> craniofacial dysostosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The patients have cytogenetic and/or molecular deletions of chromosome 11p11 -p13 .
These deletions are located between the centromere and D11S914 in a region of approximately 20cM .
The present study confirms the presence of a <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple exostoses <END> gene on chromosome 11p .
Furthermore , it suggests that the gene for isolated foramina parietalie permagna and genes associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> craniofacial dysostosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> reside in the same chromosomal region .
Mutations in the human ortholog of Aristaless cause X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> often occur together .
They are both heterogeneous conditions with acquired and genetic causes .
Where causes are primarily genetic , major advances have been made in unraveling their molecular basis .
The human X chromosome alone is estimated to harbor more than 100 genes that , when mutated , cause <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
At least eight autosomal genes involved in idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> have been identified , and many more have been implicated in conditions where <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> is a feature .
We have identified mutations in an X chromosome-linked , Aristaless-related , homeobox gene ( ARX) , in nine families with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( syndromic and nonspecific) , various forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , including infantile spasms and <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonic seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
Two recurrent mutations , present in seven families , result in expansion of polyalanine tracts of the ARX protein .
These probably cause protein aggregation , similar to other polyalanine and polyglutamine disorders .
In addition , we have identified a missense mutation within the ARX homeodomain and a truncation mutation .
Thus , it would seem that mutation of ARX is a major contributor to X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> syndrome of branchial arch and other defects .
We report on two brothers and their maternal first cousin who have branchial arch defects and other anomalies .
Similar physical findings in all three include <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , highly arched palate , apparently lowset , <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding ears <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , slightly <START:PHENOTYPE> webbed neck <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
In addition , two boys had <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and one had subvalvar <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonic stenosis <END> and body asymmetry .
We suggest that these cousins have an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> syndrome of which branchial arch defects are a component .
Other pleiotropic manifestations of the mutant gene include <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> ; body asymmetry and relatively <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> may be components as well .
The natural history and ophthalmic involvement in childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis at the hospital for sick children .
To characterize signs , symptoms , and the natural history of myasthenic syndromes in pediatric patients .
Retrospective noncomparative case series .
Thirty-four patients with a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> were identified from either the hospital 's or treating physician 's database .
Retrospective chart review , clinical examination , and telephone interview .
Information pertaining to the ophthalmologic and neurologic examination , diagnostic interventions , and treatment was noted .
Patients with active disease , attending during the study period , were examined at their outpatient visits .
Those who no longer attended the hospital were contacted by means of a telephone interview to complete their follow-up .
Thirty-four children were found to have <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> .
Two had transient neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> , which resolved quickly .
Seven (2 0.6% ) patients had congenital myasthenic syndromes ( CMS ) and 25 ( 73 .5% , 19 females ) were affected with autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis ( AMG ) .
In those patients with severe CMS , three showed signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized weakness <END> , including failure to thrive , frequent apneas , and aspirations .
In four patients with mild CMS , eye signs were relatively more prominent .
In all patients with CMS , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , ophthalmoplegia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> were the main ophthalmologic signs and remained relatively constant .
Fourteen ( 56% ) patients with AMG had ocular signs and symptoms , and five of them progressed to systemic involvement in 7. 8 months on average ( range , 1-23 ) .
The remaining nine patients with ocular AMG had either <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> and were treated with pyridostigmine ( nine patients ) and prednisone ( two patients ) .
Patients with ocular AMG were seen at 78 months on average , those with systemic AMG at 85 .6 months .
Systemic AMG was seen in 16 patients .
No thymomas were found in 14 patients who underwent thymectomy .
Of the 25 patients with AMG , 8 are still being treated , 8 are in remission for an average of 65 .2 months and are asymptomatic , 4 patients are receiving long-term immunosuppressants ( 1 has likely sustained permanent damage to her extraocular muscles with complete ophthalmoplegia and <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> ) , and 4 have been lost to follow-up .
Finally , one patient died after aspiration because of <START:PHENOTYPE> bulbar weakness <END> .
Patients with CMS varied in the degree of severity .
Apneic attacks , aspiration , and failure to thrive may obscure the diagnosis .
Compared with AMG , their ophthalmologic signs and symptoms were usually permanent .
Visual signs and symptoms were usually prominent in those patients with active AMG , but those in remission were asymptomatic .
More than half of the patients with juvenile AMG had ocular symptoms .
Generalization occurred in a minority in an average of 7. 8 months .
Patients entered remission after approximately 2 years of treatment and were visually asymptomatic .
This study suggests that long-term permanent damage to the extraocular muscles as a result of juvenile AMG is rare .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myasthenia <END> gravis is a life-threatening disease as evidenced by the death of one of our patients .
Many of these patients are first seen by the ophthalmologist who can aid the diagnosis , screen for amblyopia , and monitor the patient 's response to therapy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> deafness and <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome in a Swedish pedigree is described .
Five patients were affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
Four of these patients had symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Optic atrophy <END> , other neurological abnormalities and psychiatric symptoms developed with increasing disease duration .
Three patients had non-neurological disease in addition , including diabetes mellitus in two and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in one .
Autopsy with neuropathological examination was performed in one case .
Molecular studies focused on the short arm of chromosome 6 , including the HLA DR2 locus associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> and the ( CAG )n repeat at the spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 1 ( SCA1 ) locus .
Biochemical investigation of muscle biopsy of one case indicated mitochondrial dysfunction with selective decrease in ATP production for substrates that normally give the highest rates .
The activity of glutamate dehydrogenase was reduced , indicating a low mitochondrial density .
We postulate an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> genetic factor responsible for this syndrome .
Linkage was excluded to HLA DR2 , and a normal sized SCA1 repeat was observed .
We conclude that a locus predisposing to <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , deafness and <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> exists outside this region of chromosome 6 .
Cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts .
Extensive cerebral calcifications and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> have been reported in two rare disorders Coats plus and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> with calcifications and cysts .
In the latter , a progressive formation of parenchymal brain cysts is a special feature , whereas Coats plus is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , bilateral retinal telangiectasias and exudations ( Coats disease) , <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysplastic nails <END> without cyst formation .
We identified 13 patients , including two pairs of siblings , with extensive cerebral calcifications and leukoencephalopathy.
We reviewed clinical , ophthalmologic , radiologic and neuropathologic data of seven deceased patients and studied five patients prospectively .
Eleven patients were small for gestational age ; the other symptoms emerged from infancy to adolescence .
All patients had neurologic symptoms including <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive decline <END> .
Progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> intracerebral calcifications <END> involved deep gray nuclei , brainstem , cerebral and cerebellar white matter , and dentate nuclei and were accompanied by diffuse white matter signal changes and , in five patients , cerebral cysts .
Eleven patients had retinal telangiectasias or angiomas .
Additional features were skeletal and hematologic abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal bleeding <END> , and poor growth .
Neuropathologic examination showed extensive calcinosis and abnormal small vessels with thickened , hyalinized wall and reduced lumen .
Our data suggest that Coats plus syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> with calcifications and cysts belong to the same spectrum .
The primary abnormality seems to be an obliterative cerebral angiopathy involving small vessels , leading to dystrophic calcifications via slow necrosis and finally to formation of cysts and secondary white matter abnormalities .
Severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperaldosteronism <END> type I : relationship to gender and degree of biochemical disturbance .
In familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperaldosteronism <END> type I ( FH-I) , inheritance of a hybrid 11beta-hydroxylase/aldosterone synthase gene causes ACTH-regulated aldosterone overproduction .
In an attempt to understand the marked variability in <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> severity in FH-I , we compared clinical and biochemical characteristics of 9 affected individuals with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> ( normotensive or <START:PHENOTYPE> onset <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> after 15 yr , blood pressure never >16 0/10 0 mm Hg , < or = 1 medication required to control <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , no history of stroke , age >18 yr when studied ) with those of 17 subjects with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> onset <END> before 15 yr , or systolic blood pressure >18 0 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >12 0 mm Hg at least once , or > or = 2 medications , or history of stroke ) .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> was more frequent in males ( 11 of 13 males vs . 6 of 13 females ; P < 0.05 ) .
All 4 subjects still normotensive after age 18 yr were females .
Of 10 other affected , deceased individuals ( 7 males and 3 females ) from a single family , all six who died before 60 yr of age ( 4 by stroke ) were males .
Biochemical studies were conducted in 6 mild and 16 severe subjects .
The 2 groups were similar in terms of urinary sodium excretion .
Mild subjects tended , although not significantly , to have lower urinary 18-oxo-cortisol ( mean +/- SD , 27. 4 +/- 9. 0 vs . 35.2 +/- 12 .9 nmol/mmol creatinine x day ) , higher plasma potassium ( 4. 0 +/- 0.3 vs . 3.6 +/- 0.4 mmol/L ) , and lower recumbent ( 0800 h after overnight recumbency ) plasma aldosterone levels ( 498 +/- 279 vs . 744 +/- 290 pmol/L ) .
Upright ( midmorning after 2-3 h of upright posture ) plasma aldosterone levels were similar ( mild , 485 +/- 15 0 ; severe , 474 +/- 188 pmol/L ) .
In 1 normotensive female , upright PRA was much higher , and the upright aldosterone/PRA ratio was much lower than that in the other subjects .
The remaining mild subjects had similar upright PRA levels ( mild , 2.8 +/- 1.4 ; severe , 3.7 +/- 3.2 pmol/ L x min ) and aldosterone/PRA ratios ( mild , 199.5 +/- 133.4 ; severe , 200.6 +/- 15 0 .9 ) as severe subjects .
During angiotensin II ( AII) infusion studies ( n = 6 mild and 10 severe ) , performed during recumbency , aldosterone levels were lower in the mild group both basally (404 +/- 144 vs . 843 +/- 498 pmol/L ; P < 0.05 ) and after 60 min AII ( 2 ng/kg x min ; 261 +/- 130 vs . 520 +/- 330 pmol/L ; P < 0.05 ) .
Aldosterone was unresponsive ( rose by <5 0% ) to AII in all subjects .
Day curve studies ( blood collected every 2 h for 24 h ; n = 2 mild and 7 severe ) demonstrated abnormal regulation of aldosterone by ACTH rather than by AII in both groups .
In conclusion , in this series of patients with FH-I , males had more severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , and the degree of hybrid gene-induced aldosterone overproduction may have contributed to the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Parkinsonism <END> , premature menopause , and mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma mutations : clinical and molecular genetic study .
Mutations in the gene encoding mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma ( POLG) , the enzyme that synthesises mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) , have been associated with a mitochondrial disease-autosomal dominant or recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia-and multiple deletions of mtDNA .
Mitochondrial dysfunction is also suspected to participate in the pathogenesis of Parkinson 's disease . However , no primary gene defects affecting mitochondrial proteins causing mendelian transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> have been characterised .
We aimed to analyse the gene sequence of POLG in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> and their healthy relatives .
In seven families of various ethnic origins we assessed patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> and unaffected individuals by clinical , biochemical , morphological , and molecular genetic characterisation and positron emission tomography ( PET) .
We recorded mutations in POLG in members of all seven families .
Clinical assessment showed significant cosegregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> with POLG mutations ( p< 0.0001 ) , and PET findings were consistent with dopaminergic neuron loss .
Post-mortem examination in two individuals showed loss of pigmented neurons and pigment phagocytosis in substantia nigra without Lewy bodies .
Furthermore , most women with <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> had early menopause-before age 35 years .
The POLG gene defect resulted in secondary accumulation of mtDNA deletions in patients ' tissues .
Dysfunction of mitochondrial POLG causes a severe progressive multisystem disorder including <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and premature menopause , which are not typical of mitochondrial disease .
Cosegregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and POLG mutations in our families suggests that when defective , this gene can underlie mendelian transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
Awareness that mitochondrial POLG mutations can underlie <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> is important for clinicians working in diagnosis of movement disorders , as well as for studies of the genetics of Parkinson 's disease . Further , <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> with muscle weakness and neuropathy can mask symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , and clinicians should pay special attention to detect and treat <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> in those individuals .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and developmental delay associated with a chemotactic defect and transient hypogammaglobulinaemia in two brothers .
Two brothers presented with unusual facial features , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , developmental delay , and severe postnatal growth retardation .
They both developed <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> in infancy and have had <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> .
Additional physical findings in both boys included <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flexion contractures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic patellae <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
Their facial similarity was striking with sloping foreheads , beaked noses , large , <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding ears <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
Low levels of serum gammaglobulins and defective chemotaxis were present in both boys in infancy .
The hypogammaglobulinaemia was transient and improved , reaching normal levels by 3 1/2 years and 15 months , respectively .
Defective chemotaxis and <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> have persisted to the present .
Both parents were normal .
The mode of inheritance was not clear , as both X linked and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> patterns were possible .
Although patients with congenital malformations who also had immunodeficiency have previously been reported , immune system abnormalities , especially those of a transient nature , may frequently go unrecognised .
Clinical and <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> in keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans .
Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans ( KFSD ) is an uncommon genodermatosis mainly characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> follicular hyperkeratosis <END> , progressive cicatricial <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> .
Although an excess of affected males and linkage studies strongly suggest an X-linked pattern of inheritance , an apparently rarer <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> with prominent follicular inflammation has also been postulated .
We report on a three-generation family with five affected individuals and male-to-male transmission .
In addition to widespread keratosis pilaris , cicatricial <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> and eye involvement , our patients show diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> facial erythema <END> , recurrent folliculitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> enamel hypoplasia <END> , and thickened nails .
A literature review of the last 50 years identified 43 additional KFSD cases .
X-linked inheritance is demonstrated in two pedigrees by linkage studies and suspected in five .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern is confirmed in three families , including ours , by male-to-male transmission and considered likely in four .
Marked <START:PHENOTYPE> facial erythema <END> , extensive folliculitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> caries <END> are frequently reported in the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> variant , while palmo-plantar keratoderma and early onset seem more typical of the X-linked form .
Moreover , three sporadic male patients showing additional multisystemic abnormalities might be explained by an X-linked contiguous-gene syndrome .
An adult patient with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalciuria <END> due to a novel homozygous inactivating mutation of calcium-sensing receptor .
Inactivating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor ( CaSR ) cause familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> ( FHH ) and neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> ( NSHPT) .
Earlier investigations showed patients with FHH are heterozygous , and NSHPT are homozygous for inactivating mutations .
However , one adult patient with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalciuria <END> has been reported to have a homozygous inactivating mutation in CaSR ( Pro39Ala ) .
This suggested that mutant CaSR in this patient had some residual activity and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> was not so severe as to be fatal .
However , the function of this mutant CaSR was not evaluated .
In the present study , we describe a novel homozygous mutation in an adult patient with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalciuria <END> , and evaluate the function of the mutant CaSRs .
The DNA sequence of CaSR gene was determined by direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction product .
The function of mutant CaSR was analysed by creating mutant cDNAs by in vitro mutagenesis , transfection of mutant cDNAs into HEK293 cells and measuring intracellular ionized Ca in response to changes in extracellular Ca . A 26-year-old Japanese woman showed marked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> with an elevated parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) level .
Her consanguineous parents had asymptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> with relative <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalciuria <END> .
The proband had a homozygous mutation at codon 27 of CaSR gene ( CAA-->CGA , Gln27Arg ) .
Her parents were heterozygous for this mutation .
EC50 for Ca of this mutant CaSR ( GIn27Arg ) was 4.9 mM . EC50 of another mutant CaSR ( Pro39Ala ) whose homozygous mutation was discovered in an adult patient was 4.4 mM . These EC50s were significantly higher than that of wild-type CaSR ( 3.7 } 0.1 mM) , but were the lowest among the reported EC50s for inactivating mutations of CaSR .
These results indicate that serum Ca and PTH levels are determined by residual function of mutant CaSR in patients with homozygous mutation in CaSR , and that patients having homozygous mutant CaSRs with mild dysfunction do not suffer from fatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> in infancy and can survive into adulthood .
Recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with ocular apraxia : review of 22 Portuguese patients .
The recessive ataxias are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> associated with a number of different neurologic , ophthalmologic , or general signs .
They are often difficult to classify in clinical terms , except for Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , ataxia-telangiectasia , and a relatively small group of rare conditions for which the molecular basis has already been defined .
To study the clinical presentation and to define diagnostic criteria in a group of Portuguese patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and ocular apraxia , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> without the essential clinical and laboratory features of ataxia-telangiectasia .
We reviewed 22 patients in 11 kindreds , identified through a systematic survey of hereditary ataxias being conducted in Portugal .
Age at onset ranged from 1 to 15 years , with a mean of 4.7 years .
The duration of symptoms at the time of last examination varied from 5 to 58 years .
All patients presented with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , the characteristic ocular apraxia , and a peripheral neuropathy.
Associated neurologic signs included <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> .
Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 16 patients , all of whom showed cerebellar atrophy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> with ocular apraxia may be more frequent than postulated before , and may be identified clinically using the following criteria : (1 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> transmission ; (2 ) early onset ( for most patients in early childhood ) ; (3 ) combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , ocular apraxia , and early <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> , with later appearance of the full picture of peripheral neuropathy ; (4 ) absence of mental retardation , telangiectasia , and immunodeficiency ; and (5 ) the possibility of a long survival , although with severe motor handicap.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dementia <END> in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> but is independent of plaques and neurofibrillary tangles .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> is frequently found in demented and nondemented elderly persons , but its contribution to the causation of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> is unknown .
Therefore , we investigated the relation between the amount of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> and the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> in 19 patients with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type .
The advantage of studying hereditary cerebral hemorrhage in amyloidosis-Dutch type is that patients with this disease consistently have severe <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> with minimal neurofibrillary pathology .
The amount of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> , as quantified by computerized morphometry , was strongly associated with the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> independent of neurofibrillary pathology , plaque density , or age .
The number of cortical amyloid beta-laden severely stenotic vessels , vessel-within-vessel configurations , and cerebral amyloid angiopathy-associated microvasculopathies was associated with the amount of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
A semiquantitative score , based on the number of amyloid beta-laden severely stenotic vessels , completely separated demented from nondemented patients .
These results suggest that extensive ( more than 15 amyloid beta-laden severely stenotic vessels in five frontal cortical sections ) <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> alone is sufficient to cause <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type .
This may have implications for clinicopathological correlations in Alzheimer 's disease and other dementias with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
Identification of a new gene locus for adolescent <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> , on chromosome 3q22 in a large Venezuelan pedigree .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephronophthisis <END> , an autosomal-recessive cystic kidney disease , is the most frequent monogenic cause for <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> in childhood .
Infantile and juvenile forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> are known to originate from separate gene loci .
We describe here a new disease form , adolescent <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> , that is clearly distinct by clinical and genetic findings .
In a large , 340-member consanguineous Venezuelan kindred , clinical symptoms and renal pathology were evaluated .
Onset of terminal <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> was compared with that in a historical sample of <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile nephronophthisis <END> .
Onset of terminal <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> in adolescent <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> occurred significantly later ( median age 19 years , quartile borders 16. 0 and 25. 0 years ) than in <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile nephronophthisis <END> ( median age 13.1 years , quartile borders 11 .3 and 17 .3 years ; Wilcoxon test P=.0069 ) .
A total-genome scan of linkage analysis was conducted and evaluated by LOD score and total-genome haplotype analyses .
A gene locus for adolescent <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> was localized to a region of homozygosity by descent , on chromosome 3q22 , within a critical genetic interval of 2 . 4 cM between flanking markers D3S1292 and D3S1238 .
The maximum LOD score for D3S1273 was 5 .90 ( maximum recombination fraction.035 ) .
This locus is different than that identified for <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile nephronophthisis <END> .
These findings will have implications for diagnosis and genetic counseling in hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic renal failure <END> and provide the basis for identification of the responsible gene .
Mutations in CUL4B , which encodes a ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit , cause an X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome associated with aggressive outbursts , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> relative macrocephaly <END> , central obesity , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> .
We have identified three truncating , two splice-site , and three missense variants at conserved amino acids in the CUL4B gene on Xq24 in 8 of 250 families with X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) .
During affected subjects ' adolescence , a syndrome emerged with <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed puberty <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> relative macrocephaly <END> , moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , central obesity , unprovoked aggressive outbursts , fine intention <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , and abnormalities of the toes .
This syndrome was first described by Cazebas et al. , in a family that was included in our study and that carried a CUL4B missense variant .
CUL4B is a ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit implicated in the regulation of several biological processes , and CUL4B is the first XLMR gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase .
The relatively high frequency of CUL4B mutations in this series indicates that it is one of the most commonly mutated genes underlying XLMR and suggests that its introduction into clinical diagnostics should be a high priority .
Variant ataxia-telangiectasia presenting as primary-appearing <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> in Canadian Mennonites . To compare the phenotype of primary-appearing <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> due to variant ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T) with that of other <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> ascertained for genetics research .
Movement disorder specialists examined 20 Canadian Mennonite adult probands with primary-appearing <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , as well as relatives in 4 families with parent-child transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
We screened for the exon 43 c.6200 C> A ( p . A2067D ) ATM mutation and mutations in DYT1 and DYT6 .
Clinical features of the individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> who were harboring ATM mutations were compared with those of individuals without mutations .
Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous founder mutation in ATM in 13 members from 3 of the families , and no one harbored DYT6 or DYT1 mutations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dystonia <END> in ATM families mimicked other forms of early-onset primary torsion <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , especially DYT6 , with prominent cervical , cranial , and brachial involvement .
Mean age at onset was markedly younger in the patients with variant A- T ( n = 12 ) than in patients with other <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> ( n = 23) , ( 12 years vs 40 years , p < 0.05 ) .
The patients with A- T were remarkable for the absence of notable cerebellar atrophy on MRI , lack of frank <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> on examination , and absence of ocular telangiectasias at original presentation , as well as the presence of prominent myoclonus-dystonia in 2 patients .
Many also developed malignancies .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> and telangiectasias may not be prominent features of patients with variant A- T treated for <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> in adulthood , and variant A- T may mimic primary torsion <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> and myoclonus-dystonia .
Clinical and radiological features in young individuals with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome .
Nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterized by multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> , jaw cysts , palmar/plantar pits , spine and rib anomalies , and falx cerebri calcification .
Current diagnostic criteria are suboptimal when applied to pediatric populations , as most common symptoms often do not begin to appear until teenage years .
We studied minor and major clinical features in 30 children/teenagers and compared the findings with 75 adults from 26 families with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome .
Fifty percent of children/teenagers and 82 % of adults had at least one <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> .
Jaw cysts occurred in 60 % of children/teenagers and 81 % of adults .
Palmar/plantar pits were the most frequent feature seen in affected individuals at all ages .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Macrocephaly <END> was seen in 5 0 % of affected and 8 % of unaffected children/teenagers .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Frontal bossing <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel deformity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus deformity <END> , and cleft lip/palate were seen among affected children/teenagers but not among their unaffected siblings .
Falx calcification , the most frequent radiological feature , was present in 37% of individuals <2 0 and 79 % of those >2 0 years .
We report clinical and radiological manifestations of nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome in children/teenagers , many of whom lacked major features such as <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> , jaw cysts , and falx calcification .
Evaluations for palmar/plantar pits , craniofacial features , and radiological manifestations permit early diagnosis and optimum surveillance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ichthyosis <END> follicularis , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> ( IFAP ) syndrome : report of a new family with additional features and review .
Two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis , noncicatricial universal <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , hyerkeratotic psoriasis-like lesions , nails dystrophy , inguineal herniae , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor developmental delay <END> are described .
These features correspond to the <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> ( IFAP ) syndrome .
The youngest brother had in addition a bilateral absence of 4th fingers and camptodactyly , features never reported in patients with IFAP syndromes .

Clinical variability of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and corneal opacity and novel mutation in the alpha A crystallin gene ( CRYAA ) .
We studied 28 individuals from a four-generation Chilean family ( ADC54 ) including 13 affected individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and/or corneal opacity .
All individuals underwent a complete ophthalmologic exam .
We screened with a panel of polymorphic DNA markers for known loci that cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , if mutated , and refined the locus using the ABI Prism Linkage Mapping Set Version 2.5 , and calculated two-point lod scores .
Novel PCR primers were designed for the three coding exons , including intron-exon borders , of the candidate gene alpha A crystallin ( CRYAA ) .
Clinically , affected individuals had diverse and novel <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> with variable morphology ( anterior polar , cortical , embryonal , fan-shaped , anterior subcapsular ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcornea <END> and corneal opacity was evident in some .
Marker D21S171 gave a lod score of 4.89 ( theta(m ) = theta(f ) = 0 ) . CRYAA had a G414A transition that segregated with the disease and resulted in an amino acid alteration ( R116H ) .
The phenotypic variability within this family was significant with novel features of the <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> and a corneal opacity .
With the exception of <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> , the clinical features in all six previously reported families with mutations in the CRYAA gene were found in this family .
We identified a novel G414A transition in exon 3 of CRYAA that co-segregated with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> phenotype .
The resulting amino acid change R116H is in a highly conserved region and represents a change in charge .
The genotype-phenotype correlation of this previously unreported mutation provides evidence that other factors , genetic and/or environmental , may influence the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> as a result of this alteration .

COACH syndrome : report of two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar vermis hypoplasia <END> , oligophrenia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and mental retardation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> ( CHF ) is probably the most common cause of non-icteric hepatosplenomegaly and is encountered mainly in children and young adults .
We describe here two brothers from healthy , non-consanguineous parents .
The patients showed early hepatosplenomegaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> portal hypertension <END> , and no apparent kidney involvement .
Clinical and laboratory findings were similar in both patients .
Liver biopsies showed the presence of broad septa of fibrous tissue containing abundant bile ducts , portal tracts enlarged by fibrosis , and preserved lobular architecture .
The histological findings were suggestive of CHF . Ophthalmological assessment demonstrated <START:PHENOTYPE> visual impairment <END> with mild exotropia , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> .
Neurological examination showed <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
Brain MRI confirmed cerebellar malformation with inferior vermis hypoplasia .
This pattern of defects is consistent with COACH syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia <END> , Oligophrenia , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Coloboma <END> , Hepatic fibrocirrhosis ) which has previously been reported in five other cases .
Our report may contribute to a better delineation of the COACH syndrome phenotype in the spectrum of oculo-encephalohepato-renal disorders .
Linkage of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> to the short arm of chromosome 1 in two families .
At least half of the cases of profound <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> of early onset are caused by genetic factors , but few of the genetic defects have been identified .
This is particularly true of the most common hereditary forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , which occur in the absence of any associated syndrome .
We studied a large Indonesian family in which <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> was inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> first affects the high frequencies during the teens or 20s and becomes profound within 10 years .
To locate the responsible gene , we performed genetic-linkage analysis , using microsatellite markers distributed over the entire genome .
We then performed linkage analyses in an American family and a Dutch family with similar patterns of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> .
In the extended Indonesian family , a gene linked to <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> mapped to chromosome 1p , with a multipoint lod score of more than 7 . In the American family , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> was linked to the same locus on chromosome 1p , with a multipoint lod score of more than 5 .
In the Dutch family , however , this locus was ruled out .
The flanking markers D1S255 and D1S211 defined a region of 6 cM on chromosome 1p that is likely to contain the gene associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> in the first two families .
In some families with early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , the responsible gene is on chromosome 1p .
Primary non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> ( Meige disease ) is not caused by mutations in FOXC2 .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> is a genetic disorder with numerous phenotypic subgroups .
The most common form is the non-syndromic Meige disease , which is primarily of pubertal or later onset , with oedema clinically indistinguishable from that found in the lymphoedema-distichiasis syndrome .
There are also other very rare forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> such as yellow nail syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , which are clinically similar to Meige disease .
The only causative genes so far identified for the non-congenital primary lymphoedemas are the transcription factor FOXC2 , where mutations are known to produce <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> , and SOX18 in the very rare condition hypotrichosis-lymphoedema-telangiectasia .
This study has examined FOXC2 gene by sequence analysis in 23 affected individuals with Meige disease .
A novel truncating mutation ( c.563-584del ) was identified in one family and found to segregate with the disease in eight affected relatives over three generations .
This deletion creates a frameshift that predicts a premature stop at nucleotide 599 and truncating the normal protein by 38 % .
Although the affected patient initially selected for mutation screening from this family had <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> without <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> , all but one of his affected relatives who carried the FOXC2 mutation did have accessory eyelashes originating from their meibomian glands .
This is further confirmation that of the primary lymphoedemas , only <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> is caused by FOXC2 mutations .
All forms of post-pubertal <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> need careful phenotyping for <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> , which may prove difficult to confirm unless several family members are examined , and cannot ever be assumed to be absent from self-report .
Recessive and dominant mutations in retinoic acid receptor beta in cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Anophthalmia <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> , and cardiac defects are the main features of PDAC syndrome .
Recessive mutations in STRA6 , encoding a membrane receptor for the retinol-binding protein , have been identified in some cases with PDAC syndrome , although many cases have remained unexplained .
Using whole-exome sequencing , we found that two PDAC-syndrome-affected siblings , but not their unaffected sibling , were compound heterozygous for nonsense ( c.355 C > T [p.Arg119 ( âˆ— )] ) and frameshift ( c.12 01_1202ins CT [p.Ile403Serfs(âˆ— )15] ) mutations in retinoic acid receptor beta ( RARB ) .
Transfection studies showed that p.Arg119 ( âˆ— ) and p.Ile403Serfs(âˆ— )15 altered RARB had no transcriptional activity in response to ligands , confirming that the mutations induced a loss of function .
We then sequenced RARB in 15 subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and at least one other feature of PDAC syndrome .
Surprisingly , three unrelated subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> showed de novo missense mutations affecting the same codon ; two of the subjects had the c.1159 C> T ( Arg387Cys ) mutation , whereas the other one carried the c.1159 C> A ( p.Arg387Ser ) mutation .
We found that compared to the wild-type receptor , p.Arg387Ser and p.Arg387Cys altered RARB induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in transcriptional activity in response to retinoic acid ligands , suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism .
Our study thus suggests that both recessive and dominant mutations in RARB cause <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> , providing further evidence of the crucial role of the retinoic acid pathway during eye development and organogenesis .

Wilms 's tumour and <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> : clinical and cytogenetic features .
A survey carried out to detect children with aniridia/Wilms 's tumour syndrome identified 8 living and 3 dead children .
The incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> was found to be 1 in 43 among Wilms 's tumour patients in the UK .
The clinical features included complete bilaterial <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , cataracts , glaucoma , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , hyperkinesis , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> .
A high incidence of bilateral tumours ( 36% ) , male sex , presentation at a young age , and advanced maternal age appeared to be associated with the syndrome .
The 8 living children each had a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 11 . In contrast , although 2 patients with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> without Wilms 's tumour had other malformations , neither had genitourinary anomalies , and the only additional problems in patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> were cataracts .
Among 49 children with Wilms 's tumour without <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> ony one had bilateral tumours .
No chromosome abnormalities were detected in patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , nor were they detected in patients with Wilms 's tumour without <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> or in those with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> without Wilms 's tumour .
While many infants with the Wilms 's tumour/aniridia syndrome are clinically diagnosable at birth , chromosome analysis using the elongated chromosome method is especially valuable to confirm the diagnosis in girls with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> and in boys who lack the genitourinary malformations .
The presence of an 11p13 deletion confirms the diagnosis of the Wilms 's tumour/aniridia syndrome and indicates a very high risk for the development of Wilms 's tumour .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> syndrome : further delineation of the phenotype .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> ( ARIH) syndrome , which is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital ichthyosis <END> , abnormal hair and corneal involvement , has recently been shown in one consanguineous Israeli Arab family to be caused by a mutation in the ST14 gene , which encodes serine protease matriptase .
No other families have so far been described since the original report .
In this current report we describe a female patient from a second family with ARIH syndrome who carries a homozygous novel mutation , p.M1I .
The patient has <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital ichthyosis <END> , light brown , curly , <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> , improving with age , and sparse body hair , eyebrows and eyelashes .
She does not suffer from <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , but has <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharitis <END> .
The phenotype of this patient closely resembles that of the affected individuals in the previously reported family , although she does not have <START:PHENOTYPE> tooth abnormalities <END> and the <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> is milder .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal respiratory distress <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> caused by a mutation of NKX2-1 .
To study the NKX2-1 gene in two half-siblings with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) on state screen , prolonged <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal respiratory distress <END> despite term gestations , and persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , and developmental delay .
We amplified and sequenced DNA samples from blood or buccal swab for subjects and their unaffected siblings .
The same mutation that prevents splicing together of exons 2 and 3 of the NKX2-1 gene was present in the affected siblings , their mother , and maternal grandmother but not in their unaffected siblings .
The mutation was present in the heterozygous form , thus explaining the disease phenotype .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> transmission of mutations of NKX2-1 may cause <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal respiratory distress <END> at term , and persistent neurologic findings such as <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> in families with affected subjects in multiple generations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , V-esotropia , syndactyly and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
A recessively inherited syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> with weakness of extraocular and frontal muscles is reported in six members of three related kindreds .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Prognathism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> thick eyebrows <END> added to a typical facial appearance .
Additional findings included <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , borderline head circumference and toe syndactyly .
Borderline mental retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> were found in one patient .
The clinical features and the mode of inheritance distinguish this syndrome from other <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> syndromes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( CAHMR ) : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
We have studied 2 Egyptian sibs ( the offspring of normal first cousins ) with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and normal chromosomes .
Review showed that the condition of our patients was not similar to any previously reported entity .
POSSUM lists 84 syndromes with any of the above 3 main traits .
Two disorders with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , Martsolf syndrome and Mollica-Pavone-Anterer syndrome , have overlapping manifestations and therefore are particularly differentiated from our cases .
We suggest that the association of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> observed in this report represents a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
Pattern of familial aggregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Vitiligo <END> is a disorder whose cause is not well understood .
This study was undertaken to clarify whether genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> .
Data on 160 white kindreds living in the United States have been collected .
Each family was ascertained through a proband afflicted with <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> .
The nature and extent of familial aggregation and other relevant epidemiologic features have been determined .
The mean age at onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> is about 19 years in male and about 24 years in female individuals .
The percentage of probands reporting one or more first-degree relatives also afflicted with <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> is 20% .
Children of probands are found to be afflicted about 1.7 times more commonly than other first-degree relatives .
The relative risk ( RR ) for <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> is about 7 for parents , about 12 for siblings , and about 36 for children .
For second-degree relatives , the RR varies between 1 and 16 . Relative risks for all first- and second-degree relatives , except uncles and grandsons , are significant at the 5 % level .
In families in which one or more relatives of the proband are afflicted with <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> , the intrafamilial correlation of ages at onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> is moderate ( 0.6 ) .
No statistically significant effect ( at the 5 % level ) of parental age at first childbirth was seen on the proportion of offspring afflicted with <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> .
No significant association of some commonly related diseases ( eg , thyroid disorder or alopecia areata ) was observed with <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> or with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> .
The extent of familial aggregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> is statistically significant .
The pattern of relationship between RR and degree of kinship indicates involvement of genetic factors , although it is not consistent with single-locus mendelian transmission .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> ( SEMD ) Shohat type .
Recently a distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> ( SEMD ) was reported in three members of a Jewish family .
We present a 3.5-year-old Mexican boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> disproportionate short stature <END> , peculiar face , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , small chest , <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal distension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lumbar lordosis <END> , short limbs , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> genua vara <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> .
Roentgenologic findings include short long bones , wide and <START:PHENOTYPE> flared metaphyses <END> with irregularities , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed epiphyseal ossification <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> and morphological changes of vertebral bodies and <START:PHENOTYPE> fibular overgrowth <END> .
The striking resemblance of this patient to those previously reported confirms this form of SEMD as a distinct entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> is supported and the designation SEMD Shohat type is proposed .
The G and BBB syndromes : case presentations , genetics , and nosology .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertelorism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> are described in four unrelated boys ; bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> were also present in two of the boys and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in another .
These features are compatible with both the G and BBB syndromes .
When present , laryngotracheoesophageal anomalies or respiratory and <START:PHENOTYPE> swallowing difficulties <END> are characteristic features of the G syndrome ; otherwise facial features may be useful in distinguishing the G and BBB syndromes .
Cases 1 and 2 had anteverted nares and a broad and <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> , and Case 1 had shortened palpebral fissures , all consistent with the G syndrome .
In contrast , Cases 3 and 4 had a high and <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> as previously described in the BBB syndrome .
The father of Case 1 had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> and first-degree <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , demonstrating <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> in the G syndrome .
The mothers of Cases 2 , 3 , and 4 all had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> and partial male-sex limitation , as previously proposed for both the G and BBB syndromes .
Familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> and neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> .
Effects of mutant gene dosage on phenotype .
Neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> is a rare life-threatening disorder characterized by very high serum calcium concentrations ( > 15 mg/dl ) .
Many cases have occurred in families with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> , a benign condition transmitted as a dominant trait .
Among several hypothesized relationships between the two syndromes is the suggestion that neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> is the homozygous form of familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
To test this hypothesis , we refined the map location of the gene responsible for familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> on chromosome 3q . Analyses in 11 families defined marker loci closely linked to the gene responsible for familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
These loci were then analyzed in four families with parental consanguinity and offspring with neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> .
Each individual who was homozygous for loci that are closely linked to the gene responsible for familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> had neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> .
The calculated odds of linkage between these disorders of > 350 ,000:1 ( lod score = 5.56 ) .
We conclude that dosage of the gene defect accounts for these widely disparate clinical phenotypes ; a single defective allele causes familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> , while two defective alleles causes neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> .
Osteochondrodysplasia with <START:PHENOTYPE> rhizomelia <END> , platyspondyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> callosal agenesis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
A female infant born at term to phenotypically normal nonconsanguinous parents had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> callosal agenesis <END> , and nonlethal rhizomelic osteochondrodysplasia .
Her osteochondrodysplasia was characterized roentgenographically by shortening and metaphyseal broadening of long bones , without bowing , and by platyspondyly , with deficient ossification of dorsal and central portions of vertebral bodies .
By light microscopy , the iliac crest growth plate showed expansion of the zone of chondrocyte hypertrophy and degeneration , with faulty columnar alignment , sparse vascular ingrowth , and irregular mineralization at the zone of chondroosseous transformation .
These findings appear to define a novel osteochondrodysplasia , which in association with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> callosal agenesis <END> may constitute a new syndrome .
Oculo-palatal-cerebral syndrome : a second case .
Oculo-palato-cerebral syndrome is an extremely rare disorder consisting of low birth weight , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , small hands and feet , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> , developmental delay , and cerebral atrophy.
There has been one report of a consanguineous family with three affected children , suggesting <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
We report on the second case of this disorder .
Our patient , a 2-year-old boy , had growth delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous <END> with right <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , long ears with <START:PHENOTYPE> thickened helices <END> , small hands and feet , highly arched palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> , hypoplastic nails , frontal cerebral atrophy and thinning of the corpus callosum on brain magnetic resonance imaging , and mild developmental delay .
He has much milder features than those seen in the previously reported cases .

Association of <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> and sudden death in macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita syndrome .
Macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita ( M-CMTC ) constitutes a distinct entity characterized by prenatal <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> , macrosomia , hemihypertrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , nonobstructive <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , generalized or facial capillary malformation with upper philtral nevus flammeus and <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis marmorata <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> , loose skin , <START:PHENOTYPE> toe syndactyly <END> , and postaxial <START:PHENOTYPE> polydactyly <END> .
All but one of the cases reported previously had benign clinical courses without showing an increased risk of early infant death .
We describe three additional cases with poor clinical outcomes including severe postnatal growth failure , intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrhythmia <END> in two cases , and sudden infant death in two cases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Arrhythmia <END> has not been described previously as one of the symptoms of M-CMCT.
Patients with M-CMTC associated with severe postnatal growth failure and <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> may constitute a distinct clinical subtype of M-CMTC with an increased risk of life-threatening episodes or sudden death .
Recognizing this clinical subtype of M-CMTC is important to prevent these serious potential complications .

<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> skeletal dysplasia with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
A syndrome compatible with an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> trait is described , affecting four male cousins in three sibships .
The body had skeletal anomalies , including <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , ridging of the metopic suture , <START:PHENOTYPE> fusion of cervical vertebrae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thoracic hemivertebrae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , sarcral hypoplasia and <START:PHENOTYPE> short middle phalanges <END> .
In addition , they had moderate developmental retardation , and abducens palsies .
Three of the four had <START:PHENOTYPE> glucose intolerance <END> , and one was born with an <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> .
Of five female obligate carriers studied , three had <START:PHENOTYPE> fusion of cervical vertebrae <END> , three had some shortening of the middle phalanges and three had <START:PHENOTYPE> glucose intolerance <END> .
The syndrome in this family was compared to previously reported syndromes , and the conclusion was reached that it represents a previously unreported <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> syndrome with minor manifestations in carrier females .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertrichosis <END> terminalis , <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> , and a characteristic face : a new distinct entity .
Congenital generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> terminalis has been described in association with other features as <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> , osteochondrodysplasia , and a dysmorphic face .
Bondeson and Miles [ 1993 : Am J Med Genet 47 : 198-212 ] described a woman with universal congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> terminalis associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> ; the face of this patient was coarse and different from other forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> described before .
We present an 11-year , 6-month-old girl with universal congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> terminalis , <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> , and a characteristic <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse face <END> resembling the patient described by Bondeson and Miles [ 1993 : Am J Med Genet 47 : 198-212 ] .
We propose that this type of congenital generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> terminalis , associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse face <END> , is a distinctive new entity .

" Idiopathic " <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> .
Two phenotypical expressions of a common genetic defect .
Among 59 closely related members of one Bedouin tribe , we identified 9 who had the characteristic features of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> ( HHRH ) .
We found "idiopathic " <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> in 21 of the 50 asymptomatic members .
The biochemical abnormalities observed in these 21 subjects were qualitatively similar to those in the 9 with HHRH , but were quantitatively milder .
The urinary calcium concentration was 0.43 +/- 0.14 mg per milligram of creatinine ( mean +/- SD ) in the patients with HHRH , 0.34 +/- 0.07 in the subjects with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> , and 0.14 +/- 0.05 in normal subjects from the same tribe .
Tubular reabsorption of phosphorus and serum phosphorus concentrations were 3. 0 and 4.3 SD units below the age-related mean , respectively , in HHRH , and 1 .1 SD units below the normal mean for both variables in idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
Mean serum levels of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D ( 1 ,25- ( OH)2D) were 303 pg per milliliter in HHRH and 145 pg per milliliter in idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> ( upper normal limit , 110 ) .
We conclude that the subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and the patients with HHRH shared a hereditary renal phosphate leak that led to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , elevated serum concentrations of 1 ,25- ( OH)2D , increased intestinal calcium absorption , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
The magnitude of the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , which regulates 1 ,25- ( OH)2D levels , appears to determine which subjects will have <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> alone and which will also have bone disease .
Variants of DENND1B associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> in children .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> is a complex disease that has genetic and environmental causes .
The genetic factors associated with susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> remain largely unknown .
We carried out a genomewide association study involving children with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
The sample included 793 North American children of European ancestry with persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> who required daily inhaled glucocorticoid therapy and 1988 matched controls ( the discovery set ) .
We also tested for genomewide association in an independent cohort of 917 persons of European ancestry who had <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and 1546 matched controls ( the replication set ) .
Finally , we tested for an association between 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) at chromosome 1q31 and <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> in 1667 North American children of African ancestry who had <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and 2045 ancestrally matched controls .
In our meta-analysis of all samples from persons of European ancestry , we observed an association , with genomewide significance , between <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and SNPs at the previously reported locus on 17q21 and an additional eight SNPs at a novel locus on 1q31 .
The SNP most strongly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> was rs2786098 ( P=8.55x10( -9) ) .
We observed replication of the association of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> with SNP rs2786098 in the independent series of persons of European ancestry ( combined P=9.3x10( -11) ) .
The alternative allele of each of the eight SNPs on chromosome 1q31 was strongly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> in the children of African ancestry ( P=1.6x10( -13 ) for the comparison across all samples ) .
The 1q31 locus contains the 1q31 locus contains DENND1B , a gene expressed by natural killer cells and dendritic cells .
DENND1B protein is predicted to interact with the tumor necrosis factor Î± receptor [corrected ] .
We have identified a locus containing DENND1B on chromosome 1q31 .3 that is associated with susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Renal insufficiency <END> is a component of COACH syndrome .
Two sisters , ages 23 years and 6 years , respectively , were found to have congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , mental retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal liver function <END> .
Magnetic resonance imaging showed <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar vermis hypoplasia <END> in the younger girl and liver biopsy showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> in the older sister .
This combination of findings suggested a diagnosis of COACH syndrome which is characterized by hypoplasia of cerebellar vermis , oligophrenia , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> .
COACH syndrome is a newly recognized condition .
So far , five cases have been reported from three sibships .
We report two additional cases from one sibship and suggest that several other cases may already exist in literature that were not recognized as having COACH syndrome .
The occurrence of multiple cases in single sibships suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
In addition to previously described findings typical of COACH syndrome , the older of our patients showed progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> renal insufficiency <END> with fibrocystic changes on renal biopsy .
Renal function has not been described consistently in previous reports of COACH syndrome but has been abnormal in all cases in which it has been investigated .
We suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> renal insufficiency <END> should be considered a common manifestation of COACH syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Albinism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> with profound developmental delay : Vici syndrome , evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
We report on two sibs and two other unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of corpus callosum <END> , oculocutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> , repeated infections , and cardiomyopathy.
All manifested postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and profound developmental delay .
Additional central nervous system anomalies present in at least one patient included <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> white matter neuronal heterotopia <END> , or bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> schizencephaly <END> .
Repeated viral , bacterial , and fungal infections were consistent with a primary immunodeficiency .
However , immunological studies showed variable , nonspecific findings .
Cardiomyopathy with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> or infection led to death before age 2 years in three of the patients .
This syndrome was first described by Vici et al . [ 1988 : Am . J . Med . Genet . 29:1-8 ] .
The four patients reported herein confirm this unique disorder .
Affected sibs of both sexes born to unaffected parents provide evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , due to steroid sulphatase deficiency , associated with Kallmann syndrome ( hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> ) : linkage relationships with Xg and cloned DNA sequences from the distal short arm of the X chromosome .
We report a large Italian pedigree in which five out of six males are affected by a syndrome , following an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked inheritance <END> pattern , characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , hypogonadotropic hypogonadism , and <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> .
The concurrence of features of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> ( XLI ) with those of Kallmann syndrome , another disease often inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> trait , prompted us to perform biochemical , cytogenetic , and molecular studies in relation to the short arm of the X chromosome ( Xp ) .
Steroid sulphatase ( STS ) activity was found to be completely deficient in all affected members of the family .
Prometaphase chromosome analyses of two obligate heterozygous women and one affected male showed normal karyotypes .
Xg blood group antigen analysis and molecular studies employing cloned DNA sequences from the distal segment of the Xp ( probes RC8 , 782 , dic56 , and M1A ) , did not provide evidence for deletions or rearrangements of the X chromosome .
The linkage analysis showed no crossovers between the disease , Xg , and DXS143 , the locus defined by probe dic56 , thus suggesting the possibility of a linkage between these two markers of the distal segment of Xp and the <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , hypogonadism , and <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> syndrome .
Syndrome complex of <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> predicts germline defects in telomerase .
Mutations in the essential telomerase components hTERT and hTR cause dyskeratosis congenita , a <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> syndrome characterized by mucocutaneous features .
Some ( ~ 3% ) sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> aplastic anemia <END> ( AA ) and idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> cases also carry mutations in hTERT and hTR .
Even though it can affect clinical outcome , because the mutation frequency is rare , genetic testing is not standard .
We examined whether the cooccurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> in the same individual or family enriches for the presence of a telomerase mutation .
Ten consecutive individuals with a total of 36 family members who fulfilled these criteria carried a germline mutant telomerase gene (100% ) .
The mean age of onset for individuals with AA was significantly younger than that for those with <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> ( 14 vs 51 ; P < .0001 ) .
Families displayed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> and there was an evolving pattern of genetic anticipation , with the older generation primarily affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> and successive generations by <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> .
The cooccurrence of AA and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> in a single patient or family is highly predictive for the presence of a germline telomerase defect .
This diagnosis affects the choice of bone marrow transplantation preparative regimen and can prevent morbidity .
Neurovascular compression at the ventrolateral medulla in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> with brachydactyly features severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> that causes stroke usually before the age of 50 years .
We recently characterized the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> as featuring normal renin , aldosterone , and catecholamine responses and mapped the gene responsible to chromosome 12p.
Since angiography in an affected subject had earlier shown tortuous vessels , we performed magnetic resonance tomography ( MRT) angiography to look for possible neurovascular anomalies ( NVA) , which have been previously associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
NVA can be caused by a looping posterior inferior cerebellar or vertebral artery .
Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that NVA may cause <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> by a compression of the ventrolateral medulla .
We performed MRT in 15 hypertensive affected ( aged 14 to 57 years ) and 12 normotensive nonaffected ( aged 12 to 59 years ) family members .
We then tested for linkage between the hypertension-brachydactyly phenotypes and the presence of NVA .
All 15 affected persons had MRT evidence for NVA .
All had left-sided posterior inferior cerebellar artery or vertebral artery loops , while 6 had bilateral NVA . None of the nonaffected family members had NVA .
The phenotypes were linked with an LOD score of 9.2 given a penetrance of 99 % .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly regularly feature NVA , which is frequently bilateral .
The early age at which NVA was identified suggests that the condition is primary .
We suggest that NVA may be involved in the pathogenesis of this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and perhaps essential <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> as well .
Further studies are necessary to address the question of causation .
Mental retardation , distinct facial changes , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> : a new X-linked mental retardation syndrome .
We describe a 3-year-old boy and his 2 maternal uncles with moderate to <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , a low total finger ridge count , and a distinctive face characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> bitemporal narrowness <END> , almond-shaped palperbral fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , short and inverted-V-shaped upper lip , and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> .
Two other males in this family who had similar facial anomalies and developmental delay died in early infancy and midchildhood .
This apparently new disorder is reminiscent of , but distinct from , the Prader-Willi syndrome , and is likely inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> trait .
Preliminary studies with DNA probes are consistent with an X-linked locus and permit exclusion of distal Xp and Xq regions as the site of this mutation .
Marinesco-SjÃ¶gren syndrome in a male with mild dysmorphism .
Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome ( MSS ) is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , cerebellar ataxia caused by cerebellar hypoplasia , mild to moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , neuromuscular <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism <END> , and skeletal anomalies .
The syndrome was recently mapped to chromosome 5q31 , but there is evidence for genetic heterogeneity , and no gene has been identified .
We report a 5-year-old male with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , ataxia , a progressive cerebellar atrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , seizures , hypotonia , and a sensorimotor <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> consistent with many cases of MSS .
He also had mild craniofacial dysmorphism consisting of hypertrichosis and synophrys , deep-set eyes with epicanthic folds , a flat philtrum , a high palate , short thumbs , and a wide sandal gap between the first and second toes .
Skeletal findings included an increased <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphosis <END> .
We reviewed the literature on MSS to determine if craniofacial dysmorphism and the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> would prove to be diagnostically useful in this phenotypically heterogeneous condition .
The majority of cases of MSS do not have craniofacial dysmorphism , but other cases have been reported with features such as ptosis or a myopathic facies that are likely to reflect the underlying myopathic or neuromuscular processes in MSS . (c ) 2005 Wiley-Liss , Inc .
9q34.3 deletion syndrome in three unrelated children .
We described three unrelated children with cryptic 9q34.3 rearrangements and similar clinical manifestations : two with 9q34.3 terminal deletions and the other with an unbalanced translocation involving 9q34.3-qter monosomy and 6p25-pter trisomy .
Common features among the three we studied and the other six patients with 9q34.3 deletions in the literature include <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MR) , hypotonic , and epileptic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Their facial characteristics included <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arched eyebrows <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nostrils <END> , carp mouth , <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding tongue <END> , micrognathia , and pointed chin . Other frequent abnormalities were cardiac abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , and abnormal toes .
These findings are characteristic enough to be a clinically recognizable syndrome .

<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> chondrodysplasia with <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> , distinctive brachydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> .
We describe a family with an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> chondrodysplasia .
Four males and six females were affected through four generations .
Identification of skeletal abnormalities and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> during the pregnancy of three male fetuses led to termination of the pregnancies .
A fourth affected male died at 6 days of life .
The four patients had chondrodysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> , and facial features with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> .
Radiographs showed severe <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> and various bone abnormalities including a distinctive metaphyseal cupping of the metacarpals , metatarsals , and phalanges .
The affected females were less affected and showed <START:PHENOTYPE> small stature <END> , sometimes associated with body asymmetry and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
This condition appears to be a previously unrecognized <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> chondrodysplasia .

Characterisation and genetic mapping of a new X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> syndrome .
Hereditary forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> are classified as syndromic , when <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is associated with other clinical features , or non-syndromic , when <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> occurs without other clinical features .
Many types of syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> have been described , some of which have been mapped to specific chromosomal regions .
Here we describe a family with progressive sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> , facial dysmorphism , and variable other features , transmitted by apparent X linked recessive inheritance .
Haplotype analysis of PCR products spanning the X chromosome and direct sequencing of candidate genes were used to begin characterising the molecular basis of features transmitted in this family .
Comparison to known syndromes involving <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , facial dysmorphism , and other clinical features was performed by review of published reports and personal discussions .
Genetic mapping places the candidate locus for this syndrome within a 48 cM region on Xq1-21 .
Candidate genes including COL4A5 , DIAPH , and POU3F4 were excluded by clinical and molecular analyses .
The constellation of clinical findings in this family (deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> , facial dysmorphism , variable renal and genitourinary abnormalities , and late onset pancytopenia) , along with a shared haplotype on Xq1-21 , suggests that this represents a new form of syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
We discuss our findings in comparison to several other syndromic and non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> loci that have been mapped to the X chromosome .
Autosomal-recessive syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , hypogonadism , progressive extra-pyramidal disorder , white matter disease , sensory neural <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , and low IGF1 .
We explored the manifestations of an autosomal-recessive multisystemic disorder in several Saudi families .
Recognized causes of progressive extra-pyramidal disorder and white matter disease were excluded and the neurological , imaging , endocrine , and skin manifestations of this syndrome described .
The onset of these symptoms in these patients began in early adolescence and progressed more rapidly in males .
All affected patients had total or partial <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , clinical and chemical evidence of hypogonadism ( low levels of estradiol and testosterone ) ; females had clear evidence of hypogonadism ( streak or absent ovaries) , and some patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
The constant biochemical abnormality was the low IGF-1 .
The neurological manifestations included moderate to severe intellectual decline and abnormality of muscle tone and posture with choreo-athetoid and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonic movements <END> resulting in gait difficulty , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , difficulty swallowing , and scoliosis .
The MRI of brain demonstrated white matter involving cerebellum , brain stem , and cerebral structures , as well as abnormal decreased signal intensity in the basal ganglia with involvement of the substantia nigra .
We conclude that the association of hypogonadism , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , and persistent low IGF-1 is a significant <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome ; it is prevalent in Saudi Arabia .
We also demonstrate that the progressive extra-pyramidal disorder , white matter disease , and abnormal signals of the basal ganglia are common features of this syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Sensorineural deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> were recognized features .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> in people with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> is a well-recognized psychiatric disorder of childhood .
Its cause is unknown , but there is evidence of a familial predisposition .
Symptoms suggestive of this disorder have been reported in subjects with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> , a disease caused by mutations in the thyroid receptor-beta gene and characterized by reduced responsiveness of peripheral and pituitary tissues to the actions of thyroid hormone .
We systematically evaluated the presence and severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> in 18 families with a history of generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> .
We studied 49 affected and 55 unaffected family members ; 52 were adults , and 52 were children .
All subjects were evaluated with structured psychiatric questionnaires by interviewers who were unaware of the medical diagnosis .
The number of symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> was calculated for each subject .
Among the adults , 11 of 22 subjects with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> (5 0 percent ) and 2 of 30 unaffected subjects ( 7 percent ) had met the criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> as children ( P < 0.001 ) .
Among the children , 19 of 27 subjects resistant to thyroid hormone (7 0 percent ) and 5 of 25 unaffected subjects (2 0 percent ) met the criteria for the disorder ( P < 0.001 ) .
The odds of having <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> were 3.2 times higher for affected male subjects than for affected female subjects and were 2.7 times higher for unaffected male subjects than for unaffected female subjects .
The mean symptom score was 2.5 times higher in the affected group than in the unaffected group ( 7. 0 vs . 2.8 , P < 0.001 ) .
The frequency of other psychiatric diagnoses was similar in the two groups .
In our study sample , <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> is strongly associated with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> .
Connexin 26 mutations in hereditary non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> is the most prevalent inherited sensory disorder , affecting about 1 in 1,000 children .
Most <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> results from peripheral auditory defects that occur as a consequence of either conductive ( outer or middle ear ) or sensorineuronal ( cochlea ) abnormalities .
Although a number of mutant genes have been identified that are responsible for syndromic ( multiple phenotypic disease ) <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> such as Waardenburg syndrome and Usher 1B syndrome , little is known about the genetic basis of non-syndromic (single phenotypic disease ) <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
Here we study a pedigree containing cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and have identified a mutation in the gene encoding the gap-junction protein connexin 26 ( Cx26 ) that segregates with the profound <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> in the family .
Cx26 mutations resulting in premature stop codons were also found in three <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> non-syndromic sensorineuronal <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> pedigrees , genetically linked to chromosome 13q11 -12 ( DFNB1) , where the Cx26 gene is localized .
Immunohistochemical staining of human cochlear cells for Cx26 demonstrated high levels of expression .
To our knowledge , this is the first non-syndromic sensorineural autosomal <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> susceptibility gene to be identified , which implicates Cx26 as an important component of the human cochlea .
A clinical and molecular genetic study of 112 Iranian families with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( MCPH ) is a genetically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> disorder showing an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance .
Affected individuals present with head circumferences more than three SDs below the age - and sex-matched population mean , associated with mild to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Five genes ( MCPH1 , CDK5RAP2 , ASPM , CENPJ , STIL ) and two genomic loci , MCPH2 and MCPH4 , have been identified so far .
In this study , we investigated all seven MCPH loci in patients with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> from 112 Consanguineous Iranian families .
In addition to a thorough clinical characterisation , karyotype analyses were performed for all patients .
For Homozygosity mapping , microsatellite markers were selected for each locus and used for genotyping .
Our investigation enabled us to detect homozygosity at MCPH1 ( Microcephalin ) in eight families , at MCPH5 ( ASPM ) in thirtheen families .
Three families showed homozygosity at MCPH2 and five at MCPH6 ( CENPJ) , and two families were linked to MCPH7 ( STIL ) .
The remaining 81 families were not linked to any of the seven known loci .
Subsequent sequencing revealed eight , 10 and one novel mutations in Microcephalin , ASPM and CENPJ , respectively .
In some families , additional features such as <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hearing loss <END> were observed in the microcephalic patient , which widens the spectrum of clinical manifestations of mutations in known <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> genes .
Our results show that the molecular basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> is <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> ; thus , the Iranian population may provide a unique source for the identification of further genes underlying this disorder .
A new X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small testes <END> , muscle wasting , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> localises to Xq24-q25 .
A large family is described in which <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> segregates as an X linked trait .
Six affected males in three generations were studied by linkage and clinical examination .
Characteristic clinical features include <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent lower lip <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small testes <END> , muscle wasting of the lower legs , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hyperextensibility <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal gait <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , and decreased fine motor coordination .
Affected subjects also had impaired speech and decreased attention span .
A carrier female was mildly affected .
A similar disorder was not found on review of our XLMR Database of 124 syndromes .
Linkage analysis of 37 markers resulted in a lod score of 2.8 0 at DXS1212 and 2.76 at DXS425 .
The limiting markers were DXS424 and DXS1047 .
Ten of 124 XLMR syndromes and eight of 58 MRX families overlap this region .
In summary , this family appears to have a new XLMR syndrome localising to Xq24-q25 .
SCA-12 : Tremor with cerebellar and <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical atrophy <END> is associated with a CAG repeat expansion .
To characterize the clinical and neuroradiologic features of a new spinocerebellar ataxia , SCA-12 , in the index family .
The authors recently linked SCA-12 to a novel CAG repeat expansion on chromosome 5q31-33 that is located within the 5 ' region of PPP2R2B , a gene encoding a brain-specific regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. Neurologic features of the proband and nine symptomatic relatives in the first SCA-12 family were compiled and , in some individuals , related to changes found on brain MRI or CT. SCA-12 typically presented in the 4th decade of life with <START:PHENOTYPE> action tremor <END> of the head or arms ( present in 10/1 0 of the affected individuals ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperreflexia <END> ( 8 /10 ) was a common feature , and cerebellar signs ( 8 /10 ) , including ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysmetria <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , developed gradually but were less prominent and disabling than cerebellar dysfunction in other SCA . Subtle parkinsonian features ( 9/10 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ( 2/10 ) were observed in later stages of SCA-12 , and psychiatric symptoms , including <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> delusions <END> , were present in some affected family members ( 4/10 ) .
Two individuals studied had nondisabling neurologic signs neonatally , including nystagmus and lower extremity dystonia .
Brain images of affected individuals revealed cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.
SCA-12 is a slowly progressive , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> , neurodegenerative disorder that differs from other SCA in that it typically presents with <START:PHENOTYPE> action tremor <END> in patients in their mid 30s and usually includes <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> and subtle parkinsonian signs .
Cerebellar dysfunction , including gait ataxia , is relatively nondisabling , and cognitive or psychiatric disorders may occur .
Neuroradiologic studies reveal atrophy of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> rigid spine <END> syndrome : a clinical , pathological , radiological , and genetic study .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Rigid spine <END> syndrome is a term first proposed by Dubowitz to describe a subset of patients affected by myopathy with early spinal <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures <END> as a prominent feature .
While <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal rigidity <END> is a nonspecific feature , found in Emery-Dreifuss <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> and in some congenital myopathies , it is also a prominent feature in a group of patients with merosin-positive congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> , where it is generally associated with stable or only slowly progressive weakness and early respiratory insufficiency .
Recently , the first locus for congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> in association with <START:PHENOTYPE> rigid spine <END> syndrome was mapped to chromosome 1p35-p36 in consanguineous Moroccan , Turkish , and Iranian families .
We present here a detailed phenotypic description of the familial syndrome linked to this locus , describing 4 siblings ( 3 boys and 1 girl ) of Northern European-American heritage who are the offspring of a nonconsanguineous marriage .
All 4 siblings were affected by hypotonia and prominent neck weakness in infancy , early <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal rigidity <END> , and early <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
After initial improvement , muscle strength stabilizes or slowly declines , and skeletal deformities and respiratory insufficiency supervene .
Muscle biopsy in an affected child at age 9 months revealed minimal , nonspecific myopathic changes , leading to a diagnosis of "minimal change myopathy. "
Muscle biopsy in his sibling , at the age of 14 years , revealed chronic and severe myopathic (dystrophic ) changes , with normal staining for laminin-2 and for proteins of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex .
A possible explanation for these biopsy findings is that magnetic resonance imaging of the thighs reveals stereotyped selective muscle involvement , with the selectivity more pronounced early in the disease course followed by widespread muscular signal abnormalities in the late stages of the disease .
In this family , linkage to the chromosome 1p <START:PHENOTYPE> rigid spine <END> syndrome locus ( RSMD1 ) is supported by maximum LOD scores for several markers of 1.81 at theta = 0 , representing the maximum statistical power possible for this family .
In combination with the previous report , this syndrome is linked to the RSMD1 locus with a summated maximum LOD score of 6.29 , and analysis of recombination events in our family narrows the previously reported RSMD1 locus to 3 centiMorgans .
Mutations in the gene for the granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor receptor in patients with acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> preceded by severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
In severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> the maturation of myeloid progenitor cells is arrested .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> myelodysplastic syndrome <END> and acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> develop in some patients with severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Abnormalities in the signal-transduction pathways for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) may play a part in the progression to acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> .
We isolated genomic DNA and RNA from hematopoietic cells obtained from two patients with acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> and histories of severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
The nucleotide sequences encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the G-CSF receptor were amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced .
Murine myeloid 32D.C1 0 cells were transfected with complementary DNA encoding the wild-type or mutant G-CSF receptors and tested for their responses to G-CSF . Point mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor were identified in both patients .
The mutations , a substitution of thymine for cytosine at the codon for glutamine at position 718 ( Gln718 ) in one patient and at the codon for glutamine at position 731( Gln731 ) in the other , caused a truncation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of the receptor .
Both mutant and wild-type genes for the G-CSF receptor were present in leukemic cells from the two patients .
In one patient , the mutation was also found in the neutropenic stage , before the progression to acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> .
The 32D.C1 0 cells expressing mutant receptors had abnormally high proliferative responses but failed to mature when cultured in G-CSF .
The mutant G-CSF receptors also interfered with terminal maturation mediated by the wild-type G-CSF receptor in the 32D.C1 0 cells that coexpressed the wild-type and mutant receptors .
Mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor that interrupt signals required for the maturation of myeloid cells are involved in the pathogenesis of severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> and associated with the progression to acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> .
Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome : a novel marker of kidney <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> .
Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome ( BHD ) is a dominantly inherited predisposition for development of fibrofolliculomas , trichodiscomas , and acrochordons .
Concurrent internal tumors , such as colonic polyps and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal carcinoma <END> , have been described in patients with BHD . To evaluate kindreds with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> for cutaneous manifestations of BHD .
One hundred fifty-two patients from 49 families underwent complete oral and skin examination .
Skin lesions were identified by their clinical appearance , and the diagnosis was confirmed by results of histologic examination .
Individuals underwent screening for familial renal neoplasms .
A tertiary referral research hospital .
Individuals with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> and their asymptomatic at-risk relatives .
We determined whether any form of renal <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> is associated BHD .
We identified 3 extended kindreds in whom renal neoplasms and BHD appeared to segregate together .
Two kindreds had renal oncocytomas and a third had a variant of papillary <START:PHENOTYPE> renal cell carcinoma <END> .
Thirteen patients exhibited BHD . Seven individuals , including a set of identical twins , had renal neoplasms and BHD .
An additional 4 patients ( 3 deceased and not examined ) in these families had renal neoplasms but not BHD . Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome without renal neoplasms was present in 6 individuals .
Thirteen patients with fibrofolliculomas and trichodiscomas presented clinically with multiple smooth skin-colored to grayish-white papules located on the face , auricles , neck , and upper trunk .
Oral papules were present in 9 of 28 and achrochordons in 11 of 28 patients .
Features of BHD not previously appreciated included deforming <START:PHENOTYPE> lipomas <END> in 5 , collagenomas in 4 , and pulmonary cysts in 4 of 28 patients .
Families with BHD did not display germline mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau gene or in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET proto-oncogene .
Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome may be associated with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> .
Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> segregate together in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion .
Patients with BHD and their relatives are at risk for development of <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> .
Therefore , patients with BHD and their relatives should undergo abdominal computed tomography and renal ultrasound screening for <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> .
New phenotype of the cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy mapped to chromosome 19 : <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> as the prominent clinical feature .
A survey was carried out on a large family presenting the symptoms of familial arteriopathy ( CADASIL ) recently mapped to chromosome 19 . This is characterised clinically by <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent subcortical infarcts <END> developing into <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudobulbar palsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> subcortical dementia <END> , and radiologically by early MRI abnormalities . To characterise this familial condition , 43 members older than 20 years and spreading over four generations were studied clinically ( 31 living , 12 deceased ) , genetically , and radiologically by MRI ( n = 31 ) . Twenty out of 43 were found to be clinically symptomatic and of these 13 out of 31 had MRI abnormalities .
Genetic studies mapped this condition to the locus of CADASIL ( lod score > 3 ) .
The natural history suggests a chronological clinicoradiological staging of this phenotype of CADASIL : stage I between 20 and 40 years with frequent migraine-like episodes and well delineated lesions of the white matter ; stage II between 40 and 60 years with stroke-like episodes , bipolar or monopolar-like psychotic disorders , coalescent lesions of the white matter , and well delineated lesions of the basal ganglia ; and stage III over 60 years with <START:PHENOTYPE> subcortical dementia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudobulbar palsy <END> , diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> , and multiple well delineated lesions of the basal ganglia .
This phenotype differs from the other two previously described by high frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , frequency of psychotic disorders , and early neurological manifestations .
The new acronym " cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts , <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> " ( CADASILM ) is proposed to better describe this particular subvariety of CADASIL .
Alport syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse leiomyomatosis <END> .
Alport syndrome ( AS ) is a hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> progressing to <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal failure <END> ( ESRF) , sensorineural deafness , and specific eye signs ( lenticonus , macular flecks , and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> ) .
Inheritance is <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> in about 85 % of the cases , caused by different mutations in the COL4A5 gene .
Rarely AS is seen in combination with <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse leiomyomatosis <END> ( DL ) .
DL is a tumorous process involving smooth muscle cells , mostly of the esophagus , but also of the tracheobronchial tree and the female genital tract .
Characteristically , the patients have deletions of the 5 ' -end of both the COL4A5 and the COL4A6 genes , respectively .
We here present a 9-year-old boy who was admitted because of a newly diagnosed sensorineural deafness .
He was born with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> and presented symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> and bronchial irritation in the first year of life .
Macroscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> was first noticed at 2 years during a febrile infection .
Since early childhood the boy suffered from severe <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> .
Taking together these symptoms , the diagnosis of Alport syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse leiomyomatosis <END> ( AS-DL ) has to be considered .
Genetic analysis demonstrated the predicted deletion of the COL4A5 / COL4A6 genes .

We report on 4 boys ( 3 in one family ) who have a remarkably constant syndrome of childhood-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> with later <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal microcephaly <END> , growth and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> external ophthalmoplegia <END> and varying degrees of <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
The pedigrees are consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked inheritance <END> .
The syndrome is compared and contrasted with others comprising basal ganglion dysfunction in childhood .
It is concluded that clinically and genetically the condition is unique .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephromegaly <END> in infancy and early childhood : a risk factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome .
Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome ( BWS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> syndrome associated with macrosomia , <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macroglossia <END> , visceromegaly and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> ( WT) .
We conducted a case-control study in children with BWS to examine whether <START:PHENOTYPE> nephromegaly <END> increases the risk of WT.
The BWS Registry was used to identify control and case patients .
Control patients were defined as children with BWS who were older than 6 years and had no imaging evidence of renal disease or previous WT and for whom complete records were available ; 31 patients met these criteria .
Case patients were defined as children with BWS who had WT and screening renal imaging before the diagnosis of WT; 12 of these patients had serial screening images before diagnosis of WT and comprised the study population .
Only renal images obtained before the diagnosis of WT was made were used to assess renal length .
All 12 patients with WT had <START:PHENOTYPE> nephromegaly <END> ( > or =95th percentile of age adjusted renal length ) on serial screening studies .
Only four of 31 control patients ( specificity = 86% ) had <START:PHENOTYPE> nephromegaly <END> resulting in an odds ratio of 72 ( 95 % confidence interval = 13-391 ) for the risk of WT with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephromegaly <END> .
In patients with BWS , persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> nephromegaly <END> is a strong risk factor for the development of WT. If screening for WT is done in this population , infants with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephromegaly <END> should be considered those at greatest risk for WT, and screening may be best targeted at this group .
DOOR syndrome : clinical report , literature review and discussion of natural history .
DOOR syndrome (deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> , osteodystrophy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ) is a rarely described disorder with less than 35 reports in the literature .
The hallmarks of the syndrome , represented in the DOOR acronym , include sensorineural hearing loss , hypoplastic or <START:PHENOTYPE> absent nails <END> on the hands and feet , small or absent distal phalanges of the hands and feet , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The purpose of our communication is to report on an additional patient with DOOR syndrome , delineate common as well as less frequent manifestations of DOOR syndrome , bring attention to the under appreciated facial features in DOOR syndrome , document the natural history of this disorder , and propose a suggested workup of those suspected of DOOR syndrome .
DOOR syndrome is associated with characteristic , <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse facial features <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> large nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> wide nasal bridge <END> , bulbous tip and <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , a long prominent philtrum and <START:PHENOTYPE> downturned corners of the mouth <END> .
The natural history is one of a deteriorative course , with progressive neurological manifestations including <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> from infancy , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and a peripheral polyneuropathy.
The majority of patients with DOOR syndrome have elevated levels of 2-oxoglutarate in the urine and plasma .
In this report , we present a newborn with manifestations consistent with DOOR syndrome and a progressive clinical course .
A comprehensive literature review reveals 32 patients with DOOR syndrome .
In conclusion , DOOR syndrome is a neurometabolic disorder with recognizable facial features and a progressive natural history .

IMAGe , a new clinical association of <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> adrenal hypoplasia <END> congenita , and genital anomalies .
We report three boys with <START:PHENOTYPE> adrenal hypoplasia <END> congenita ( AHC ) and additional findings that represent a new syndrome , IMAGe : <START:PHENOTYPE> Intrauterine growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Metaphyseal dysplasia <END> , AHC , and Genital anomalies .
Each presented shortly after birth with growth retardation and severe adrenal insufficiency .
Each of the three patients had mild dysmorphic features , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> small penis <END> , and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism .
Skeletal surveys revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal dysplasia <END> in all three and <START:PHENOTYPE> epiphyseal dysplasia <END> in two .
The patients had documented or suspected <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> , resulting in nephrocalcinosis in one and in prenatal liver and spleen calcifications in another .
AHC presents most often either as an isolated abnormality , caused by mutations in the DAX1 gene , or as part of an Xp21 contiguous gene syndrome , caused by a deletion of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy , glycerol kinase , and DAX1 genes .
All three patients with the IMAGe association had normal creatine kinase levels and no evidence of glycerol kinase deficiency .
Sequence analysis of DNA from these patients revealed no mutation in the DAX1- or steroidogenic factor-1-coding sequences , nor was a deletion of DAX1 detected .
Identification of the molecular basis of the IMAGe association will give new insight into the pathogenesis of this syndromic relationship involving bone , adrenal cortical , and pituitary development .
Neuroacanthocytosis .
A clinical , haematological and pathological study of 19 cases .
Nineteen cases are described , including 12 cases from three different families and 7 nonfamilial cases , in which multisystem neurological disease was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> in peripheral blood and normal plasma lipoproteins .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> can easily be overlooked , and scanning electron microscopy may be helpful .
Some neurologically asymptomatic relatives with significant <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> were identified during family screening , including some who were clinically affected .
The mean age of onset was 32 ( range 8-62 ) yrs and the clinical course was usually progressive but there was marked phenotypic variation .
Cognitive impairment , psychiatric features and organic <START:PHENOTYPE> personality change <END> occurred in over half the cases , and more than one-third had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Orofaciolingual involuntary movements and pseudobulbar disturbance commonly caused <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> that was sometimes severe , but biting of the lips or tongue was rarely seen .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Chorea <END> was seen in almost all symptomatic cases but <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tics <END> , involuntary vocalizations and akinetic-rigid features also occurred .
Two cases had no movement disorder at all . Computerized tomography often demonstrated cerebral atrophy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Caudate atrophy <END> was seen less commonly , and nonspecific focal and symmetric signal abnormalities from the caudate or lentiform nuclei were seen by magnetic resonance imaging in 3 out of 4 cases .
Depression or absence of tendon reflexes was noted in 13 cases and neurophysiological abnormalities often indicated an axonal neuropathy.
Sural nerve biopsies from 3 cases showed evidence of a chronic axonal <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> with prominent regenerative activity , predominantly affecting the large diameter myelinated fibres .
Serum creatine kinase activity was increased in 11 cases but without clinical evidence of a myopathy.
Postmortem neuropathological examination in 1 case revealed extensive neuronal loss and gliosis affecting the corpus striatum , pallidum , and the substantia nigra , especially the pars reticulata .
The cerebral cortex appeared spared and the spinal cord showed no evidence of anterior horn cell loss .
Two examples of the McLeod phenotype , an X-linked abnormality of expression of Kell blood group antigens , were identified in a single family and included 1 female .
The genetics of neuroacanthocytosis are unclear and probably heterogeneous , but the available pedigree data and the association with the McLeod phenotype suggest that there may be a locus for this disorder on the short arm of the X chromosome .
Warburg Micro syndrome in a Turkish boy .
We report a 4-year-old Turkish boy with Warburg Micro syndrome born to consanguineous parents .
He had <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deep-set eyes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , prominent ears and nasal root , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , hypertrichosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic diplegia <END> , skin hyperextensibility and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogenitalism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral atrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of corpus callosum <END> and cerebellum .
Sequence analysis of exon 8 of the RAB3GAP gene has confirmed the presence of a splice donor mutation ( 748 +1G>A ) in the homozygous state .
Skin hyperextensibility and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> in the affected child have not been reported in Warburg Micro syndrome cases to date .
This report compares the symptoms and features of the case with previously reported cases of Warburg Micro syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> : a distinctive clinical syndrome .
We report on two patients who have a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and recurrent cerebral insults that resemble strokes ( MELAS ) .
These two and nine other reported patients share the following features : ragged red fibers evident on muscle biopsy , normal early development , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , seizures , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiparesis <END> , hemianopia , or <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical blindness <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lactic acidemia <END> is a common finding .
We believe that MELAS represents a distinctive syndrome and that it can be differentiated from two other clinical disorders that also are associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> and cerebral disease : Kearns-Say re syndrome and the myoclonus epilepsy ragged red fiber syndrome .
Existing information suggests that MELAS is transmitted by maternal inheritance .
The ragged red fibers suggest an abnormality of the electron transport system , but the precise biochemical disorders in these three clinical syndromes remain to be elucidated .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizure <END> frequency in adults with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> is a characteristic feature of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome ( WHS ) with onset usually in the first 2 years of life .
There have been several reports of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ceasing as children get older .
We have inspected a register of WHS cases from the UK and identified 27 adults with the condition ; their mean age was 24.8 years ( range 17-40 years ) .
We conducted a telephone survey and asked parents to comment on their experience of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in WHS .
In 18 patients ( 66% ) a <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> had not occurred within 3 years .
The mean age of those who have been <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> free for over 3 years was 23.7 years ( range 17-33 years ) whereas for those who had a recent <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> their mean age was 27. 1 years ( range 17-40 years ) .
The mean age of the last <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> for those who were <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> free for 3 years was 11 .3 years ( range 2-28 years ) ; in the majority of patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ceased within childhood years .
Many parents commented that <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were precipitated by fever .
Individuals with WHS who had a deletion were more likely to be <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> free than those with a translocation .
This reached statistical significance : chi(2 ) = 4.6 , P = 0.03 , odds ratio = 6.5 ( 95 % CI 1 .1-38 .6 ) .
Data from this survey may be helpful when counseling families with a very young child with WHS .

Autosomal recessively inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> .
A new form of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> affecting females as severely as males .
A new form of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> , autosomal recessively inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> ( AROA) , was studied in seven females and two males from five unrelated Caucasian kindreds .
Affected patients have the <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired vision <END> , translucent irides , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , albinotic fundi with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of the fovea <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> that are also found in X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> ( XOA ) .
Unlike XOA , however , this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait , with females affected as severely as males .
Obligate heterozygotes of AROA lack the ocular abnormalities that are present in females heterozygous for XOA .
Also , skin and hairbulb biopsy specimens do not reveal any abnormalities in patients with AROA , whereas giant pigment granules are found in patients heterozygous and hemizygous for XOA .
The recognition of this disorder is imperative for proper diagnosis and responsible genetic counseling .
Neuroserpin mutation S52R causes neuroserpin accumulation in neurons and is associated with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Mutations in the Neuroserpin gene have been reported to cause familial presenile <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
We describe a new family in which the S52R Neuroserpin mutation is associated with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in 2 siblings .
The proband presented <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> at age 24 , his brother and mother presented a similar disorder when they were 25 .
A clinical diagnosis of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> was made on the proband and his brother .
Skin and liver biopsies did not reveal the presence of cytological alterations in the proband .
His neurological status worsened over the subsequent 19 yr during which he became demented and had uncontrollable <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
He died at 43 yr of age from aspiration pneumonia .
Neuropathologically , eosinophilic bodies , which were positive for periodic acid-Schiff and immunoreactive with antibodies against human neuroserpin , were present in the perikarya and cell processes of the neurons .
They were found in large numbers in the cerebral cortex and substantia nigra and to a lesser extent , in most subcortical gray areas , spinal cord , and dorsal root ganglia .
By electron microscopy , the intracytoplasmic bodies were contained within the membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum .
Occasionally neuroserpin immunopositivity was seen throughout the cytoplasm , even without the presence of well-defined bodies .
Our study characterizes for the first time the neuropathologic phenotype associated with hereditary progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> caused by the S52R Neuroserpin mutation .
Cohen syndrome resulting from a novel large intragenic COH1 deletion segregating in an isolated Greek island population .
Cohen syndrome , caused by mutations in the COH1 gene , is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , growth delay , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal dystrophy <END> , facial anomalies , slender limbs with <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow hands <END> and feet , <START:PHENOTYPE> tapered fingers <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphosis <END> and/or scoliosis , pectus carinatum , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> , pes calcaneovalgus , and , variably , truncal <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .
Here , we describe the clinical and molecular findings in 14 patients from an isolated Greek island population .
The clinical phenotype was fairly homogeneous , although <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> was not constant , and some patients had severe visual disability .
All patients were homozygous for a novel intragenic COH1 deletion spanning exon 6 to exon 16 , suggesting a founder effect .
The discovery of this mutation has made carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis possible in this population .

Diagnostic value of ophthalmologic findings in myotonic dystrophy : comparison with risks calculated by haplotype analysis of closely linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms .
To determine diagnostic value of <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> in myotonic dystrophy ( DM) , we examined 98 at-risk members of 9 DM kindreds .
Haplotype analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLPs ) using ApoC2 , CKMM , and pEFD4.2 supported the diagnosis of DM in 33 and excluded the diagnosis in 51 members .
The sensitivities of bilateral iridescent <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> , posterior cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> , orbicularis oculi weakness , low intraocular pressure , ptosis , and ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> were 46 .7 , 5 0.0 , 60.6 , 59 .3 , 51 .5 , and 3.0% , while their specificities were 10 0.0 , 10 0.0 , 98.0 , 94 .1 , 96 .1 , and 10 0.0% , respectively .
A peripheral pigmentary degeneration and central macular lesions of retina were not found on indirect fundoscopy .
In 86.2% of DM patients , bilateral iridescent <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> , posterior cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> , or both were present .
Unilateral iridescent <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> occurred in only 3 of our DM patients , and 2 of non-DM relatives showed a few unilateral iridescent particles .
Posterior cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> in DM patients always affected both eyes in this series .
We conclude that 1 ) bilateral iridescent <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> and posterior cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> are highly specific for DM and useful for establishing clinical diagnosis of DM , 2 ) unilateral iridescent <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> are infrequent in DM and are seen in some non-DM members , and 3 ) ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> and clinical retinopathies are rare in DM .
Oculopharyngodistal myopathy is a distinct entity : clinical and genetic features of 47 patients .
Oculopharyngodistal myopathy ( OPDM ) has been reported as a rare , adult-onset hereditary muscle disease with putative <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Patients with OPDM present with progressive ocular , pharyngeal , and distal limb muscle involvement .
The genetic defect causing OPDM has not been elucidated .
Clinical and genetic findings of 47 patients from 9 unrelated Turkish families diagnosed with OPDM at the Department of Neurology , Istanbul Faculty of Medicine , between 1982 and 2009 were evaluated .
The mean age at onset was around 22 years .
Both <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> traits were observed , without any clear difference in clinical phenotype or severity .
The most common initial symptom was <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , followed by oropharyngeal symptoms and distal weakness , which started after the fifth disease year .
Intrafamilial variability of disease phenotype and severity was notable in the largest <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> family .
Atypical presentations , such as absence of limb weakness in long-term follow-up in 9 , proximal predominant weakness in 4 , and asymmetric <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> in 3 patients , were observed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Swallowing difficulty <END> was due to oropharyngeal <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> with myopathic origin .
Serum creatine kinase levels were slightly increased and EMG revealed myopathic pattern with occasional myotonic discharges .
Myopathologic findings included rimmed and autophagic vacuoles and chronic myopathic changes .
Importantly , a considerable proportion of patients developed <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory muscle weakness <END> while still ambulant .
Linkage to the genetic loci for all known muscular dystrophies , and for distal and myofibrillar myopathies , was excluded in the largest <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> OPDM families .
We suggest that OPDM is a clinically and genetically distinct myopathy.
Salmeterol for the prevention of high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> .
Pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> results from a persistent imbalance between forces that drive water into the air space and the physiologic mechanisms that remove it .
Among the latter , the absorption of liquid driven by active alveolar transepithelial sodium transport has an important role ; a defect of this mechanism may predispose patients to pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> .
Beta-adrenergic agonists up-regulate the clearance of alveolar fluid and attenuate pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> in animal models .
In a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled study , we assessed the effects of prophylactic inhalation of the beta-adrenergic agonist salmeterol on the incidence of pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> during exposure to high altitudes ( 455 9 m , reached in less than 22 hours ) in 37 subjects who were susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> .
We also measured the nasal transepithelial potential difference , a marker of the transepithelial sodium and water transport in the distal airways , in 33 mountaineers who were prone to high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> and 33 mountaineers who were resistant to this condition .
Prophylactic inhalation of salmeterol decreased the incidence of high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> in susceptible subjects by more than 50 percent , from 74 percent with placebo to 33 percent ( P= 0.02 ) .
The nasal potential-difference value under low-altitude conditions was more than 30 percent lower in the subjects who were susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> than in those who were not susceptible ( P< 0.001 ) .
Prophylactic inhalation of a beta-adrenergic agonist reduces the risk of high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> .
Sodium-dependent absorption of liquid from the airways may be defective in patients who are susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> .
These findings support the concept that sodium-driven clearance of alveolar fluid may have a pathogenic role in pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> in humans and therefore represent an appropriate target for therapy .
Homozygosity mapping of spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> and peripheral neuropathy to 9q33-34 , and with <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> and optic atrophy to 6p21-23.
With the availability of a simple molecular test that distinguishes Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , the most frequent form of inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , from other recessive ataxias , it now becomes possible to unravel the genetic heterogeneity of the latter .
We have now localised two genes causing <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> in two consanguineous families .
In the first family , the four affected Japanese sibs had spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> associated with elevated levels of serum creatine kinase , gamma-globulin , and alpha-foetoprotein .
Homozygosity over a 20 cM region allowed to demonstrate linkage at 9q33.3-34.3 with a lod score of 3.0 . Genotyping two unrelated Japanese patients from first degree consanguineous parents revealed that one was homozygous for the same region but did not share the biochemical features .
In the second family , an Israeli uncle and a niece were affected by an early-onset recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and subsequently developed <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> and optic atrophy.
Homozygosity over a 17 cM region allowed demonstration of linkage at 6p21-23 with a lod score of 3.25 . These two localisations of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> genes represent a first step toward the identification of genetically homogenous , non-Friedreich , ataxic patients and subsequent cloning of the genes .
Glomerular basement membrane attenuation in familial nephritis and " benign " <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Lamination of the basement membrane has been considered to be the lesion characteristic of familial nephritis and attenuation to be the lesion of " Benign " familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Electron micrographs were reviewed of 57 children who had renal biopsies for persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Attenuation or lamination of the glomerular capillary basement membrane was found in each .
Twenty of the 57 children had familial nephritis ; 20 had familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> ; and 17 had no involved relatives .
Follow-up data were available for 14 of 20 children with familial nephritis , 12 of 20 with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , and 12 of 17 with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> for 13.6 +/- 6.3 , 6.7 +/- 4.6 , and 7. 0 +/- 4.8 years , respectively , after discovery of <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Five children developed end-stage renal disease : three with familial nephritis , one with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , and one with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Only two no longer had <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Attenuation of the glomerular capillary basement membrane was seen in every biopsy , whereas lamination was not .
Because <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> and ultrastructural abnormalities were findings shared by all the children , we suggest the possibility that familial nephritis , and familial or sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> as defined in this study , may be variations in a spectrum of inherited abnormality or abnormalities in the formation of the glomerular capillary basement membrane .
Familial renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> : a genetic reappraisal of hexose transport by kidney and intestine .
Renal glucose titration studies were carried out in 10 members of two pedigrees with familial renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> to test the accepted hypothesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> and to investigate the genetic significance of " type A " and " type B " renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> .
In one family , a brother and sister each had a moderately reduced threshold and tubular maximum for glucose ( type A) , but both of their parents reabsorbed glucose normally .
In the second family , two brothers had severe type A renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> , their mother and one brother had a mild type A defect , and another brother demonstrated a reduced threshold , an exaggerated splay , and a normal tubular maximum , indicative of type B glycosuria.Hexose transport by intestinal mucosa was also investigated in controls and in the three brothers with the most severe renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> .
D-glucose-(14 ) C and 3-O-methylglucose-(14 ) C were accumulated by jejunal mucosa from controls by processes which were saturable and concentrative .
No differences in hexose transport were observed in the patients with renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> .
We conclude that familial renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> can be inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait ; that mild and severe type A renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> and type B renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> can occur in the same pedigree ; and that defective reabsorption of glucose by the kidney need not be accompanied by abnormalities in intestinal glucose transport .
These findings indicate that glucose transport in the gut and kidney are not mediated by identical mechanisms , and that several different mutations are responsible for the phenotypic variability in familial renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> .
The clinical picture of the BÃ¶rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome in males and heterozygous females with PHF6 mutations .
The usual description of the BÃ¶rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome ( BFLS ) is that of a rare , X-linked , partially dominant condition with severe intellectual disability , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse facial features <END> , long ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tapering fingers <END> , and shortened toes .
Recently , mutations have been identified in the PHF6 gene in nine families with this syndrome .
The clinical history and physical findings in the affected males reveal that the phenotype is milder and more variable than previously described and evolves with age .
Generally , in the first year , the babies are floppy , with failure to thrive , big ears , and small external genitalia .
As schoolboys , the picture is one of learning problems , moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , with emerging <START:PHENOTYPE> truncal obesity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> .
Head circumferences are usually normal , and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> may be seen .
Big ears and small genitalia remain .
The toes are short and fingers tapered and malleable .
In late adolescence and adult life , the classically described heavy facial appearance emerges .
Some heterozygous females show milder clinical features such as <START:PHENOTYPE> tapering fingers <END> and shortened toes .
Twenty percent have significant learning problems , and 95 % have skewed X inactivation .
We conclude that this syndrome may be underdiagnosed in males in their early years and missed altogether in isolated heterozygous females .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> tRNA( Leu( UUR) ) mutation in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ( MELAS ) : genetic , biochemical , and morphological correlations in skeletal muscle .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ( MELAS ) has recently been associated with an A----G transition at position 3243 within the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> tRNA( Leu( UUR) ) gene .
Besides altering the tRNA( Leu( UUR) ) sequence , this point mutation lies within a DNA segment responsible for transcription termination of the rRNA genes .
We have studied the distribution and expression of mutant mtDNAs in muscle biopsies from MELAS patients .
Histochemical , immunohistochemical , and single-fiber PCR analysis showed that <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> ( RRF ) are associated both with high levels of mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genomes ( greater than 85 % mutant mtDNA ) and with a partial cytochrome c oxidase deficiency .
By quantitative in situ hybridization , the steady-state ratios of mRNAs :rRNAs were found to be similar to controls in six of eight patients studied .
In two other patients the relative levels of heavy-strand mRNAs were slightly increased , but a patient with myoclonic epilepsy and RRF also exhibited a similar increase .
These results directly correlate the A----G transition at mtDNA position 3243 with muscle <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> proliferation , partial respiratory-chain impairment , decreased mitochondrially synthesized protein content , and no specific alterations in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> ratios of mRNAs :rRNAs .
The Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome in fetuses .
Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome ( WHS ) with partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4 has been exceptionally diagnosed in fetuses .
We report prenatal diagnosis of five cases of monosomy 4p .
The fetuses were karyotyped for severe <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> ( IUGR ) diagnosed on routine ultrasound ( US ) .
In addition , cleft-lip and palate and <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> respectively were found in two cases .
The quantity of amniotic fluid was normal in all cases .
At autopsy , the fetuses showed the typical craniofacial dysmorphy but without <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
Major renal hypoplasia was the only constant visceral anomaly .
Midline fusion defects were observed in all the fetuses , ranging from minor abnormalities such as <START:PHENOTYPE> scalp defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , pulmonary isomerism , common mesentery , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sacral dimple <END> , to <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> corpus callosum agenesis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> .
On post-mortem X-rays , a <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> was always observed .
All the placentae were hypotrophic , and two exhibited vascular lesions , although there was no maternal hypertension .
Chromosomal studies showed that the breakpoints were within the 4p16 band in three cases , the 4p15 band in one case , and the 4p14 band in one case .
The deletion was de novo in four cases , and resulted from a paternal translocation in one case .
This study emphasizes the importance of karyotyping all fetuses with IUGR , especially when the quantity of amniotic fluid is normal , and suggests the possibility of recognizing on US the particular phenotype of WHS in utero .
Clinical phenotype of juvenile-onset primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> linked to chromosome 1q . Recent reports have suggested that a gene responsible for juvenile-onset primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> exists on the long arm of chromosome 1 ( 1q ) .
This report describes a previously unpublished family ( UM:JG3 ) in which juvenile-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is segregating in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> manner .
The clinical features in this family were compared with those seen in other pedigrees with this condition .
Linkage analysis was performed to evaluate whether a glaucoma-causing gene in UM:JG3 is linked to genetic markers on chromosome 1q . Affected family members , their siblings , children , and spouses were examined to identify the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Linkage studies were performed using short tandem repeat polymorphisms from chromosome 1q . Results of these studies were compared with those found for other families in which juvenile-onset primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is linked genetically to the same chromosome 1q region .
The UM:JG3 family includes 22 affected individuals over five generations , including 12 still living .
The average age at diagnosis for living affected individuals was 26 years .
An association between <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> was observed in this family , but the <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> was not associated with iris processes or other structural anomalies .
The clinical course of disease and response to treatment were similar to other families with this disease .
The disease phenotype in this family is linked to markers on chromosome 1q with a maximum lod score of 3.52 at a recombination fraction of 0.00 for marker D1S433 .
Haplotype analysis suggests the gene responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in this family is located in an 8-cM region between markers D1S445 and D1S218 .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in UM:JG3 is linked to markers on chromosome 1q , with a candidate interval smaller than that in previous reports .
In individuals with juvenile-onset open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> linked to chromosome 1q , the phenotype can range from mild ocular hypertension to blindness , resulting from marked elevations in intraocular pressure , with age at diagnosis ranging from 6 to 62 years .
However , most affected individuals display a characteristic phenotype that includes onset in the first three decades of life , unusually high intraocular pressures , and the need for surgical therapy to prevent loss of vision .
Whether differences in expression among families is due to allelic heterogeneity remains to be determined .
A family with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> linked to the OPA2 locus Xp11 .4-Xp11 .2 .
Autosomal dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( ADOA ) is the most common inherited optic atrophy.
Clinical features of ADOA include a slowly progressive bilateral loss of visual acuity , constriction of peripheral visual fields , central scotomas , and color vision abnormalities .
Although ADOA is the most commonly inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , autosomal recessive , <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> , mitochondrial , and sporadic forms have also been reported .
Four families with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( XLOA ) were previously described .
One family was subsequently linked to Xp11 .4-Xp11 .2 ( OPA2 ) .
This investigation studied one multi-generation family with an apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked form <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and compared their clinical characteristics with those of the previously described families , and determined whether this family was linked to the same genetic locus .
Fifteen individuals in a three-generation Idaho family underwent complete eye examination , color vision testing , automated perimetry , and fundus photography.
Polymorphic markers were used to genotype each individual and to determine linkage .
Visual acuities ranged from 20/30 to 20/10 0 .
All affected subjects had significant optic nerve pallor .
Obligate female carriers were clinically unaffected .
Preliminary linkage analysis ( LOD score = 1.8 ) revealed that the disease gene localized to the OPA2 locus on Xp11 .4-Xp11 .2 .
Four forms of inherited optic neuropathy , ADOA , autosomal recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( Costeff Syndrome ) , Leber hereditary optic neuropathy , and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction .
Future identification of the XLOA gene will reveal whether this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> is also associated with a mitochondrial defect .
Identification of the XLOA gene will advance our understanding of the inherited optic neuropathies and perhaps suggest treatments for these diseases .
An improved understanding of inherited optic neuropathies may in turn advance our understanding of acquired optic nerve diseases , such as glaucoma and ischemic optic neuropathy.

Congenital generalized lipodystrophy , type 4 ( CGL4 ) associated with myopathy due to novel PTRF mutations .
Congenital generalized lipodystrophy ( CGL ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by near total absence of body fat since birth with predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , diabetes , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> .
Three CGL loci , AGPAT2 , BSCL2 , and CAV1 , have been identified previously .
Recently , mutations in polymerase I and transcript release factor ( PTRF ) were reported in five Japanese patients presenting with myopathy and CGL ( CGL4 ) .
We report novel PTRF mutations and detailed phenotypes of two male and three female patients with CGL4 belonging to two pedigrees of Mexican origin ( CGL71 0 0 and CGL178 ) and one pedigree of Turkish origin ( CGL180 ) .
All patients had near total loss of body fat and congenital myopathy manifesting as weakness , percussion-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle mounding <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> high serum creatine kinase <END> levels .
Four of them had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> .
Three of them had atlantoaxial instability .
Two patients belonging to CGL178 pedigree required surgery for <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> in the first month of life .
None of them had <START:PHENOTYPE> prolonged QT interval <END> on electrocardiography but both siblings belonging to CGL7100 had exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias .
Three of them had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> but had normal glucose tolerance .
Two of them had <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> .
All patients had novel null mutations in PTRF gene .
In conclusion , mutations in PTRF result in a novel phenotype that includes generalized lipodystrophy with mild metabolic derangements , myopathy , cardiac arrhythmias , atlantoaxial instability , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> .
It is unclear how mutations in PTRF , which plays an essential role in formation of caveolae , affect a wide variety of tissues resulting in a variable phenotype .

Mutations in CIZ1 cause <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> primary <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> .
Primary dystonia is usually of <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> , can be familial , and frequently involves the cervical musculature .
Our goal was to identify the causal mutation in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> , primary <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> .
Linkage and haplotype analyses were combined with solution-based whole-exome capture and massively parallel sequencing in a large Caucasian pedigree with <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> , primary <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> to identify a cosegregating mutation .
High-throughput screening and Sanger sequencing were completed in 308 Caucasians with familial or sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> and matching controls for sequence variants in this mutant gene .
Exome sequencing led to the identification of an exonic splicing enhancer mutation in exon 7 of CIZ1 ( c.79 0A>G , p.S264G ) , which encodes CIZ1 , Cip1-interacting zinc finger protein 1 . CIZ1 is a p21( Cip1/ Waf1 ) -interacting zinc finger protein expressed in brain and involved in DNA synthesis and cell-cycle control .
Using a minigene assay , we showed that c.79 0A> G altered CIZ1 splicing patterns .
The p.S264 G mutation also altered the nuclear localization of CIZ1 .
Screening in subjects with adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> identified 2 additional CIZ1 missense mutations ( p.P47S and p.R672M ) .
Mutations in CIZ1 may cause <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> , primary <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> , possibly by precipitating neurodevelopmental abnormalities that manifest in adults and/or G1/ S cell-cycle dysregulation in the mature central nervous system .

Skeletal muscle contractile gene ( TN NT3 , MYH3 , TPM2 ) mutations not found in <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical talus <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
Arthrogryposis presents with lower limb contractures that resemble <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical talus <END> .
Recently , mutations in skeletal muscle contractile genes MYH3 ( myosin heavy chain 3) , TNNT3 ( troponin T3 ) , and TPM2 ( tropomyosin 2 ) were identified in patients with distal arthrogryposis DA2A ( Freeman-Sheldon syndrome ) or DA2B ( Sheldon-Hall syndrome ) .
We asked whether the contractile genes responsible for distal arthrogryposis are also responsible for cases of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical talus <END> .
We determined the frequency of MYH3 , TN NT3 , and TPM2 mutations in patients with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical talus <END> , and distal arthrogryposis type 1 ( DA1 ) .
We resequenced the coding exons of the MYH3 , TN NT3 , and TPM2 genes in 31 patients ( five with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical talus <END> , 20 with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> , and six with DA1 ) .
Variants were evaluated for segregation with disease in additional family members , and the frequency of identified variants was determined in a control population .
In one individual with DA1 , we identified a de novo TNNT3 mutation ( R63H ) previously identified in an individual with DA2 B.
No other causative mutations were identified , though we found several previously undescribed single-nucleotide polymorphisms of unknown importance .
Although mutations in MYH3 , TN NT3 , and TPM2 are frequently associated with distal arthrogryposis syndromes , they were not present in patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical talus <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
The TNNT3 R63H recurrent mutation identified in two unrelated individuals may be associated with either DA1 or DA2 B.

Expanding the clinical and neuroradiologic phenotype of primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> due to ASPM mutations .
To determine the spectrum of clinical , neuropsychological , and neuroradiologic features in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( MCPH ) due to ASPM gene mutations .
ASPM was sequenced in 52 unrelated MCPH probands .
In patients with ASPM mutations , we evaluated the clinical phenotype , cognition , behavior , brain MRI , and family .
We found homozygous or compound heterozygous ASPM loss-of-function mutations in 11 ( 22% ) probands and 5 siblings .
The probands harbored 18 different mutations , of which 16 were new .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> was severe after 1 year of age in all 16 patients , although in 4 patients the occipital-frontal circumference ( OFC ) at birth was decreased by only 2 SD .
The OFC Z score consistently decreased after birth .
Late-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> occurred in 3 patients and significant pyramidal tract involvement in 1 patient .
Intellectual quotients ranged from borderline-normal to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> motor delay <END> was noted in 7/16 patients .
Language development was delayed in all patients older than 3 years .
Brain MRI ( n = 12 ) showed a simplified gyral pattern in 9 patients and several malformations including ventricle enlargement ( n = 7) , partial <START:PHENOTYPE> corpus callosum agenesis <END> ( n = 3) , mild cerebellar hypoplasia ( n = 1 ) , focal <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical dysplasia <END> ( n = 1 ) , and unilateral polymicrogyria ( n = 1 ) . Non-neurologic abnormalities consisted of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> ( n = 1 ) , idiopathic premature puberty ( n = 1 ) , and renal dysplasia ( n = 1 ) .
We provide a detailed description of features associated with ASPM mutations .
Borderline <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> at birth , borderline-normal intellectual efficiency , and brain malformations can occur in ASPM-related primary hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , and renal disease in relatives of Bardet-Biedl syndrome sibs .
The Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by pigmentary retinopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , polydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Renal abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , acquired heart disease , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> also occur in homozygotes .
Two adult Bardet-Biedl sibs , a man with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and cardiomegaly and a woman with biliary cirrhosis , and 75 relatives in 5 generations of the extended family were identified .
Hospital records for major illnesses , death certificates , and autopsy reports were examined .
The frequent observation of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , and renal disease in first-degree relatives , obligate gene carriers , and other blood relatives raise the possibility that Bardet-Biedl heterozygotes are also predisposed to these disorders .
Puberty and genetic susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in a case-control study in twins .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Breast cancer <END> is thought to result from excessive cumulative exposure to ovarian hormones .
Different predictors of hereditary and sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> suggest different pathogenic mechanisms .
Affected twin pairs may help to illustrate such differences .
We obtained information from 1811 pairs of female twins , one or both of whom had <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
The pairs were stratified according to concordance or discordance for <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , zygosity , the presence or absence of a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , and the presence of bilateral or unilateral disease .
Disease-concordant monozygotic pairs were assumed to have a higher genetic susceptibility than other subgroups of pairs .
Paired twins were compared with respect to age at puberty and other factors .
We calculated adjusted odds ratios for the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> when only one twin was affected and for the first of the two diagnoses when both were affected .
Within disease-discordant monozygotic pairs , the twin with an earlier onset of puberty did not have an increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> ( adjusted odds ratio , 0.8 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.6 to 1.2 ) .
Within disease-concordant monozygotic pairs , the twin with earlier puberty was much more likely to receive the diagnosis first ( adjusted odds ratio , 5.4 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 2.0 to 14.5 ) .
In contrast , a later first pregnancy , lower parity , and later menopause within the pair were associated with an increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> when one twin was affected but did not predict an earlier diagnosis when both were affected .
Within the most genetically susceptible subgroup of twin pairs , the strong influence of earlier puberty on the age at the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and the absence of linkage to hormonal milestones later in life suggest that most cases of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> are not related to cumulative hormone exposure and that they may instead result from an unusual sensitivity to pubertal hormones .
Associations between <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and early menarche and those with reproductive milestones in adulthood may reflect different genotypes .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> nocturnal frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> : demonstration of focal frontal onset and intrafamilial variation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> nocturnal frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ( ADNFLE ) is a newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
We studied <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> localization and intrafamilial variation using video-EEG monitoring ( VEM ) and functional neuroimaging in two pairs of subjects from unrelated families .
The clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were similar from <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> to <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> in each individual , but varied between individuals .
As is often found in frontal lobe epilepsies , ictal EEG localization was imprecise in three of four cases .
One patient showed a consistent left fronto-polar onset that was corroborated by congruent focal hypometabolism on interictal PET and focal hyperperfusion on ictal single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) .
A second case studied with ictal SPECT showed a right parasagittal , midfrontal focus .
We conclude that this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome , which in one of the two families was due to a known neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mutation , causes frontal lobe foci that are unilateral and in variable locations in different individuals .
Hypophosphataemic <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> and Fanconi syndrome of adult onset with dominant inheritance .
Possible relationship with diabetes mellitus .
Adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> with multiple renal tubular defects and generalized aminoaciduria is uncommon , and where familial it is characteristically an autosomal recessive disorder .
This paper describes a kindred in which the syndrome has appeared in four successive generations , apparently inherited in a dominant manner , and possibly associated with diabetes mellitus .
The proposita had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> , renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> and generalized aminoaciduria , and at the age of 22 developed symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> which responded to treatment with oral phosphate .
Her father had been similarly affected : renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> was first noted when he was 24 , and 12 years later he developed diabetes mellitus from which he died .
One sister , aged 31 , has renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> , aminoaciduria and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> without bone disease .
In the three preceding generations at least seven other individuals had crippling bone disease and profound <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> of early adult onset ; in four , preterminal polydipsia was recorded , and others had renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> or diabetes mellitus .
Three of the five children in the latest generation have slight <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> but not other detectable abnormality .
The possible association between these renal tubular defects and diabetes mellitus is discussed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> granulomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> skin rash <END> , and synovial cysts .
In 1985 , Blau reported a family with 11 members in four generations affected by granulomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> iritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> skin rash <END> , and periarticular synovial cysts .
We report a second family with these abnormalities , thereby confirming this syndrome as a distinct familial entity with transmission compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Affected members in our family included a mother and two daughters .
Disease onset was at 10 months to 8 years of age .
Each had <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> , symmetric polyarthritis , and synovial cysts overlying the ankle and wrist joints .
In addition , both daughters had an <START:PHENOTYPE> intermittent generalized erythematous papular rash <END> that on biopsy revealed noncaseating granulomatous infiltration .
All three patients improved during alternate-day steroid therapy .
Recognition of this disorder as distinct from other , more common causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> is important because of the apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission and because of the excellent responses to low-dose steroid therapy .
Course of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> ( ARPKD ) in siblings : a clinical comparison of 20 sibships .
Forty-two children out of 20 sibships with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> were observed pro- and retrospectively over a mean period of 3.7 years in a long-term study on cystic kidney diseases in children .
The intra- and interfamilial variability in terms of age at diagnosis , administration of antihypertensive therapy , liver affection , and renal function were evaluated .
According to the 1971 subclassification of Blyth & Ockenden , defining different grades of severity , 12 patients were assigned to the perinatal , nine to the neonatal , 13 to the infantile , and eight to the juvenile subtype of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
In 11 of the 20 families different subtypes were observed among affected siblings .
In seven families , affected sibs belonged to adjacent subtypes , while major intrafamilial differences were observed in only four families .
The defined subtypes , therefore , cannot be regarded as appropriate in distinguishing genetic groups of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
With respect to the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> , there is a wide spectrum of phenotypic manifestations , ranging from stillbirths to mildly affected of phenotypic manifestations , ranging from stillbirths to mildly affected adults , while intrafamilial variability of the clinical picture is generally small with multiple allelism as the most likely genetic explanation .
Age at death , however , showed gross variation in eight sibships .
Differences in the clinical course between several siblings cannot be explained by a sex influence in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Neuroblastoma <END> screening at one year of age .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Neuroblastoma <END> is the second most common type of childhood tumor .
It is not known whether screening for <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> at one year of age reduces the incidence of metastatic disease or mortality due to <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> .
We offered urine screening for <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> at approximately one year of age to 2,581 ,188 children in 6 of 16 German states from 1995 to 2000 .
A total of 2 ,117 ,60 0 eligible children in the remaining states served as controls .
We compared the two groups in terms of the incidence of disseminated disease and mortality from <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> .
A total of 1 ,475 ,773 children ( 61 .2 percent of those who were born between July 1 , 1994 , and October 31 , 1999 ) underwent screening .
In this group , <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> was detected by screening in 149 children , of whom 3 have died .
Fifty-five children who had negative screening tests were subsequently given a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> ; 14 of these children have died .
The screened group and children in the control area had a similar incidence of stage 4 <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> ( 3.7 cases per 100,000 screened children [95 percent confidence interval , 2.7 to 4.7 ] and 3.8 per 100,000 controls [95 percent confidence interval , 2 .9 to 4.6] ) and a similar rate of death among children with <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> ( 1.3 deaths per 100,000 screened children [95 percent confidence interval , 0.7 to 1.8 ] and 1.2 per 100,000 controls [95 percent confidence interval , 0.7 to 1.7] ) . Comparison of the screened group and the children in the control area revealed substantial overdiagnosis in the former group ( an estimated rate of 7 cases per 100,000 children [95 percent confidence interval , 4.6 to 9.2] ) ; the overdiagnosis rate represents children who had <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> that was diagnosed by screening but who would not benefit from earlier diagnosis and treatment .
The present findings do not support the usefulness of general screening for <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> at one year of age .
Association between family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> in Parkinson disease . To identify familial risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> in patients with Parkinson disease ( PD ) .
Two hundred seventy-six outpatients with PD participated in the study .
The presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> was determined using a validated questionnaire , including items regarding the occurrence of visual , auditory , or other types of <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> .
Family history of PD and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> was determined by a structured interview and examination of medical records and affected family members .
Patients with young-onset PD ( <5 0 years ) who reported another PD patient among their siblings were tested for parkin mutations .
Stepwise logistic regression was applied for the detection of risk factors .
The regression model included a set of family history-related variables ( family history of PD and of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ) and a set of disease-related variables ( age , age at onset of PD , stage , duration of PD and of l-dopa therapy , l-dopa dose , and number of antiparkinsonian drugs ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hallucinations <END> were present in 32 % of the 276 patients .
Risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> included Mini-Mental State Examination score ( p < 0.0001 ) and positive family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ( p = 0.0005 ) .
Family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores are risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> in Parkinson disease .
Emberger syndrome-primary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> myelodysplasia <END> : report of seven new cases .
Four reports have been published on an association between acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) and primary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> , with or without congenital deafness .
We report seven new cases , including one extended family , confirming this entity as a genetic syndrome .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> typically presents in one or both lower limbs , before the hematological abnormalities , with onset between infancy and puberty and frequently affecting the genitalia .
The AML is often preceded by <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> myelodysplasia <END> with a high incidence of monosomy 7 in the bone marrow ( five propositi and two relatives ) .
Associated anomalies included <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> , long <START:PHENOTYPE> tapering fingers <END> and/or neck webbing ( four patients) , recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> cellulitis <END> in the affected limb ( four patients) , generalized warts ( two patients) , and congenital , high frequency <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> ( one patient ) .
Children with lower limb and genital <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> should be screened for hematological abnormalities and immunodeficiency .

A variant of Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> characterized by recovery of vision and by an unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genetic etiology .
The Tas2 and Vic2 Australian families are affected with a variant of Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> ( LHON ) .
The risk of developing the <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> shows strict maternal inheritance , and the ophthalmological changes in affected family members are characteristic of LHON .
However , in contrast to the common form of the disease , members of these two families show a high frequency of vision recovery .
To ascertain the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genetic etiology of the LHON in these families , both (a ) the the nucleotide sequences of the seven <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genes encoding subunits of respiratory-chain complex I and (b ) the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> cytochrome b gene were determined for representatives of both families .
Neither family carries any of the previously identified primary <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> LHON mutations : ND4/11778 , ND1/3460 , or ND1/416 0 .
Instead , both LHON families carry multiple nucleotide changes in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> complex I genes , which produce conservative amino acid changes .
From the available sequence data , it is inferred that the Vic2 and Tas2 LHON families are phylogenetically related to each other and to a cluster of LHON families in which mutations in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> cytochrome b gene have been hypothesized to play a primary etiological role .
However , sequencing analysis establishes that the Vic2 and Tas2 LHON families do not carry these cytochrome b mutations .
There are two hypotheses to account for the unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genetic etiology of the LHON in the Tas2 and Vic2 LHON families .
One possibility is that there is a primary LHON mutation within the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome but that it is at a site that was not included in the sequencing analyses .
Alternatively , the disease in these families may result from the cumulative effects of multiple secondary LHON mutations that have less severe phenotypic consequences .
Dermatosparaxis in children .
A case report and review of the newly recognized phenotype .
Dermatosparaxis is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> connective tissue disorder in animals that is caused by abnormal processing of type I procollagen and results in skin laxity and fragility .
Only three humans with characteristic biochemical and electronmicroscopic findings have been recognized to date .
We describe the clinical and electronmicroscopic findings in an affected boy who presented at birth with large full-thickness groin fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , large fontanelles , <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> , and dental laminal cysts .
He subsequently exhibited marked <START:PHENOTYPE> skin fragility <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> , increased <START:PHENOTYPE> bruisability <END> , and growth retardation .
The diagnosis of dermatosparaxis was made by electron-microscopic findings consisting of characteristic small , irregular , and circular collagen fibers in the skin .
His phenotype is strikingly similar to two other reported children with the disorder , which is now classified in humans as Ehlers-Danlos VII-C .
The newly recognized phenotype of Ehlers-Danlos VII-C is a distinct connective tissue disorder characterized by marked <START:PHENOTYPE> skin fragility <END> and laxity , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , increased <START:PHENOTYPE> bruisability <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> , and growth retardation .
A suspected clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by electron-microscopic and biochemical studies of connective tissue .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Encephalopathy <END> with intracerebral calcification , white matter lesions , <START:PHENOTYPE> growth hormone deficiency <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> : two sibs confirming a probably distinct entity .
Two sibs with an <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , including intracerebral calcification and white matter lesions , <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> owing to <START:PHENOTYPE> growth hormone deficiency <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> are reported .
The onset of the disease in both patients occurred with retardation of motor development during the first year of life .
Later , <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> , mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> became apparent .
These cases probably represent some form of connatal leucodystrophy.
The differential diagnosis is discussed .
Familial hemiplegic <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> ( CADASIL ) .
Cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> ( CADASIL ) is a recently described familial cerebrovascular disorder shown to map to chromosome 19q12 .
Familial hemiplegic <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> has also been shown in some families to map close to the CADASIL locus .
The fully developed CADASIL phenotype consists of recurrent strokes developing in the fourth decade , progressing to a <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudobulbar palsy <END> , spastic quadriparesis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> subcortical dementia <END> .
In an Irish family 15 members were fully investigated by magnetic resonance scanning ; 10 had typical magnetic resonance features of CADASIL .
Five members of this family had familial hemiplegic <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> and 4 of these had magnetic resonance evidence of CADASIL .
Two other members had <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> with and without aura as a presenting clinical symptom of CADASIL .
This disorder has been shown by linkage analysis to map to the CADASIL locus at chromosome 19 .
The phenotype at presentation of CADASIL in this family was variable and age related and included familial hemiplegic <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> with and without aura , transient ischemic attacks , strokes , and spinal cord infarction .
This family study increases our understanding of the spectrum of clinical manifestations of this underrecognized familial cerebrovascular disorder .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> with renal failure .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephrolithiasis <END> may occur as a consequence of a number of hereditary disorders .
We describe a large kindred from northern New York with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> accompanied by urinary concentrating defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , renal insufficiency , and renal wasting of potassium , phosphate , calcium , and uric acid .
The pattern of inheritance was established by examining the patients and their records and interviewing family members .
Selected members of the family were evaluated in detail , with measurements of erythrocyte cation fluxes and carbonic anhydrase ( carbonate dehydratase ) activity .
The kindred consisted of 162 family members from six generations .
All nine affected persons were male and appeared to have inherited the disease from their mothers .
No affected man transmitted the gene to a son , but the daughters of affected men were carriers .
The patients presented in childhood with calcium <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> and proteinuria , with progression to <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , urinary concentrating defects , and renal insufficiency .
Renal biopsies revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> tubular atrophy <END> , interstitial fibrosis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulosclerosis <END> ; the characteristic features of other forms of hereditary nephritis were absent .
Abnormalities in the renal excretion of calcium , phosphate , potassium , and uric acid were found only in the adult members of the kindred , although renal biopsies were abnormal even in younger members .
In one patient who has had a renal transplant for seven years , the disease has not recurred .
This kindred manifested an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> with renal failure , a new form of hereditary renal disease .
Most of the identifiable physiologic abnormalities occurred after the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> and renal insufficiency and may not be of pathogenetic importance .
Pitx1 haploinsufficiency causes <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> in humans and a clubfoot-like phenotype in mice .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Clubfoot <END> affects 1 in 1000 live births , although little is known about its genetic or developmental basis .
We recently identified a missense mutation in the PITX1 bicoid homeodomain transcription factor in a family with a spectrum of lower extremity abnormalities , including <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
Because the E130K mutation reduced PITX1 activity , we hypothesized that PITX1 haploinsufficiency could also cause <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
Using copy number analysis , we identified a 241 kb chromosome 5q31 microdeletion involving PITX1 in a patient with isolated familial <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
The PITX1 deletion segregated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> over three generations .
To study the role of PITX1 haploinsufficiency in <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> pathogenesis , we began to breed Pitx1 knockout mice .
Although Pitx1( + /- ) mice were previously reported to be normal , <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> was observed in 20 of 225 Pitx1( + /- ) mice , resulting in an 8 .9% penetrance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Clubfoot <END> was unilateral in 16 of the 20 affected Pitx1( + /- ) mice , with the right and left limbs equally affected , in contrast to right-sided predominant hindlimb abnormalities previously noted with complete loss of Pitx1 .
Peroneal artery hypoplasia occurred in the <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> limb and corresponded spatially with small lateral muscle compartments .
Tibial and fibular bone volumes were also reduced .
Skeletal muscle gene expression was significantly reduced in Pitx1( -/- ) E12 .5 hindlimb buds compared with the wild-type , suggesting that muscle hypoplasia was due to abnormal early muscle development and not disuse atrophy.
Our morphological data suggest that PITX1 haploinsufficiency may cause a developmental field defect preferentially affecting the lateral lower leg , a theory that accounts for similar findings in human <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
Fraser syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> : review of the diagnostic criteria and evidence for phenotypic modules in complex malformation syndromes .
Fraser syndrome is characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous syndactyly <END> , malformations of the larynx and genitourinary tract , craniofacial dysmorphism , orofacial clefting , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and musculoskeletal anomalies .
The inheritance is <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
No diagnostic cytogenetic abnormalities have been documented in affected patients , and no molecular genetic studies have been reported .
We have reviewed 117 cases diagnosed as Fraser syndrome or <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> published since the comprehensive review of Thomas et al in 1986 in order to validate the published diagnostic criteria and to delineate the phenotype associated with this syndrome .
Our series showed more females ( 57 / 117 ) than males and consanguinity was present in 29/119 ( 24.8% ) .
Eighty-eight patients satisfied the diagnostic criteria for Fraser syndrome ( 75% ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cryptophthalmos <END> was present in 103/117 ( 88% ) , syndactyly in 72 /117 ( 61 .5% ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> in 20/117 ( 17 .1% ) .
Ear malformations were recorded in 69 /117 ( 59% ) , and renal agenesis in 53 /117 ( 45 .3% ) .
Use of the published diagnostic criteria excluded several patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> and one or more physical feature(s ) consistent with Fraser syndrome .
The frequency of additional anomalies in our series was also higher than previously reported ( for example , imperforate anus or anal stenosis were found in 34/117 ( 29% ) compared with 2/124 ( 2% ) in the series of Thomas et al ( 1986 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal stenosis <END> or atresia was present in 7/ 117 ( 6% ) compared to 0/124.
These findings emphasise the clinical variability associated with Fraser syndrome and support genetic heterogeneity of the syndrome .
We also noted patterns of anomalies ( for example , <START:PHENOTYPE> bicornuate uterus <END> with imperforate anus or anal stenosis and renal malformations ) that are found in other syndromes and associations without <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> , suggesting that common modifier genes may explain some of the phenotypic variation in Fraser syndrome .
Further delineation of the C ( <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> ) syndrome .
This communication brings the number of recognized cases of the C ( <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> ) syndrome to 11 .
The pattern of findings includes an anomaly of the anterior cranium and frontal cortex ( trigonocephaly) , the root of the nose ( <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus <END> , and short nose) , and palate ( <START:PHENOTYPE> thick anterior alveolar ridges <END> ) ; abnormalities of the limbs ( polysyndactyly , bridged palmar creases , short limbs , and joint <START:PHENOTYPE> dislocations <END> and/or contractures ) ; visceral defects ( <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defects <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and abnormal lobulations of the lungs and kidneys ) .
Auricular , mandibular , skin , and genital abnormalities also occur .
Consistent neurological findings are hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> have been reported .
Normal chromosomes , normal parents with multiple affected offspring , equal sex ratio of affected individuals , and consanguineous matings all support <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> of the C syndrome .
In autopsied cases , there has been a suggestion of defective central nervous system myelination .
About 1/2 of the case have died within the first year .
All survivors have severe to profound mental retardation except for one child who has moderate retardation .
Familial cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> with a mutation in NOL3 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myoclonus <END> is characterized by sudden , brief involuntary movements , and its presence is debilitating .
We identified a family suffering from <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> , cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> without associated seizures .
We performed clinical , electrophysiological , and genetic studies to define this phenotype .
A large , 4-generation family with a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> underwent careful questioning , examination , and electrophysiological testing .
Thirty-five family members donated blood samples for genetic analysis , which included single nucleotide polymorphism mapping , microsatellite linkage , targeted massively parallel sequencing , and Sanger sequencing .
In silico and in vitro experiments were performed to investigate functional significance of the mutation .
We identified 11 members of a Canadian Mennonite family suffering from <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> , disabling , multifocal <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> .
Somatosensory evoked potentials indicated a cortical origin of the <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> .
There were no associated seizures .
Some severely affected individuals developed signs of progressive cerebellar ataxia of variable severity late in the course of their illness .
The phenotype was inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion .
We demonstrated linkage to chromosome 16q21-22.1 .
We then sequenced all coding sequence in the critical region , identifying only a single cosegregating , novel , nonsynonymous mutation , which resides in the gene NOL3 .
Furthermore , this mutation was found to alter post-translational modification of NOL3 protein in vitro .
We propose that familial cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> is a novel movement disorder that may be caused by mutation in NOL3 .
Further investigation of the role of NOL3 in neuronal physiology may shed light on neuronal membrane hyperexcitability and pathophysiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and related disorders .

Rare dental abnormalities seen in oculo-facio-cardio-dental ( OFCD ) syndrome : three new cases and review of nine patients .
Oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome is a very rare condition .
So far , only nine cases have been documented .
We report on three additional female patients representing the same entity .
The clinical findings were : <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , microphthalmia/microcornea , secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , vision impairment , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , long <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal tip <END> with separated cartilages , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , and skeletal anomalies .
The following dental abnormalities were found : radiculomegaly , delayed dentition , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> , root dilacerations ( extension ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> malocclusion <END> .
For the first time , fusion of teeth and hyperdontia of permanent upper teeth were seen .
In addition , structural and morphological dental changes were noted .
These findings expand the clinical spectrum of the syndrome .
Epidermal growth factor gene functional polymorphism and the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> in patients with cirrhosis .
Overexpression of epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) in the liver induces transformation to <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> in animal models .
Polymorphisms in the EGF gene modulate EGF levels .
To assess the relationship among human EGF gene single-nucleotide polymorphism , EGF expression , and risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> .
Molecular mechanisms linking the 61 * G allele polymorphism to EGF expression were examined in human <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> cell lines and human liver tissue .
A case-control study involving 207 patients with cirrhosis was conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital ( 1999-2006 ) and a validation case-control study involving 121 patients with cirrhosis was conducted at HÃ´pital Paul Brousse ( 1993-2006 ) .
Restriction fragment-length polymorphism was used to determine the EGF gene polymorphism genotype .
Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between the EGF polymorphism and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> risk .
Mechanisms by which the EGF gene polymorphism modulates EGF levels and associations among EGF gene polymorphism , EGF levels , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> .
Transcripts from the EGF 61 * G allele exhibited more than a 2-fold longer half-life than those from the 61 * A allele , and EGF secretion was 2.3-fold higher in G/G <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> cell lines than A/ A cell lines .
Serum EGF levels were 1.8-fold higher in G/G patients than A/ A patients , and liver EGF levels were 2.4-fold higher in G/G patients than A/ A patients .
Among the 207 patients with cirrhosis in the Massachusetts study population , 59 also had <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> .
Analysis of the distribution of allelic frequencies revealed that there was a 4-fold odds of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> in G/G patients compared with A/ A patients in the Massachusetts study population ( odds ratio , 4.0 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI] , 1.6-9.6 ; P = .002 ) .
Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the number of copies of G was significantly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> after adjusting for age , sex , race , etiology , and severity of cirrhosis ( G/G or A/ G vs A/ A ; hazard ratio , 3.49 ; 95 % CI , 1.29-9.44 ; P = .01 ) .
The significant association was validated in the French patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> .
The EGF gene polymorphism genotype is associated with risk for development of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> in liver cirrhosis through modulation of EGF levels .
Clinical characterization of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and recessive variants of Robinow syndrome .
Robinow syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> mesomelic limb shortening <END> associated with facial and genital anomalies that can be inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> or recessive mode .
We characterized these two variants clinically , with the aim of establishing clinical criteria to enhance the differential diagnosis between them or other similar conditions .
The frequencies of clinical signs considered important for the discrimination of the dominant or recessive variants were estimated in a sample consisting of 38 patients personally examined by the authors and of 50 affected subjects from the literature .
Using the presence of rib fusions as diagnostic of the recessive variant , and also based on the inheritance pattern in familial cases , we classified 37 patients as having the recessive form and other 51 as having the dominant form .
The clinical signs present in more than 75 % of patients with either form , and therefore the most important for the characterization of this syndrome were <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , nasal features ( large nasal bridge , short <START:PHENOTYPE> upturned nose <END> , and anteverted nares) , <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mesomelic limb shortening <END> , brachydactyly , clinodactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
Hemivertebrae and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> were present in more than 75 % of patients with the recessive form , but in less than 25% of patients with the dominant form .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Umbilical hernia <END> (32.3% ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> supernumerary teeth <END> (1 0.3% ) were found exclusively in patients with the dominant form .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Thrombocytopenia <END> identifies a severe familial phenotype of <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> and reveals genetic linkages at 1q22 and 11p13 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( SLE ) is a complicated autoimmune disease with a definite genetic predisposition .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Thrombocytopenia <END> predicts severe disease and death in SLE , making the identification of the related genetic risk factors especially important .
We selected the 38 pedigrees that had an SLE patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> ( platelets , < 10 x 10(9 ) / L [ < 100,000/microL] ) from a collection of 184 pedigrees multiplex for SLE .
Linkages were established at 1q22-23 ( maximum logarithm of odds [lod(max) ] = 3.71 ) in the 38 pedigrees and at 11p13 ( lod(max ) = 5.72 ) in the 13 African American pedigrees .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephritis <END> , serositis , neuropsychiatric involvement , autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic anemia <END> , anti-double-stranded DNA , and <START:PHENOTYPE> antiphospholipid antibody <END> were associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> .
Other results show that SLE is more severe in the families with a thrombocytopenic SLE patient , whether or not <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> in an individual patient is considered .
These results are consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> being a component of a severe familial form of SLE and with genes at 1q22-23 and 11p13 contributing to this severe phenotype and to the subsequent high mortality associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> in SLE .
G syndrome : an unusual family .
The G syndrome is a multiple congenital anomaly ( MCA ) syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , stridor , and <START:PHENOTYPE> swallowing difficulties <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cleft lip <END> and palate , cardiac defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> cranial asymmetry <END> , and bowel obstruction are occasional manifestations .
Family data suggest <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Males appear to have more serious manifestations , whereas most females with the G syndrome have a benign course and are ascertained through affected male relatives .
In the family reported here , the proposita was first seen at age 7 weeks because of <START:PHENOTYPE> swallowing difficulties <END> , stridor , and unusual facial appearance , reminiscent of the G syndrome .
Evaluation of the family showed striking facial changes in her father and all four of his sibs .
These five individuals had megalencephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and a broad prominent nasal root and bridge , reminiscent of the facial appearance in the BBB syndrome .
There was no evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> , respiratory abnormality , or hoarse voice in any other relative .
These individuals with the G syndrome display two unusual manifestations .
There are no males with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> ; the proposita has the most severe laryngotracheoesophageal symptoms .
Although <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> is not an invariable manifestation of the G syndrome and although six females with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> or respiratory abnormalities have been reported previously , the manifestations in this family underline the variability of this condition and provide further support that the G syndrome can be expressed with equal severity in both males and females .
Although phenotypic overlap between the BBB and G syndromes has long been recognized , many still consider them to be distinct nosologic entities .
The occurrence of both BBB and G syndrome in different members of the same family has been observed previously.( ABSTR ACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Self-limited <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of skin ulceration , arthroosteolysis with pseudoacromegaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> keratitis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> in a Kirghizian family .
We report on a previously apparently undescribed Puretic syndrome-like self-limited <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder with <START:PHENOTYPE> onset in infancy <END> and running its course by 11 yr in five sibs in a Kirghizian family with recurrent skin ulceration , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthralgias <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , fistulous <START:PHENOTYPE> osteolysis <END> around joints , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dystrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> keratitis <END> with visual impairment or blindess in three of the five affected sibs .
Affected hands and feet acquire a pseudoacromegalic appearance ; fingers become clawed ; involvement of growth plates around knees may lead to asymmetrical shortness with secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
Slow but normal healing during and after the course of the disease leaves severe cicatrization and chronic arthroses .
No other organ system is involved , intellect is normal , and health and reproductive capacity are otherwise unimpaired .
We propose the name Kirghizian dermatoosteolysis for this condition .
New phenotype associated with an Arg116Cys mutation in the CRYAA gene : nuclear <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> .
To describe a new phenotype with an arginine-to-cysteine mutation at position 116 ( Arg116 Cys ) in the CRYAA gene .
We investigated a 4-generation French family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and performed a genetic linkage analysis using microsatellite DNA markers encompassing 15 known <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> loci .
Exons 1 , 2 , and 3 and flanking intronic sequences of the CRYAA gene were amplified and analyzed using direct sequencing .
All of the affected individuals had nuclear <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> .
Genetic analysis revealed the previously described Arg116Cys mutation in the CRYAA gene in the heterozygous state in all of the affected members of the family but not in unaffected individuals .
To our knowledge , this is the first case to date in which an Arg116Cys mutation in the CRYAA gene was associated with nuclear <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> .
This study indicates that an Arg116Cys mutation in the CRYAA gene could be associated with an unusual phenotype in affected individuals .
In this family , the clinical observation of <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> allows for the possibility of identifying individuals carrying the mutation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Iris coloboma <END> is particularly important in terms of perinatal diagnosis because its detection in the newborn requires a careful and regular examination of the lens .
Long-term outcome in treated combined <START:PHENOTYPE> methylmalonic acidemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinemia <END> .
To describe the clinical and biochemical features and long-term outcome of a cohort of eight patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> methylmalonic acidemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> ( cblC ) .
Documentation of clinical features at birth and longitudinal follow-up of the biochemical and clinical response to treatment with daily oral carnitine and intramuscular hydroxocobalamin observed during continuous follow-up for an average of 5.7 years .
Our patients had an increased incidence of congenital malformations including <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( <5% ) at birth ( 2 of 8 ) , congenital heart disease ( 2 of 8 ) , dysmorphic facial features ( 1 of 8 ) , and thyroglossal duct cyst ( 1 of 8 ) .
Postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( 2 of 8 ) and hip dislocation caused by ligament laxity ( 1 of 8 ) were also noted .
One patient had profound <START:PHENOTYPE> visual impairment <END> before 6 months of age secondary to cblC <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , and two patients had abnormal retinal pigmentation with normal visual function .
All patients presented with poor growth , feeding problems , and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
No patients had acute acidotic crises before or after treatment .
All patients had dramatic reduction of plasma free homocystine and urine methylmalonic acid excretion after initiation of therapy with carnitine , intramuscular ( IM) hydroxocobalamin ( OHcbl ) and , in two cases , oral betaine .
Growth was significantly improved in most cases after the initiation of therapy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> was resolved in one patient .
All patients were developmentally delayed regardless of age of treatment onset , although two patients had relatively mild <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
cblC patients may have an increased incidence of congenital malformations suggesting prenatal effects of abnormal cbl metabolism .
Treatment with IM OHcbl and carnitine successfully corrects the biochemical abnormalities and improves growth .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Developmental delay <END> of variable severity is always present regardless of age at diagnosis or treatment onset .
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIB with characteristic facies , decreased curvatures of the spinal column , and joint contractures in two unrelated girls .
Two unrelated girls , aged 11 and 14 years , with clinical manifestations of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ( EDS ) type VIB , characteristic facies , skeletal abnormalities , and other features are described .
They had Marfanoid habitus with <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> ; fragile , hyperextensible , and readily bruisable skin with widened , atrophic scars ; recurrent hematomas ; <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized joint laxity <END> ; hypotonia ; <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ; and mild delay of gross motor development .
Lysyl hydroxylase deficiency was ruled out in Patient 1 . Parental consanguinity was present in Patient 2 . They both had , in early childhood , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , drooping lower eyelids , short nose , small mouth , and <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> .
Facial features that persisted included thick eyebrows , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , low-set , and slanted ears , hypoplastic columella , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> thin upper lip <END> .
They had tubular stenosis of the phalanges , metacarpals , and metatarsals ; decreased physiological curvatures of the spinal column with tall vertebrae ; and joint contractures including <START:PHENOTYPE> talipes equinovarus <END> and progressive talipes valgus .
Their hearing of high-pitched sounds was impaired .
They had <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> and recurrent cystitis with an enlarged bladder .
In view of these findings , we propose that these two girls represent a clinically recognizable subgroup of EDS type VIB.
Clinical and molecular findings of ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 2 in 4 families .
Ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 2 ( AOA2 ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disease caused by SETX mutations in 9q34 resulting in cerebellar ataxia in association with peripheral neuropathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> on imaging , an <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated alpha-fetoprotein <END> ( AFP ) serum level , and occasional <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> .
To describe the clinical and molecular findings of 7 patients with a clinical presentation of AOA2 and their relatives .
Case report .
Projet Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique .
Seven patients with AOA2 and their family members .
Linkage analysis and direct sequencing of all exons of SETX were performed in all patients .
Magnetic resonance imaging and electroneuromyography were performed and the patients ' AFP serum levels were tested .
We identified 7 patients with AOA2 from 4 unrelated families .
Three novel SETX mutations were found .
The clinical picture of the patients reported is fairly homogeneous and in accordance with the classic AOA2 presentation : onset from 13 to 18 years of progressive cerebellar ataxia and <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Oculomotor apraxia <END> was detected in 1 patient .
Predominant <START:PHENOTYPE> axonal neuropathy <END> and a diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> were found in the 4 patients tested .
All patients had elevated AFP serum levels and 5 of 8 nonsymptomatic heterozygous relatives had moderately increased AFP serum levels as well .
Ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 2 is a homogeneous form of cerebellar ataxia with occasional <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> .
Most nonsymptomatic heterozygous carriers present with increased AFP serum levels .
A form of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> marfanoid habitus <END> .
A kindred has been studied in which <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and marfanoid clinical features are present in several individuals .
The pedigree is consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive inheritance <END> .
Four affected males aged 12-18 years and four obligate carriers have been identified .
Clinical findings in the 4 affected males included a tall slender habitus (3 ) ( the fourth was tall but muscular) , a long-narrow face (3) , <START:PHENOTYPE> large head <END> (4) , highly arched palate (4) , <START:PHENOTYPE> small mandible <END> (4) , abnormal speech (4) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypernasal voice <END> (3) , joint hyperextensibility (3) , borderline to large testes (3) , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> (2 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> (1 ) , and a double row of teeth (1 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> (4 ) ranged from mild to severe ; abnormal behavior included hyperactive and <START:PHENOTYPE> aggressive behavior <END> (2 ) , autistic-like (1 ) and jovial behavior (1 ) .
One and possibly two , males had absence of the corpus callosum .
Chromosome studies on all were normal; no marker X was observed .
We believe this family probably represents a new form of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
SUCLA2 mutations are associated with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> methylmalonic aciduria <END> , Leigh-like encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
One pedigree with four patients has been recently described with mitochondrial DNA depletion and mutation in SUCLA2 gene leading to succinyl-CoA synthase deficiency .
Patients had a Leigh-like encephalomyopathy and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> but besides the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , the profile of urine organic acid was not reported .
We have studied 14 patients with mild 'unlabelled ' <START:PHENOTYPE> methylmalonic aciduria <END> ( MMA ) from 11 families .
Eight of the families are from the Faroe Islands , having a common ancestor , and three are from southern Italy .
Since the reaction catalysed by succinyl-CoA synthase in the tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle represents a distal step of the methylmalonic acid pathway , we investigated the SUCLA2 gene as a candidate gene in our patients .
Genetic analysis of the gene in the 14 patients confirmed the defect in all patients and led to the identification of three novel mutations ( p.Gly118 Arg ; p.Arg284Cys ; c.534 + 1G --> A ) .
The defect could be convincingly shown at the protein level and our data also confirm the previously described mitochondrial DNA depletion .
Defects in SUCLA2 can be found at the metabolite level and are defined by mildly elevated methylmalonic acid and C4-dicarboxylic carnitine concentrations in body fluids in association with variable <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> .
Clinically the diagnosis should be considered in patients with early/neonatal onset encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and Leigh-like MRI abnormalities mainly affecting the putamen and the caudate nuclei .
The frequency of the mutated allele in the Faroese population amounted to 2% , corresponding with an estimated homozygote frequency of 1 : 250 0 .
Our data extend knowledge on the genetic defects causing MMA .
Our patients present with an early infantile Leigh-like encephalomyopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , and later on a progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
Mild MMA , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and specific abnormalities in the carnitine ester profile are the biochemical hallmarks of the disease .
In view of the frequency of the mutated allele on the Faroe Islands , measures become feasible to prevent the occurrence of the disease on the islands .
We confirm and extend the findings on this inborn error of metabolism in the TCA cycle that must be carefully investigated by accurate metabolite analyses .
FACL4 , encoding fatty acid-CoA ligase 4 , is mutated in nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) is an inherited condition that causes failure to develop cognitive abilities , owing to mutations in a gene on the X chromosome .
The latest XLMR update lists up to 136 conditions leading to 'syndromic ' , or 'specific ' , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MRXS ) and 66 entries leading to 'nonspecific ' <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MRX ) .
For 9 of the 66 MRX entries , the causative gene has been identified .
Our recent discovery of the contiguous gene deletion syndrome ATS-MR ( previously known as Alport syndrome , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , midface hypoplasia , elliptocytosis , OMIM #300194 ) , characterized by Alport syndrome ( ATS ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MR) , indicated Xq22.3 as a region containing one <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> gene .
Comparing the extent of deletion between individuals with ATS-MR and individuals with ATS alone allowed us to define a critical region for <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> of approximately 380 kb , containing four genes .
Here we report the identification of two point mutations , one missense and one splice-site change , in the gene FACL4 in two families with nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Analysis of enzymatic activity in lymphoblastoid cell lines from affected individuals of both families revealed low levels compared with normal cells , indicating that both mutations are null mutations .
All carrier females with either point mutations or genomic deletions in FACL4 showed a completely skewed X-inactivation , suggesting that the gene influences survival advantage .
FACL4 is the first gene shown to be involved in nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and fatty-acid metabolism .
Genetically increasing Myoc expression supports a necessary pathologic role of abnormal proteins in <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Despite the importance of MYOC for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , the protein 's normal function(s ) and the pathogenic mechanism(s ) of MYOC mutations are not clear .
Elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> are sometimes induced by corticosteroids , and corticosteroid use can result in substantially increased MYOC expression .
It has been suggested , therefore , that steroid-induced MYOC protein levels cause steroid-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and that protein level-increasing mutations in MYOC contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> not associated with steroid use .
A causative role of elevated MYOC levels in steroid-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is controversial , however , and it is not clear if elevated MYOC levels can result in IOP elevation .
To directly test if increased levels of MYOC can cause IOP elevation and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , we generated bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice that overexpress Myoc at a level similar to that induced by corticosteroid use .
These mice do not develop elevated IOP or <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Our present findings , along with the absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in mice completely lacking MYOC , show that changing the level of MYOC is not pathogenic ( from absent to approximately 15 times normal ) .
These findings suggest that noncoding sequence variants are unlikely to influence <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and that disease pathogenesis in primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> patients is dependent upon the expression of abnormal mutant proteins .
This work does not support a causative role for increased MYOC levels or the MYOC gene in steroid-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Apparently new osteodysplastic and primordial short stature with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microdontia <END> , opalescent teeth , and rootless molars in two siblings .
A Thai man and his sister affected with a newly recognized syndrome of proportionate primordial short stature are reported .
The patients had severe intrauterine and <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent nose <END> and nasal bridge , <START:PHENOTYPE> small pinnae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large sella turcica <END> , areas of hypo- and hyperpigmentation of skin , dry and <START:PHENOTYPE> thin scalp hair <END> , and long and <START:PHENOTYPE> straight clavicles <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ivory epiphyses <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cone-shaped epiphyses <END> of the hands were found when they were young , but most of them disappeared as they grew up . Scaphoid and trapezium had angular appearance .
The second toes were unusually long .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Distal symphalangism <END> of toes and barchymesophalangy of fingers were noted .
The findings that appear to distinguish this syndrome from the previously reported syndromes are long second toes , opalescent and rootless teeth , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microdontia <END> , severely hypoplastic alveolar process , and unerupted tooth .
The mode of inheritance is suspected to be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .

TH2 cytokine-associated transcription factors in atopic and nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> : evidence for differential signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 expression .
The expression of IL-4 and IL-5 is increased in patients with atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> compared with control subjects and correlates with indices of pulmonary function .
In nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> the expression of IL-4 , unlike IL-5 , fails to correlate with pulmonary function , and compared with their atopic counterparts , these patients have fewer cells expressing IL-4 receptor ( IL-4R ) .
As such , a deficiency in the IL-4 signaling pathway may be implicated in nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
The transcription factors GATA-3 and cMAF mediate IL-4 and IL-5 synthesis , whereas signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 ( STAT-6 ) is critical for IL-4R signaling .
This study examines the expression profile of these transcription factors in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , according to atopic status .
With immunocytochemistry , the expression of GATA-3 , cMAF , and STAT- 6 protein was determined in sections of bronchial biopsy specimens from patients with atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( n = 7) , patients with nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( n = 8 ) , and control subjects ( n = 8 ) .
Higher numbers of cells expressing GATA-3 and cMAF were observed in patients with atopic and those with nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> than in control subjects and patients with tuberculosis ( P <.001 ) .
There were also more STAT-6-immunoreactive cells in patients with atopic and those with nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> than in control subjects ( P <.0001 , P <.05 ) .
Notably , however , fewer cells expressing STAT- 6 protein were observed in nonatopic versus atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( P <.0001 ) .
These results demonstrate the upregulation of GATA-3 and cMAF in both variants of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and indicate that reduced IL-4R signaling , because of lower STAT- 6 expression , may be a feature of nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome : fourteen new patients and a clinical analysis .
The Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome ( SGS ) is a disorder of unknown cause comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> marfanoid habitus <END> and skeletal , neurological , cardiovascular , and connective-tissue anomalies .
There are no pathognomonic signs of SGS and diagnosis depends on recognition of a characteristic combination of anomalies .
Here , we describe 14 persons with SGS and compare their clinical findings with those of 23 previously reported individuals , including two families with more than one affected individual .
Our analysis suggests that there is a characteristic facial appearance , with more than two thirds of all individuals having <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , and apparently low-set and posteriorly rotated ears . Other commonly reported manifestations include hypotonia in at least the neonatal period , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and inguinal or <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> .
The degree of reported <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual impairment <END> ranges from mild to severe .
The most common skeletal manifestations in SGS were <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , pectus deformity , camptodactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> .
None of the skeletal signs alone is specific for SGS .
Our study includes 14 mainly German individuals with SGS evaluated over a period of 10 years .
Given that only 23 other persons with SGS have been reported to date worldwide , we suggest that SGS may be more common than previously assumed .
Clinical spectrum of steroid sulfatase deficiency : <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , birth complications and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> .
When boys affected with steroid sulfatase deficiency are delivered , the lack of the enzyme in the placenta may cause birth complications .
In postnatal life this gene defect gives rise to <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> .
In a series of 25 patients birth complications were reported in 9 cases .
Of these boys , 4 displayed bilateral inguinal <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> and one was affected unilaterally .
In a further boy we observed unilateral inguinal <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> without a history of birth complications .
In one patient who had been delivered by forceps , abdominal bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> resulted in severe hypogenitalism .
A review of the literature revealed 30 cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> displaying hypogenitalism or <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> or both .
In conclusion , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> should be considered as a further clinical manifestation of steroid sulfatase deficiency .
PAK3 related mental disability : further characterization of the phenotype .
We report clinical , neuropsychological and molecular findings in affected males and carrier females in the fourth reported family with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> caused by mutation in the PAK3 gene ( Xq22.3-q23) , W446 S .
In contrast to previous reports , carrier females manifested learning problems and mild mental disability .
Skewed X-inactivation was observed here for the first time in carriers of PAK3 mutation .
Neuropsychological tests in affected males and carrier females suggested a common neuropsychological profile of impaired spatial cognitive abilities and defects in attentional and executive functions .
The five affected males examined herein had a proportionally small head size or <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , oral motor hypotonia with <START:PHENOTYPE> drooling <END> and inarticulate speech and <START:PHENOTYPE> short attention span <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> , restlessness , and <START:PHENOTYPE> aggression <END> .
Brain imaging showed signs of chronic non-progressive hydrocephalus in one patient who manifested <START:PHENOTYPE> psychosis <END> and fluctuant gait deterioration , while two other patients showed no abnormalities .
EEG recordings were available from four affected males and one carrier female , and all showed similar posterior slow wave activity without epileptic discharges .
Only one affected male in the family suffered from <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
When comparing the affected males in this family and the three previously reported families with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> due to a PAK3 mutation , similarities in their characteristics were small head size or <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , speech defects , behavioral abnormalities , and psychiatric disease .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> chorea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Pathologic features of a newly defined familial disorder .
Five generations of a family exhibit a unique <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> neurologic disorder characterized by the development ( usually between 15 and 30 years of age ) of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> choreiform movements <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive dementia <END> , and death after 15 to 25 years of illness .
Neuropathologic findings in two deceased family members revealed remarkably similar findings , including marked neuronal loss of the dentate nucleus , microcalcification of the globus pallidus , neuroaxonal dystrophy of the nucleus gracilis , and demyelination of the centrum semiovale .
The clinical and pathologic findings are closely correlated .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> chorea <END> are related to severe neuronal loss in the dentate nucleus with calcification in the globus pallidus .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dementia <END> occurs with progressive demyelination of the centrum semiovale , and loss of posterior column function occurs with neuroaxonal dystrophy of the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus .
A new syndrome with distinct facial and auricular malformations and dominant inheritance .
We report on a mother and son with <START:PHENOTYPE> high forehead <END> ; elongated and flattened face ; arched , <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse eyebrows <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> long nose <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nostrils <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> microstomia <END> ; high , narrow palate ; <START:PHENOTYPE> nasal speech <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> chin dimples <END> ; and a highly unusual bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> auricular malformation <END> .
Intelligence and hearing are normal , and there is no " whistling " face or deviation of fingers .
Although resembling in some ways the Freeman-Sheldon syndrome , this phenotype most likely represents a new malformation syndrome , either <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> or X-linked dominant .
Clinical characterisation of 29 neurofibromatosis type-1 patients with molecularly ascertained 1.4 Mb type-1 NF1 deletions . Large deletions of the NF1 gene region occur in approximately 5 % of patients with neurofibromatosis type-1 ( NF1 ) and are associated with particularly severe manifestations of the disease .
However , until now , the genotype-phenotype relationship has not been comprehensively studied in patients harbouring large NF1 gene deletions of comparable extent ( giving rise to haploinsufficiency of the same genes ) .
We have performed the most comprehensive clinical/neuropsychological characterisation so far undertaken in NF1 deletion patients , involving 29 patients with precisely determined type-1 NF1 ( 1.4 Mb ) deletions .
Novel clinical features found to be associated with type-1 NF1 deletions included <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> ( 17 % of patients) , <START:PHENOTYPE> bone cysts <END> (5 0% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit <END> ( 73% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> ( 45% ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> speech difficulties <END> ( 48% ) .
Type-1 NF1 deletions were found to be disproportionately associated with facial dysmorphic features (90 % of patients) , <START:PHENOTYPE> tall stature <END> ( 46% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> large hands <END> and feet ( 46% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ( 43% ) , joint hyperflexibility ( 72%) , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed cognitive development <END> and/or learning disabilities ( 93% ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( IQ<70 ; 38% ) , as compared with the general NF1 patient population .
Significantly increased frequencies ( relative to the general NF1 population ) of plexiform neurofibromas ( 76% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> subcutaneous neurofibromas <END> ( 76% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal neurofibromas <END> ( 64% ) and MPNSTs ( 21% ) were also noted in the type-1 deletion patients .
Further , 5 0 % of the adult patients exhibited a very high burden of cutaneous neurofibromas ( N>or=1000 ) .
These findings emphasise the importance of deletion analysis in NF1 since frequent monitoring of tumour presence and growth could potentiate early surgical intervention thereby improving patient survival .
Exclusion of the dymeclin and PAPSS2 genes in a novel form of <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasias ( SEMD ) represent a heterogeneous group of conditions composed of at least 15 well-defined entities .
The classification is based on clinical , radiological and molecular findings .
Among them , several conditions also include a <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MR ) syndrome , namely Wolcott-Rallison syndrome , Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome ( DMC ) and lysosomal storage disorders .
Here , we report on a novel form of SEMD with MR in two Pakistani sisters born to first-cousin parents .
SEMD , MR , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , facial dysmorphism and <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> of back and legs were noted in the two children .
Skeletal findings included <START:PHENOTYPE> flat vertebral bodies <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> irregular vertebral plates <END> , irregular and flared metaphyses with vertical striations , small and <START:PHENOTYPE> irregular epiphyses <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small carpal bones <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow iliac wings <END> without lacy pelvis iliac crest .
Similarities with DMC prompted us to test and eventually exclude the DMC gene , dymeclin , by direct sequencing .
Similarly , we excluded the PAPSS2 gene ( 3 ' -alpha phosphoadenosine 5 ' -phosphosulphate synthase 2 ) responsible for SEMD Pakistani type .
The combination of features observed in the two sisters does not fit with any previously reported SEMD and represents therefore a novel form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> SEMD with MR .
Familial isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> is associated with recurrent chromosome 17q23.1q23.2 microduplications containing TBX4 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Clubfoot <END> is a common musculoskeletal birth defect for which few causative genes have been identified .
To identify the genes responsible for isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> , we screened for genomic copy-number variants with the Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP Array 6. 0 . A recurrent chromosome 17q23.1q23.2 microduplication was identified in 3 of 66 probands with familial isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
The chromosome 17q23.1q23.2 microduplication segregated with autosomal-dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> in all three families but with reduced penetrance .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> was common and one female had developmental <START:PHENOTYPE> hip dysplasia <END> .
Subtle skeletal abnormalities consisted of broad and shortened metatarsals and calcanei , small distal tibial epiphyses , and thickened ischia .
Several skeletal features were opposite to those described in the reciprocal chromosome 17q23.1q23.2 microdeletion syndrome associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and cardiac and limb abnormalities .
Of note , during our study , we also identified a microdeletion at the locus in a sibling pair with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
The chromosome 17q23.1q23.2 region contains the T-box transcription factor TBX4 , a likely target of the bicoid-related transcription factor PITX1 previously implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> etiology .
Our result suggests that this chromosome 17q23.1q23.2 microduplication is a relatively common cause of familial isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> and provides strong evidence linking <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> etiology to abnormal early limb development .

Genotype-phenotype studies in three families with mutations in the polyglutamine-binding protein 1 gene ( PQBP1 ) .
Recently , the polyglutamine-binding protein 1 ( PQBP1 ) gene was found to be mutated in five of 29 families studied with X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) linked to Xp.
The reported mutations include duplications or deletions of AG dinucleotides in the fourth coding exon that resulted in shifts of the open reading frame .
Three of the five families with mutations in this newly identified XLMR gene have been reported previously .
We characterized the phenotypic and neuropsychological features in the two unpublished families with aberrations in PQBP1 and in a family reported 10 years ago .
In total , seven patients diagnosed with aberrations in this gene were examined , including a newly identified patient at 18 months of age .
Additionally , the features were compared to those reported in the literature of three other families , comprising MRXS3 ( Sutherland-Haan syndrome ) MRX55 and MRXS8 ( Renpenning syndrome ) .
Characteristics seen in these patients are <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , lean body habitus , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , striking facial appearance with long narrow faces , upward slant of the eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> malar hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prognathism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nasal speech <END> .
In addition , <START:PHENOTYPE> small testes <END> and midline defects as <START:PHENOTYPE> anal atresia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , clefting of palate and/or uvula , <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Tetralogy of Fallot <END> are seen in several patients .
These observations contribute to the phenotypic knowledge of patients with PQBP1 mutations and make this XLMR syndrome well recognizable to clinicians .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> leptodactylic form : clinical course and phenotypic variations in four patients .
We describe a 5-year-old boy and a 33-year-old woman with <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> leptodactylic form ( <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with multiple dislocations ) ( MIM 6003546 ) , and two 12-year-old girls with the disorder who were previously reported as examples of a variant of sponatrime dysplasia .
Their clinical manifestations included <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , micromelic <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> that caused multiple joint problems , including thoracolumbar <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , hip subluxation , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> genu valgum <END> with knee and patellar subluxation , elbow subluxation , and malalignment of the wrist .
Laryngotracheomalacia was present in two individuals , and myopathy was noted in one .
The radiological findings in the four individuals included mild <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> most conspicuous in infancy , narrow interpediculate distances of the lumbar spine evident in infancy , retarded epiphyseal ossification that evolved to epiphyseal dysplasia and later to degenerative joint disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal irregularities <END> and striations present in early childhood , and leptodactylic appearance ( slender short tubular bones ) of the hand .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> nocturnal frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
A distinctive clinical disorder .
The disorder of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> nocturnal frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> has recently been identified , and is now delineated in detail .
A phenotypically homogeneous group of five families from Australia , Britain and Canada , containing 47 affected individuals , was studied .
The largest family contained 25 affected individuals spanning six generations .
This disorder is characterized by clusters of brief nocturnal motor <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , with hyperkinetic or tonic manifestations .
Subjects often experienced an aura , and remained aware throughout the attacks .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> occurred in clusters ( mean eight attacks/night ) typically as the individual dozed , or shortly before awakening .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> usually began in childhood , and persisted through adult life , with considerable intra-family variation in severity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> were often misdiagnosed as benign nocturnal parasomnias , psychiatric and medical disorders .
Interictal EEG studies were unhelpful .
Ictal video-EEG studies showed that the attacks were <START:PHENOTYPE> partial seizures <END> with frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> semiology .
Neuro-imaging was normal .
Carbamazepine monotherapy was frequently effective .
This disorder showed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Recognition of this entity is clinically important for diagnosis , appropriate therapy and genetic counselling .
Moreover , this disorder now offers an opportunity to identify a gene for partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Differential contributions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes predispose women to <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
BRCA1 mutations are found in approximately 12 percent of women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> of early onset , and the specific mutation causing a deletion of adenine and guanine ( 185delAG ) , which is present in 1 percent of the Ashkenazi Jewish population , contributes to 21 percent of breast cancers among young Jewish women .
The contribution of BRCA2 mutations to <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> of early onset is unknown .
Lymphocyte specimens from 73 women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> diagnosed by the age of 32 were studied for heterozygous mutations of BRCA2 by a complementary-DNA-based protein-truncation assay , followed by automated nucleotide sequencing .
In addition , specimens from 39 Jewish women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> diagnosed by the age of 40 were tested for specific mutations by an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction .
Definite BRCA2 mutations were found in 2 of the 73 women with early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> ( 2.7 percent ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.4 to 9.6 percent ) , suggesting that BRCA2 is associated with fewer cases than BRCA1 ( P= 0.03 ) .
The specific BRCA2 mutation causing a deletion of thymine ( 6174delT) , which is found in 1.3 percent of the Ashkenazi Jewish population , was observed in 1 of the 39 young Jewish women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> ( 2.6 percent ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.09 to 13.5 percent ) , indicating that it has a small role as a risk factor for early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Among young women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , there are BRCA2 mutations that cause truncation of the extreme C terminus of the protein and that may be functionally silent , along with definite truncating mutations .
Germ-line mutations in BRCA2 contribute to fewer cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> among young women than do mutations in BRCA1 .
Carriers of BRCA2 mutations may have a smaller increase in the risk of early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Prognosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in a rural African community : a 30-year follow-up of 164 patients in an outpatient clinic in rural Tanzania .
While working as a physician in Tanzania in the early 1960s , Dr . Louise Jilek-Aall founded an outpatient clinic for <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> among the Pogoro people of Mahenge mountains where <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ( locally termed Kifafa ) had brought misery and death to an unusually high percentage of the population .
With local assistance and overseas donations of phenobarbital ( PB) , this clinic treated approximately 200 patients for less than or equal to 10 years .
The area was revisited 30 years later to trace these patients .
Of the 164 patients who had started treatment , 86 (52 .4% ) achieved complete <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> suppression , 59 ( 36. 0% ) experienced reduction in <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> frequency , 13 ( 7 .9% ) experienced no change , and in 1 ( 0.6% ) <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were worse .
The effect of treatment could not be assessed in 5 ( 3.0% ) patients .
After 30 years , only 36 ( 21.9% ) of the 164 patients were known to be alive .
Of the patients , 110 ( 67 .1% ) had died , and the whereabouts of 18 ( 11% ) could not be traced .
The causes of death were <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> related ( status epilepticus , drowning , burns , dying in or after a <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> ) in greater than 5 0 % of the patients .
Epilepsy-related deaths were proportionately higher after drug supply was stopped and among patients who were receiving drugs irregularly or who had only partial <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> control .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> showed an increased mortality rate , which was twice that of the general rural Tanzanian population of similar age .
Management of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in rural Africans should also emphasize methods to prevent epilepsy-related causes of death among patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal lymphangiectasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> , with facial anomalies and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We report on two male and two female relatives with <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal lymphangiectasia <END> ; severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> of limbs , genitalia , and face ; facial anomalies ; <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ; mild growth retardation ; and moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Main facial anomalies are a <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , small mouth , tooth anomalies , and ear defects .
Their parents are consanguineous .
This disorder probably is an hitherto undescribed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Heterogeneity <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital retinal non-attachment <END> , falciform folds and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dysplasia <END> .
A guide to genetic counselling .
The heritable falciform folds and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital retinal non-attachment <END> reported in the literature are here divided into monosymptomatic and complex types .
Of the former , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and recessive disorders are known .
The complex types comprise several syndromes , both <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> and X-linked .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinal dysplasia <END> is sometimes seen in histological sections from these affections , but it is an unspecific histological reaction , and not a disease sui generis .
Attention is drawn to the syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and falciform detachment which , though previously described , has not so far been delineated .
It is hypothesized that <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital retinal non-attachment <END> with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous constitute yet another 'new ' syndrome , mainly seen in females .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> frontotemporal <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pachygyria <END> is a cortical malformation that results from the abnormal migration of neurons .
Regions of the brain with <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> have an abnormally thick cortex that lacks normal folding and has deficient layering .
We describe three siblings , born to nonconsanguineous Mexican parents , who have bilateral frontotemporal <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> without polymicrogyria .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> is accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> esotropia <END> , and either <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> .
They are otherwise morphologically normal and do not have microcephaly .
Two experienced a single <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> in infancy .
The characteristic phenotype present in this family suggests a new genetic syndrome that is likely inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Primary biliary cirrhosis <END> associated with HLA , IL12A , and IL12RB2 variants .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Primary biliary cirrhosis <END> is a chronic granulomatous cholangitis , characteristically associated with antimitochondrial antibodies .
Twin and family aggregation data suggest that there is a significant genetic predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> , but the susceptibility loci are unknown .
To identify genetic loci conferring a risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> , we carried out a genomewide association analysis in which DNA samples from 2072 Canadian and U.S . subjects ( 536 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> and 1536 controls ) were genotyped for more than 300,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) .
Sixteen of the SNPs most strongly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> were genotyped in two independent replication sets .
We carried out fine-mapping studies across three loci associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> .
We found significant associations between <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> and 13 loci across the HLA class II region ; the HLA-DQB1 locus (encoding the major histocompatibility complex class II , DQ beta chain 1 ) had the strongest association ( P=1.78 x10( -19 ) ; odds ratio for patients vs . controls , 1.75 ) . <START:PHENOTYPE> Primary biliary cirrhosis <END> was also significantly and reproducibly associated with two SNPs at the IL12A locus (encoding interleukin-12alpha) , rs6441286 ( P=2.42x10( -14 ) ; odds ratio , 1.54 ) and rs574808 ( P=1.88x10( -13 ) ; odds ratio , 1.54 ) , and one SNP at the IL12RB2 locus (encoding interleukin-12 receptor beta2) , rs3790567 ( P=2.76 x10( -11 ) ; odds ratio , 1.51 ) . Fine-mapping analysis showed that a five-allele haplotype in the 3 ' flank of IL12A was significantly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> ( P=1 .15x10( -34) ) .
We found a modest genomewide association ( P<5. 0x10( -5) ) with the risk of disease for SNPs at the STAT4 locus (encoding signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 ) and the CTLA4 locus (encoding cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ) and 10 other loci .
Our data show significant associations between <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> and common genetic variants at the HLA class II , IL12A , and IL12RB2 loci and suggest that the interleukin-12 immunoregulatory signaling axis is relevant to the pathophysiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> .

Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> in the Japanese population is frequently located at the cardiac region .
The clinical features of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> are still unknown .
To approach this question , we investigated the clinicopathological characteristics of 16 cases of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> .
In this study the criteria used to define familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> was the existence of three or more family members with <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> in at least two successive generations .
The clinicopathological characteristics of cases who fulfilled this criteria were studied .
This study contained 16 familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> probands .
Seven cases ( 44% ) of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> had developed at the cardiac region of the stomach .
This frequency was significantly higher than for <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> in the general population in Japan ( 15 .4% , p < 0.01 ) .
Undifferentiated types were dominant in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> ( 69% , p < 0.05 ) .
Furthermore , the frequency of disseminated peritoneal (40% ) and liver metastases (20% ) in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> was also significantly higher than for <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> in the general population in Japan (1 0 .9% , p < 0.01 , and 4.4% , p < 0.05 , respectively ) .
Familial gastric cancers were frequently located at the cardiac region and appeared to be more aggressive than sporadic gastric cancers .
The unique characteristics of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> suggest a genetic background in their etiology .
The Hunter-MacDonald syndrome with expanded phenotype including risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> meningioma <END> : an update and review .
Hunter-MacDonald syndrome ( HMS ) is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> skeletal dysplasia with multiple malformations .
The skeletal manifestations of HMS include <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epiphyseal dysplasia <END> with early osteoarthritis leading to joint replacement , prominent humeral insertions for the deltoids , <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , subluxation of the thumbs , and malformed feet .
Craniofacial manifestations include normal head circumference , tall forehead , <START:PHENOTYPE> bitemporal narrowing <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> .
Decreased hearing acuity , transient <START:PHENOTYPE> cranial nerve palsies <END> , congenital heart defects , and <START:PHENOTYPE> meningioma <END> are also reported .
Herein , we present two cases , and , through review of the manifestations of HMS in affected and at-risk family members , we have observed that predisposition to brain tumor is a cardinal feature of this condition .

Homozygous frameshift mutation in TMCO1 causes a syndrome with craniofacial dysmorphism , skeletal anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We identified an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition in 11 individuals in the Old Order Amish of northeastern Ohio .
The syndrome was characterized by distinctive craniofacial dysmorphism , skeletal anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The typical craniofacial dysmorphism included <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , highly arched <START:PHENOTYPE> bushy eyebrows <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long eyelashes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , microdontism of primary teeth , and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> , whereas <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel deformity <END> of scapula , fusion of spine , rib abnormities , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pes planus <END> represented skeletal anomalies .
The genome-wide homozygosity mapping using six affected individuals localized the disease gene to a 3.3-Mb region on chromosome 1q23.3-q24.1 .
Candidate gene sequencing identified a homozygous frameshift mutation , c.139_140delAG , in the transmembrane and coiled-coil domains 1 ( TM CO1 ) gene , as the pathogenic change in all affected members of the extended pedigree .
This mutation is predicted to result in a severely truncated protein ( p.Ser47Ter ) of only one-fourth the original length .
The TMCO1 gene product is a member of DUF841 superfamily of several eukaryotic proteins with unknown function .
The gene has highly conserved amino acid sequence and is universally expressed in all human tissues examined .
The high degree of conservation and the ubiquitous expression pattern in human adult and fetal tissues suggest a critical role for TM CO1 .
This report shows a TMCO1 sequence variant being associated with a genetic disorder in human .
We propose " TM CO1 defect syndrome " as the name of this condition .
Coloboma , congenital heart disease , and <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> with multiple anomalies : CHARGE association .
We report 21 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> or ocular coloboma or both who have certain other associated anomalies , including congenital heart disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth deficiency <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and/or CNS anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphallus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and ear anomalies and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Facial palsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> swallowing difficulties <END> were also common .
It has not been possible to define a single etiology or a syndrome in these patients .
We propose the mnemonic CHARGE ( C-coloboma , H-heart disease , A-atresia choanae , R-retarded growth and retarded development and/or CNS anomalies , G-genital hypoplasia , and E-ear anomalies and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> ) to describe the features of this association .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> enteropathy <END> with villous <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> and immunoglobulin G2 subclass deficiency .
We describe a familial form of recurrent acute , life-threatening secretory <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> associated with distinctive jejunal histologic changes and IgG2 subclass deficiency .
Symptoms begin abruptly with <START:PHENOTYPE> anorexia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , and progress within hours to massive secretory <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> and shock with profound <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoproteinemia <END> , including <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> and hypogammaglobulinemia .
Affected survivors recover quickly and thereafter grow and develop normally .
Biopsy specimens obtained during remission from 3 adults and 11 children show club-shaped jejunal villi broadened by <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> and histiocytes with imbibed fluid ; the overlying intestinal epithelium and brush border appear normal , but the basement membrane is interrupted in some areas .
No characteristic microorganisms have been identified in association with the syndrome .
Clinical manifestations cease in the second decade , but the abnormal jejunal histologic pattern persists into adult life .
Female and male patients are equally affected , although all fatal cases have been in female subjects .
Inheritance appears dominant with variable penetrance : one family member without a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> has characteristic biopsy findings and another appears to be an obligate carrier with normal biopsy findings .
Affected individuals have a reduced serum concentration of IgG2 .
We believe that this familial <START:PHENOTYPE> enteropathy <END> is a unique entity , not previously described .
CblE type of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> due to methionine synthase reductase deficiency : clinical and molecular studies and prenatal diagnosis in two families .
The cblE type of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder , which manifests with megaloblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay in early childhood <END> .
This disease is caused by a defect in reductive activation of methionine synthase ( MTR ) .
Our study was directed at clinical , biochemical , enzymatic and molecular characterization of two Czech patients with the cblE type of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> .
Case 1 involves a 20-year-old mentally retarded patient who presented with megaloblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> at 10 weeks of age .
She was treated with folates and vitamin B12 , and subsequent attempts to cease administration of folates led to recurrence of megaloblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> .
Biochemical features included severe hyperhomocysteinaemia and hypomethioninaemia and in fibroblasts defective formation of methionine from formate , and no complementation with cblE cells .
Subsequent molecular analysis of the methionine synthase reductase ( MTRR ) gene revealed compound heterozygosity for a transition c.1459 G>A ( G487R ) and a 2bp insertion ( c.1623-1624ins TA ) .
Case 2 involves an 8-year-old girl with <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> in whom megaloblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> was detected at 11 weeks of age .
Severe hyperhomocysteinaemia with normal methionine levels was found and enzymatic and complementation studies confirmed the cblE defect .
This patient is homozygous for a 140 bp insertion ( c.903-904ins140 ) .
The insertion is caused by a T> C transition within intron 6 of the MTRR gene , which presumably leads to activation of an exon splicing enhancer .
In the families of both patients , enzymatic and mutation analyses were successfully used for prenatal diagnosis .
Our study expands the knowledge of the phenotypic and genotypic variability of the cblE type of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> and supports the concept that this disorder is caused by mutations in the MTRR gene .
Fryns syndrome : two further cases without lateral diaphragmatic defects .
We report on two unrelated infants with Fryns syndrome but without lateral diaphragmatic defects .
In case 1 , a female <START:PHENOTYPE> stillborn <END> , pertinent findings included a <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse facies <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> with a broad pterygium , heart defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> lung hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , urogenital malformations , <START:PHENOTYPE> anal atresia <END> , and distal digital hypoplasia .
Case 2 showed a <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse facies <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate , para-oesophageal hernia with herniation of the stomach into the thoracic cavity , <START:PHENOTYPE> malrotation <END> of the intestine , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> anal atresia <END> .
At age 14 months she was developmentally severely retarded .
These observations represent the 11th and 12th reports of probable Fryns syndrome without lateral diaphragmatic defect .
Teebi <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> syndrome : report of a family with previously unrecognized findings .
We present a family consisting of a mother , a daughter , and a son with Teebi <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> syndrome , including some previously unrecognized manifestations .
The clinical findings include a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arched eyebrows <END> , pronounced <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , mild interdigital webbing , fifth-finger clinodactyly , umbilical anomalies , and hypotonia .
The mother and daughter also had <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> requiring surgical correction .
The daughter has bilateral iridochorioretinal colobomas with high hyperopia and a small <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> .
The son has less striking facial features but was born with a small <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , large ASD secundum , PDA , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> right hydronephrosis , and a cystic left kidney .
The mother had an <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> requiring surgical correction as a child and a history of heart murmur .
Both children have normal hearing and mild developmental delay .
Their high-resolution karyotypes were normal and the FISH for 22q11 microdeletion was negative in the daughter .
We conclude that cardiac defects in Teebi <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> syndrome are not rare findings and that eye colobomas and renal anomalies were previously unrecognized .

Variable genotype of Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> patients .
Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> is caused by a single nucleotide change in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> deoxyribonucleic acid ( mtDNA ) .
Each cell contains thousands of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA molecules .
We demonstrated that in certain isolated instances , the proband and close maternal lineage relatives can have mixtures of mutant and normal <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA molecules ( heteroplasmy ) .
The proportion of mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA molecules was found to shift markedly across generations and within the tissues of an individual .
One unaffected mother had 65 % mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA molecules whereas her affected son had essentially 100% mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA molecules .
Two affected individuals had predominantly mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA in their blood , but significant normal <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA in their hair .
The demonstration of heteroplasmy within maternal lineages and affected individuals means that the successful determination of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA genotype of a family or patient with Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> requires testing of more than one family member and more than one tissue from each individual .
Localization of a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> locus ( LAH3 ) to chromosome 13q14 .11-q21.32 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> is a rare form of alopecia characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> on scalp , sparse to absent eyebrows and eyelashes , and sparse auxiliary and body hair .
Previously , for this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> , two loci LAH ( localized hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> ) and AH ( <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> ) have been mapped on chromosome 18q12 .1 and 3q27.2 , respectively .
In the study presented here , we report the localization of a third locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> in two large Pakistani families .
The patients in the two families exhibited typical features of the hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> .
Genome scan using polymorphic microsatellite markers mapped the gene on chromosome 13q14 .11-q21.32 .
A maximum combined two-point logarithm of odds ( LOD ) score of 4.79 at theta= 0.0 was obtained for several markers .
Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in a maximum LOD score of 5 .9 , which further supports the linkage .
Haplotype analysis defined the linkage interval of 17 .35 cM flanked by markers D13S325 and D13S1231 according to the Rutgers combined linkage -physical map.
This region contains 24.41 Mb according to the build 36 of the human genome sequence-based physical map.
Frequency analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxias in Japanese patients and clinical characterization of spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 6 . Using a molecular diagnostic approach , we investigated 101 kindreds with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxias ( ADCAs ) from the central Honshu island of Japan , including spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 1 ( SCA1 ) , spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 2 ( SCA2 ) , Machado-Joseph disease ( MJD) , dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy ( DRPLA ) and spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 6 ( SCA6 ) .
In our unselected series , MJD was the most common type of ADCA , accounting for 33.7% followed by DRPLA ( 19.8% ) , SCA2 ( 5 .9% ) and SCA6 ( 5 .9% ) .
No SCA1 mutations were identified .
We analysed the clinical features of six molecular confirmed SCA6 kindreds : in each family , there was an expanded allele in the alpha1A-voltage dependent calcium channel comprising between 23 and 25 CAG repeats .
The mean age at onset of symptoms was 43+ /-13 years .
The clinical features consisted predominantly of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and horizontal <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , which was generally consistent with ADCA type 3 . However several new clinical features were found in some patients : dramatic anticipation , rapid disease progression , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> action tremor <END> or action <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , and very early onset , which are not described as the classical features of ADCA type 3 .
Clinical variability in a Noonan syndrome family with a new PTPN11 gene mutation .
Noonan syndrome ( NS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , facial dysmorphism , short and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> webbed neck <END> , heart defects , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> in males .
The gene responsible for the disorder ( PTP N11 ) was recently identified , and explains 30-5 0 % of the cases clinically diagnosed as NS . Cardiofaciocutaneous ( CFC ) syndrome , a similar but distinct entity , is characterized by relative macrocephaly , characteristic facial appearance , ectodermal abnormalities ( sparse and friable hair , sparse eyebrows , hyperkeratotic skin) , congenital heart defects , and growth and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We describe on a young woman who presents clinical features of NS ( <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> triangular facies <END> , with <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> and apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> webbed neck <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary stenosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bleeding diathesis <END> , prominent corneal nerves) , but with a more prominent ectodermal involvement ( sparse and very coarse hair , sparse eyebrows and eyelashes ) and developmental delay/mental retardation , which are characteristic of CFC patients .
Sequencing of the PTPN11 gene showed a T411M substitution , not previously described in patients with NS .
The same mutation was found in her mother and older sister , not initially considered to be affected by NS , but with very subtle clinical findings compatible with this diagnosis .
Molecular dynamic studies indicate that this new mutation , similar to other previously described mutations , favors a more active protein conformation .
However , the main disruptive effect is not directly in the catalytic domain , suggesting that the location of this mutation could make the protein more susceptible to gene-gene or gene-environment interactions .
Atypical cases of NS should be screened for mutations in the PTPN11 gene and in the case of a positive result , first-degree relatives should also be tested for the specific mutation .
The distal arthrogryposes : delineation of new entities--review and nosologic discussion .
We report on 44 patients ( 18 with additional affected family members ) , with congenital distal limb contractures identified from a large study of over 350 patients with congenital joint contractures .
Fourteen propositi ( seven familial cases , seven isolated cases ) had a newly recognized form of arthrogryposis , which we have designated <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> type 1 , with the predominant manifestations of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> ; tightly clenched fists at birth , with medially overlapping fingers , ulnar deviation , and camptodactyly in adults ; and positional foot deformities .
Contractures at other major joints are variable .
There are no associated visceral anomalies ; intelligence is normal .
There can be marked intrafamilial and interfamilial variability .
Twenty-two propositi with similar distal contractures had additional findings and were classified into five subcategories of <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> ( type IIA-E ) .
Among type II patients <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , cleft lip , small tongue , <START:PHENOTYPE> trismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthal folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , a unique hand position , and dull normal intelligence were seen .
These characteristics were seen in various combinations and patterns and allowed sorting into groups that were the basis for the categorization .
The remaining eight propositi were recognized to have previously described conditions with distal contractures and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> , ie , the Freeman-Sheldon syndrome , trismus-pseudo-camptodactyly syndrome , congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , and familial camptodactyly .
Pathogenetically we postulate similar underlying defects of abnormal tendon attachments , attenuation , and absence ; careful nosologic comparisons are important for prognostic counseling and habilitative management .
Association of tumor necrosis factor polymorphisms with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and serum total IgE . Tumor necrosis factors ( TN F ; TNFA and TN FB ) are major pro-inflammatory cytokines that are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
However , the functions of genetic polymorphisms in these cytokines have not been thoroughly examined in the context of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> pathology .
In an effort to discover polymorphism(s ) in genes whose variant(s ) have been implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> phenotypes , we examined the genetic effects of TNF ( TN FA and TN FB ) polymorphisms on <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and total serum IgE level .
Seven common single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) in TNF genes were genotyped in a Korean <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> cohort ( asthmatics n=55 0 , normal controls n=171 ) .
Six common haplotypes could be constructed in the TNF gene cluster due to very strong LD between TNFA and TN FB , located 13 kb apart on chromosome 6p21 .
One SNP ( TN FA-308G>A ) showed a significant association with the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( P= 0.0004 ) .
The frequency of TN FA-308 A allele-containing genotype in asthmatics ( 9.8% ) was much lower than that in normal controls ( 22.9% ) .
The protective effects of this polymorphism on <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> were also evident in separated subgroups by atopic status ( P= 0.05 in non-atopic subjects and P= 0.003 in atopic subjects ) .
The most common haplotype of the TNF gene ( TN F-ht1[ GGTC CGG] ) was associated with total serum IgE ( immunoglobulin E ) levels in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> patients , especially in non-atopic patients ( P= 0.004 ) .
Genetic variants of TNF might be involved in development of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and total serum IgE level in <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchial asthma <END> patients .
The results of this study could be helpful to understand the function of important TNF genes in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and IgE production .
Prevalence and characteristics of foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> without macular hole in <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> .
To report the prevalence of foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> without macular hole in a large number of highly myopic eyes using optical coherence tomography ( OCT) , and to clarify the demographic characteristics associated with foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> in these eyes .
A consecutive , prospective , observational case series .
In 134 eyes of 78 consecutive patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> ( refractive error of -8 diopters or more ) , we performed complete ophthalmic examinations and studied cross-sectional images of the macula with OCT.
The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence ( group 1 , n = 78 eyes of 45 patients ) or absence ( group 2 , n = 56 eyes of 33 patients ) of posterior staphyloma .
Slit-lamp examination with a Goldmann three-mirror lens indicated that none of the eyes had a macular hole .
In seven of 78 eyes ( 9. 0% ) with posterior staphyloma ( group 1 ) , OCT revealed foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> .
Two of the seven eyes had foveal retinoschisis .
Optical coherence tomography revealed no <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> or retinoschisis in any eye without posterior staphyloma ( group 2 ) . Visual acuity of the seven eyes with foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> ranged from 20/40 to 20/200 .
Two of the seven eyes had visual acuity 20/5 0 or better .
No patients complained of recent , progressive visual impairment .
All seven eyes with foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> had severe myopic fundus changes ( focal chorioretinal atrophy or bare sclera ) .
In highly myopic eyes with posterior staphyloma , the prevalence of foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> without macular hole was 9. 0% .
In eyes with this type of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> , visual acuity varies and foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> tends to be missed on routine examination .
Periodic examination using OCT is recommended for highly myopic eyes with severe myopic degenerative changes and posterior staphyloma .

Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> .
We describe the first cases of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> , a disorder in which capillaries in the lungs proliferate .
Three siblings died from <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> .
One developed pulmonary congestion preterminally after vasodilator treatment .
The inheritance pattern seems <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
Lung specimens obtained in two siblings showed extensive <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> , with normal capillaries proliferating into veins and alveoli .
Including our patients , four of the nine patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> have presented with the clinical picture of <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> .
Thus , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> should be considered as a histologic pattern of <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> .
Most other cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> have been similar to pulmonary veno-occlusive disease .
Recently , disorders involving the proliferation of cytologically normal capillaries have been termed angiogenic diseases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> may be an angiogenic disease .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> and endosteal sclerosis : a newly recognized syndrome .
We describe a brother and sister and an unrelated boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cerebellar hypoplasia <END> and endosteal sclerosis .
All 3 children presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and were found to have <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hip dislocation <END> .
A previously published case is reviewed .
The disorder appears to represent a newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
Alpha-mannosidosis .
Alpha-mannosidosis is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder characterized by immune deficiency , facial and skeletal abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> .
It occurs in approximately 1 of 500,000 live births .
The children are often born apparently normal , and their condition worsens progressively .
Some children are born with ankle equinus or develop hydrocephalus in the first year of life .
Main features are immune deficiency ( manifested by recurrent infections , especially in the first decade of life) , skeletal abnormalities ( mild-to-moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> dysostosis multiplex <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> and deformation of the sternum) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> ( moderate-to-severe sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> ) , gradual impairment of mental functions and speech , and often , periods of psychosis .
Associated motor function disturbances include muscular weakness , joint abnormalities and ataxia .
The facial trait include <START:PHENOTYPE> large head <END> with prominent forehead , rounded eyebrows , <START:PHENOTYPE> flattened nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macroglossia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> widely spaced teeth <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> prognathism <END> .
Slight strabismus is common .
The clinical variability is significant , representing a continuum in severity .
The disorder is caused by lysosomal alpha-mannosidase deficiency .
Alpha-mannosidosis is inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> fashion and is caused by mutations in the MAN2B1 gene located on chromosome 19 ( 19 p13.2-q12 ) .
Diagnosis is made by measuring acid alpha-mannosidase activity in leukocytes or other nucleated cells and can be confirmed by genetic testing .
Elevated urinary secretion of mannose-rich oligosaccharides is suggestive , but not diagnostic .
Differential diagnoses are mainly the other lysosomal storage diseases like the mucopolysaccharidoses .
Genetic counseling should be given to explain the nature of the disease and to detect carriers .
Antenatal diagnosis is possible , based on both biochemical and genetic methods .
The management should be pro-active , preventing complications and treating manifestations .
Infections must be treated frequently .
Otolaryngological treatment of fluid in the middle ear is often required and use of hearing aids is invariably required .
Early educational intervention for development of social skills is needed and physiotherapy is important to improve bodily function .
Orthopedic surgery may be necessary .
The long-term prognosis is poor .
There is an insidiously slow progression of neuromuscular and skeletal deterioration over several decades , making most patients wheel-chair dependent .
No patients manage to be completely socially independent .
Many patients are over 50 years of age .
Phenotypic overlap of the BBB and G syndromes .
Three males with similar malformations including <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , have been evaluated .
One also had a laryngotracheoesophageal cleft and therefore was considered to have the G syndrome .
The other two had no stridor , <START:PHENOTYPE> aspiration <END> , or difficulty swallowing , and were considered to have the BBB syndrome .
Both disorders are associated with multiple malformations and can be most readily distinguished by the presence of laryngoesophageal abnormalities in the G syndrome and differences in facial features evident later in childhood .
The BBB syndrome appears to be inherited as an X-linked disorder with the affected female showing only <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> .
The G syndrome exhibits <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> with males more severely affected , although a few few females have had serious malformations in addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> .
In the family with the G syndrome evaluated for this report , the mother of the affected infant had <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and anosmia , the latter a feature not previously noted in this disorder .
The Gardner-Silengo-Wachtel or genito-palato-cardiac syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> male pseudohermaphroditism <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and conotruncal cardiac defect .
We report on two sib fetuses with similar abnormalities detected prenatally by ultrasound .
The first fetus had <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , was without <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and had <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> double outlet right ventricle <END> with a <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , and 46 , XY gonadal dysgenesis .
The second sib fetus was born with cleft lip and palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , transposition of the great vessels , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , a right-sided aorta arch , and bilateral cystic kidneys with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> .
We were able to identify 11 additional cases in the literature with similar findings .
We think this set of defects is a recognizable syndrome that appears to be inherited either as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> or as an X-linked recessive and may overlap with the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome .
Case report and delineation of the congenital hypothalamic hamartoblastoma syndrome ( Pallister-Hall syndrome ) .
We report one new case of congenital hypothalamic hamartoblastoma syndrome ( Pallister-Hall syndrome ) and one case of a diencephalic nodule associated with craniofacial malformations .
Based on a review of 11 cases of Pallister-Hall syndrome documented by pathological examination , two cases presumed by phenotype , three cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothalamic hamartoma <END> with craniofacial anomalies only , and several cases of related interest , we delineate the clinical , neuroradiologic , and neuropathologic manifestations which aid in differential diagnosis .
Clinical manifestations in infants with Pallister-Hall syndrome included postaxial polydactyly with <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> , apparently low-set , posteriorly angulated ears , kidney and lung anomalies , congenital heart defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> with undescended or <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic testes <END> in males .
These manifestations were associated with varying degrees of <START:PHENOTYPE> panhypopituitarism <END> and pituitary aplasia .
In three cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothalamic hamartoma <END> associated with craniofacial anomalies only , the face resembled that of <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> . Other cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothalamic hamartoma <END> have had associated palate or heart defects or presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> precocious puberty <END> .
Of the infants with a hypothalamic hamartoblastoma at autopsy , neuropathologic findings were consistent with a primitive neuroectodermal tumor .
Surgical tissue from our sole survivor suggested such tumors might mature , and the tumor has not recurred .
Neuroradiologic diagnosis may be difficult but should be attempted in infants with these clinical manifestations ; due to the need for prompt initiation of appropriate therapy .
SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> syndrome , premature centromere separation , and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cranial nerve paralysis <END> in two sisters , one with malignant melanoma .
Two middle age sisters had most manifestations of the SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> syndrome including <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> , symmetric limb deficiencies with <START:PHENOTYPE> radial aplasia <END> and absent thumbs , facial anomalies with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nasal alae <END> , and borderline to mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Unusual findings included congenital paralysis of some cranial nerves in both patients and malignant melanoma in the proposita .
Cultured lymphocytes from both patients , and skin fibroblasts , Epstein Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes , and tumor cells from the proposita demonstrated <START:PHENOTYPE> premature separation of centromeric heterochromatin <END> ( PCS ) of many chromosomes , a finding noted previously in the SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> syndrome and the similar but more severe Roberts syndrome .
Extensive overlap of the phenotypes of the sisters and 15 other patients with either syndrome and PCS confirms that these are either allelic conditions or the same disease--designated Roberts-SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> syndrome .
The role of PCS in the syndrome(s ) remains uncertain since some patients with the characteristic clinical phenotypes are reported to lack it .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperekplexia <END> : pedigree studies in two families .
We report on 2 unrelated Japanese families , each with several individuals affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperekplexia <END> , a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> exaggerated startle response <END> of neonatal onset .
In the first family , affected relatives included a 4-week-old boy , his mother , grandmother , a maternal uncle , and 2 maternal cousins .
In the second family , affected were a 4-week-old boy , his father , and an elder brother .
These 9 individuals had various combinations of transient infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertonia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokinesia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> exaggerated startle response <END> with falling episodes , nocturnal <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and an easily elicited head retraction reflex , <START:PHENOTYPE> hip dislocation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> .
Treatment with clonazepam was effective in relieving these manifestations in the affected infants and children .
Genetic analysis of these 2 families and 4 others in the literature suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> with considerable variability but complete penetrance .
Another 3 families in the literature were reported , suggesting the existence of startle disorder with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
A sporadic case is also known , presumably representing a fresh mutation of a dominantly inherited trait .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> : clinical heterogeneity at a single gene locus .
X-linked hydrocephalus-stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius sequence ( H-SAS , MIM number 30007 ) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We confirm here the localisation of the mutant gene on Xq ( Xq 2.8 ) by linkage analysis in a 5-generation pedigree ( maximum lod score of Z = 4.57 at theta = 0.04 with probe St14 at locus DXS52 ) and emphasise the phenotypic variability of the disease .
Ventricular dilatation in affected males was either severe and diagnosed antenatally or moderate and consistent with a long survival with little or no <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> .
Since other X-linked syndromes of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> and flexion deformities of the thumbs have previously been shown to map to the Xq 2.8 region as well ( e.g . MASA syndrome and spastic paraplegia) , the present results raise the question of whether H-SAS syndrome , MASA syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> might represent different phenotypic expression of various mutations at the same locus .
Long-term outcome in Desbuquois dysplasia : a follow-up in four adult patients .
Desbuquois dysplasia is a rare chondrodysplasia characterized by short stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> , and specific radiographic findings .
We report the natural history of four patients ( three boys and one girl ) with Desbuquois dysplasia ages 16-22 years .
The mean height in adulthood was 114 cm ( -8.5 SD ) with progressive deceleration of the growth curve from birth ( -4 SD ) to adulthood .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> was noted consistently and facial abnormalities were still present but less obvious than in childhood .
Three of four patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> of varying degree .
Hyperlaxity was persistent but limited motion of various joints was also noted .
Orthopedic complications included <START:PHENOTYPE> coxa vara <END> or valga ( 3/4) , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ( 3/4) , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> lordosis <END> ( 3/4) , and ambulatory difficulties ( 3/4 ) .
Surgical treatment was necessary for all four patients , involving large joints , spine and hands . Other complications included acute open-angle glaucoma secondary to a congenital malformation of the angle in one case .
In addition to consistent radiological findings , elevated greater trochanter , <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized osteoporosis <END> especially of the spine , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> lordosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> wide metaphyses <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat epiphyses <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> coxa vara <END> or valga were part of the natural history of the disorder .
Our study emphasizes the care of older patients with Desbuquois dysplasia .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Nonprogressive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> maps to chromosome 9q34-9qter in a large consanguineous Lebanese family .
Congenital ataxias are a heterogeneous group of predominantly <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive <END> disorders characterized by hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> followed by the appearance of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and often associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and atrophy of the cerebellum .
We performed a genome-wide screen on a large inbred Lebanese family presenting a <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> ( MIM 213200) , already described by MÃ©garbanÃ© and colleagues .
The disease locus was assigned to a 12 .1 cM interval on chromosome 9q34-9qter between D9S67 and D9S312 .
Differential diagnosis with other hereditary ataxias linked to the same region is discussed .
Muscle excitability abnormalities in Machado-Joseph disease . To estimate the frequency of and to characterize muscle excitability abnormalities in Machado-Joseph disease ( MJD ) .
Machado-Joseph disease is a common <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> caused by an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Muscle cramps <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> are frequent and sometimes disabling manifestations .
However , their frequency and pathophysiological mechanisms remain largely unknown .
Symptomatic patients with MJD ( hereinafter MJD patients ) with molecular confirmation were assessed prospectively .
A standard questionnaire addressing clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle cramps <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> was used .
The Cramps Disability Scale was used to quantify cramps-related disability .
Patients underwent neurophysiological testing with routine techniques .
F waves of the right median nerves were obtained , and persistence indexes were calculated .
Four muscles (deltoid , first dorsal interossei , tibialis anterior , and vastus lateralis ) were examined by needle electromyography.
A semiquantitative scale ( from 0 [no activity ] to 4 [continuous activity] ) was used to determine the frequency of rest <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> in each muscle .
Fifty MJD patients ( 29 men ) were included in the study .
Their mean age at examination was 46 .3 years , their mean age at onset of the disease was 35 years , and the mean duration of disease was 11 .2 years .
Abnormal CAG(n ) varied from 59 to 75 repeats .
Forty-one patients presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle cramps <END> ; in 10 , this was their first symptom .
The frequency of cramps varied between 1 and 90 episodes a week .
For 15 patients , cramps were the chief complaint , frequently disturbing sleep or work ( Cramps Disability Scale score , 2 or 3 ) . Lower limbs were affected in 37 individuals , but unusual regions , such as the face and abdominal muscles , were also involved .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Fasciculations <END> were found in 25 individuals ; in 8 patients , they included facial muscles .
However , <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> were not a significant complaint for any of these patients .
The clinical and neurophysiological profile of MJD patients with and without cramps was not significantly different .
However , MJD patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> had more severe damage to their peripheral nerves .
Muscle excitability abnormalities were found in 41 MJD patients ( 82%) , and they were the presenting complaint in 10 (20% ) .
They are related to altered excitability of peripheral motor axons , but mechanisms underlying cramps and <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> are possibly distinct in MJD patients .
Delineation of the male phenotype in carniofrontonasal syndrome .
We are reporting on a 4-generation family in which 6 individuals had frontonasal dysplasia with variable extracranial abnormalities .
All affected persons had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , bifid or broad nose , and highly arched palate .
Associated abnormalities included <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate ( 1/6 ) , webbed neck ( 2/6 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel anomaly <END> ( 2/6 ) , pseudoarthrosis of the clavicle ( 2/6 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> ( 3/6 ) , narrow , <START:PHENOTYPE> sloping shoulders <END> ( 3/6 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> ( 2/6 ) , broad first toe ( 4/6 ) , brachydactyly ( 3/6 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> fifth finger clinodactyly <END> ( 5/6 ) , longitudinal grooves of nails ( 5/6 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> shawl scrotum <END> ( 2/3 males) , first degree <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> ( 1/3) , and mild mental retardation ( 1/6 ) .
Only one affected female had <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> and right coronal synostosis .
Four other affected relatives had varying degrees of <START:PHENOTYPE> facial asymmetry <END> , but normal skull contour .
No male to male transmission is observed , and both daughters of an affected male were affected .
Based on the phenotype of the 3 affected females , craniofrontonasal syndrome ( CFNS ) is the likely diagnosis .
However , there are 3 affected males in this kindred , and 2 of the 3 had significant anomalies .
Affected males also had genital abnormalities and pectus deformity of the chest , not previously reported in this condition .
Two of the 3 males have posterolateral <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> .
This family expands the phenotype of affected males .
A population genetic study of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
We present epidemiological data for 5197 families with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
Errors in reporting have been analysed .
Analysis of the data provides indications of random mating with respect to whether the partner has the skin disease or not . Data on <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> among parents , siblings and children are provided , and particular attention has been paid to the age at onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Psoriasis <END> was present in the parents of about 36 % of the probands .
In families in which one or both parents have <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> , the occurrence of the disease among the siblings does not provide any information which differentiates between a dominant and recessive mode of inheritance , but is compatible with both .
In families in which neither parent had <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> , provided there was a proband with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> , the probability of the siblings suffering from <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> was close to 0.25 , indicating a recessive mode of inheritance .
The distribution of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> among the parents of all probands , and among the children of probands , was also compatible with this mode of inheritance .
The prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> in the elderly was estimated to be about 5% , and the gene frequency in the whole population 25% .
These findings show that , with regard to first-degree relatives , the inheritance of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> can fit an autosomal recessive model .
The concept of a recessive mode of inheritance may be used as a basis for genetic counselling .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly in a unique Turkish kindred maps to human chromosome 12 .
Finding genes that cause human <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> is not straightforward , since the determinants of blood pressure in primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> are multifactorial .
One approach to identifying relevant genes is to elucidate rare forms of monogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
A relevant mutation may provide a rational starting point from which to analyse the pathophysiology of a condition affecting 20% of the world 's population .
In 1973 a family with autosomal dominantly inherited brachydactyly and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , where the two traits cosegregated completely , was described .
We have now re-examined this kindred , and localized the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly locus to chromosome 12p in a region defined by markers D12S364 and D12S87 .
As the renin-angiotensin-system and sympathetic nervous system respond normally in this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , the condition resembles essential <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
This feature distinguishes this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> from glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism and Liddle 's syndrome , which are salt-sensitive forms of monogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> with very low plasma renin activity .
We suggest that identification of the gene involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly and its mutation will be of great relevance in elucidating new mechanisms leading to blood pressure elevation .
Autosomal dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> with elevated serum 1 ,25 dihydroxyvitamin D and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
A 14-year-old boy presented with the clinical and radiological features of <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> .
Serum inorganic phosphate levels were constantly low , whereas serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were within the normal range .
Laboratory investigation did not show any evidence for vitamin-D deficiency , chronic renal insufficiency , Fanconi syndrome , tubular acidosis , hepatic disease or intestinal malabsorption .
A family study comprising 34 members over four generations revealed 10 other individuals to be affected and the mode of inheritance to be autosomal dominant .
In addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> and normocalcaemia , the disease is characterized by elevated serum 1 ,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
This hereditary syndrome of renal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> differs from the common familial X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> and the recently described <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hypophosphataemic <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> by its dominant mode of inheritance ; it differs from hypophosphataemic non-rachitic bone disease by the elevated serum 1 ,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
The desmosterolosis phenotype : <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> with agenesis of corpus callosum and loss of white matter .
Desmosterolosis is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder of elevated levels of the cholesterol precursor desmosterol in plasma , tissue and cultured cells .
With only two sporadic cases described to date with two very different phenotypes , the clinical entity arising from mutations in 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase ( DHCR24) has yet to be defined .
We now describe consanguineous Bedouin kindred with four surviving affected individuals , all presenting with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> with variable degree of hand contractures .
Convulsions near birth , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> were found in most .
Brain MRI demonstrated significant reduction in white matter and near agenesis of corpus callosum in all .
Genome-wide linkage analysis and fine mapping defined a 6.75 cM disease-associated locus in chromosome 1 ( maximum multipoint LOD score of six) , and sequencing of candidate genes within this locus identified in the affected individuals a homozygous missense mutation in DHCR24 leading to dramatically augmented plasma desmosterol levels .
We thus establish a clear consistent phenotype of desmosterolosis ( MIM 602398 ) .
Genetic aspects of early childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
Eighty-seven families with early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> were evaluated .
These were divided into 3 groups : resolving infantile idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ( 15 families) , progressive infantile idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ( 21 families) , and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> due to vertebral malformations ( 51 families ) .
The children with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> were subdivided into those who had closed neural arch defects ( 19 families ) and those who did not (32 families ) .
Resolving infantile idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> was usually associated with plagiocephaly , and both deformations tended to show spontaneous recovery .
These children were otherwise normal .
Seven ( 33% ) of the children with progressive infantile idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> were mentally retarded , but only 2 had a congenital malformation .
In contrast , 18 ( 33% ) of the children with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> had other malformations , but only 2 were mentally retarded .
The recurrence risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> was low in each group studied .
However , there was an increased risk ( 4% for sibs ) of neural tube defects in the families with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ( with or without neural arch defects ) .
This sib risk was apparent for probands with only a single hemivertebrum in addition to probands with more extensive vertebral defects and would support an etiological relationship between neural tube defects and other vertebral malformations .
Delineation of an estimated 6.7 MB candidate interval for an <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> gene at 3q26.33-q28 and description of the syndrome associated with visible chromosome deletions of this region .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Anophthalmia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> occur in approximately one in 10 children who have severe <START:PHENOTYPE> visual impairment <END> .
These eye malformations are often of unknown aetiology , but can be inherited in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> , recessive or X-linked forms , and can also occur in association with specific chromosome abnormalities .
Four children are described in the medical literature with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> in association with chromosome rearrangements involving distal 3q , suggesting the presence of a micro/anophthalmia gene in this region .
We have identified two further patients with micro/anophthalmia and chromosome rearrangements involving 3q26-->3q27 and identified a 6.7 MB common deleted region .
Patient 1 had multiple abnormalities including bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> , abnormalities of the first and second cranial nerves and partial absence of the corpus callosum .
His karyotype was 46 , XY,del(3 ) (q26.33q28 ) .
Patient 2 had right <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> and left extreme <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> .
Her karyotype was 46 , XX,del(3 ) (q26.33q28)t(3;7 ) (q28;q21.1 ) .
Both patients had intrauterine growth retardation ( IUGR ) and strikingly similar dysmorphic facies consisting of bossed forehead , downward-slanting palpebral fissures , grooved bridge of the nose , prominent low-set ears , small down-turned mouth and small mandible .
We identified BAC clones mapping to distal 3q from the ENSEMBL and NCBI Entrez databases .
These BAC clones were used as fluorescence in situ hybridisation ( FISH ) probes to identify the minimum deleted region common to both patients .
This interval , between clones RPC11 -134F2 and RPC11 -132N15 , was estimated to be 6.7 MB .
We conclude that there is an <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> locus within this interval .
Candidate genes mapping to this region include Chordin and DVL3 , a homologue of the Drosophila Dishevelled gene .
Germ-line BRCA1 mutations in Jewish and non-Jewish women with early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Mutations in a germ-line allele of the BRCA1 gene contribute to the familial <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> syndrome .
However , the prevalence of these mutations is unknown in women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> who do not have the features of this familial syndrome .
We sought BRCA1 mutations in women who were given a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> at an early age , because early onset is characteristic of a genetic predisposition to cancer .
Clinical information and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 418 women from the Boston metropolitan area in whom <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> was diagnosed at or before the age of 40 .
A comprehensive BRCA1 mutational analysis , involving automated nucleotide sequencing and a protein-truncation assay , was undertaken in 30 of these women , who had <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> before the age of 30 .
In addition , the BRCA1 mutation 185delAG , which is prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population , was sought with an allele-specific polymerase-chain-reaction assay in 39 Jewish women among the 418 women who had <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> at or before the age of 40 . Among 30 women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> before the age of 30 , 4 ( 13 percent ) had definite , chain-terminating mutations and 1 had a missense mutation .
Two of the four Jewish women in this cohort had the 185delAG mutation .
Among the 39 Jewish women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> at or before the age of 40 , 8 ( 21 percent ) carried the 185delAG mutation ( 95 percent confidence interval , 9 to 36 percent ) .
Germ-line BRCA1 mutations can be present in young women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> who do not belong to families with multiple affected members .
The specific BRCA1 mutation known as 185delAG is strongly associated with the onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in Jewish women before the age of 40 .
Distinctive anthropometric characteristics of women with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> .
We examined the hypothesis that <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> is often associated with an inherited , anthropometrically distinct habitus .
Using standard echo- and phonocardiographic techniques , we identified 60 subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> , 21 first-degree relatives ( 12 with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> and nine normal ) and a control group of 57 normal women .
Patients with "silent " ( echo only ) <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> or the Marfan syndrome were excluded .
Analysis of measurements taken of the first 39 patients and 46 control subjects revealed that , in relation to their height , patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> had narrower anteroposterior chest diameters and longer arm spans than did the women in the control group .
Linear discriminant analysis produced the equation : Z = 17.51 1 + 98 .6 ( anteroposterior chest diameter /height )--27.3 ( arm span /height ) .
Those with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> tended to score below zero ( mean , --0.62 ) , whereas normal subjects tended to score above zero ( mean , --0.39 ; p less than 0.001 ) .
The equation was tested prospectively on 53 subjects , including the 21 family members , and correctly classified 75 percent of all unrelated subjects and 86 percent of the family members as normal or having <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> .
Both <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> and discriminant classification followed an autosomally dominant pattern of inheritance .
We conclude that a significant proportion of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> have an autosomally dominant , inherited , anthropometrically distinct habitus , suggesting that <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> is only one component of a generalized developmental syndrome .
A novel syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular hypoplasia <END> , deafness , and progeroid features associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> , and male <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> .
Mandibuloacral dysplasia ( MAD ) is an autosomal recessive progeroid disorder associated with type A ( partial ) or B ( generalized ) <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> and is due to mutations in lamin A/ C ( LMNA ) or zinc metalloproteinase ( ZMPSTE24) genes .
The objective of the study was to report a novel syndrome with some overlapping features with MAD .
We report seven patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular hypoplasia <END> , deafness , progeroid features ( MDP) , and associated lipodystrophy.
These patients have similar features to MAD patients such as <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic mandible <END> , beaked nose , stiff joints , and sclerodermatous skin .
However , the patients did not harbor any disease causing variants in LMNA or ZMPSTE24 and showed distinct characteristics such as sensorineural hearing loss and absence of clavicular hypoplasia and acroosteolysis .
All males with MDP had <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> and were hypogonadal .
One adult female showed lack of breast development .
Skinfold thickness , dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging for body fat distribution revealed a lack of <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> in a prepubertal female but a progressive loss of sc fat presenting with partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> in young adults and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> in older patients .
Patients with MDP syndrome have a few overlapping but some distinct clinical features as compared with MAD , suggesting that it is a novel syndrome .
The molecular basis of MDP syndrome remains to be elucidated .
Wolfram syndrome : hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> with brainstem and optic atrophy.
Wolfram syndrome was originally described as a combination of familial juvenile-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and optic atrophy. Other neurological features subsequently emerged , and " DIDMOAD " ( <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and deafness ) became a commonly accepted acronym .
Here , we describe 4 further cases from 2 families , in whom there occurred previously unrecognized neurological features , central apnea and neurogenic upper airway collapse , together precipitating primary respiratory failure ( fatal in 1 case) , startle myoclonus ( in 2 unrelated cases) , axial rigidity , and Parinaud 's syndrome .
Magnetic resonance images revealed striking brainstem atrophy affecting , in particular , the pons and midbrain .
The mitochondrial DNA from 3 cases ( and relatives ) showed no evidence of any of the previously reported abnormalities .
These neurological and neuroradiological features , in conjunction with (1 ) analyses showing the neurodegenerative origin of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , and incontinence , (2 ) other previously reported neurological complications ( including anosmia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and neuropsychiatric and cognitive abnormalities) , and (3 ) the very small number of published postmortem studies , indicate that Wolfram syndrome should be reemphasized as a unique hereditary neurodegenerative disorder with prominent <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> .
A distinctive triad of malformations of the central nervous system in the Meckel-Gruber syndrome .
A distinct triad of central nervous system ( CNS ) malformations ( prosencephalic dysgenesis , occipital exencephalocele and rhombic roof dysgenesis ) was present in seven cases of the Meckel-Gruber syndrome examined at autopsy .
We compared our findings with those previously described .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sloping forehead <END> , posterior occipital exencephalocele , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Chiari malformation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , polymicrogyria , arhinencephaly , holoprosencephaly and <START:PHENOTYPE> anencephaly <END> constituted a broad spectrum of the reported CNS anomalies .
Few reports contained a comprehensive description of the observed CNS malformations .
In those reports , and in our cases , features of prosencephalic dysgenesis included agenesis of olfactory bulbs and tracts ( arhinencephaly) , hypoplasia of optic nerves and chiasm , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of corpus callosum <END> , fused thalami or complete holoprosencephaly .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> occipital encephalocele <END> has consisted of a displacement of rhombic roof elements , including caudal third ventricle , cerebellar vermis and fourth ventricle , extruded through an enlarged posterior fontanelle rather than through an occipital <START:PHENOTYPE> cranium bifidum <END> and is thus more precisely labeled an exencephalocele .
Different degrees of dysgenesis of posterior fossa structures , described by some as a variant of <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker cyst <END> with features of a <START:PHENOTYPE> Chiari malformation <END> , were often associated with this occipital exencephalocele .
This pattern of CNS anomalies represents a triad of malformations probably associated with defective ventral induction of the developing CNS by the prechordal mesoderm .
Further delineation of the Toriello-Carey syndrome : a report of two siblings .
Toriello-Carey is a rare multiple malformation/mental retardation syndrome characterized by dysmorphic features , including <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> /hypertelorism , <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> small nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malformed ears <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> Pierre Robin sequence <END> .
Affected patients also show several other important signs of midline field disruption : <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> laryngeal anomalies <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defects <END> .
Hypotonia and developmental delay are present in most reported cases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> was proposed , but an X-linked or sex-influenced gene disorder was also suspected .
We report on two siblings , a brother and sister , supporting further an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> type of inheritance .
Both patients had severe clinical presentation with death in early infancy .
Besides clinical findings typical for this condition , they showed additional traits , expanding further the phenotypic spectrum .
A specific malformation pattern observed in the patients presented and , in the previously reported cases , suggests an early midline developmental field disruption , presumably caused by a developmental regulatory gene mutation .

Self-limited neonatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> in three siblings .
Three siblings with neonatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> diagnosed at age 4 months , 2 months , and 5 days , respectively , were treated .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypercalciuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> were present in each child .
In all three , there were higher responses of serum parathyroid hormone to serum calcium and higher elevation of serum calcium with oral calcium loading .
The metabolism of vitamin D and calcitonin seemed to be intact .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypercalcemia <END> associated with the abnormal response of parathyroid hormone secretion disappeared when the children passed the age of approximately 2 years , although <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> remained .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> seems likely .
Defining the phenotype in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndrome with a combined congenital defect of glycosylation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> is a genetically heterogeneous condition .
Its molecular basis is largely unknown .
Recently , a combined disorder of N- and O-linked glycosylation was described in children with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> in association with severe central nervous system involvement , brain migration defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and hearing loss .
We report on seven additional patients with similar clinical features in combination with congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIx .
On the basis of phenotype in 10 patients , we define an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndrome .
The patients have a complex phenotype of neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , transient feeding intolerance , late closure of the fontanel , characteristic facial features including <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> and small mouth , and developmental delay .
There is a variable degree of the central nervous system involvement and variable systemic presentation .
The biochemical analysis using transferrin isoelectric focusing gives false negative results in some of the youngest patients .
Analysis of the apolipoprotein C-III isoelectric focusing , however , is diagnostic in all cases .
Mutations in MKKS cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome .
Bardet-Biedl syndrome ( BBS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder with locus heterogeneity .
None of the ' responsible ' genes have previously been identified .
Some BBS cases ( approximately 10% ) remain unassigned to the five previously mapped loci .
McKusick-Kaufma syndrome ( MKS ) includes hydrometrocolpos , postaxial polydactyly and congenital heart disease , and is also inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> manner .
We ascertained 34 unrelated probands with classic features of BBS including <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> ( RP) , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and polydactyly .
The probands were from families unsuitable for linkage because of family size .
We found MKKS mutations in four typical BBS probands ( Table 1 ) .
The first is a 13-year-old Hispanic girl with severe RP , PAP , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ( BMI >40 ) .
She was a compound heterozygote for a missense (1042GA , G52D) and a nonsense ( 1679 TA , Y264stop ) mutation in exon 3 . Cloning and sequencing of the separate alleles confirmed that the mutations were present in trans .
A second BBS proband ( from Newfoundland) , born to consanguineous parents , was homozygous for two deletions ( 1316delC and 1324-1326delGTA ) in exon 3 , predicting a frameshift .
An affected brother was also homozygous for the deletions , whereas an unaffected sibling had two normal copies of MKKS .
Both the proband and her affected brother had RP , PAP , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , morbid <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ( BMI >5 0 and 37 , respectively) , lobulated kidneys with prominent calyces and <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> ( diagnosed at ages 33 and 30 , respectively ) .
A deceased sister ( DNA unavailable ) had similar phenotypic features ( RP with blindness by age 13 , BMI >45 , abnormal glucose tolerance test and IQ=64 , <START:PHENOTYPE> vaginal atresia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> of both feet ) .
Both parents and the maternal grandfather were heterozygous for the deletions .
Genotyping with markers from the MKKS region confirmed homozygosity at 20p12 in both affected individuals .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> disorder with muscle contractions resembling neonatal tetanus , characteristic face , <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , hyperthermia , and sudden death : a new syndrome ?
This work describes an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome observed over the past 25 years in 17 newborn babies ( 8 males , 9 females) , from 12 different families in Southern Sardinia .
This disorder is evident at birth and is characterized by marked muscular contraction of the facial muscles in response to tactile stimuli or during crying , with trismus and abundant salivation simulating a tetanic spasm .
The contractions slowly disappear as the infant calms .
There is also neck muscle hypertonia with a tendency to <START:PHENOTYPE> opisthotonus <END> .
All patients present facial anomalies such as <START:PHENOTYPE> large face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> chubby cheeks <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nostrils <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> .
The hands show bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> .
The clinical course in all patients was characterized by marked feeding difficulties and appearance of variable fever at about 38 degrees C , with peaks of irregular hyperthermia of over 42 degrees C , with onset ranging from birth to a few weeks .
In some patients these symptoms were accompanied by generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Death occurred after a period of a few weeks to some months and coincided with fever above 42 degrees C . Laboratory investigations performed in all of these cases did not give any useful pathogenetic indications .
Only patients 10 and 16 are still alive today .
Patient 10 is now 14 years old .
She presents slow regression of the dystonic symptomatology , while dysthermia and mild psychomotor delay persist .
Apparently novel genetic syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnoid cysts <END> .
We report on an apparently new syndrome in a consanguineous family with seven members , three of whom have cerebral anomalies including <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnoid cysts <END> along with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
The two patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> disorders also had multiple enlarged perivascular spaces seen in the white matter of the centrum semiovale .
Our data provide a contribution to the accumulating knowledge on familial cerebral anomalies including <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnoid cysts <END> and lissencephaly .
Given the lack of mutation in known lissencephaly genes such as LIS1 , 14-3-3epsilon , and DCX , this syndrome may constitute a new phenotype with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
An oculocerebrofacial syndrome .
A syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> mongoloid slant <END> to the palpebral fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> preauricular skin tags <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> small mandible <END> is described in four ( including one set of twins ) of seven sibs born to unaffected , nonconsanguineous parents of German ancestry .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance seems most likely .
A newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome with short stature and oculo-skeletal involvement .
This report describes a young girl and her cousin presenting with postnatal short stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , rhizomelic shortening of the long bones , short and slightly bowed humeri with <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent deltoid tuberosities <END> , short and <START:PHENOTYPE> wide ribs <END> and clavicles , dorso-lumbar <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> biconcave vertebral bodies <END> of the thoraco-lumbar spine , and narrowed lumbar canal .
In addition , in the girl there were <START:PHENOTYPE> amelogenesis imperfecta <END> of the hypomaturation type , and the radiographs showed short distal ulnae , sloping epiphyses of the radii , <START:PHENOTYPE> short femoral necks <END> , and slightly flat uncovered femoral heads .
The children 's parents are first cousins .
Differential diagnoses are discussed and the possibility of a newly recognized oculo-skeletal syndrome is raised .

Di George anomaly and velocardiofacial syndrome .
The velocardiofacial syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , cardiac anomalies , characteristic facies , and learning disabilities .
The Di George anomaly involves developmental defects of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches , resulting in thymic and <START:PHENOTYPE> parathyroid hypoplasia <END> and cardiac defects .
The cases of individuals in two families help substantiate the notion that the Di George anomaly occurs as a feature of the velocardiofacial syndrome .
The proband in family 1 was a male infant with persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> and cardiac defects consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> truncus arteriosus <END> , atrial septal defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , and abnormal aortic arch vessels .
Autopsy revealed absence of thymic and parathyroid tissue , and the Di George anomaly was diagnosed .
His father had a submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , T cell dysfunction , and facial features consistent with the velocardiofacial syndrome .
This is the third case of male-to-male transmission of velocardiofacial syndrome .
The proband of family 2 was a 4-year-old girl with <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , persistent neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , T cell dysfunction , and facial features of the velocardiofacial syndrome .
The Di George anomaly has been reported to occur in at least 18 different disorders .
The observation that the Di George anomaly is a component manifestation of the velocardiofacial syndrome in these two families provides further evidence that the Di George anomaly is not a distinct syndrome of a single origin but rather a heterogeneous developmental field defect .
It is proposed that all previously reported cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Di George anomaly are examples of the velocardiofacial syndrome .
Elevated plasma 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations in infants with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> and an <START:PHENOTYPE> elfin facies <END> .
We measured plasma concentrations of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D ( 1 ,25- ( OH)2D) in the course of a 6-to-37-month survey of four children with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> and an <START:PHENOTYPE> elfin facies <END> ( Williams syndrome ) .
Levels of 1 ,25- ( OH)2D were elevated ( 16 0 to 470 pg per milliliter ) during the hypercalcemic phase of the disease , when the children were five to nine months old , and they decreased thereafter .
Plasma 1 ,25 ( OH)2D levels were higher than those found in three children ( 16 to 60 months old ) with the <START:PHENOTYPE> elfin facies <END> syndrome and no <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> ( 42 to 71 pg per milliliter ) and eight children ( 1 to 36 months old ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> and no dysmorphy ( 12 to 140 pg per milliliter ) , including two children with vitamin D intoxication . <START:PHENOTYPE> Hypercalcemia <END> in the three children with <START:PHENOTYPE> elfin facies <END> was controlled by a low-calcium diet .
Serum calcium levels fell to the normal range , and plasma 1 ,25- ( OH)2D levels were normal for age ( 18 to 105 pg per milliliter ) at 14 to 47 months of age , even after appropriate therapy had been discontinued .
These observations suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> may be the consequence of abnormal synthesis or degradation of 1 ,25- ( OH)2D in children with the <START:PHENOTYPE> elfin facies <END> syndrome .
A new feature of the <START:PHENOTYPE> ablepharon <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> syndrome : zygomatic arch absence .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> ablepharon <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> syndrome is an extremely rare congenital anomaly .
It is characterised by bilateral absence or hypoplasia of lower eyelids , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> and multiple other congenital anomalies .
Three cases have been reported ( McCarthy and West , 1977 ; Hornblass and Reifler , 1985 ) .
In addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> ablepharon <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> , other anomalies common to all patients include auricular deformity , nasal alar deformity , absence of lanugo hair , dry , ichthyotic skin and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> .
A new feature of the syndrome is described--absence of the zygomatic arches .
In addition , an expanded and revised classification of the <START:PHENOTYPE> ablepharon <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> syndrome and related disorders is presented .
Skin graft <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> in this black patient has been prevented by prolonged application of sun block .
E-cadherin germline mutations in familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
The identification of genes predisposing to familial <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> is an essential step towards understanding the molecular events underlying tumorigenesis and is critical for the clinical management of affected families .
Despite a declining incidence , gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> remains a major cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> death worldwide , and about 10 % of cases show familial clustering .
The relative contributions of inherited susceptibility and environmental effects to familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> are poorly understood because little is known of the genetic events that predispose to gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Here we describe the identification of the gene responsible for early-onset , histologically poorly differentiated , high grade , diffuse gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> in a large kindred from New Zealand ( Aotearoa ) .
Genetic linkage analysis demonstrated significant linkage to markers flanking the gene for the calcium-dependent cell-adhesion protein E-cadherin .
Sequencing of the E-cadherin gene revealed a G --> T nucleotide substitution in the donor splice consensus sequence of exon 7 , leading to a truncated gene product .
Diminished E-cadherin expression is associated with aggressive , poorly differentiated carcinomas .
Underexpression of E-cadherin is a prognostic marker of poor clinical outcome in many tumour types , and restored expression of E-cadherin in tumour models can suppress the invasiveness of epithelial tumour cells .
The role of E-cadherin in gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> susceptibility was confirmed by identifying inactivating mutations in other gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> families .
In one family , a frameshift mutation was identified in exon 15 , and in a second family a premature stop codon interrupted exon 13 . These results describe , to our knowledge for the first time , a molecular basis for familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> , and confirm the important role of E-cadherin mutations in <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Association between deletion size and important phenotypes expands the genomic region of interest in Phelan-McDermid syndrome ( 22q13 deletion syndrome ) .
The clinical features of Phelan-McDermid syndrome ( also known as 22q13 deletion syndrome ) are highly variable and include hypotonia , speech and other developmental delays , autistic traits and mildly dysmorphic features .
Patient deletion sizes are also highly variable , prompting this genotype-phenotype association study .
Terminal deletion breakpoints were identified for 71 individuals in a patient cohort using a custom-designed high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridisation platform with a resolution of 100 bp . Patient deletion sizes were highly variable , ranging from 0.22 to 9.22 Mb , and no common breakpoint was observed .
SHANK3 , the major candidate gene for the neurologic features of the syndrome , was deleted in all cases .
Sixteen features ( <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal hypotonia <END> , neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hyporeflexia <END> , neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> feeding problems <END> , speech/language delay , delayed age at crawling , delayed age at walking , severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , male genital anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysplastic toenails <END> , large or fleshy hands , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tall stature <END> , facial asymmetry , full brow , atypical reflexes and <START:PHENOTYPE> dolichocephaly <END> ) were found to be significantly associated with larger deletion sizes , suggesting the role of additional genes or regulatory regions proximal to SHANK3 .
Individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) were found to have smaller deletion sizes ( median deletion size of 3.39 Mb ) than those without ASDs ( median deletion size 6.03 Mb , p= 0.0144 ) .
This may reflect the difficulty in diagnosing ASDs in individuals with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
This genotype-phenotype analysis explains some of the phenotypic variability in the syndrome and identifies new genomic regions with a high likelihood for causing important developmental phenotypes such as <START:PHENOTYPE> speech delay <END> .
Variability of expression of the orofaciodigital syndrome type I in black females : six cases . Orofaciodigital syndrome type I ( OFD I ) includes striking orodental , facial , digital , renal , and central nervous system ( CNS ) abnormalities .
Frequently associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , OFD I is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> trait , lethal in males .
Here , we report the variable expressivity of OFD I in 6 black U.S . females and review findings in 2 previously reported black patients .
Only these 8 of over 160 reported cases involve blacks .
Abnormalities observed in black patients are similar to those observed in whites , but with specific differences .
Only 25% of the blacks had <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and none was observed with midline cleft of the upper lip .
Among whites , 80% have <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and 45 % midline cleft of the upper lip .
These findings suggest that racial genetic factors may protect lip and palate development in blacks , even in the presence of the OFD I gene .
CNS abnormalities , including <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> , cystic brain lesions , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , were present in 5 0 % of our the cases .
This figure is greater than previously reported .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Polycystic kidneys <END> were present in 3 of our patients .
Including a previously reported patient , 5 0 % of the black OFD I patients show <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidneys <END> .
Hyperplastic and supernumerary frenula , with or without brachydactyly , have been shown to be strong diagnostic criteria in our patients .
New findings reported here include intracranial berry <START:PHENOTYPE> aneurysm <END> , periodontal disease , and lip pits .
Clinicians treating these patients should be aware of the pleiotropic manifestations of the syndrome , which may include renal and CNS anomalies .
Ultrasonic and computed tomography scan studies are indicated in patients diagnosed with OFD I .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cataracts <END> , radiculomegaly , septal heart defects and hearing loss in two unrelated adult females with normal intelligence and similar facial appearance : confirmation of a syndrome ?
Two unrelated , adult females with normal intelligence are described .
They show a similar clinical picture with a long and <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> , a short nose , a <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal tip <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , bilateral hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> persistent primary teeth <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> , variable root length including dental radiculomegaly , heart defects and cutaneous syndactyly of the 2nd-3rd toes .
Abnormalities present in only one of the two patients were a <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and a transverse vaginal septum , respectively .
There are numerous similarities between our two patients and the family described by Wilkie et al . ( ( 1993 ) : Clin Dysmorphol 2 : 114-119 ) and all may be examples of the same entity .
Craniofacial dysostosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , genital hypoplasia , ocular , dental , and digital defects : confirmation of the Gorlin- Chaudhry-Moss syndrome .
We report clinical , orofacial and radiological manifestations in a 4-year-old girl and a 33-year-old female with the Gorlin- Chaudhry-Moss ( GCM ) syndrome .
Typical findings in the GCM syndrome are <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , stocky body build , <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , small eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> , highly arched and <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malocclusion <END> , abnormally shaped teeth , oligodontia , <START:PHENOTYPE> microdontia <END> , low scalp hairline , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> of scalp , face , trunk and limbs and genital hypoplasia .
Radiological features include premature synostosis of the coronal suture , <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , and maxillary under-development .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypoplasia of the distal phalanges <END> of fingers and toes ( also present in the 2 original cases ) represents a further manifestation of the GCM syndrome .
Hypoprebetalipoproteinemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pallidal degeneration <END> ( HARP syndrome ) .
We describe the clinical and laboratory studies of an 11-year-old girl with prominent <START:PHENOTYPE> orofacial dyskinesia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive dementia <END> .
Investigations revealed hypoprebetalipoproteinemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> , atypical <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , and evidence of iron deposition in the pallidal nuclei .
Electroneuromyography and skin and sural nerve biopsies were normal .
The "eye-of-the-tiger " sign , used to describe the pallidal nuclei in Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome , was present on T2-weighted MRIs ( GE Signa , 1.5 T) . Phase-contrast microscopy of whole blood showed 80 to 90 % <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytes <END> whose morphology was confirmed by electron microscopy .
High-resolution lipoprotein electrophoresis demonstrated an absence of the pre-beta fraction .
This case differs phenotypically from the previous reports of Hallervorden-Spatz disease with <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> by the presence of prominent <START:PHENOTYPE> orofacial dyskinesia <END> and abnormal serum lipoproteins .
Prediction of the risk of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , using DNA polymorphisms within the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> gene .
Using molecular cloning , we earlier isolated the " <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> gene " ; mutations or deletions at this locus are associated with the hereditary predisposition to some human cancers , especially <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> . To develop diagnostic tests for such a predisposition , we identified restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms ( RFLPs ) within the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> gene and tested their usefulness in predicting the risk of cancer in 20 families with members who had hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
We were able to make predictions in 19 of the 20 kindreds .
In 18 kindreds , we demonstrated a consistent association of marker RFLPs with the mutation predisposing to <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
In the 19th kindred , there may be a lack of cosegregation of the DNA polymorphisms within the gene and the site of the mutation predisposing to <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
However , there is uncertainty about the clinical diagnosis of the retinal lesion in a key member of this kindred ; if the lesion is not a <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , there is no discrepancy between the DNA polymorphisms and the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> trait .
We conclude that it is feasible and clinically useful to use these DNA polymorphisms to determine the risk of cancer .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> : evidence for an X chromosome <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> locus .
A family of 5 affected male infants in 2 generations with an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> pattern of inheritance is described .
All affected infants manifested intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , severe psychomotor retardation , growth failure , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphallus <END> , and death during infancy .
Three of the affected patients had radiological studies that demonstrated findings consistent with pachygyria-agyria and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> .
We believe that this family represents a form of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> pachygyria-agyria ( <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> ) that has not been described previously and suggests a locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> on the X chromosome .
Clinical heterogeneity in lymphoedema-distichiasis with FOXC2 truncating mutations .
Hereditary lymphoedema-distichiasis ( LD ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder that classically presents as <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> of the limbs , with variable age of onset , and extra aberrant growth of eyelashes from the Meibomian gland ( <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> ) . Other major reported complications include cardiac defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and extradural cysts .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Photophobia <END> , exotropia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , congenital ectropion , and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> are additional eye findings .
Recently , we reported that truncating mutations in the forkhead transcription family member FOXC2 resulted in LD in two families .
The clinical findings in seven additional families with LD , including the original family described by Falls and Kertesz , were determined and mutational analyses were performed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Distichiasis <END> was the most common clinical feature followed by age dependent <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> .
There is a wide variation of associated secondary features including <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
The mutational analyses identified truncating mutations in all of the families studied ( two nonsense , one deletion , three insertion , and one insertion-deletion ) , which most likely result in haploinsufficiency of FOXC2 .
FOXC2 mutations are highly penetrant with variable expressivity which is not explicable by the pattern of mutations .
Natural history of symptomatic partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency .
We reviewed the natural history and differential diagnosis of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency ( an X-linked inborn error of urea synthesis ) in 13 symptomatic female heterozygotes .
The patients presented as early as the first week of life or as late as the sixth year .
The most common symptoms before diagnosis were nonspecific : episodic extreme <START:PHENOTYPE> irritability <END> (10 0 percent ) , episodic <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> (10 0 percent ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> protein avoidance <END> (92 percent ) , ataxia ( 77 percent ) , Stage II <START:PHENOTYPE> coma <END> ( 46 percent ) , delayed physical growth ( 38 percent ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> ( 38 percent ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( 23 percent ) .
Including the proband , 42 percent of the female members of the 13 families studied had symptoms .
The median interval between the onset of major symptoms ( <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> coma <END> ) and diagnosis was 16 months ( range , 1 to 142 ) .
Five patients had IQ scores below 70 at the time of diagnosis .
We suggest that careful evaluation of the family history , the dietary history , the episodic nature of the nonspecific symptoms , the response of these symptoms to the withdrawal of protein , and their frequent onset at the time of weaning from breast milk will permit early diagnosis and might thereby reduce the risk of death or neurologic impairment in female patients with partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency .
Association of IL12B promoter polymorphism with severity of atopic and non-atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> in children .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> is a frequent cause of hospital admission , especially among children .
The main environmental triggers of airway inflammation in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> are viruses and aeroallergens .
These agents elicit reciprocal immune responses , characterised by production of T helper 1 and T helper 2 cytokines , respectively .
There is no genetic explanation for how hyper-responsiveness to these disparate environmental stimuli develops among individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Our aim was to assess relation between an IL12B promoter polymorphism and <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
We did a cohort study in which we initially genotyped 411 6-year olds for the IL12B promoter polymorphism .
We then assessed the relation between this polymorphism and <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> severity .
A further 85 asthmatic children in an additional sample of 433 children from the same cohort were then assessed to confirm these findings .
We also examined in-vitro interleukin-12 responses in a subgroup of individuals .
Heterozygosity for the IL12B promoter polymorphism was observed in 76 % ( 16 ) of atopic and non-atopic individuals with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> in the initial sample .
By comparison , heterozygotes comprised only 31 % ( 17 ) of the moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> group , and 48 % (20) of individuals with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> were heterozygous , as were unaffected controls .
These findings were confirmed in the second sample ( overall p< 0.0001 ) .
Our data suggest that IL12B promoter heterozygosity contributes to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> severity rather than susceptibility per se .
The severity-predisposing genotype was associated with reduced interleukin 12 p40 gene transcription and decreased interleukin 12 p70 secretion .
Interleukin 12 plays a key part in antagonism of T helper 2 differentiation , and in induction of antiviral host defense .
Genetically determined attenuation of interleukin-12 response capacity would , therefore , provide a plausible common immunological pathway to disease severity for the two major forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Novel mutations in G protein-coupled receptor gene ( P2RY5 ) in families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> ( LAH3 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> ( LAH3 ) is a rare hair disorder characterized by sparse hair on scalp and the rest of the body of affected individuals .
Recently mutations in a G protein-coupled receptor gene , P2RY5 , located at LAH3 locus , have been reported in several families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> simplex and <START:PHENOTYPE> woolly hair <END> .
For the present study , 22 Pakistani families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> were enrolled .
Genotyping using microsatellite markers linked to three <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> ( LAH1 , LAH2 , LAH3 ) showed the linkage of 2 families to the LAH2 locus and 14 to the LAH3 locus .
The remaining 6 families were not linked to any of the three loci .
Families linked to LAH3 locus were further subjected to screening of the P2RY5 gene with direct DNA sequencing .
Three previously reported variants , c.69ins CATG ( p.24ins Hfs52 ) , c.188 A > T ( p.D63V ) and c.565 G > A ( p.E189K ) were observed in eight families .
Four novel nonsynonymous sequence variants , c.8 G > C ( p.S3T) , c.36ins A ( p.D13RfsX16 ) , c.16 0ins A ( p.N54TfsX58 ) and c.436 G > A ( p.G146R ) were found to segregate within six families .
Evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> in Romano-Ward <START:PHENOTYPE> long QT syndrome <END> .
Analysis of 23 families .
The Romano-Ward long-QT Syndrome ( LQTS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> inherited trait characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> prolonged QT interval <END> on ECG , life-threatening arrhythmias , <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , and sudden death in affected individuals .
A gene responsible for this disorder has been shown to be linked to the Harvey ras-1 locus ( H-ras-1 ) DNA marker on the short arm of chromosome 11 ( 11p ) in 7 families .
The purpose of this study was to determine , by analyzing 23 families with LQTS for linkage to chromosome 11p , whether evidence exists for more than one gene causing LQTS ( ie , locus <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> ) .
Twenty-three families ( 262 family members ) were clinically evaluated using medical histories , ECGs , and Holter recordings .
Each corrected QT interval ( QTc ) were determined using Bazett 's formula .
Blood for DNA extraction and cell line immortalization was obtained after informed consent .
Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction were performed , and linkage analysis carried out using the LINKAGE computer program ( v 5. 03 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Genetic heterogeneity <END> was determined using the HOMOG 2 ( v 2.51 ) computer program .
Twenty-three families were studied for evidence of linkage to chromosome 11p using the H-ras-1 locus probe pTB B-2 and multiple flanking markers , including tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) .
Two-point linkage analysis using pTB B-2 and TH markers was consistent with linkage in 15 of 23 families , with the maximum single-family LOD score of +3.038 occurring at theta = 0 . However , 8 of 23 families had negative LOD scores , with the values in 4 families being less than -2 at theta = 0 , consistent with exclusion of linkage .
Analysis with the HOMOG program was consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> ( P < .0001 ) .
Multipoint linkage data using pTB B-2 and TH were also examined for evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> .
HOMOG analysis of multipoint LOD scores from 100 cM surrounding the H-ras-1 locus also supported <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> ( P < .001 ) .
In the 23 families with LQTS analyzed for linkage to the H-ras-1 locus on chromosome 11p15 .5 , 15 of 23 families had LOD scores consistent with linkage .
The remaining 8 of 23 families had negative LOD scores , 4 of which were definitively excluded from linkage .
Thus , <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> is definitively ( P < .001 ) demonstrated for this disorder .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertrichosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> , abnormal corpus callosum , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and dysmorphic features in three unrelated females .
We report three unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , mild to moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and dysmorphic facial features including <START:PHENOTYPE> low anterior hairline <END> , thick <START:PHENOTYPE> arched eyebrows <END> , nose with broad tip and columella below alae nasi , <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , thick drooping lower lip and simple <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated ears <END> .
They also had rough skin with hyperkeratotic plaques .
Feet and finger tips were broad .
All of them had personality problems like <START:PHENOTYPE> aggressiveness <END> , stubborn temperament or tendency to withdraw .
Brain MRI showed thick and <START:PHENOTYPE> short corpus callosum <END> .
We believe that these patients represent a new syndrome of unknown aetiology .
A distinct dysmorphic syndrome with spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and probable <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Two brothers and their sister aged 8 , 13 , and 7 years were found to have unusual facies ( gross , rough and abundant hair , <START:PHENOTYPE> wide forehead <END> , mild palpebral <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nostrils <END> , thick lips , and down-slanting corners of the mouth) , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed psychomotor development <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , feet deformities , and limb and gait <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
The characteristic clinical picture in the three sibs , once compared with other ataxic syndromes , allowed one to conclude that this could correspond to a distinct entity probably inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder .
Multipoint linkage analysis of loci in the proximal long arm of the human X chromosome : application to mapping the <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> locus .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Choroideremia <END> ( McK30310 ) , an X-linked retinal dystrophy , causes progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> night blindness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> visual field constriction <END> , and eventual central blindness in affected males by the third to fourth decade of life .
The biochemical basis of the disease is unknown , and prenatal diagnosis is not available .
Subregional localization of the <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> locus to Xq13-22 was accomplished initially by linkage to two restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms ( RFLPs ) , DXYS1 ( Xq13-q21.1 ) and DXS3 ( Xq21.3-22 ) .
We have now extended our linkage analysis to 12 families using nine RFLP markers between Xp11 .3 and Xq26 .
Recombination frequencies of 0%-4% were found between <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> and five markers ( PGK , DXS3 , DXYS12 , DXS72 , and DXYS1 ) located in Xq13-22 .
The families were also used to measure recombination frequencies between RFLP loci to provide parameters for the program LINKMAP .
Multipoint analysis with LINKMAP provided overwhelming evidence for placing the <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> locus within the region bounded by DXS1 ( Xq11 -13 ) and DXS17 ( Xq21.3-q22 ) .
At a finer level of resolution , multipoint analysis suggested that the <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> locus was proximal to DXS3 ( 384 :1 odds ) rather than distal to it .
Data were insufficient , however , to distinguish between a gene order that puts <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> between DXS3 and DXYS1 and one that places <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> proximal to both RFLP loci .
These results provide linkage mapping of <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> and RFLP loci in this region that will be of use for further genetic studies as well as for clinical applications in this and other human diseases .
Pheochromocytomas , multiple endocrine <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> type 2 , and von Hippel-Lindau disease . <START:PHENOTYPE> Pheochromocytoma <END> is a feature of two disorders with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern of inheritance--multiple endocrine <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> type 2 ( MEN-2 ) ( with medullary thyroid carcinoma and hyperparathyroidism ) and von Hippel-Lindau disease ( with angioma of the retina , hemangioblastoma of the central nervous system , renal-cell carcinoma , pancreatic cysts , and epididymal cystadenoma ) .
The frequency of these syndromes in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> is not known .
In an unselected group of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> , we performed pentagastrin tests , parathyroid hormone assays , computed tomography ( CT) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of the brain , ophthalmoscopy , CT imaging of the abdomen , and ultrasonography of the testes .
We also screened members of families with MEN-2 or von Hippel-Lindau disease for <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> by measuring plasma and urine catecholamines and plasma chromogranin A and by performing abdominal ultrasonography , CT and MRI , and metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy.
Nineteen of 82 unselected patients with pheochromocytomas ( 23 percent ) were carriers of familial disorders ; 19 percent had von Hippel-Lindau disease and 4 percent had MEN-2 .
Prospectively , in 36 of 79 subjects at risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> ( 46 percent ) , 42 unsuspected pheochromocytomas were found .
Overall , there were 130 patients with 185 pheochromocytomas ; 43 had von Hippel-Lindau disease , 24 had MEN-2 , and 63 had sporadic tumors .
The patients with familial and those with sporadic pheochromocytomas differed in mean age at diagnosis (32 vs . 46 years , P < 0.001 ) , multifocal localization (55 vs . 8 percent , P < 0.001 ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> ( 0 vs . 11 percent , P = 0.005 ) ; but not in the frequency of extraadrenal tumors ( 24 vs . 16 percent ) .
Thirty-eight percent of carriers of von Hippel-Lindau disease and 24 percent of carriers of MEN-2 had <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> as the only manifestation of their syndrome .
All patients with pheochromocytomas should be screened for MEN-2 and von Hippel-Lindau disease to avert further morbidity and mortality in the patients and their families .
All patients in families with MEN-2 or von Hippel-Lindau disease should be screened for <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> , even if they are asymptomatic .
Is <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperprolinemia <END> type I actually a benign trait ?
Report of a case with severe neurologic involvement and vigabatrin intolerance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperprolinemia <END> type I is a deficiency of proline oxidase ( McKusick 23950 ) , leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperprolinemia <END> and iminoglycinuria , usually with renal involvement .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperprolinemia <END> type I is considered a benign trait .
We reported a case of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperprolinemia <END> type I with a severe neurologic disorder and without renal involvement .
The patient had marked <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor delay <END> and right hemiparesis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> was characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> status epilepticus <END> or a cluster of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Laboratory findings revealed elevated levels of proline in the serum , urine , and cerebrospinal fluid without delta1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate dehydrogenase in the plasma or urine .
Fluorescence in situ hybridization excluded a chromosome 22q11 deletion .
Vigabatrin inhibits ornithine transaminase .
Thus , vigabatrin could lead to a depletion of the normal pool of pyrroline 5-carboxylate dehydrogenase and could aggravate the clinical condition of the child .
In this study , vigabatrin was discontinued .
In the following months , the patient had marked psychomotor improvement , without modification of the <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
We suggest that vigabatrin should be avoided in <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperprolinemia <END> type I .
Borate transporter SLC4A11 mutations cause both Harboyan syndrome and non-syndromic corneal endothelial dystrophy.
Harboyan syndrome , or <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal dystrophy <END> and perceptive <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> ( CDPD) , consists of congenital corneal endothelial dystrophy and progressive perceptive <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , and is transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
CDPD and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , non-syndromic congenital hereditary endothelial <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal dystrophy <END> ( CHED2 ) both map at overlapping loci at 20p13 , and mutations of SLC4A11 were reported recently in CHED2 .
A genotype study on six families with CDPD and on one family with either CHED or CDPD , from various ethnic backgrounds ( in the seventh family , <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> could not be assessed because of the proband 's young age ) , is reported here .
Novel SLC4A11 mutations were found in all patients .
Why some mutations cause <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> in addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal dystrophy <END> is presently unclear .
These findings extend the implication of the SLC4A11 borate transporter beyond <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal dystrophy <END> to perceptive <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
Fronto-ocular syndrome : newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> syndrome .
We describe an apparently unique disorder , Fronto-Ocular syndrome , present in a mother and her two daughters , and comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> due to coronal and metopic craniosynostosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypotelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular proptosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthal folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic supraorbital ridges <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated nasal bridge <END> , thin philtrum , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> and a narrow bifrontal region .
Both daughters have glabellar <START:PHENOTYPE> capillary hemangiomas <END> , a congenital heart defect and mild developmental disabilities .
Review of the literature failed to disclose any syndrome with similar findings .
It is likely that this disorder represents an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> condition , that arose as a new mutation in the mother .
Mutational analysis of fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) 1 and FGFR2 failed to identify the molecular basis of the disorder .

Evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital stationary night blindness <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital stationary night blindness <END> ( CSNB ) is a nonprogressive retinal disorder characterized by disturbed or absent night vision ; its clinical features may also include myopia , nystagmus , and impaired visual acuity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> CSNB is clinically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> , and it may also be genetically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> .
We have studied 32 families with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> CSNB , including 11 families with the complete form of CSNB and 21 families with the incomplete form of CSNB , to identify genetic-recombination events that would refine the location of the disease genes .
Critical recombination events in the set of families with complete CSNB have localized a disease gene to the region between DXS556 and DXS8083 , in Xp11 .4-p11 .3 . Critical recombination events in the set of families with incomplete CSNB have localized a disease gene to the region between DXS722 and DXS8023 , in Xp11 .23.
Further analysis of the incomplete-CSNB families , by means of disease-associated-haplotype construction , identified 17 families , of apparent Mennonite ancestry , that share portions of an ancestral chromosome .
Results of this analysis refined the location of the gene for incomplete CSNB to the region between DXS722 and DXS255 , a distance of 1.2 Mb .
Genetic and clinical analyses of this set of 32 families with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> CSNB , together with the family studies reported in the literature , strongly suggest that two loci , one for complete ( CSNB1 ) and one for incomplete ( CSNB2 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> CSNB , can account for all reported mapping information .
Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene mutation ( c.319C>T) presents with clinical heterogeneity and is candidate founder mutation in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish origin .
We report 10 children ( 7 male , 3 female) , 3 homozygous for c.319C> T mutation and 7 heterozygous for c.319C> T on one allele and c.625G >A variant on the other in the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( SCAD ) gene ( ACADS ) .
All were of Ashkenazi Jewish origin in which group we found a c.319C> T heterozygote frequency of 1 :15 suggesting the presence of a founder mutation or selective advantage .
Phenotype was variable with onset from birth to early childhood .
Features included hypotonia ( 8 /10 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> ( 8 /10 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> ( 4/10 ) with multicore changes in two and lipid storage in one , <START:PHENOTYPE> facial weakness <END> ( 3/10 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> ( 5 /10 ) , feeding difficulties ( 4/10 ) and congenital abnormalities ( 3/7 ) .
One female with multiminicore <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> had progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> external ophthalmoplegia <END> , ptosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> with pneumonia and respiratory failure .
Two brothers presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> psychosis <END> , pyramidal signs , and multifocal <START:PHENOTYPE> white matter abnormalities <END> on MRI brain suggesting additional genetic factors .
Two other infants also had white matter changes .
Elevated butyrylcarnitine ( 4/8 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> ethylmalonic aciduria <END> ( 9/9) , methylsuccinic aciduria ( 6/7) , decreased butyrate oxidation in lymphoblasts ( 2/4 ) and decreased SCAD activity in fibroblasts or muscle ( 3/3 ) were shown .
Expression studies of c.319C> T in mouse liver mitochondria showed it to be inactivating .
c.625G >A is a common variant in ACADS that may confer disease susceptibility .
Five healthy parents were heterozygous for c.319C> T and c.625G >A , suggesting reduced penetrance or broad clinical spectrum .
We conclude that the c.319C> T mutation can lead to wide clinical and biochemical phenotypic variability , suggesting a complex multifactorial/polygenic condition .
This should be screened for in individuals with multicore <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , particularly among the Ashkenazim .
The telomere of human chromosome 1p contains at least two independent <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> genes .
Multiple genetic causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> have been identified , both as a component of syndromes and in families that present with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> .
Linkage analysis was used to map the genetic locus in a six generation Australian family presenting with total <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> .
Microsatellite markers located across all known <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> loci were genotyped in all recruited family members of the Tasmanian family .
Both two point and multipoint linkage analysis were used to assess each locus under an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model .
Significant linkage was detected at the telomere of the p arm of chromosome 1 , with a maximum two point LOD of 4.21 at marker D1S507 , a maximum multipoint exact LOD of 5.44 , and an estimated location score of 5.61 at marker D1S507 .
Haplotype analysis places the gene inside a critical region between D1S228 and D1S199 , a distance of approximately 6 megabases .
The candidate gene PAX7 residing within the critical interval was excluded by direct sequencing in affected individuals .
This is the third report of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> linkage to 1ptel .
The critical region as defined by the shared haplotype in this family is clearly centromeric from the Volkmann cataract locus identified through study of a Danish family , indicating that two genes causing <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> map to the telomeric region of chromosome 1p .
Kartagener 's syndrome .
Kartagener 's syndrome , characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> , paranasal <START:PHENOTYPE> sinusitis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> , is part of a more generalized syndrome characterized by sterility in men , chronic bronchitis or <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic sinusitis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic otitis media <END> ; it is referred to as the immotile-cilia syndrome .
Those patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> will give a typical radiological appearance allowing an early diagnosis ; however , in those patients with immotile-cilia syndrome who have normal visceral situs , a high index of suspicion and early electron microscopic examination of respiratory tract cilia will be necessary for early diagnosis and therapy to prevent irreversible <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> and lung destruction .
We describe a young woman with <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic sinusitis <END> , found to have abnormal respiratory epithelium cilia .
Secretory <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> protein-losing enteropathy <END> , enterocolitis cystica superficialis , intestinal lymphangiectasia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> : a new syndrome .
Four infants had noninfectious intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , anasarca , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> , and malnutrition within the first 3 months of life .
Their parents originated from the same Northeastern part of Quebec , and consanguinity was found in two kindreds .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Diarrhea <END> was secretory in three infants ( mean stool volume 87 ml/kg/day , Na+ 108 mEq/L , Cl- 85 mEq/L ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypoalbuminemia <END> ( mean 2.0 gm/dl) , present in all infants , appeared to be secondary to a <START:PHENOTYPE> protein-losing enteropathy <END> , which was documented in two infants .
Histologic examination of the upper small intestine showed only mild to moderate villous atrophy.
The remarkable findings were those of cystic dilation of the crypts and acute inflammation of crypts and lamina propria , all of which were most prominent in the colon and terminal ileum ; the changes were progressive over time .
Mild lymphangiectasia was found in all of the patients .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> , present in all , was associated in one patient with a nonfunctional multicystic kidney .
Prolonged total parenteral nutrition , intravenously administered albumin , antisecretory agents , and antibiotics were unsuccessful in controlling the disease .
Although a total colectomy was followed by a temporary decrease in stool output and normalization of serum albumin concentration in one infant , the patients died between 4 and 21 months of age .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cleft lip <END> and palate , characteristic facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> malrotation <END> of the intestine , and lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> in two sibs : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition ?
A chromosomally normal brother and sister shared a lethal pattern of anomalies including <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral cleft lip and palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , flat facial profile , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat occiput <END> , complex <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> malrotation <END> of the intestine .
The male was <START:PHENOTYPE> large for gestational age <END> , while his sister was normally grown .
The girl had bifid thumbs , but the boy had only minor hand anomalies .
These findings are not consistent with any previously recognized syndrome and represent a new condition with probable <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> , congenital heart defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and facial anomalies : a new X-linked multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome : clinical description and molecular studies .
We report on two brothers and their two maternal uncles with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , congenital heart defect , cleft or highly arched palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and craniofacial anomalies consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , abnormal ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> bulbous nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malar hypoplasia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
Three of the four patients died at an early age .
The mother of the two brothers had an <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> .
She is assumed to be a manifesting carrier of a mutant gene , which is expressed in her two sons and two brothers .
By multipoint linkage analysis it is found that the most likely location of the responsible gene is the pericentromeric region Xp21.3-q21.3 with DMD and DXS3 as flanking markers .
Maximum information is obtained with marker DXS453 ( Z = 1.2 0 at theta = 0.0 ) .
Mutations in DNMT1 cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , deafness and <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , deafness and <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> ( ADCA-DN ) is characterized by late onset (30-40 years old ) <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , sensory neuronal deafness , narcolepsy-cataplexy and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
We performed exome sequencing in five individuals from three ADCA-DN kindreds and identified DNMT1 as the only gene with mutations found in all five affected individuals .
Sanger sequencing confirmed the de novo mutation p.Ala57 0Val in one family , and showed co-segregation of p.Val606Phe and p.Ala57 0Val , with the ADCA-DN phenotype , in two other kindreds .
An additional ADCA-DN kindred with a p.GLY605Ala mutation was subsequently identified .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Narcolepsy <END> and deafness were the first symptoms to appear in all pedigrees , followed by <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
DNMT1 is a widely expressed DNA methyltransferase maintaining methylation patterns in development , and mediating transcriptional repression by direct binding to HDAC2 .
It is also highly expressed in immune cells and required for the differentiation of CD4+ into T regulatory cells .
Mutations in exon 20 of this gene were recently reported to cause hereditary sensory neuropathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and hearing loss ( HSAN1 ) .
Our mutations are all located in exon 21 and in very close spatial proximity , suggesting distinct phenotypes depending on mutation location within this gene .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , deafness/malformed ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and peculiar facies in a mother and son .
We report a mother and son who have a <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with a characteristic dysmorphic face .
Prominent manifestations include <START:PHENOTYPE> facial asymmetry <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent glabella <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , low-set , <START:PHENOTYPE> cup-shaped ears <END> , thick , <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding lower lip <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We conclude that these patients have a previously undescribed type of genetic <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
The mother has become normocephalic and we would not have been able to diagnose her condition without her childhood photographs .
Such photographs are essential in the recognition of familial syndromes .
Schinzel-Giedion syndrome : report of splenopancreatic fusion and proposed diagnostic criteria .
We report on the 46th patient with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome ( SGS ) and the first observation of splenopancreatic fusion in this syndrome .
In the antenatal period , a male fetus was found to have bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> .
Postnatally , in keeping with a diagnosis of SGS , there were large fontanelles , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> , a wide , broad forehead , midface retraction , a short , <START:PHENOTYPE> upturned nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macroglossia <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> . Other anomalies included cardiac defects , widened and dense long bone cortices , cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> ventriculomegaly <END> , and abnormal fundi .
Splenopancreatic fusion , usually encountered in trisomy 13 , was found on autopsy .
Schinzel-Giedion syndrome is likely a monogenic condition for which neither the heritability pattern nor pathogenesis has yet been determined .
A clinical diagnosis may be made by identifying the facial phenotype , including <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , midface retraction , and short , <START:PHENOTYPE> upturned nose <END> , plus one of either of the two other major distinguishing features : typical skeletal abnormalities or <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> .
Typical skeletal anomalies include a sclerotic skull base , wide supraoccipital-exoccipital synchondrosis , increased cortical density or thickness , and <START:PHENOTYPE> broad ribs <END> . Other highly supportive features include neuroepithelial tumors ( found in 17% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , and brain abnormalities .
Severe developmental delay and poor survival are constant features in reported patients .

<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> recessive inheritance of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> : clinical features and preliminary linkage analysis .
Three generations of a family exhibit a unique syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyramidal tract signs <END> , and adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Initial signs , manifested by 2 to 3 years of age , are delayed walking and <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> .
During their teens , the patients develop mild but progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pyramidal tract signs <END> .
Memory problems in the third decade initiate a <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive dementia <END> , leading to death in the sixth decade .
Laboratory investigations failed to disclose a biochemical basis for the syndrome .
Preliminary molecular linkage studies have been conducted , and although the specific position of the responsible gene on the X chromosome has not yet been determined , the q26-qter region and much of the p arm are unlikely sites for this gene .
The linkage studies are continuing .
Differences in the gyral pattern distinguish chromosome 17-linked and <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> or "smooth brain " is a human brain malformation that consists of diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> agyria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> .
Two genes associated with classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> have recently been cloned-LIS1 from chromosome 17p13.3 and XLIS ( also called DCX ) from Xq22.3-q23.
We performed genotype-phenotype analysis in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> associated with mutations of different genes .
We compared the phenotype , especially brain imaging studies , in a series of 48 children with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , including 12 with Miller-Dieker syndrome ( MDS) , which is associated with large deletions of LIS1 and other genes in the region , 24 with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> sequence caused by smaller LIS1 deletions or mutations , and 12 with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> sequence caused by XLIS mutations .
We found consistent differences in the gyral patterns , with the malformation more severe posteriorly in individuals with LIS1 mutations and more severe anteriorly in individuals with XLIS mutations .
Thus , mutations of LIS1 are associated with a posterior-to-anterior gradient of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , whereas mutations of XLIS are associated with an anterior-to-posterior gradient .
We also confirmed differences in severity between MDS and ILS17 .
Hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis proved to be more common with XLIS mutations .
It is often possible to predict the gene mutation from careful review of brain imaging studies .
Mutations in the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger gene AE1 cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> but not <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> distal renal tubular acidosis <END> .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> distal renal tubular acidosis <END> (dRTA ) is characterized by reduced ability to acidify urine , variable hyperchloremic hypokalemic metabolic acidosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , and nephrolithiasis .
Kindreds showing either <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> or recessive transmission are described .
Mutations in the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger AE1 have recently been reported in four <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> dRTA kindreds , three of these altering codon Arg589 .
We have screened 26 kindreds with primary dRTA for mutations in AE1 .
Inheritance was <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> in seventeen kindreds , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> in one , and uncertain due to unknown parental phenotype or sporadic disease in eight kindreds .
No mutations in AE1 were detected in any of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> kindreds , and analysis of linkage showed no evidence of linkage of recessive dRTA to AE1 .
In contrast , heterozygous mutations in AE1 were identified in the one known dominant dRTA kindred , in one sporadic case , and one kindred with two affected brothers .
In the dominant kindred , the mutation Arg-589/ Ser cosegregated with dRTA in the extended pedigree .
An Arg-589/His mutation in the sporadic case proved to be a de novo mutation .
In the third kindred , affected brothers both have an intragenic 13-bp duplication resulting in deletion of the last 11 amino acids of AE1 . These mutations were not detected in 80 alleles from unrelated normal individuals .
These findings underscore the key role of Arg-58 9 and the C terminus in normal AE1 function , and indicate that while mutations in AE1 cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> dRTA , defects in this gene are not responsible for recessive disease .
Respiration-deficient cells are caused by a single point mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> tRNA-Leu ( UUR ) gene in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ( MELAS ) .
MELAS ( <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ) is a major subgroup of heterogeneous <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> diseases .
For identifying a mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> gene , we isolated , from the same muscle tissue from a patient with MELAS , cell lines with distinctly different phenotypes : one was respiration-deficient , and the other was apparently normal .
Compared with the normal cells , only one A-to-G nucleotide transition at nucleotide 3243 in the tRNA-Leu ( UUR ) gene was found in whole mtDNA of the respiration-deficient cells .
This mutation was also found in eight patients , from unrelated families , who had MELAS in a heteroplasmic manner but was not found in control individuals .
Therefore , the single point mutation causes the functional abnormality in the respiratory chain of mitochondria .
Hydrometrocolpos and polydactyly : a common neonatal presentation of Bardet-Biedl and McKusick-Kaufman syndromes .
McKusick-Kaufman syndrome ( MKKS ) is a rare , recessively inherited syndrome reported mainly in young children and is characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> vaginal atresia <END> with hydrometrocolpos , postaxial polydactyly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> .
Bardet-Biedl syndrome ( BBS ) is the generic name for a genetically heterogeneous group of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorders characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> ( appearing usually between 10 and 20 years of age ) , postaxial polydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , nephropathy , and mental disturbances , or , occasionally , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Typically , MKKS is diagnosed ( and reported ) in very young children , whereas the diagnosis of BBS often is delayed to the teenage years .
We report here a series of nine patients diagnosed in infancy with MKKS because of the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> vaginal atresia <END> and postaxial polydactyly , who later developed <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> , thus turning out to be instances of BBS .
The overlap of BBS and MKKS is a real diagnostic pitfall and its importance has to be stressed , for genetic counselling , for clinical management and follow up , and for molecular approaches .
The diagnosis of MKKS should be considered with caution in all published cases described exclusively in the neonatal period and in those with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We strongly recommend all children seen in infancy with a diagnosis of MKKS to be re-evaluated for RP and other signs of BBS .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> ( ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome ) is linked to chromosome 9q34 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> ( ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome [ AOA] ; MIM 208920) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> .
These neurological features resemble those of ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT) , but in AOA there are none of the extraneurological features of AT , such as immunodeficiency , neoplasia , chromosomal instability , or sensitivity to ionizing radiation .
It is unclear whether these patients have a true disorder of chromosomal instability or a primary neurodegenerative syndrome , and it has not been possible to identify the defective gene in AOA , since the families have been too small for linkage analysis .
We have identified a new family with AOA , and we show that the patients have no evidence of chromosomal instability or sensitivity to ionizing radiation , suggesting that AOA in this family is a true primary <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
We have localized the disease gene , by linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping , to a 15 .9-cM interval on chromosome 9q34 .
This work will ultimately allow the disease gene to be identified and its relevance to other types of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> cerebellar ataxias to be determined .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Macrocephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis marmorata <END> , haemangioma and syndactyly--a distinctive <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> syndrome .
We describe nine children with a similar pattern of features including <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis marmorata <END> telangiectatica congenita .
All were large at birth and had a distinctive capillary haemangioma involving the philtrum and upper lip .
The seven who survived all developed <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> and had <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
Six developed body asymmetry and three had internal arteriovenous malformations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Syndactyly <END> of the second and third toes and/or the third and fourth fingers or toes was commonly seen .
All of the cases were <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> .
This condition is easily recognizable and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> .
Recurrent reciprocal 16p11 .2 rearrangements associated with global developmental delay , behavioural problems , dysmorphism , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and abnormal head size .
Deletion and the reciprocal duplication in 16p11 .2 were recently associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and developmental delay .
We indentified 27 deletions and 18 duplications of 16p11 .2 were identified in 0.6 % of all samples submitted for clinical array-CGH ( comparative genomic hybridisation ) analysis .
Detailed molecular and phenotypic characterisations were performed on 17 deletion subjects and ten subjects with the duplication .
The most common clinical manifestations in 17 deletion and 10 duplication subjects were speech/language delay and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> .
Other phenotypes in the deletion patients included motor delay (5 0% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( approximately 40% ) , behavioural problems ( approximately 40% ) , congenital anomalies ( approximately 30% ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> ( approximately 20% ) .
The phenotypes among duplication patients included motor delay ( 6/10 ) , behavioural problems ( especially <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <END> ( ADHD) ) ( 6/10 ) , congenital anomalies ( 5 /10 ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( 3/10 ) .
Patients with the 16p11 .2 deletion had statistically significant <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> ( p< 0.0017 ) and 6 of the 10 patients with the duplication had microcephaly .
One subject with the deletion was asymptomatic and another with the duplication had a normal cognitive and behavioural phenotype .
Genomic analyses revealed additional complexity to the 16p11 .2 region with mechanistic implications .
The chromosomal rearrangement was de novo in all but 2 of the 10 deletion cases in which parental studies were available .
Additionally , 2 de novo cases were apparently mosaic for the deletion in the analysed blood sample .
Three de novo and 2 inherited cases were observed in the 5 of 10 duplication patients where data were available .
Recurrent reciprocal 16p11 .2 deletion and duplication are characterised by a spectrum of primarily neurocognitive phenotypes that are subject to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> observed with deletion and ADHD and microcephaly seen in duplication patients support a diametric model of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum and psychotic spectrum behavioural phenotypes in genomic sister disorders .
Genetic analysis of PSORS1 distinguishes guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> and palmoplantar pustulosis .
The PSORS1 locus in the major histocompatibility complex region is the major genetic determinant for <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> vulgaris .
Within the PSORS1 region reside at least three potential candidate genes for <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> susceptibility .
Specific allelic variants of the genes HLA-Cw*6 , HCR*WWCC , and CDSN*5 are strongly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> vulgaris and are in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other .
We have genotyped the three <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> vulgaris susceptibility alleles of the PSORS1 locus in two clinical variants of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> ( guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> and palmoplantar pustulosis ) to study whether PSORS1 is also involved in the pathogenesis of these variants .
We also asked whether these two clinical subgroups could help us to distinguish the causative gene within the high-risk PSORS1 haplotype .
The association of guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> with the three PSORS1 susceptibility alleles was similar and even stronger than seen with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> vulgaris .
Palmoplantar pustulosis , however , did not show association with any of the three candidate genes at this locus .
Finally , no correlation with the age of onset for disease was observed .
Our results show conclusively that <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> vulgaris and guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> have a similar genetic basis for their association to PSORS1 , whereas palmoplantar pustulosis appears to be a distinct disorder .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> : overview and guidelines for management .
Families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> inherited predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> have been described .
More recently , germline E-cadherin/CDH1 mutations have been identified in hereditary diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> kindred .
The need to have protocols to manage and counsel these families in the clinic led a group of geneticists , gastroenterologists , surgeons , oncologists , pathologists , and molecular biologists to convene a workshop to produce consensus statements and guidelines for familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> .
Review of the available <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> pathology from people belonging to families with documented germline E-cadherin/CDH1 mutations confirmed that the gastric cancers were all of the diffuse type .
Criteria to define the different types of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> syndromes were agreed .
Foremost among these criteria was that review of histopathology should be part of the evaluation of any family with aggregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> cases .
Guidelines for genetic testing and counselling in hereditary diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> were produced .
Finally , a proposed strategy for clinical management in families with high penetrance <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> was defined .
Mutant GlialCAM causes megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts , benign familial <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> with retardation and autism .
Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts ( MLC ) is a leukodystrophy characterized by early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and delayed-onset neurological deterioration .
Recessive MLC1 mutations are observed in 75 % of patients with MLC .
Genetic-linkage studies failed to identify another gene .
We recently showed that some patients without MLC1 mutations display the classical phenotype ; others improve or become normal but retain <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> . To find another MLC-related gene , we used quantitative proteomic analysis of affinity-purified MLC1 as an alternative approach and found that GlialCAM , an IgG-like cell adhesion molecule that is also called HepaCAM and is encoded by HEPACAM , is a direct MLC1-binding partner .
Analysis of 40 MLC patients without MLC1 mutations revealed multiple different HEPACAM mutations .
Ten patients with the classical , deteriorating phenotype had two mutations , and 18 patients with the improving phenotype had one mutation .
Most parents with a single mutation had <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , indicating dominant inheritance .
In some families with dominant HEPACAM mutations , the clinical picture and magnetic resonance imaging normalized , indicating that HEPACAM mutations can cause benign familial <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> .
In other families with dominant HEPACAM mutations , patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with or without autism .
Further experiments demonstrated that GlialCAM and MLC1 both localize in axons and colocalize in junctions between astrocytes .
GlialCAM is additionally located in myelin .
Mutant GlialCAM disrupts the localization of MLC1- GlialCAM complexes in astrocytic junctions in a manner reflecting the mode of inheritance .
In conclusion , GlialCAM is required for proper localization of MLC1 .
HEPACAM is the second gene found to be mutated in MLC .
Dominant HEPACAM mutations can cause either <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with or without autism or benign familial <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> .

A missense mutation in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein as a cause of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Narcolepsy <END> is a rare sleep disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> excessive daytime sleepiness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> accounts for less than 10 % of all <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> cases .
However , documented multiplex families are very rare and causative mutations have not been identified to date . To identify a causative mutation in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> , we performed linkage analysis in the largest ever reported family , which has 12 affected members , and sequenced coding regions of the genome ( exome sequencing ) of three affected members with <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> .
We successfully mapped a candidate locus on chromosomal region 6p22.1 ( LOD score Â¼ 3.85 ) by linkage analysis .
Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation in the second exon of MOG within the linkage region .
A c.398 C> G mutation was present in all affected family members but absent in unaffected members and 775 unrelated control subjects .
Transient expression of mutant myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( MOG ) in mouse oligodendrocytes showed abnormal subcellular localization , suggesting an altered function of the mutant MOG . MOG has recently been linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders and is considered as a key autoantigen in multiple sclerosis and in its animal model , experimental autoimmune encephalitis .
Our finding of a pathogenic MOG mutation highlights a major role for myelin and oligodendrocytes in <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> and further emphasizes glial involvement in neurodegeneration and neurobehavioral disorders .

TUBA1A mutations : from isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> to familial <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> .
Mutations in the TUBA1A gene have been reported in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> and perisylvian <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> .
Twenty-five patients with malformations of cortical development ranging from <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> to <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> were screened for mutations in TU BA1 A .
Two novel heterozygous missense mutations in TUBA1A were identified : c.629A> G ( p.Tyr210Cys ) occurring de novo in a boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , and c.13A> C ( p.Ile5Leu ) affecting 2 sisters with <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> whose mother presented somatic mosaicism for the mutation .
Mutations in TUBA1A have been described in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> .
We report a mutation in TUBA1A as a cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> .
So far , all mutations in TUBA1A have occurred de novo , resulting in isolated cases .
This article describes familial recurrence of TUBA1A mutations due to somatic mosaicism in a parent .
These findings broaden the phenotypic spectrum associated with TUBA1A mutations and have implications for genetic counseling .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> of a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> ?
We report on 3 brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> .
Parents are first cousins once removed ; the father has apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> .
An apparently normal paternal uncle who is married to a second cousin also has a daughter with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> .
All similarly affected relatives have mild or borderline mental retardation .
The combination of anomalies may represent a previously undescribed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder .
Clinical and molecular characterization defines a broadened spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> ( ARPKD ) .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> ( ARPKD ) is generally considered an infantile disorder with the typical presentation of greatly enlarged echogenic kidneys detected in utero or within the neonatal period , often resulting in neonatal demise .
However , there is an increasing realization that survivors often thrive into adulthood with complications of the ductal plate malformation , manifesting as <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> and Caroli disease , becoming prominent .
Previous natural history studies have concentrated almost exclusively on the infantile presenting group .
However , developments in understanding the genetic basis of ARPKD , through identification of the disease gene , PKHD1 , have allowed exploration of the etiology in patients with ARPKD-like disease or <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> presenting later in childhood or as adults .
In the current study we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records , and where possible performed PKHD1 mutation screening , in patients diagnosed with ARPKD or <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> at the Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , from 1961 to 2004 .
Of a total of 133 cases reviewed , 65 were considered to meet the diagnostic criteria with an average duration of follow-up of 8.6 +/- 6.4 years .
Fifty-five cases had ARPKD and 10 had isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> with no or minimal renal involvement .
The patients were analyzed as 3 groups categorized by the age at diagnosis ; <1 years ( n = 22) , 1-20 years ( n = 23) , and >2 0 years ( n = 20) .
The presenting feature in the neonates was typically associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal enlargement <END> , but in the older groups , more often involved manifestations of liver disease , including hepatosplenomegaly , hypersplenism , variceal bleeding , and cholangitis .
During follow-up , 22 patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> renal insufficiency <END> and 8 developed end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) , most from the neonatal group .
Liver disease was evident on follow-up in all diagnostic groups but particularly prevalent in those diagnosed later in life .
A total of 12 patients died , 6 in the neonatal period , but 86 % of patients were alive at 40 years of age .
The likelihood of being alive without ESRD differed significantly between the diagnostic groups with 36% , 80% , and 88 % survival in the 3 diagnostic groups , respectively , 20 years after the diagnosis .
Considerable evidence of intrafamilial phenotype variability was observed .
Mutation analysis was performed in 31 families and at least 1 mutation was detected in 25 ( 81% ) , with 76 % of mutant alleles detected in those cases .
Consistent with the relatively mild disease manifestations in this population , the majority of changes were missense ( 79% ) and no case had 2 truncating changes .
Mutations were detected in all diagnostic groups , indicating that <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> with minimal kidney involvement can result from PKHD1 mutation .
The finding of 6 cases with no detected mutations may represent missed mutations or possible evidence of genetic heterogeneity .
The current study indicates a broadened spectrum for the ARPKD phenotype and that later presenting cases with predominant liver disease should be considered part of ARPKD .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Restless legs syndrome <END> : diagnostic criteria , special considerations , and epidemiology .
A report from the <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> diagnosis and epidemiology workshop at the National Institutes of Health .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Restless legs syndrome <END> is a common yet frequently undiagnosed sensorimotor disorder .
In 1995 , the International <START:PHENOTYPE> Restless Legs Syndrome <END> Study Group developed standardized criteria for the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> .
Since that time , additional scientific scrutiny and clinical experience have led to a better understanding of the condition .
Modification of the criteria is now necessary to better reflect that increased body of knowledge , as well as to clarify slight confusion with the wording of the original criteria .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> diagnostic criteria and epidemiology workshop at the National Institutes of Health .
Members of the International <START:PHENOTYPE> Restless Legs Syndrome <END> Study Group and authorities on epidemiology and the design of questionnaires and scales .
To modify the current criteria for the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> , to develop new criteria for the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> in the cognitively impaired elderly and in children , to create standardized criteria for the identification of augmentation , and to establish consistent questions for use in epidemiology studies .
The essential diagnostic criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> were developed and approved by workshop participants and the executive committee of the International <START:PHENOTYPE> Restless Legs Syndrome <END> Study Group . Criteria were also developed and approved for the additional aforementioned groups .
A novel KIT mutation results in <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> with progressive depigmentation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Piebaldism <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder of melanocyte development characterized by white skin ( leukoderma ) and white hair ( poliosis ) .
In general , <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> has been distinguished from vitiligo by the presence of lesions from birth , the <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperpigmented macules <END> of depigmented and normal skin , and the static course .
We hypothesized that an 8-year-old girl and her mother who had unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> of a progressive nature would have a novel mutation of the KIT gene , the gene that is altered in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> , or of the MITF ( microphthalmia activating transcription factor ) gene , which would be expected to cause type II Waardenburg syndrome , but is associated with a phenotype of progressive depigmentation in mice .
Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood of affected and unaffected family members , and the KIT and MITF genes were sequenced .
Genetic analysis of genomic DNA from both the mother and daughter with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> revealed a novel Val620Ala ( 1859 T>C ) mutation in the KIT gene , which was not detected in family members without progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> or in 52 normal control individuals .
This KIT mutation affects the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and thus predicts a severe phenotype , as was the case in this family .
Although other KIT mutations in the vicinity of codon 620 lead to the standard phenotype of static <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> , the Val620Ala mutation is novel and may result in a previously undescribed phenotype with melanocyte instability , leading to progressive loss of pigmentation as well as the progressive appearance of the <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperpigmented macules <END> .
Genotype-phenotype analysis of TCF4 mutations causing Pitt-Hopkins syndrome shows increased <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> activity with missense mutations .
Pitt-Hopkins syndrome is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , characteristic dysmorphic features , and susceptibility to childhood-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and intermittent episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperventilation <END> .
This syndrome is caused by haploinsufficiency of TCF4 , which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor .
Missense , nonsense , splice-site mutations , and gene deletions have been found in individuals with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome .
Previous reports have suggested that the Pitt-Hopkins syndrome phenotype is independent of mutation or deletion type .
We screened 13 ,186 individuals with microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization .
We also conducted a review of the literature and statistical analysis of the phenotypic features for all individuals with confirmed mutations or deletions of TCF4 .
We identified seven individuals with TCF4 deletions .
All patients have features consistent with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome , although only three have breathing anomalies , and none has <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Our review of previously reported cases with TCF4 mutations and deletions showed that all patients with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome reported to date have severe psychomotor retardation , the onsets of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperventilation <END> episodes are limited to the first decade in most reported patients with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperventilation <END> episodes are more common than <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and are seen in the oldest patients , and individuals with missense TCF4 mutations are more likely to develop <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
On the basis of an analysis of published cases , we propose a genotype-phenotype correlation of increased <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> activity with missense TCF4 mutations .
Fatal infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy and renal dysfunction due to cytochrome-c-oxidase deficiency .
A 1-month-old boy was admitted because of <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> .
He was floppy and had bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , diminished reflexes , and poor suck .
He had aspiration pneumonia , developed <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and died at age 3 1/2 months .
Laboratory data showed <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> aminoaciduria <END> .
He was an only child , and family history was negative .
Muscle biopsy showed large clumps of granules positive with oxidative enzyme stains and increased lipid droplets .
Ultrastructural studies showed large aggregates of mitochondria , many of which were greatly enlarged and contained disoriented or concentric whorls of cristae and paracrystalline inclusions .
Cytochrome c oxidase was absent in fresh frozen sections by histochemical staining .
By biochemical assay , cytochrome c oxidase ( cytochrome aa3 ) was 6% of normal in muscle biopsy and undetectable in autopsy muscle ; spectra and content of cytochromes showed lack of cytochrome aa3 , decreased cytochrome b and normal cytochrome cc1 .
In kidney , cytochrome-c-oxidase activity was 38 % of normal and spectra showed decreased cytochromes aa3 and b .
The association of fatal infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and renal dysfunction was previously reported by Van Biervliet et al and appears to be a distinct nosologic entity , one of the few biochemically defined <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathies .
Clinical and molecular genetic spectrum of congenital deficiency of the leptin receptor .
A single family has been described in which <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> results from a mutation in the leptin-receptor gene ( LEPR) , but the prevalence of such mutations in severe , early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> has not been systematically examined .
We sequenced LEPR in 300 subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphagia <END> and severe early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , including 90 probands from consanguineous families , and investigated the extent to which mutations cosegregated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and affected receptor function .
We evaluated metabolic , endocrine , and immune function in probands and affected relatives .
Of the 300 subjects , 8 ( 3% ) had nonsense or missense LEPR mutations--7 were homozygotes , and 1 was a compound heterozygote .
All missense mutations resulted in impaired receptor signaling .
Affected subjects were characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphagia <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , alterations in immune function , and <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed puberty <END> due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism .
Serum leptin levels were within the range predicted by the elevated fat mass in these subjects .
Their clinical features were less severe than those of subjects with congenital leptin deficiency .
The prevalence of pathogenic LEPR mutations in a cohort of subjects with severe , early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> was 3% . Circulating levels of leptin were not disproportionately elevated , suggesting that serum leptin cannot be used as a marker for leptin-receptor deficiency .
Congenital leptin-receptor deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis in any child with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphagia <END> and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in the absence of developmental delay or dysmorphism .

Plasma lipoproteins in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> and monogenic familial hypertriglyceridemia .
Plasma lipoprotein concentration , composition , and size were evaluated in two common familial forms of hypertriglyceridemia and compared with those in normal subjects .
The very low density lipoproteins ( VLDL ) were triglyceride-enriched in familial hypertriglyceridemia ( triglyceride/apoprotein B ratio : 25.7 +/- 8 .9 ) as compared to normal ( 9.6 +/- 12 .2 , P < 0.001 ) or familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> ( 9.7 +/- 3.3 , P < 0.001 ) .
The diameter of VLDL was larger in familial hypertriglyceridemia ( 3.27 +/- 0.28 pm ) than in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> ( 2.87 +/- 0.16 pm , P < 0.02 ) .
Although in familial hypertriglyceridemia VLDL tended to be larger , and in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> VLDL tended to be smaller than normal ( 3.08 +/- 0.48 pm) , neither of these differences were significant .
While VLDL was normally distributed in the control population , the size was skewed to larger particles in familial hypertriglyceridemia with fewer small particles ( P < 0.05 ) and skewed to smaller particles in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> with fewer large particles ( P < 0.05 ) .
VLDL was reciprocally related to low density lipoproteins ( LDL ) in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> ( r = -0.8 0 to -0.87 ) suggesting that the concentrations of these individual lipoprotein groups were somehow interrelated .
There was no significant relationship between these two lipoprotein classes in familial hypertriglyceridemia or in normals .
In familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> , the apoprotein A-I/A-II ratio was below normal ( P < 0.01 ) suggestive of low HDL(2 ) levels .
This change in apoprotein composition was independent of VLDL or LDL concentration .
In familial hypertriglyceridemia , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol was reduced ( 33% below mean normal ) and HDL triglyceride was increased ( by 46% ) , while the concentration of apoA- I and apoA-II was normal .
VLDL triglyceride was inversely related to HDL cholesterol in familial hypertriglyceridemia ( r = -0.74 , P < 0.005 ) , but not in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> .
The large , triglyceride-enriched VLDL observed in familial hypertriglyceridemia is compatible with the reported increase in VLDL triglyceride synthesis seen in this disorder .
The increase in VLDL apoprotein B synthesis previously reported in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> was associated with VLDL of normal composition .
The changes in HDL cholesterol in these two disorders might reflect exchange of triglyceride between VLDL and HDL or could be related to transfer of surface components during the catabolism of VLDL .
The reciprocal relationship between various components of VLDL and LDL seen in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> , but not in familial hypertriglyceridemia or in normal subjects , might provide some insight into the pathological abnormalities in these disorders .
The differences between these two common familial forms of hypertriglyceridemia provide further support that they are distinct entities .-Brunzell , J . D. , J . J . Albers , A . Chait , S . M . Grundy , E . Groszek , and G . B . McDonald .

Gender , genotype , and phenotype differences in Smith-Magenis syndrome : a meta-analysis of 105 cases .
Smith-Magenis syndrome ( SMS ) is a multisystem disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , a distinctive behavioral phenotype , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep disturbance <END> .
We undertook a comprehensive meta-analysis to identify genotype-phenotype relationships to further understand the clinical variability and genetic factors involved in SMS .
Clinical and molecular information on 105 patients with SMS was obtained through research protocols and a review of the literature and analyzed using Fisher 's exact test with two-tailed p values .
Several differences in these groups of patients were identified based on genotype and gender .
Patients with RAI1 mutation were more likely to exhibit overeating , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , polyembolokoilamania , self-hugging , muscle cramping , and dry skin and less likely to have <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , hearing loss , frequent ear infections , and heart defects when compared with patients with deletion , while a subset of small deletion cases with deletions spanning from TNFRSF13B to MFAP4 was less likely to exhibit <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , dental anomalies , iris abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> head-banging <END> , and hyperactivity .
Significant differences between genders were also identified , with females more likely to have <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , eating/appetite problems , cold hands and feet , and frustration with communication when compared with males .
These results confirm previous findings and identify new genotype-phenotype associations including differences in the frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , hearing loss , ear infections , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , overeating , heart defects , self-injury , self-hugging , dry skin , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and hyperactivity among others based on genotype .
Additional studies are required to further explore the relationships between genotype and phenotype and any potential discrepancies in health care and parental attitudes toward males and females with SMS .
Clinical features distinguish childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> associated with tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) from <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> in the general paediatric population .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Chordoma <END> , an age-dependent rare cancer , arises from notochordal remnants .
Fewer than 5 % of chordomas occur in children .
Tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> neurocutaneous syndrome characterised by abnormal tissue growths in multiple organ systems .
Reports of <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> in children with TSC suggest that TSC1 and TSC2 mutations may contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> aetiology .
To determine whether the 10 TS C-associated childhood chordomas reported in the literature are representative of <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> in the general paediatric population , the authors compared age at diagnosis , primary site and outcome in them with results from a systematic assessment of 65 paediatric <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> cases reported to the US population-based cancer registries contributing to the SEER Program of the National Cancer Institute . TS C-associated paediatric chordomas differed from chordomas in the general paediatric population : median age at diagnosis ( 6.2 months , TSC , vs 12 .5 years , SEER) ; anatomical site (40% sacral , TSC , vs 9.4% sacral , SEER) ; and site-specific age at diagnosis ( all four sacral chordomas diagnosed during the fetal or neonatal period , TSC , vs all six sacral chordomas diagnosed at >15 years , SEER ) .
Finally , three of four patients with TS C-associated sacral <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> were alive and tumour-free at 2.2 , 8 and 19 years after diagnosis versus a median survival of 36 months among paediatric patients with sacral <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> in SEER .
These results strengthen the association between paediatric <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> and TS C . Future clinical and molecular studies documenting the magnitude and clinical spectrum of the joint occurrence of these two diseases should provide the basis for delineating the biological relationship between them .
A new congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> structural abnormalities .
We report a new form of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> ( CMD ) in 4 patients from three unrelated families with probable autosomal-recessive inheritance .
All patients had the clinical characteristics of merosin-positive congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> , but had marked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The disease was <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> and 1 patient died from <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> at the age of 13 years .
In addition to dystrophic changes with necrosis and regeneration in muscle , the most striking finding was <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> depletion in the center of the sarcoplasm .
Mitochondria at the periphery of fibers were markedly enlarged ( "megaconial " appearance ) with complicated cristae , and contained a normal amount of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA by in situ hybridization .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> enlargement may represent functional compensation for <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> depletion in the central sarcoplasm , where myofibrillar degeneration occurred .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> cranium bifidum <END> and symmetric <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> are the same entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cranium bifidum <END> is literally " cleft skull. " Numerous reports describe the anatomy of this defect , and crude estimates of the population prevalence suggest it is a relatively infrequent occurrence .
McKusick 's catalog contains only one family with <START:PHENOTYPE> cranium bifidum <END> but several familial reports of symmetrical <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> .
Available information indicates that <START:PHENOTYPE> cranium bifidum <END> and symmetrical <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> are inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion and occur in orientals , blacks , whites , and native Americans .
Here we report on a family with serial radiographs that document ontogenic development of <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> in late childhood and adulthood from apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> cranium bifidum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> during infancy and early childhood .
We conclude that these are the same entity , differentiated only by the time during life in which the defect is demonstrated .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Maturity-onset diabetes of the young <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> ) .
This review summarized aspects of the widening scope , phenotypic expression , natural history , recognition , pathogeneses , and heterogenous nature of <START:PHENOTYPE> maturity-onset diabetes of the young <END> ( MODY) , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> inherited subtype of NIDDM , which can be recognized at a young age .
There are differences in metabolic , hormonal , and vascular abnormalities in different ethnic groups and even among Caucasian pedigrees .
In <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> patients with low insulin responses , there is a delayed and decreased insulin and C-peptide secretory response to glucose from childhood or adolescence , even before glucose intolerance appears ; it may represent the basic genetic defect .
The nondiabetic siblings have had normal insulin responses for decades .
The fasting hyperglycemia of some <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> has been treated successfully with sulfonylureas for more than 30 years .
In a few , after years or decades of diabetes , the insulin and C-peptide responses to glucose are so low that they may resemble those of early Type I diabetes .
The rate of progression of the insulin secretory defect over time does distinguish between these two types of diabetes .
In contrast are patients from families who have very high insulin responses to glucose despite glucose intolerance and fasting hyperglycemia similar to those seen in patients with low insulin responses .
In many of these patients , there is in vivo and in vitro evidence of insulin resistance .
Whatever its mechanism , the compensatory insulin responses to nutrients must be insufficient to maintain normal carbohydrate tolerance .
This suggests that diabetes occurs only in those patients who have an additional islet cell defect , i.e. , insufficient beta cell reserve and secretory capacity .
In a few <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> pedigrees with high insulin responses to glucose and lack of evidence of insulin resistance , an insulin is secreted which is a structurally abnormal , mutant insulin molecule that is biologically ineffective .
No associations have been found between specific HLA antigens and <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> in Caucasian , black , and Asian pedigrees .
Linkage studies of the insulin gene , the insulin receptor gene , the erythrocyte/Hep G2 glucose transporter locus , and the apolipoprotein B locus have shown no association with <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> .
Vascular disease may be as prevalent as in conventional NIDDM .
Because of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission and penetrance at a young age , <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> is a good model for further investigations of etiologic and pathogenetic factors in NIDDM , including the use of genetic linkage strategies to identify diabetogenic genes .
Infantile onset spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with sensory neuropathy : a new inherited disease .
We report the clinical findings in 19 Finnish patients , including six pairs of siblings , with a new , early onset spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
The slowly progressive clinical symptoms manifested between one and two years of age in previously healthy infants .
The first manifestation of children at that age was <START:PHENOTYPE> clumsiness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of ability to walk <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> athetosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle hypotonia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of deep tendon reflexes <END> were discovered on clinical examination .
By school age <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> were diagnosed , while sensory neuropathy developed by adolescence .
In addition , an acute crisis with <START:PHENOTYPE> status epilepticus <END> was a late manifestation .
We found a marked decrease in sensory nerve condition velocities , a progressive loss of myelinated fibers in sural nerve specimen , and abnormal background activity in EEG with advancing age .
The main finding in neuroradiological investigations was cerebellar atrophy.
The occurrence of the disease in siblings and lack of manifestations in parents indicate recessive inheritance .
Clinical progression and genetic analysis in hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic gait <END> gene 11 ( SPG11 ) .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( HSP ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> ( CC ) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder classified as a complicated form of <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> .
Some patients with HSP with thin CC have previously been described in Japanese families , and the genetic locus was linked to chromosome 15q13-15 .
Our objective was to further clinically and genetically characterize HSP with thin CC .
We describe the clinical , structural , and functional follow-up and the genetic characterization of 2 sisters aged 26 and 31 years who had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> and cognitive impairment .
Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a thin CC with progressing frontoparietal <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical atrophy <END> paralleled by <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive decline <END> .
Using transcranial magnetic stimulation , we delineated a lack of transcallosal inhibition .
Images obtained with(18 )fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed reduced cortical and thalamic hypometabolism that decreased further within 4 years .
Additionally , combined axonal loss and demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy were present .
Because other family members were not affected , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> was considered likely .
Genetic analysis of this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> HSP was consistent with the linkage to 15q13-15 ( markers D15 S971 , D15 S118 , D15 S994 , and D15 S659 ) .
No mutation was found within the SLC12A6 gene .
Progressive axonal degeneration occurs in the corticocortical projections , corticospinal tract , and peripheral nerves in HSP with thin CC linking to chromosome 15q13-15 in a German pedigree .
Mapping of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> chronic distal <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> to chromosome 11q13 .
Distal <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> is a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders caused by progressive anterior horn cell degeneration and characterized by progressive motor weakness and muscular atrophy , predominantly in the distal parts of the limbs .
Here we report on chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> distal <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> in a large , inbred family with onset at various ages .
Because this condition had some of the same clinical features as <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> with respiratory distress , we tested the disease gene for linkage to chromosome 11q and mapped the disease locus to chromosome 11q13 in the genetic interval that included the <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> with respiratory distress gene ( D11 S1889-D11 S1321 , Z(max ) = 4.59 at theta = 0 at locus D11S4136 ) .
The sequencing of IGHMBP2 , the human homologue of the mouse neuromuscular degeneration gene ( nmd ) that accounts for <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> with respiratory distress , failed to detect any mutation in our chronic distal <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> patients , suggesting that <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> with respiratory distress and chronic distal <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> are caused by distinct genes located in the same chromosomal region .
In addition , the high intrafamilial variability in age at onset raises the question of whether nonallelic modifying genes could be involved in chronic distal spinal muscular atrophy.
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> with ubiquitin-positive , tau-negative inclusions .
To describe the clinical features , neuropathology , and genetic studies in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> ( FTD ) .
Clinical Pick 's disease , or FTD with <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , has been described in several families linked to chromosome 17 ( FTD P-17 ) .
Most of these have shown tau protein mutations .
The clinical and pathologic variations in these families resemble the spectrum of sporadic FTD or " Pick complex. " Clinical and behavioral analysis of the affected members with extensive histochemical and neuropathologic description of three cases , genetic analysis of three clinically affected members and seven at risk members to assess linkage to chromosome 17 , and sequencing of the tau gene in two patients were performed .
The clinical pattern shows a highly stereotypic <START:PHENOTYPE> disinhibition <END> dementia with late extrapyramidal features , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> mutism <END> , and terminal dysphagia in three generations of affected individuals .
Neuropathology showed frontotemporal atrophy , and microscopically tau- and synuclein-negative and ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions , in the background of superficial cortical spongiosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> .
Tau expression was restricted to oligodendroglia .
All exons and surrounding introns of the tau gene were sequenced , and no mutation or disease-related polymorphisms were detected in either of two affected pedigree members .
This family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> ( FTD ) shows no tau expression in neurons .
The ubiquitin-positive , tau-negative inclusions have been described before in FTD with and without motor neuron disease , but not in a familial form .
The clinical and some pathologic features are similar to those of several of the families included in descriptions of FTD with <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> linked to chromosome 17 , but the linkage to tau has been excluded .
The defect in this family , however , could be functionally related to tau mutations .
Optiz <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> syndrome : report of two cases .
We report two patients with Opitz <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> syndrome .
Both children showed the pattern of abnormal findings characteristic of this syndrome , including <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> upslanted palpebral fissures <END> , inner <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> , broad alveolar ridges , small chin , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> loose skin <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> and cardiac defect .
An 8-week-old girl had multiple gingival frenula , brachydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly of toes <END> and anal stenosis in addition , while a boy who died at 28 h from cardiac failure showed multiple joint contractures , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal cortical cysts <END> .
Genetic and phenotypic <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> in patients with mandibuloacral dysplasia-associated lipodystrophy.
Mandibuloacral dysplasia ( MAD ) is a phenotypically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> , rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by mandibular and <START:PHENOTYPE> clavicular hypoplasia <END> , acroosteolysis , delayed closure of cranial sutures , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> , and mottled cutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> .
Patients with MAD develop two patterns of <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> : type A pattern , with loss of sc fat from the extremities and normal or slight excess in the neck and truncal regions ; and type B pattern , with a more generalized loss of sc fat involving the face , trunk , and extremities .
Recently , affected patients from five consanguineous Italian pedigrees with partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> ( type A ) were reported to have a homozygous R527H mutation in LMNA ( lamin A/C ) gene .
We carried out mutational analysis of LMNA in affected patients from six pedigrees . Affected patients from two pedigrees with type A <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> had the homozygous R527H mutation in LMNA .
The other four affected subjects who had type B <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> did not have any mutation in the exons and splice site junctions of LMNA ; RNA extracted from lymphoblasts of two of these patients also revealed normal sequence .
In these four subjects , sequencing of other known genes implicated in lipodystrophies , i.e . AGPAT2 , Seipin , and PPARG also revealed no substantial alterations .
We conclude that MAD is a genetically and phenotypically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> disorder .
Besides LMNA gene , other as yet unmapped loci could be linked to MAD .
Early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular motor apraxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> is caused by mutations in a new HIT superfamily gene .
Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( FRDA) , the most common <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> neurodegenerative disease among Europeans and people of European descent , is characterized by an early onset ( usually before the age of 25) , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , sensory loss , absence of tendon reflexes and pyramidal <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of the legs .
We have recently identified a unique group of patients whose clinical presentations are characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> , early age of onset , FRDA-like clinical presentations and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> .
Linkage to the FRDA locus , however , was excluded .
Given the similarities of the clinical presentations to those of the recently described <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> ( AOA ) linked to chromosome 9p13 , we confirmed that the disorder of our patients is also linked to the same locus .
We narrowed the candidate region and have identified a new gene encoding a member of the histidine triad ( HIT) superfamily as the 'causative ' gene .
We have called its product aprataxin ; the gene symbol is APTX .
Although many HIT proteins have been identified , aprataxin is the first to be linked to a distinct phenotype .
Positional cloning uncovers mutations in PLCE1 responsible for a <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> variant that may be reversible .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephrotic syndrome <END> , a malfunction of the kidney glomerular filter , leads to <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> and , in steroid-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> , end-stage kidney disease .
Using positional cloning , we identified mutations in the phospholipase C epsilon gene ( PLCE1 ) as causing early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> with end-stage kidney disease .
Kidney histology of affected individuals showed <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse mesangial sclerosis <END> ( DMS ) .
Using immunofluorescence , we found PLCepsilon1 expression in developing and mature glomerular podocytes and showed that DMS represents an arrest of normal glomerular development .
We identified IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 as a new interaction partner of PLCepsilon1 .
Two siblings with a missense mutation in an exon encoding the PLCepsilon1 catalytic domain showed histology characteristic of <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> .
Notably , two other affected individuals responded to therapy , making this the first report of a molecular cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> that may resolve after therapy .
These findings , together with the zebrafish model of human <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> generated by plce1 knockdown , open new inroads into pathophysiology and treatment mechanisms of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Novel compound heterozygous TULP1 mutations in a family with severe early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
To describe the clinical characteristics and determine the genetic defect in a Surinamese family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
Family members underwent blood sampling and ophthalmologic examinations .
After exclusion of all known mutations in all genes involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , a genome-wide linkage scan was performed using 11 ,55 5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms spread throughout the genome .
Mutation analysis of the TULP1 gene was performed by direct sequencing .
All affected family members had a severe retinal dystrophy with a history of nystagmus , low visual acuity , and nyctalopia since infancy .
The scotopic and photopic responses were nonrecordable on electroretinography.
A genome-wide scan suggested linkage to the chromosomal region containing the TULP1 gene .
Mutation analysis of TULP1 identified novel compound heterozygous mutations ( p.Arg482Trp and p.Leu504fsX140 ) in all affected family members .
The affected members of the Surinamese family have a severe early-onset form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , which is caused by compound heterozygous mutations in the TULP1 gene .
Clinical Relevance Clinical and molecular genetic characterization of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> may help to provide a more accurate prognosis in individual patients .
This study confirms that TULP1 mutations cause a severe early-onset form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> , ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , tubulopathy , and KCNJ10 mutations .
Five children from two consanguineous families presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> beginning in infancy and severe ataxia , moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , and a renal salt-losing tubulopathy with normotensive <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis <END> .
We investigated the genetic basis of this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disease , which we call the EAST syndrome ( the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , and tubulopathy ) .
Whole-genome linkage analysis was performed in the four affected children in one of the families .
Newly identified mutations in a potassium-channel gene were evaluated with the use of a heterologous expression system .
Protein expression and function were further investigated in genetically modified mice .
Linkage analysis identified a single significant locus on chromosome 1q23.2 with a lod score of 4.98 .
This region contained the KCNJ10 gene , which encodes a potassium channel expressed in the brain , inner ear , and kidney .
Sequencing of this candidate gene revealed homozygous missense mutations in affected persons in both families .
These mutations , when expressed heterologously in xenopus oocytes , caused significant and specific decreases in potassium currents .
Mice with Kcnj10 deletions became dehydrated , with definitive evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> renal salt wasting <END> .
Mutations in KCNJ10 cause a specific disorder , consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , and tubulopathy.
Our findings indicate that KCNJ10 plays a major role in renal salt handling and , hence , possibly also in blood-pressure maintenance and its regulation .

Evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
A family-history cancer survey was conducted on 5 ,486 men who underwent a radical prostatectomy , for clinically localized <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> , in the Department of Urology at the Mayo Clinic during 1966 -95 ; 4,288 men responded to the survey .
Complex segregation analysis was performed to assess the genetic basis of age at diagnosis and the familial clustering of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
For the total group , no single-gene model of inheritance clearly explained familial clustering of disease , which could be partly explained by lack of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium , with an excess of homozygotes .
After accounting for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium , the best-fitting model that explained the familial aggregation and age at diagnosis was a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> susceptibility gene , and this model fitted best when probands were diagnosed at <6 0 years of age .
The model predicts that the frequency of the susceptibility gene in the population is .006 and that the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> by age 85 years is 89% among carriers of the gene and 3% among noncarriers .
A strength of our study is its large size , such that genetic models could be fitted within strata defined by the age of the proband .
Although the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model was consistently the best model , the parameter estimates differed somewhat ( P=.03 ) across the different age groups , suggesting genetic heterogeneity .
Additional evidence that the hereditary basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> is likely to be genetically complex was provided by the following : (1 ) there was a significantly elevated age-adjusted risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> among brothers of probands , compared with their fathers ( relative risk 1.5 [95 % confidence interval 1.4-1.7] ) ; (2 ) the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model predicted an excess of homozygotes , over that predicted by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ; and (3 ) the model-predicted risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> among relatives was inadequate when probands were diagnosed at age >=70 years .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , microphthalmia , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcification <END> .
We present two sisters with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , marked microphthalmia , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , cerebral and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcification <END> .
No evidence of intrauterine infection was found .
There have been previous reports of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcification <END> , and an intrauterine infection-like <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition , but the sibs in this report appear to represent a more severe form of such a condition or a previously undescribed entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> syndrome caused by mutated TAF2 .
The combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , pyramidal signs , abnormal corpus callosum , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> presents a diagnostic challenge .
We describe an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , pyramidal signs , <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> .
We previously mapped the locus for this disorder to 8q23.2-q24.12 ; the candidate region included 22 genes .
We performed Sanger sequencing of 10 candidate genes ; to ensure other genes in the candidate region do not harbor mutations , we sequenced the exome of one affected individual .
We identified two homozygous missense changes , p.Thr186Arg and p.Pro416His in TAF2 , which encodes a multisubunit cofactor for TFIID-dependent RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription , in all affected individuals .
We propose that the disorder is caused by the more conserved mutation p.Thr186Arg , with the second sequence change identified , p.Pro416His , possibly further negatively affecting the function of the protein .
However , it is unclear which of the two changes , or maybe both , represents the causative mutation .
A single missense mutation in TAF2 in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> was described in a large-scale study reporting on the identification of 50 novel genes .
We suggest that a mutation in TAF2 can cause this syndrome .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> : genetic counselling and antenatal diagnosis after the birth of an affected child .
We describe the clinical and genetic details of a series of microcephalic patients who were referred to the Genetic Counselling Service for the West of Scotland .
There were 29 isolated cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and 9 families with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
The sib recurrence risk was 19% , which reflects the high incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> in this series .
There was evidence for several varieties of recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
The most frequent , affecting 5 sib pairs , was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic quadriplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and profound mental handicap.
In 15 families with one microcephalic child , prenatal diagnosis by serial ultrasound scans was undertaken in 21 subsequent pregnancies .
Four recurrences of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> were detected in the third trimester and one recurrence was missed because no scans were performed after 24 wk gestation when the ultrasound measurements indicated satisfactory head growth .
The main reason for late diagnosis of affected fetuses was that head growth did not slow appreciably until the last trimester .
The high recurrence risk in this prospective series emphasizes the contribution of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> amongst patients of our Genetic Counselling Service .
Monosomy 1p36 .
We have reviewed published reports on patients with segmental aneusomy for chromosome 1p36 to help geneticists and other health professionals in the recognition of this emerging chromosomal syndrome .
Terminal deletions of the short arm of chromosome 1 are associated with hypotonia and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> ( usually severe ) , growth abnormalities ( <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ) , and craniofacial dysmorphism with a <START:PHENOTYPE> large anterior fontanelle <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , deep set eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , ear asymmetry , a <START:PHENOTYPE> pointed chin <END> , and orofacial clefting .
Minor cardiac malformations , cardiomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular dilatation <END> are the more common additional findings .
Sensorineural hearing loss and variable ophthalmological anomalies have also been frequently observed .
Although the deletions can be detected by high resolution cytogenetic studies , confirmation by fluorescence in situ hybridisation is required in most cases .
The majority of deletions are maternally derived .
Molecular characterisation of 1p36 deletions has been undertaken in several cases , and it is likely that this condition is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> and parkinsonism-dementia complex of the Kii Peninsula of Japan : clinical and neuropathological study and tau analysis .
We report the first case of neuropathologically verified parkinsonism-dementia complex of the Kii peninsula , together with the patient 's brother , who had <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> .
The propositus woman developed <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> at 63 years of age and died at 70 without displaying clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> .
The brain exhibited marked atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes .
Microscopically , there were many neurofibrillary tangles in the central nervous system , most markedly in the mesial temporal lobe and deep nuclei , as well as changes of <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> but no senile plaques or Lewy bodies .
Neurofibrillary tangles exhibited twisted tubule structures on electon microscopic examination , and an analysis of insoluble tau protein extracted from the fresh brain revealed a 60- , 64- , 68-kD triplet .
The tau gene exhibited no mutations .
Her brother developed progressive bulbar palsy-type <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> at 45 years of age and died at 49 without presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
Neuropathological examination revealed not only pathologic features of <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> but also a moderate number of neurofibrillary tangles in the temporal cortex and deep nuclei .
The siblings were neuropathologically similar despite their different clinical manifestations .
These findings suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> and parkinsonism-dementia complex of this family may be phenotypic variants of a tauopathy caused by genetic abnormalities .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Anaemia <END> and macrocytosis--unrecognized features in cartilage -hair hypoplasia .
Cartilage -hair hypoplasia is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> osteo-chondrodysplasia which results in <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , sparse hair and impaired cell-mediated immunity .
In a study of 88 Finnish patients we found episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> and/or macrocytosis during childhood in 86 % of the patients .
The reticulocyte index was always low in relation to <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> .
Bone marrow examination revealed decreased erythropoiesis in six of eight anaemic patients studied .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Anaemia <END> was most prevalent and severe during infancy .
Spontaneous recovery occurred before adulthood in all patients except in three infants with fatal hypoplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> .
Sixty-two percent of the patients had had <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphopenia <END> and 24% <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> significantly correlated to severity of immunodeficiency and growth failure and to presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Disordered erythrogenesis is an integral feature of cartilage -hair hypoplasia and may , together with growth failure and immunodeficiency , reflect a generalized defect in cellular proliferation .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal lymphangiectasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> : further case of Hennekam syndrome with a severe phenotype .
We report on an Italian patient affected by severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> of lower limbs , genitalia and face , <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal lymphangiectasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
He has a <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> .
We propose that he presents with a severe form of Hennekam syndrome .

Congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> ( Beals syndrome ) .
Congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> ( CCA ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder akin to , but usually less severe than , Marfan syndrome .
The clinical features are <START:PHENOTYPE> marfanoid habitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , crumpled ears , camptodactyly of the fingers and <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures of the elbows <END> , knees , and hips , and mild muscle hypoplasia especially of the calf muscles .
Many patients have <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> and , very occasionally , <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic root dilatation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> have been described .
Linkage to a gene coding for fibrillin on chromosome 5q23-31 has been shown in several kindreds .
The prognosis for a normal lifespan is good and improvement in joint contractures is usual .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lissencephaly <END> .
A human brain malformation associated with deletion of the LIS1 gene located at chromosome 17p13 .
We review the clinical phenotype , pathological changes , and results of cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies in 90 probands with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> ( smooth brain ) with emphasis on patients with the classical form ( type I ) .
We also describe the recent discovery of the <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> gene ( LIS1 ) , deletions of which have been implicated as the cause of this disorder in many patients .
We have performed clinical , cytogenetic , and molecular genetic studies of 25 probands with Miller-Dieker syndrome and 65 probands with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> sequence ( ILS ) .
We have further subdivided patients with ILS into those with classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> and those with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> variants .
We consider primarily our own published and unpublished data , but include references to studies of other series of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Visible cytogenetic deletions of 17p13.3 were detected in 14 of 25 Miller-Dieker syndrome probands , and either visible cytogenetic or submicroscopic deletions in 23 (92% ) of 25 .
Submicroscopic deletions were detected in eight of 45 patients with all types of ILS . If only ILS patients with the classical form are considered , we detected deletions in eight ( 38% ) of 21 . Deletions of the <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> critical region in chromosome 17p13.3 , including LIS1 , appear to be the most frequent cause of classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Molecular cytogenetic studies , particularly fluorescence in situ hybridization , should be performed in all such patients .
LIS1 shows homology to genes involved in signal transduction , which may be its function in development of the telencephalon .
Other genetic causes of classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> and genetic and nongenetic causes of other types of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> exist and are under study .
Agonadism in two sisters with XY gonosomal constitution , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , severely retarded bone age , and multiple extragenital malformations : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
We report on 12 - and 14-year old sisters with a 46 , XY chromosome constitution , normal female external genitalia , and absence of gonadal tissue .
Except for <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , right <START:PHENOTYPE> renal agenesis <END> and malrotation of the colon in the elder sister , the internal organs were normal .
Both were mentally retarded , of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and had extremely retarded bone age .
In addition , they had an almost identical pattern of minor anomalies : peculiar face , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypodontia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> inverted nipples <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thoracolumbar scoliosis <END> , "dysplastic " hips , partial clino-/syndactyly of toes .
The occurrence of a basically similar set of malformations in two sisters and the first cousin consanguinity of the parents suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
The conserved region of the SRY gene ( [high mobility group ] HMG box ) was sequenced in the elder sib and was normal .
No consistent malformations are observed at present in agonadal patients .
This supports the idea that several autosomal genes have the potential of influencing the sequence of events of sex determination .
Clinical delineation and localization to chromosome 9p13.3-p12 of a unique dominant disorder in four families : hereditary inclusion body <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , Paget disease of bone , and <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , Paget disease of bone , and dementia constitute a unique disorder ( MIM 605382 ) .
Here we describe the clinical , biochemical , radiological , and pathological characteristics of 49 affected ( 23 male , 26 female ) individuals from four unrelated United States families .
Among these affected individuals 90 % have <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , 43 % have Paget disease of bone , and 37% have premature <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> .
EMG shows <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathic changes <END> and muscle biopsy reveals nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathic changes <END> or blue-rimmed vacuoles .
After candidate loci were excluded , a genome-wide screen in the large Illinois family showed linkage to chromosome 9 ( maximum LOD score 3.64 with marker D9S301 ) .
Linkage analysis with a high density of chromosome 9 markers generated a maximum two-point LOD score of 9.29 for D9S1791 , with a maximum multipoint LOD score of 12 .24 between D9S304 and D9S178 8 .
Subsequent evaluation of three additional families demonstrating similar clinical characteristics confirmed this locus , refined the critical region , and further delineated clinical features of this unique disorder .
Hence , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> inclusion body <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> ( HIBM) , Paget disease of bone ( PDB) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> ( FTD ) localizes to a 1.08-6.46 cM critical interval on 9p13.3-12 in the region of autosomal recessive IBM2 .

Clinical spectrum of infantile free sialic acid storage disease .
Infantile free sialic acid storage disease ( ISSD ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> metabolic disorder caused by a lysosomal membrane transport defect , resulting in accumulation of free sialic acid within lysosomes .
Only a few cases have been described .
We report on three new cases of ISSD with different modes of presentation : an infant with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> , a case of fetal and neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> , and a case of fetal <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> with esophageal atresia type III. From these patients and a review of the literature ( 27 cases total ) we draw the following conclusions .
1 ) " Coarse facies, " fair complexion , hepatosplenomegaly , and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> are constant findings in this disorder .
2 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> Nephrotic syndrome <END> occurred in most cases ( four in seven ) in which renal evaluation was performed .
Therefore , ISSD is an important cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrosis <END> in infants with a storage disorder phenotype .
3 ) Fetal/neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> or hydrops was the mode of presentation in 13 (6 0% ) of 21 cases .
Thus , ISSD enters in the differential diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops fetalis <END> with a storage disease phenotype .
4 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> Cardiomegaly <END> was evident in nine cases .
5 ) Corneae were always clear , and albinoid fundi were reported in five cases .
6 ) Dysostosis multiplex was not prominent .
7 ) Bone marrow aspiration could be negative .
8 ) Death ensued in early infancy with a mean age of 13.1 months .
All reported deaths were caused by respiratory infections .
Melorheostosis in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopoikilosis <END> .
We describe a 19-year-old woman with melorheostosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopoikilosis <END> ( mixed sclerosing bone dysplasia ) .
Her sister and mother had <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopoikilosis <END> , but no evidence of melorheostosis .
Isolated melorheostosis and melorheostosis with <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopoikilosis <END> are sporadic disorders .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Osteopoikilosis <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
Mixed sclerosing bone dysplasia in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopoikilosis <END> raises the possibility that the two bone disorders may be related .
This family and that of Butkus et al . [ 1997 : Am J Med Genet 72 :43-46 ] suggest that the melorheostosis could be due to a second mutation at the same locus as that which causes <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopoikilosis <END> .
Mutation of TRPM6 causes familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> with secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> with secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> ( OMIM 602014 ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disease that results in electrolyte abnormalities shortly after birth .
Affected individuals show severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> , which lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> tetany <END> .
The disorder has been thought to be caused by a defect in the intestinal absorption of magnesium , rather than by abnormal renal loss of magnesium .
Restoring the concentrations of serum magnesium to normal values by high-dose magnesium supplementation can overcome the apparent defect in magnesium absorption and in serum concentrations of calcium .
Life-long magnesium supplementation is required to overcome the defect in magnesium handling by these individuals .
We previously mapped the gene locus to chromosome 9q in three large inbred kindreds from Israel .
Here we report that mutation of TRPM6 causes <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> with secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> and show that individuals carrying mutations in this gene have abnormal renal magnesium excretion .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ptosis <END> of eyelids , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diastasis recti <END> , hip defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> in two sibs .
We report a distinct syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> eyelid ptosis <END> , convergent <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , abdominal muscle defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> hip dislocation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> in two brothers .
Consanguinity in their parents suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
A syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> monocytosis <END> .
We describe three siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> , and increased peripheral blood monocytes .
These children were born to apparently healthy parents in a family with one unaffected child .
Affected individuals had <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , severe developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , and brachydactyly .
The clinical courses were complicated by endocrine dysfunction , multiple respiratory , and <START:PHENOTYPE> skin infections <END> .
Laboratory studies showed normal karyotypes , normal lymphocyte function , and a peripheral blood <START:PHENOTYPE> monocytosis <END> with markedly abnormal morphology .
Mutation analysis of the seven genes ( SHH , ZIC2 , SIX3 , TGI , FTD GF1 , GLI2 , and PTCH ) known to be involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> was normal .
This is the first report demonstrating an association between abnormal mononuclear phagocytes and <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Keratitis <END> , hepatitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , and deafness : report and review of KID syndrome .
A 14-year-old girl with <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> and severe liver disease is compared to 35 reported cases of KID or Senter syndrome .
Common manifestations such as <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> ( 35/35 patients) , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> ( 33/34) , "ectodermal dysplasia " ( 25/28) , corneal abnormality ( 26/31 ) were present in the proposita , while less common manifestations such as chronic infections ( 15 /20) and neuromuscular disease ( 12/35 ) were absent .
Two families with vertical transmission and 28 sporadic cases are compatible with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of KID syndrome , while one inbred sibship with liver disease suggests the existence of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> .
The proposita was similar to the latter patients in having progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> necessitating liver transplantation ; she also had <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> (1 0/35 patients ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( 3/35 ) .
Hepatic findings included micronodular <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> , cholestasis , hyperplastic Kupffer cells , abundant Mallory 's hyaline , copper accumulation without steatosis , and normal peroxisomes .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> adducted thumb-club foot syndrome observed in Turkish cousins .
Male and female cousins , the offspring of consanguineous Turkish parents , have been affected by a hitherto unreported combination of problems comprising moderate to severe psychomotor developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular anterior chamber abnormality <END> , facial dysmorphisms ( broad , bossed forehead , <START:PHENOTYPE> late-closing fontanelle <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated ears <END> , downturned angles of mouth) , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> with severely <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> club feet <END> .
This striking phenotype has some similarities with the multiple pterygium syndrome ( Escobar syndrome ) , but it most likely represents a distinct condition caused by an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> gene defect .
Limb/pelvis hypoplasia/aplasia with <START:PHENOTYPE> skull defect <END> ( Schinzel <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> ) : distinctive features and prenatal detection .
Schinzel <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> syndrome is characterized by limb/pelvis hypoplasia/aplasia : specifically , intercalary limb deficiencies and absent or hypoplastic pelvic bones .
The phenotype is similar to that described in a related multiple malformation syndrome known as Al-Awadi/Raas-Rothschild syndrome .
The additional important feature of large parietooccipital skull defects without <START:PHENOTYPE> meningocele <END> , encephalocele , or other brain malformation has thus far been reported only in children with Schinzel <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> syndrome .
We recently evaluated a boy affected with Schinzel <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> born to nonconsanguineous healthy parents of Mexican origin .
A third-trimester fetal ultrasound scan showed severe limb deficiencies and an absent pelvis .
The infant died shortly after birth .
Dysmorphology examination , radiographs , and autopsy revealed quadrilateral intercalary limb deficiencies with preaxial toe polydactyly ; an absent pelvis and a 7 x 3-cm <START:PHENOTYPE> skull defect <END> ; and extraskeletal anomalies including microtia , telecanthus , micropenis with <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , renal cysts , stenosis of the colon , and a cleft alveolar ridge .
A normal 46 , XY karyotype was demonstrated , and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> was presumed on the basis of previously reported families .
This case report emphasizes the importance of recognizing severe pelvic and skull deficiencies ( either post- or prenatally ) in differentiating infants with Schinzel <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> from other multiple malformation syndromes that feature intercalary limb defects , including thalidomide embryopathy and Roberts-SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> .

Phenotypic spectrum and management issues in Kabuki syndrome .
To report the phenotypic spectrum and management issues of children with Kabuki syndrome ( Niikawa-Kuroki syndrome ) from North America .
A case series of children ( n = 18 ) with clinical findings of Kabuki syndrome .
Medical genetics clinics in Washington , Alaska , and Arizona .
Most patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> , and all had <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and hypotonia .
Feeding difficulties , with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , were common ; 5 patients required gastrostomy tube placement .
Developmental quotients/IQs in all but 2 were 60 or less .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> were seen in less than half of the patients , but ophthalmologic and otologic problems were common , particularly <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent otitis media <END> .
Congenital heart defects were present in 7 ( 39% ) ; 3 patients underwent repair of <START:PHENOTYPE> coarctation of the aorta <END> .
Other features included urinary tract anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> malabsorption <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> and dislocation , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura <END> , and in one patient , autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic anemia <END> and hypogammaglobulinemia .
All patients had negative family histories for Kabuki syndrome .
Kabuki syndrome is a mental retardation-malformation syndrome affecting multiple organ systems , with a broad spectrum of neuromuscular dysfunction and mental ability .
Given that 18 ethnically diverse patients were identified from 2 genetics programs , it appears that this syndrome is more common in North American non-Japanese patients than previously appreciated .
Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome : further delineation of a distinct syndrome with neonatal hemochromatosis phenotype , <START:PHENOTYPE> intractable diarrhea <END> , and hair anomalies .
We report on two sibs with syndromal congenital iron storage disease .
Prenatal symptoms were IUGR , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydramnios <END> , and placental hyperplasia .
Clinical anomalies included <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> and sparse , thin , <START:PHENOTYPE> curly hair <END> ( trichomalacia ) .
Clinical course was marked by intractable diarrhoea , with normal histological and enzymological studies , cholestatic <START:PHENOTYPE> jaundice <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> appearing after 30 days , and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> liver failure <END> , leading to death after a few months .
The only metabolic anomaly was progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> hypermethioninemia <END> .
Pathologic examination of both children showed a similar pattern of multivisceral iron deposit compatible with a diagnosis of neonatal hemochromatosis : extensive liver fibrosis or <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> with nodular regeneration , <START:PHENOTYPE> cholestasis <END> , ductular proliferation , and hepatic , pituitary , thyroidal , adrenal , and pancreatic iron deposition .
The unusual course for neonatal hemochromatosis in both sibs combined with concordant extrahepatic anomalies suggest that they could have a specific iron storage syndrome with possible <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> , probably similar to the sibship reported by Stanckler et al . [ Arch Dis Child , 57 : 212-216 , 1982 ] .
Teebi <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> syndrome .
Teebi ( 1987 ) described an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome with resemblance to craniofrontonasal dysplasia .
Here we present a 2 year 5 month old girl with Teebi syndrome showing a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> exophthalmos <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , a broad nasal tip , a <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , natal teeth , a thin upper lip , an <START:PHENOTYPE> everted lower lip <END> , a small chin , low-set ears , preauricular fistulas , a short neck , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , an <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> , clinodactyly of the 5th fingers with mild radial deviation of the distal phalanges of the middle fingers , mild pes adductus , an ectopic kidney , and normal psychomotor development .
Her mother and her grandmother had similar features .
Epidemiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> with special reference to the CHARGE association .
To present epidemiologic data on the relatively rare malformation <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> , based on a large collection of material and with special stress on the significance of the so-called CHARGE ( coloboma , heart defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> , retarded growth and development , genital anomaly , and ear defect with <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> ) association .
Data from three large registries of congenital malformations were used .
Based on more than 5 million births , 444 infants with <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> were identified .
The average rate of <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> is 0.82 per 10,000 and varies among programs .
There is no statistically significant difference between races in rates , even though white infants have a higher rate than those of other races .
The higher rate found in the California program is mainly attributable to unilateral , <START:PHENOTYPE> isolated cases <END> .
Unilateral atresia occurs equally often on the right and left .
Among all cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> , the sex distribution is normal , a slightly increased risk at twinning exists , and no effect of maternal age or parity is seen .
Chromosome anomalies are found in 6% of infants with <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> , and 21 infants ( 5% ) have monogenic syndromes or conditions .
An analysis of associated malformations ( present in 47 % of the infants without chromosome anomalies ) indicated that although a weak nonrandom association can be demonstrated between the malformations entering the so-called CHARGE complex , only a small proportion of infants with <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> and other components of that condition probably represent this entity .
The term CHARGE association seems to be overused in clinical practice .
To be meaningful , the term CHARGE should be restricted to infants with multiple malformations and <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> and/or coloboma combined with other cardinal malformations ( heart , ear , and genital ) and with a total of at least three cardinal malformations .
Growth retardation should not be used in the definition .
A clinical and molecular genetic study of a rare dominantly inherited syndrome ( MRCS ) comprising of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , rod-cone dystrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , and posterior staphyloma .
To phenotype and genetically map the disease locus in a family presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , rod-cone dystrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , and posterior staphyloma .
Six affected and three unaffected members of the pedigree were examined .
All individuals provided a history and underwent a full clinical examination with A-scan and B-scan ultrasonography and electrophysiological testing where appropriate .
PCR based microsatellite marker genotyping using a positional candidate gene approach was then performed on DNA samples extracted from venous blood provided by each subject .
The disorder is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait with variable expressivity and has a complex phenotype .
Affected individuals had bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , pulverulent-like <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> , a rod-cone dystrophy and posterior staphyloma ( MRCS ) .
Using a positional candidate gene approach , the authors have evidence suggestive of linkage of this disorder to a region on 11q13 within the <START:PHENOTYPE> nanophthalmos <END> 1 ( NNO1 ) genetic interval .
The small family size militates against achieving a LOD score of 3 , but the haplotype data and the position of the putative MRCS locus within a known <START:PHENOTYPE> nanophthalmos <END> locus are suggestive of linkage .
A candidate gene within this region ( ROM1 ) was screened and no mutations were found in affected members of the family .
This rare developmental disorder has some phenotypic similarities to <START:PHENOTYPE> nanophthalmos <END> and possibly maps to a locus within the genetic interval encompassing the NNO1 locus .
Screening of candidate genes within this region continues .
Facial and physical features of Aicardi syndrome : infants to teenagers .
Aicardi syndrome is a sporadic disorder that affects primarily females and is hypothesized to be caused by heterozygous mutations in an X-linked gene .
Its main features include of a triad of <START:PHENOTYPE> infantile spasms <END> , agenesis of the corpus callosum , and distinctive <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal lacunae <END> .
Additional common findings include moderate to <START:PHENOTYPE> profound mental retardation <END> , gray matter <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> , gyral anomalies , and vertebral and rib defects .
To date , no consistent facial dysmorphisms have been described .
We examined 40 girls with Aicardi syndrome and determined that consistent facial features appeared in over half the study participants and included a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent premaxilla <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> upturned nasal tip <END> , decreased angle of the nasal bridge , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse lateral eyebrows <END> .
Externally apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> was seen in 10/40 ( 25% ) .
Various skin lesions ( including multiple nevi , <START:PHENOTYPE> skin tags <END> , hemangiomas , one giant melanotic nevus , and a history of a previously removed angiosarcoma ) were present in 8/40 (20% ) .
Hand abnormalities were seen in 3/40 ( 7.5% ) and included camptodactyly , proximal placement of the thumb and hypoplasia of the fifth finger .
This study clearly delineates the existence of a distinctive facial phenotype of Aicardi syndrome not previously described .
We recommend that features of a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent premaxilla <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> upturned nasal tip <END> and vascular malformations /vascular tumors be added to the modified diagnostic criteria in order to improve the ability of geneticists to diagnose Aicardi syndrome .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and obesity--a new syndrome .
Five male members in four generations of the same family had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
The X-linked mode of inheritance , the distinctive facies , the normal size of the hands and feet , and the true <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> are the main characteristics .
Endocrine evaluation and histologic studies of the testes suggest partial hypogonadotropic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> .
This disorder represents a new syndrome distinct from others previously described .
AlstrÃ¶m syndrome .
AlstrÃ¶m Syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , single gene disorder caused by mutations in ALMS1 ( Chr 2p13) , a novel gene of currently unknown molecular function .
AlstrÃ¶m Syndrome is multisystemic , with <START:PHENOTYPE> cone-rod retinal dystrophy <END> leading to juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , obesity , <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> , and type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Very high incidences of additional disease phenotypes that may severely affect prognosis and survival include endocrine abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> and restrictive lung disease , and progressive hepatic and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> . Other clinical features in some patients are <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> , hyperlipidemia , hypogonadism , urological abnormalities , adult <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and bone-skeletal disturbances .
Most patients demonstrate normal intelligence , although some reports indicate delayed psychomotor and intellectual development .
The life span of patients with AlstrÃ¶m Syndrome rarely exceeds 40 years .
There is no specific therapy for AlstrÃ¶m Syndrome , but early diagnosis and intervention can moderate the progression of the disease phenotypes and improve the longevity and quality of life for patients .
Gene expression analysis in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> : reproducible up-regulation of several members of the apolipoprotein L family located in a high-susceptibility locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> on chromosome 22 .
We screened a custom-made candidate gene cDNA array comprising 300 genes .
Genes chosen have either been implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , make conceptual sense in the light of the current understanding of the disease , or are located on high-susceptibility chromosome locations .
The array screen using prefrontal cortex tissue from 10 <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and 10 control brains revealed robust up-regulation of apolipoprotein L1 ( apo L1 ) by 2.6-fold .
The finding was cross-validated in a blinded quantitative PCR study using prefrontal cortex tissue from the Stanley Foundation brain collection , Bethesda , MD . This collection consists of 15 <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , 15 bipolar disorder , 15 major depression , and 15 control individuals , all 60 brains being well-matched on conventional parameters , with antipsychotic drug exposure in the <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and bipolar disorder groups .
Significant up-regulation of apo L1 gene expression in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> was confirmed .
Using quantitative PCR , expression profiles of other members of the apo L family ( apo L2-L6 ) were investigated , showing that apo L2 and L4 were highly significantly up-regulated in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Results were then confirmed in an independent set of 20 <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and 20 control brains from Japan and New Zealand . Apo L proteins belong to the group of high density lipoproteins , with all six apo L genes located in close proximity to each other on chromosome 22q12 , a confirmed high-susceptibility locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and close to the region associated with velocardiofacial syndrome that includes symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Relation between mutations of the cystic fibrosis gene and idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
It is unknown whether genetic factors predispose patients to idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
In patients with cystic fibrosis , mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene typically cause pulmonary and <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic insufficiency <END> while rarely causing <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
We examined whether idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> is associated with CFTR mutations in persons who do not have lung disease of cystic fibrosis .
We studied 27 patients ( mean age at diagnosis , 36 years ) , 22 of whom were female , who had been referred for an evaluation of idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
DNA was tested for 17 CFTR mutations and for the 5T allele in intron 8 of the CFTR gene .
The 5T allele reduces the level of functional CFTR and is associated with an inherited form of infertility in males .
Patients with two abnormal CFTR alleles were further evaluated for unrecognized cystic fibrosis-related lung disease , and both base-line and CFTR-mediated ion transport were measured in the nasal mucosa .
Ten patients with idiopathic chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> ( 37 percent ) had at least one abnormal CFTR allele .
Eight CFTR mutations were detected ( prevalence ratio , 11 :1 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 5 to 23; P< 0.001 ) .
In three patients both alleles were affected ( prevalence ratio , 8 0:1 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 17 to 379 ; P< 0.001 ) .
These three patients did not have lung disease typical of cystic fibrosis on the basis of sweat testing , spirometry , or base-line nasal potential-difference measurements .
Nonetheless , each had abnormal nasal cyclic AMP-mediated chloride transport .
In a group of patients referred for evaluation of idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> , there was a strong association between mutations in the CFTR gene and <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
The abnormal CFTR genotypes in these patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> resemble those associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> male infertility <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> : presentation and diagnosis in children .
We report a new <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> kindred .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> is a recently described disease characterized by recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive renal failure <END> , associated with mutations in a renal chloride channel gene , chloride channel number 5 . Screening individuals at risk with renal ultrasonography and measurement of urinary excretion of low molecular weight proteins and calcium will exclude boys without <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> kindred and identify boys likely to have the disease .
Mutations in the KCNQ4 gene are responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> in four DFNA2 families .
We have previously found linkage to chromosome 1p34 in five large families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> ( DFNA2 ) .
In all five families , the connexin31 gene ( GJB3 ) , located at 1p34 and responsible for non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> in two small Chinese families , has been excluded as the responsible gene .
Recently , a fourth member of the KCNQ branch of the K+channel family , KCNQ4 , has been cloned .
KCNQ4 was mapped to chromosome 1p34 and a single mutation was found in three patients from a small French family with non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> .
In this study , we have analysed the KCNQ4 gene for mutations in our five DFNA2 families .
Missense mutations altering conserved amino acids were found in three families and an inactivating deletion was present in a fourth family .
No KCNQ4 mutation could be found in a single DFNA2 family of Indonesian origin .
These results indicate that at least two and possibly three genes responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> are located close together on chromosome 1p34 and suggest that KCNQ4 mutations may be a relatively frequent cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ichthyosis <END> follicularis with <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> .
We treated two unrelated boys with <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis , a rare skin disorder characterized by extensive noninflammatory spiny follicular hyperkeratoses , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , and generalized noncicatricial <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> .
This disorder must be differentiated from keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans ; ulerythema ophryogenes ; keratosis pilaris rubra atrophicans faciei ; atrichia with papular lesions ; atrophodermia vermiculata ; and keratitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> syndrome , all of which share some clinical features .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ichthyosis <END> follicularis with <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> appears to be a familial disorder , but too few cases have been reported to establish the exact mode of inheritance .
Maternal inheritance in cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> syndrome with neuromuscular disease .
Cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> syndrome ( CVS) , characterized by severe discrete episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> nausea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> , is a predominately childhood condition associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> and dysautonomic features .
Disease-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( mtDNA ) sequence variants are suggested by a strong maternal bias in the inheritance of <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , and the recent findings of mtDNA variants in a few children with CVS and additional neuromuscular disease manifestations ( " CVS+ " ) .
A clinical interview using a questionnaire was administered ( generally ) to one parent of 62 children with CVS+ .
Non-senile disease manifestations , including <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and dysautonomia-like symptoms , were far more common in matrilineal versus non-matrilineal relatives , including being present in 75 % of the mothers versus in only 11 % of the fathers ( P < 0.001 ) .
Overall , maternal inheritance is suggested in 86 % of the families ( in 65 % strongly so ) .
Disease manifestations in subjects and their affected matrilineal relatives are predominately intermittent and consistent with dysautonomia , including increased vital sign fluctuations .
Body fluid metabolites and muscle biopsy findings are consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> dysfunction in most cases tested .
We conclude that mtDNA sequence variants are at least risk factors in the development of disease in most children at this " severe " end of the CVS spectrum , likely involving a maternally inherited propensity towards dysautonomia .

Two brothers with facial anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic genitalia <END> , and a failure of psychomotor development .
We report on 2 brothers from a consanguineous Moslem family with prenatal onset of growth deficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic genitalia <END> , and convulsions from birth .
Phenotypic anomalies consisted of a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent glabella <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arched eyebrows <END> , a low <START:PHENOTYPE> upswept frontal hairline <END> , a small pinched nose , large <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated ears <END> with overfolded upper helices , partial camptodactyly , and widespaced nipples .
Psychomotor development was absent , and there was marked failure to thrive .
Death occurred at ages 21 days and 7 months , respectively .
Postmortem examination on one child showed <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cerebral ventricles <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> was detectable by fetal ultrasound in one brother at 17 weeks of gestation .
Epidermolytic <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> woolly hair <END> and dilated cardiomyopathy.
A new cardiocutaneous syndrome has been noted , characterized by an epidermolytic <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> woolly hair <END> , and associated with dilated cardiomyopathy.
This describes the clinical and histopathologic characteristics of this new syndrome .
Eighteen patients were examined clinically and histologically from 1970 to 1997 .
Cardiologic examinations were performed in 12 patients .
The cutaneous lesions were classified according to the presence of obligatory and facultative elements of the syndrome .
Patients were born with <START:PHENOTYPE> woolly hair <END> .
Around the first year <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> and the other keratotic elements appeared .
The first cardiac abnormalities are exclusively electrocardiographic and occur in asymptomatic patients .
In these patients , dilation of the left ventricle together with alterations in muscle contractility are observed .
The dilated cardiomyopathy can lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> and death .
The association of <START:PHENOTYPE> woolly hair <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> with a histopathologic pattern of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis has not been previously described .
Their frequent association with dilated cardiomyopathy defines a cardiocutaneous syndrome .
Whenever <START:PHENOTYPE> woolly hair <END> is associated with any kind of <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> , a search for possible cardiac abnormalities is recommended .
Index finger hyperphalangy and multiple anomalies : Catel-Manzke syndrome ?
We describe a boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , unusual face , right iris coloboma , <START:PHENOTYPE> malformed ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , and skeletal anomalies including hyperphalangy of the index fingers , <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral fifth finger clinodactyly <END> , short halluces , and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
Internal anomalies included asymmetric and <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cerebral ventricles <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> .
The neonatal history of <START:PHENOTYPE> small jaw <END> with feeding and respiratory difficulties suggested a Pierre Robin sequence , but there was no <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
Two maternal uncles with similar anomalies had died at ages 13 months and 5 years , respectively .
RFLP studies with the DNA probes DXS72 and F8C were consistent with but not diagnostic of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive inheritance <END> .
The pattern of anomalies was compatible with a diagnosis of Catel-Manzke syndrome , but a novel dysostosis syndrome must also be considered .
Early detection of severe cholestatic hepatopathy in COACH syndrome .
COACH syndrome is a disorder with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar vermis hypoplasia <END> , oligophrenia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> .
Sixteen cases with certain COACH diagnosis have been reported so far .
Neurologic abnormalities are the first symptoms in most cases .
The majority of cases were diagnosed late in childhood or adolescence .
Complications of the hepatopathy contribute extensively to the morbidity and lethality in the course of the disease .
Major complications are <START:PHENOTYPE> portal hypertension <END> , esophageal varices , and gastrointestinal bleeding .
We report of a child with only mild neurologic symptoms , but severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> with cholangiopathy , and review the literature .
This is the first description of profound cholestatic hepatopathy in a very young child with COACH syndrome .
The patient was found to have <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar vermis hypoplasia <END> , unilateral optical nerve <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , mild dysmorphic signs , and a ventricular septum defect .
Routine laboratory investigations eventually revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated liver enzymes <END> .
Prothrombin time was abnormal .
Ultrasound scan of the liver was normal .
Hepatotropic viral infections were excluded .
We performed a liver biopsy at the age of 16 months , confirming an early stage of <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> with septal fibrosis and pseudolobules , inflammatory infiltrates , signs of cholestasis , and reduced numbers of intrahepatic bile ducts .
Early detection and differentiation of liver pathology are important in COACH syndrome .
Progressive destructive cholangiopathy may contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> in COACH syndrome .
Liver disease can be severe even in cases with mild neurologic deficits .

X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria .
Seven boys with an apparently X-linked syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , and persistently elevated urinary levels of 3-methylglutaconate , 3-methylglutarate , and 2-ethylhydracrylate were studied .
The natural history of the disorder was characterized by severe or lethal cardiac disease and recurrent infections during infancy and early childhood but relative improvement in later childhood .
The initial presentation of the syndrome varied from congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> to infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> to isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> without clinical evidence of heart disease .
The excretion of 3-methylglutaconate and 3-methylglutarate appeared to be independent of the metabolism of leucine , the presumed precursor of these organic acids in humans .
Although the cause of the organic aciduria remains obscure , the constellation of biochemical and clinical abnormalities forms a distinct syndrome that may be a relatively common cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> in boys during infancy and childhood .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Midface hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal hypotonia <END> in two brothers .
We describe two brothers born to consanguineous parents , who presented with hypotonia and hypoglycaemia in the neonatal period and later developed <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
They had brachydactyly and similar facial features including a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , full lips , a small mouth , and small , <START:PHENOTYPE> low set ears <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> overfolded helices <END> .
Their sister had mild learning disabilities .
No additional anomalies were found , and metabolic investigations including peroxisomal functions gave normal results .
We suggest the patients have a hitherto unreported condition , with an autosomal or X-linked mode of inheritance .
Maternal inheritance in cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> syndrome .
Cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> syndrome ( CVS) , characterized by severe discrete episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> nausea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> , is a fairly common , disabling , predominately-childhood condition most often associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> and dysautonomic features .
Our group recently reported that children with CVS and additional neuromuscular disease manifestations demonstrate strong maternal inheritance of multiple disease manifestations and abnormal urine organic acids , suggesting the presence of predisposing <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( mtDNA ) sequence variants .
In order to determine if maternal inheritance is present in CVS in general , a clinical interview was administered regarding 80 unrelated individuals with CVS ascertained randomly from the database of the Cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> Vomiting <END> Syndrome Association ( CVSA ) .
Disease manifestations consistent with potential <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> dysfunction were far more common in matrilineal ( sharing the same mtDNA sequence ) versus in non-matrilineal relatives , including mothers versus fathers ( P = 3 x 10( -9) ) and maternal versus paternal grandmothers ( P = 2 x 10( -6) ) .
Maternal inheritance is suggested in 52 % of the 23 subjects with two or more neuromuscular abnormalities ( " CVS+ " ) and in 54 % of the 44 subjects without any neuromuscular abnormalities ( " CVS-" ) .
In both the CVS+ and CVS- sub-groups , subjects , and affected matrilineal relatives of all ages suffer at a far higher incidence from several dysautonomic-related conditions , including <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> and irritable bowel , as well as depression and hypothyroidism , while neuromuscular and cognitive disorders such as hypotonia and ADHD are common only in affected children .
We conclude that mtDNA sequences predispose towards the development of protean disease manifestations in CVS patients ascertained through a disease-specific association , as well as among their matrilineal relatives , whether or not neuromuscular disease is present in the proband .
Since CVS was absent in all but one matrilineal relative of our probands , CVS is apparently a rare clinical presentation in individuals carrying the predisposing mtDNA sequences .
The four conditions reported most frequently among the matrilineal relatives of our cases , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , depression , irritable bowel , and hypothyroidism , are known to segregate together in families , and our findings suggest that a common predisposing genetic factor is likely present on the mtDNA .

Deletions of the homeobox gene SHOX ( <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> homeobox ) are an important cause of growth failure in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Short stature <END> , with an incidence of 3 in 100 , is a fairly frequent disorder in children .
Idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> refers to patients who are short due to various unknown reasons .
Mutations of a human homeobox gene , SHOX ( <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> homeobox ) , have recently been shown to be associated with the <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> phenotype in patients with Turner syndrome and most patients with LÃ©ri-Weill dyschondrosteosis .
This study addresses the question of the incidence and type of SHOX mutations in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
We analyzed the SHOX gene for intragenic mutations by single strand conformation polymorphism , followed by sequencing , in 750 patients and for complete gene deletions by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 150 patients ( total , 900 patients ) .
This is the largest group of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> studied to date for SHOX mutations .
All patients had a normal karyotype , and their height for chronological age were below the third percentile or minus 2 SD of national height standards .
All were without obvious skeletal features reminiscent of the Leri-Weill syndrome at the time of diagnosis .
Silent , missense , and nonsense mutations and a small deletion in the coding region of SHOX were identified in 9 of the 750 patients analyzed for intragenic mutations .
Complete gene deletions were detected in 3 of the 150 patients studied for gene deletions .
At least 3 of the 9 intragenic mutations were judged to be functional based upon the genotype- phenotype relationship for the parents and normal control individuals .
We conclude that SHOX mutations have been detected in 2.4% of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
The spectrum of SHOX mutations is biased , with the vast majority leading to complete gene deletions .
The prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> due to SHOX gene mutations among children with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> appears to be similar to that of GH deficiency or Turner syndrome .
Family studies of the children with SHOX mutations often reveal older family members with same mutation who exhibit mild skeletal features reminiscent of the Turner syndrome , such as high-arched palate , short neck , abnormal auricular development , cubitus valgus , genu valgum , short fourth metacarpals , and Madelung deformity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Leukoencephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , colitis , and hypogammaglobulinemia ( LACH ) in two brothers : a novel syndrome ?
We report a pair of brothers who have <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , colitis , and hypogammaglobulinemia .
Both presented initially with seizures in the early postnatal period .
They have significant developmental delay , and brain MRIs demonstrate <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> , characterized by profound <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomyelination <END> .
They have developed <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , which in one brother has required chronic treatment ; and persistent intermittent <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , necessitating treatment for <START:PHENOTYPE> inflammatory bowel disease <END> .
Finally , they have had multiple hospitalizations , including several for sepsis ; an immunological analysis revealed that they have IgG1-subclass hypogammaglobulinemia and low B cell levels .
There is no family history of similar problems , and these brothers have an unaffected brother .
We believe this constellation of symptoms represents a novel syndrome : LACH syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , colitis , and hypogammaglobulinemia ) .
The etiology of this syndrome remains unknown despite extensive investigations .

Fowler syndrome-a clinical , radiological , and pathological study of 14 cases .
We report on 14 fetuses from 10 families with the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of proliferative vasculopathy and hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly ( Fowler syndrome ) .
In four families sibs were affected and in six the parents were consanguineous .
Antenatal ultrasonography showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> in all except two fetuses , but <START:PHENOTYPE> hydranencephaly <END> was diagnosed in only one case .
Postural abnormalities were seen in 10 fetuses and structural brain abnormalities were suspected in 3 . At autopsy the cerebral cortex appeared as a translucent membranous structure ( <START:PHENOTYPE> hydranencephaly <END> ) in most fetuses .
However , in one case , the ventricles were dilated but the cortical mantle was relatively well preserved .
Histology of the brain showed the characteristic glomeruloid vascular proliferation of Fowler syndrome in all cases , but with variable extent of involvement of the central nervous system .
Dystrophic calcification and necrosis were always present .
Extra-cranial anomalies included <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> (1 0 fetuses) , cleft palate ( 1 fetus ) , cystic hygroma ( 2 fetuses) , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> ( 12 fetuses) , and pterygia ( 11 fetuses ) .
The typical proliferative vasculopathy was never observed outside the central nervous system and karyotypes were normal in the 10 fetuses studied .
Fowler syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lethal multiple pterygium syndrome , fetal akinesia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> in addition to classical <START:PHENOTYPE> hydranencephaly <END> .
Autopsy and study of the brain are essential to differentiate <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Fowler syndrome from other causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydranencephaly <END> , which may have a lower recurrence risk .
Outcome of Sturge-Weber syndrome in 52 adults .
Sturge-Weber syndrome ( SWS ) is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by cutaneous facial angioma , leptomeningeal angioma associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and other neurologic complications including <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Only limited information about long-term outcome , including the societal integration of adult patients , is available in the literature .
Data on 52 adults with SWS , ages 18-63 years , ascertained through the Sturge-Weber Foundation , were obtained via written questionnaires , telephone interviews , and reviews of medical records .
The distribution of port-wine stains ( cranial 98 % , extracranial 52% ) and the prevalences of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> (6 0% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( 83% ) , neurologic deficit ( 65% ) , and other complications were established .
The age of onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> ( 0-41 years ) , the age of onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( 0-23 years ) , and the correlation between the distribution of port-wine stains and the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> was identified .
The relationship between the age of onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> control was established .
In those with and without <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , the prevalences of developmental delay ( 43 % vs . 0% ) , emotional and behavior problems ( 85 % vs . 58% ) , special education requirements ( 71 % vs . 0% ) , and employability ( 46 % vs . 78% ) were analyzed .
Overall , 39% were financially self-sufficient , and 55 % were or could be married .
Ten participants produced 20 liveborn offspring ; 17 were healthy , and tuberous sclerosis , a cafÃ©-au-lait spot , and a " birthmark " were found in 1 child each .
The results of this study can be used for genetic counseling in Sturge-Weber syndrome .
Perlman syndrome : report , prenatal findings and review .
Perlman syndrome is a rare overgrowth syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> with neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> macrosomia <END> , nephromegaly , distinctive facial appearance , renal dysplasia , nephro-blastomatosis , and predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> ( WT) .
We report on a newborn with prenatal sonographic signs of Perlman syndrome , large fetal <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> , nephromegaly and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrosomia <END> .
The clinical course was marked by neonatal distress , renal failure and refractory hypoxemia leading to death at 2 days of life .
Renal histologic examination showed bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> nephroblastomatosis <END> .
Genetic or epigenetic alterations of the 11p15 region ( involved in the BWS) , including mutation of the CDKN1C gene were excluded .
No mutation of the GPC3 gene was identified .
We review the 28 patients who have been reported with Perlman syndrome .
The prognosis of Perlman syndrome is poor with a high neonatal mortality rate .
Among the infants who survived beyond the neonatal period , 64 % developed a WT and all had a <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Fetal macrosomia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> are frequent manifestations .
Clinical overlaps with other overgrowth syndromes particularly Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome have been emphasized .
Perlman syndrome is considered as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition .
We review 19 patients from seven sibships with parental consanguinity in two families only .
The other cases were sporadic .
The 28 reported patients had only 10 unaffected sibs .
The low percentage of consanguinity among parents is also puzzling for a rare recessive condition .
The molecular basis of Perlman syndrome is unknown .
( Epi)genetic anomalies of 11p15 and mutations in GPC3 were not studied in most of the previous reports .

Localization of the gene for a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> neurodegenerative Huntington-like disorder to 4p15 .3 .
A consanguineous family affected by an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , progressive neurodegenerative Huntington-like disorder , was tested to rule out juvenile-onset Huntington disease ( JHD ) .
The disease manifests at approximately 3-4 years and is characterized by both pyramidal and extrapyramidal abnormalities , including <START:PHENOTYPE> chorea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gait instability <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mutism <END> , and intellectual impairment .
Brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) findings include progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal cortical atrophy <END> and bilateral caudate atrophy.
Huntington CAG trinucleotide-repeat analyses ruled out JHD , since all affected individuals had repeat numbers within the normal range .
The presence of only four recombinant events ( straight theta=.2 ) between the disease and the Huntington locus in 20 informative meioses suggested that the disease localized to chromosome 4 . Linkage was initially achieved with marker D4S2366 at 4p15 .3 ( LOD 3.03 ) .
High-density mapping at the linked locus resulted in homozygosity for markers D4S431 and D4S394 , which span a 3-cM region .
A maximum LOD score of 4.71 in the homozygous interval was obtained .
Heterozygosity at the distal D4S2366 and proximal D4S2983 markers defines the maximum localization interval ( 7 cM ) . Multiple brain-related expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) with no known disease association exist in the linkage interval .
Among the three known genes residing in the linked interval ( ACOX3 , DRD5 , QDPR) , the most likely candidate , DRD5 , encoding the dopamine receptor D5 , was excluded , since all five affected family members were heterozygous for an intragenic dinucleotide repeat .
The inheritance pattern and unique localization to 4p15 .3 are consistent with the identification of a novel , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , neurodegenerative Huntington-like disorder .
A locus for axonal motor-sensory neuropathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> maps to Xq24-q26 .
DNA markers on the X chromosome were used to map the locus for an unusual form of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> hereditary motor and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory neuropathy <END> with associated <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in a three-generation family that was originally reported by Cowchock et al . ( Am , J . Hum . Genet . 35 : 85A , 1993 ; Am . J . Med . Genet . 20: 307-315 , 1985 ) .
This family included seven affected males , three obligate carrier females , and four unaffected males .
The patients were severely affected within the first few years of life with distal <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> , sensory loss , areflexia , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , and hammer toes .
Five of the seven affected males showed associated <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , and three of these five individuals also presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> or social developmental delay .
Motor nerve conduction velocities in affected males were normal to mildly delayed , and sensory conduction was markedly abnormal .
Heterozygous females were asymptomatic .
Close linkage to the Xg blood group locus ( Xp22 ) and the PGK locus ( Xq13 ) was previously excluded in this family , while weak linkage of the disease gene to DXYS1 ( XQ21.3 ) was suggested .
Our current linkage studies and haplotype analysis of 19 microsatellite markers on the long arm of the X chromosome demonstrate that DXS425 ( Xq24) and HPRT ( Xq26.1 ) are flanking markers and that the disease gene is closely linked to the markers DXS1122 , DXS994 , DXS737 , DXS1206 , and DXS1047 .
Mutations in 3 genes ( MKS3 , CC2D2A and RPGRIP1L ) cause COACH syndrome ( Joubert syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> ) .
To identify genetic causes of COACH syndrome COACH syndrome is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia <END> , Oligophrenia (developmental delay/mental retardation ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Coloboma <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Hepatic fibrosis <END> .
The vermis hypoplasia falls in a spectrum of mid -hindbrain malformation called the <START:PHENOTYPE> molar tooth sign <END> ( MTS ) , making COACH a Joubert syndrome related disorder ( JSRD ) .
In a cohort of 251 families with JSRD , 26 subjects in 23 families met criteria for COACH syndrome , defined as JSRD plus clinically apparent liver disease .
Diagnostic criteria for JSRD were clinical findings ( <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual impairment <END> , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ) plus supportive brain imaging findings ( MTS or <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar vermis hypoplasia <END> ) .
MKS3/TMEM67 was sequenced in all subjects for whom DNA was available .
In COACH subjects without MKS3 mutations , CC2D2A , RPGRIP1L and CEP290 were also sequenced .
19/23 families ( 83% ) with COACH syndrome carried MKS3 mutations , compared to 2/209 ( 1% ) with JSRD but no liver disease .
Two other families with COACH carried CC2D2A mutations , one family carried RPGRIP1L mutations , and one lacked mutations in MKS3 , CC2D2A , RPGRIP1L and CEP290 .
Liver biopsies from three subjects , each with mutations in one of the three genes , revealed changes within the congenital hepatic fibrosis/ductal plate malformation spectrum .
In JSRD with and without liver disease , MKS3 mutations account for 21/232 families ( 9% ) .
Mutations in MKS3 are responsible for the majority of COACH syndrome , with minor contributions from CC2D2A and RPGRIP1L ; therefore , MKS3 should be the first gene tested in patients with JSRD plus liver disease and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , followed by CC2D2A and RPGRIP1L .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Diaphragmatic hernia <END> , exomphalos , absent corpus callosum , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> : a newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder ?
We describe unrelated male and female patients with an identical syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> , exomphalos , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , agenesis of the corpus callosum , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> severe myopia <END> .
One child had an <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> .
After the birth of the first affected child in each family subsequent pregnancies were monitored with ultrasound scan and a further affected fetus was identified in both families .
We conclude that this constellation of anomalies represents a distinct , previously unreported syndrome with likely <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Variable expressivity in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> by clinical , electrophysiologic , and angiographic criteria .
Of 39 members in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> with variable expressivity , 16 members , representing 5 0 % ( 15 out of 30 ) of those at risk , were affected .
Of these , ten of 16 ( 63% ) had visual acuity of 6/12 (20/40 ) or better in at least one eye , and six of 16 ( 37% ) had visual acuity between 6/15 (20/50 ) and 6/6 0 (20/200 ) in at least one eye .
Affected patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> ( 12 , 75% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> ( nine , 56% ) , strabismus ( 15 , 94% ) , amblyopia (six , 37% ) , corneal pannus ( one , 6% ) <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> ( one , 6% ) , macular hypoplasia ( five , 31% ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic nerve hypoplasia <END> ( one , 6% ) .
The good visual acuity in this family indicates that absence of iris tissue is not responsible for the <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased visual acuity <END> usually associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased visual acuity <END> correlates instead with a decreased macular reflex and with a decreased electroretinogram amplitude .
Affected family members have abnormal persistence of vessels in the macular region angiographically , and when sufficient iris tissue is present to be studied angiographically , there are abnormal vascular loops and leakage of dye at the pupillary border .
Copy number variants of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> susceptibility loci are associated with a spectrum of speech and developmental delays and behavior problems .
: Recently , molecular cytogenetic techniques have identified novel copy number variants in individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
However , no large-scale prospective studies have been performed to characterize the broader spectrum of phenotypes associated with such copy number variants in individuals with unexplained physical and intellectual disabilities encountered in a diagnostic setting .
: We analyzed 38 ,779 individuals referred to our diagnostic laboratory for microarray testing for the presence of copy number variants encompassing 20 putative <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> susceptibility loci .
We also analyzed the indications for study for individuals with copy number variants overlapping those found in six individuals referred for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
: After excluding larger gains or losses that encompassed additional genes outside the candidate loci ( e.g. , whole-arm gains /losses) , we identified 1113 individuals with copy number variants encompassing <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> susceptibility loci and 37 individuals with copy number variants overlapping those present in the six individuals referred to our laboratory for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Of these , 1035 had a copy number variant of one of six recurrent loci : 1q21.1 , 15q11 .2 , 15q13.3 , 16p11 .2 , 16p13.11 , and 22q11 .2 .
The indications for study for these 1150 individuals were diverse and included <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum , and multiple congenital anomalies .
: The results from our study , the largest genotype-first analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> susceptibility loci to date , suggest that the phenotypic effects of copy number variants associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> are pleiotropic and imply the existence of shared biologic pathways among multiple neurodevelopmental conditions .
A novel claudin 16 mutation associated with childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> abolishes binding to ZO-1 and results in lysosomal mistargeting .
Mutations in the gene coding for the renal tight junction protein claudin 16 cause familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder of renal Ca( 2+ ) and Mg( 2+ ) handling that progressively leads to chronic renal failure , with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> having been reported in heterozygous carriers .
Screening a cohort of 11 families with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> identified a novel homozygous mutation in the claudin 16 gene in two families .
In contrast to classical symptoms of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , the patients displayed serious but self-limiting childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> with preserved glomerular filtration rate .
The mutation results in inactivation of a PDZ-domain binding motif , thereby disabling the association of the tight junction scaffolding protein ZO-1 with claudin 16 .
In contrast to wild-type claudin 16 , the mutant no longer localizes to tight junctions in kidney epithelial cells but instead accumulates in lysosomes .
Thus , mutations at different intragenic sites in the claudin 16 gene may lead to particular clinical phenotypes with a distinct prognosis .
Mutations in claudin 16 that affect interaction with ZO-1 lead to lysosomal mistargeting , providing-for the first time , to our knowledge-insight into the molecular mechanism of a disease-associated mutation in the claudin 16 gene .
Kabuki make-up syndrome : a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , unusual facies , large and protruding ears , and <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth deficiency <END> .
A previously unrecognized <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> malformation syndrome was observed in five unrelated Japanese children .
Consistent clinical features included moderate-to-severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , progressive dwarfism of postnatal onset , a peculiar facies characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> long palpebral fissures <END> , with eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelids , <START:PHENOTYPE> arched eyebrows <END> , broad and <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal tip <END> , large prominent earlobes , <START:PHENOTYPE> short fifth fingers <END> , abnormal dermatoglyphics including absence of digital triradius c or d , and <START:PHENOTYPE> frequent otitis media <END> in infancy .
Inconsistent abnormalities included epicanthal folds , cleft or <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , widely spaced teeth , low occipital hair line , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and dislocation of the hip joint .
Neither familial occurrence nor parental consanguinity was noted .
The etiology of the malformation syndrome remains unknown .
A new malformation syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> long palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal tip <END> , and skeletal anomalies associated with postnatal dwarfism and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Five unrelated patients with a previously unrecognized <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> malformation syndrome are presented .
Clinical features common to them include moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , postnatal dwarfism , susceptibility to infection in infancy , and peculiar craniofacial dysmorphia characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> long palpebral fissures <END> , high-arched and abnormal eyebrows , heavy and long eyelashes , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , short nasal septum and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal tip <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
Other anomalies are stubby fingers , deformed vertebra and other bone and joint anomalies , and abnormal dermatoglyphics .
The absence of familial occurrence and of consanguinity suggests some environmental causation , but the possibility of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> or X-linked mode of inheritance remains .
Based upon our five patients and other five of Niikawa et al , we propose this syndrome as a new disease entity .
Discrete <START:PHENOTYPE> subaortic stenosis <END> as part of a <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> syndrome .
Observations in a family point to the existence of autosomal dominant inheritance for discrete <START:PHENOTYPE> subaortic stenosis <END> ( DSS) , which made up part of a multisystem disorder .
Both parents , offspring of two full siblings , had <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , obstructive lung disease ( OLD) , hoarseness and <START:PHENOTYPE> upturned nose <END> .
The father alone had aortic stenosis and inguinal hernia .
The six offspring , aged from 13 to 28 years , were followed up for up to 8 years .
While one of them was virtually normal , and one had only minor abnormalities , four siblings displayed clinical signs of progressive aortic stenosis .
Of the two eldest siblings who eventually died , necropsy in one showed a discrete <START:PHENOTYPE> subaortic stenosis <END> , which was hemodynamically proven in one and surgically corrected in another sibling .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Upturned nose <END> was present in each examined member of the family , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and hoarseness in five of the siblings , DSS in four , OLD , inguinal hernia and congested episcleral veins in three , kyphoscoliosis in two , while <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> and widely spaced teeth were noted in the deceased female .
The prevalence of some of these traits in roughly three-quarters of the sibship was consistent with an underlying single gene abnormality in affected heterozygous parents .
We proposed that this constitutes a new syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Megalocornea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , mental and motor retardation ( MMMM ) .
Two patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> are reported .
Hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> poor coordination <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> swallowing difficulties <END> were present .
One patient was obese and the other had <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
Both had <START:PHENOTYPE> large fleshy ears <END> and long fingers .
The spectrum of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> syndrome is not fully defined .
These two patients resemble a previously reported case , and although there are distinct differences from patients with familial or sporadic Neuhauser syndrome , these cases may represent clinical variability of that syndrome .
Diverticular disease in patients with chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
Twelve patients with chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> represent 8 % of the 151 hemodialysis patients followed up at the Chromalloy American Kidney Center , Washington University School of Medicine .
Ten ( 83% ) of these patients have diverticulosis , and four of these patients developed gross colonic perforation secondary to diverticulitis .
Barium enemas on 31 chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> revealed diverticulosis in 10 (32% ) .
None had diverticulitis .
Barium enemas in 120 age-matched non-renal failure control patients revealed diverticulosis in 45 ( 38% ) .
None had diverticulitis .
These findings suggest that patients with chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> have a high incidence of diverticulosis and diverticulitis , that diverticulosis occurs in patients with chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> without <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> at a rate similar to that in the general population , and that diverticulitis should be an initial consideration in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> rolandic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and speech dyspraxia : a new syndrome with anticipation .
We describe a family of 9 affected individuals in three generations with nocturnal oro-facio-brachial partial <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , secondarily generalized partial <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and centro-temporal epileptiform discharges , associated with oral and speech dyspraxia and cognitive impairment .
The speech disorder was prominent , but differed from that of Landau-Kleffner syndrome and of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with continuous spike and wave during slow-wave sleep .
The electroclinical features of this new syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> rolandic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> resemble those of benign rolandic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , a common inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> of childhood .
This family shows clinical anticipation of the <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> disorder , the oral and speech dyspraxia , and cognitive dysfunction , suggesting that the genetic mechanism could be expansion of an unstable triplet repeat .
Molecular studies on this syndrome , where the inheritance pattern is clear , could also be relevant to identifying a gene for benign rolandic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> where anticipation does not occur and the mode of inheritance is uncertain .
Variable clinical manifestation of homoplasmic G14459A <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutation .
Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> ( LHON ) /pediatric onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> is associated with a G to A transition at nucleotide position ( np ) 14459 , within the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( mtDNA) -encoded ND6 gene .
This mutation has been reported in families presenting with LHON alone , LHON plus <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , or pediatric <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> with typical <START:PHENOTYPE> age of onset <END> less than 5 years .
The mutation changes a moderately conserved alanine to a valine at amino acid residue 72 , which is within the most evolutionarily conserved region of the ND6 protein .
Pediatric onset disease is associated with basal ganglia dysfunction , spasticity , and encephalopathy.
We report a family with G14459A mtDNA mutation and a broad spectrum of clinical manifestation .
The proband was a 3-year-old girl with anarthria , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , spasticity , and mild encephalopathy.
MRI of the brain demonstrated bilateral , symmetric basal ganglia lucencies associated with cerebral and systemic lactic acidosis .
Her maternal first cousin presented with a new onset limp and mild hemiparesis along with similar MRI findings with a much milder phenotype .
Additional investigation of the family members with the mutation has revealed both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals with variable clinical and laboratory features of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disease .
This study re-emphasizes the <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> clinical manifestation of homoplasmic G14459A mtDNA mutation even within the same family , and supports the hypothesis that nuclear genes may play a role in modifying the clinical expression of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disease .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> : the clinical experience in North America .
We designed a longitudinal clinical database for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> ( ARPKD) , recruited patients from pediatric nephrology centers in the United States and Canada , and examined their clinical morbidities and survival characteristics .
We initially targeted enrollment to children who were born and diagnosed after January 1 , 1990 , so as to capture a cohort that is representative of ARPKD patients born in the last decade .
When a significant number of older ARPKD patients were also referred , we extended our database to include all patients who met our inclusion criteria , thereby allowing direct comparisons between a long-term survivor subset and a cohort that included both neonatal survivors and nonsurvivors .
Patient entry into our database required either compatible histopathology or ultrasonographic evidence of enlarged , echogenic kidneys and the presence of at least 1 of the following additional criteria : a ) biopsy-proven ARPKD in a sibling ; b ) biliary fibrosis based on either clinical or histopathologic evidence ; c ) no sonographic evidence of renal cysts in the parents ( parents must be >30 years of age ) ; or d ) parental consanguinity , eg , first-cousin marriage .
Clinical questionnaires ( primary data form and follow-up data form ) were developed to collect initial patient data and follow-up data at yearly intervals .
Thirty-four centers provided clinical information for 254 patients and of these , 209 had sufficient data for analyses .
When stratified by date of birth , 166 ( 79 .4% ) were born on or after January 1 , 1990 (younger cohort ) and 43 children (2 0.6% ) were born before 1990 ( older cohort ) .
The gender distribution was equal in both cohorts .
The median age at diagnosis was significantly later in the older cohort and no deaths were reported among these patients , suggesting that this group is biased toward long-term survivors .
In the younger cohort , 74 .7% of the patients are alive , with a median age of 5.4 years .
In this group , 40.5 % of patients required ventilation and 11 .6 % developed chronic lung disease .
Hypertension was a common , but not universal finding in both cohorts .
The relative risk for developing hypertension was higher in the older cohort , but the median age at diagnosis was significantly earlier in the younger cohort .
Chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> renal insufficiency <END> ( CRI ) was reported in approximately 40% of patients with no significant difference in the relative risk between age groups .
However , in the younger cohort , the median age at diagnosis was significantly earlier and the age of diagnosis of CRI and hypertension were significantly correlated .
Clinically significant morbidities related to <START:PHENOTYPE> periportal fibrosis <END> were more common in the older cohort .
There was a trend toward increasing frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> portal hypertension <END> with age in both cohorts .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Portal hypertension <END> was not significantly correlated with either systemic hypertension or CRI .
The ARPKD Clinical Database represents the largest single cohort of ARPKD patients collected to date .
Our initial data analysis provides several new clinical insights .
First , in our subset of long-term survivors , ARPKD has a slower rate of disease progression , as assessed by age of ARPKD diagnosis , as well as age of diagnosis of clinical morbidities .
Second , neonatal ventilation was strongly predictive of mortality as well as an earlier age of diagnosis in those who developed hypertension or chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> renal insufficiency <END> .
However , for infants who survive the perinatal period , the long-term prognosis for patient survival is much better than generally perceived .
Third , although systemic hypertension and CRI were significantly correlated with respect to age of diagnosis , similar relationships with <START:PHENOTYPE> portal hypertension <END> were not evident , suggesting that disease progression may have organ-specific patterns .
Fourth , only a subset of patients may be at risk for developing clinically significant manifestations of <START:PHENOTYPE> periportal fibrosis <END> .
Based on these observations , the next challenges will be to determine how various factors , such as specific mutations in the ARPKD gene , PKHD1( polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 ) , variations in modifying gene loci , modulation by as yet unspecified environmental factors , and/or gene-environment interactions contribute to the marked variability in survival and disease expression observed among ARPKD patients .
Spectrum of findings in a family with nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> supravalvular aortic stenosis <END> : a Doppler echocardiographic study .
Nonsyndromic familial <START:PHENOTYPE> supravalvular aortic stenosis <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder .
However , for many reported families , systematic study of all family members with echocardiographic or hemodynamic techniques has not been performed and degree of penetrance has not been assessed .
The supravalvular stenosis in these family members usually is not associated with mental retardation or other characteristics of Williams syndrome .
Although some believe that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> supravalvular aortic stenosis <END> is part of the spectrum of Williams syndrome , others believe that these are separate entities .
Doppler echocardiograms were analyzed on 23 members of a 34 member family with several known to have <START:PHENOTYPE> supravalvular aortic stenosis <END> ; 20 studies were performed by the authors and 3 were done elsewhere and made available for review .
No family member had mental retardation , characteristic facies or other findings of Williams syndrome .
Three of the 34 had <START:PHENOTYPE> supravalvular aortic stenosis <END> requiring surgery .
Of 22 members examined echocardiographically who had not had prior surgical repair , 13 had <START:PHENOTYPE> supravalvular aortic stenosis <END> .
Echocardiographic findings ranged widely , from calcification of the ascending aorta in a 71 year old man with minimally increased flow velocity ( 1.7 m/s ) to mild narrowing with mildly increased flow velocity in six members to significant narrowing with impressively increased flow velocity ( 2 to 4 m/s ) in seven .
In addition , four patients had mild narrowing of pulmonary artery branches and eight had peak pulmonary artery flow velocity above normal .
This study demonstrates complete penetrance with extremely variable expression in this family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> supravalvular aortic stenosis <END> and emphasizes the importance of using echocardiographic techniques in studying the family members who are suspected of having an inherited cardiovascular disease .
Spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 3 phenotypically resembling parkinson disease in a black family .
Machado-Joseph disease ( MJD) , also known as spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 3 ( SCA3 ) , can present with <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
However , classically , atypical features , including pyramidal and cerebellar signs , peripheral neuropathy , and/or anterior horn cell dysfunction , are also seen .
Levodopa responsiveness is unusual in this disorder .
To determine the cause of apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> suggestive of Parkinson disease ( PD ) in a large family of African origin .
We studied a large family in which apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> suggestive of PD occurs in order to find the causal genetic mutation .
Affected and unaffected family members were screened for the presence of a pathogenic expansion at the MJD/SCA3 locus using a polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-based assay .
Three of the 4 individuals who were examined have a phenotype reminiscent of PD . Specifically , they have at least 2 of the cardinal features , are levodopa responsive , and have no atypical features .
All affected family members were shown to possess pathogenic expansions in the MJD/SCA3 gene .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Parkinsonism <END> suggestive of PD due to MJD/SCA3 has not been previously reported , to our knowledge .
However , atypical , though also levodopa-responsive , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> has been previously reported to occur in African American families , suggesting that that this phenotype is associated with African ancestry .
In this regard , it is perhaps significant that all the individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> have relatively low numbers of repeats ( normal , 16-34 ; pathologic , 60-84 ) .
In families in which linkage analysis is being performed to determine a locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> suggestive of PD , evaluation for the MJD/SCA3 mutation is indicated .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic liver disease <END> : a second family .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern of transmission has been established for <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
The degree of cystic involvement of other organs has been variable .
The genetic pattern of transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic liver disease <END> independent of <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic kidney disease <END> has never been established .
We present a second family with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic liver disease <END> without kidney disease .
The lack of renal cysts is unlikely to be due to variable expressivity and penetrance of the gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
The liver cysts may be of late onset since none of the proband 's four children demonstrate cysts .
Alternatively , none of these four individuals may have received the gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic liver disease <END> from their affected mother .
The family described supports an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern of inheritance for <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic liver disease <END> .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular colobomas <END> , ichthyosis , brain malformations and endocrine abnormalities in an inbred Emirati family .
We report on an inbred Emirati family of Baluchi origin with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular colobomas <END> , ichthyosis , and endocrine abnormalities associated with midline brain malformations and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
All affected children had <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular colobomas <END> , developmental delay and midline brain malformations .
Hypoplastic pituitary gland was present in all three investigated children .
Ichthyosiform <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> appeared in infancy in all surviving children .
Other variable features include congenital heart defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> and dark skin involving the dorsum of hands and feet associated with mild degree of palmo-plantar keratoderma .
Some of the features in this family overlap the CHIME ( <START:PHENOTYPE> Coloboma <END> of the eye , Heart defect , Ichthyosiform dermatosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> , and Ear defect ) syndrome .
However , several features described in CHIME syndrome were not present in these children .
These include deafness , seizures , oligodontia , and hair abnormalities .
Some of the features in these children also overlap with septo-optic dysplasia ( SOD ) but optic nerve hypoplasia , mandatory for the diagnosis of SOD , was present in one child only .
We suggest that these children have a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular colobomas <END> and ichthyosis .

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
A high incidence of hypertension (5 0 to 75 percent ) occurs early in the course of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
Cyst enlargement , causing bilateral renal ischemia and subsequent release of renin , is proposed as the cause of this form of hypertension .
To investigate this hypothesis , we measured plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations during short-term and long-term converting-enzyme inhibition in 14 patients with hypertension due to <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> , 9 patients with essential hypertension , 11 normotensive patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> , and 13 normal subjects .
The groups were comparable with respect to age , sex , body-surface area , degree of hypertension , sodium excretion , and renal function .
During the short-term study , the mean ( + /- SE ) plasma renin activity was significantly higher in the hypertensive patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> than in the patients with essential hypertension , in the supine ( 0.36 +/- 0.06 vs . 0.22 +/- 0.06 ng per liter.second , P = 0.05 ) and upright positions ( 1.03 +/- 0.14 vs . 0.61 +/- 0.08 ng per liter.second , P less than 0.03 ) and after converting-enzyme inhibition ( 1 .97 +/- 0.28 vs . 0.67 +/- 0.17 ng per liter.second , P less than 0.0006 ) .
The mean arterial pressures measured in the supine and upright positions and the plasma aldosterone concentrations measured in the upright position were significantly higher in the normotensive patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> than in the normal subjects .
After six weeks of converting-enzyme inhibition , renal plasma flow increased ( P less than 0.005 ) , and both renal vascular resistance ( P less than 0.007 ) and the filtration fraction ( P less than 0.02 ) decreased significantly in the hypertensive patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> but not in the patients with essential hypertension .
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is stimulated significantly more in hypertensive patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> than in comparable patients with essential hypertension .
The increased renin release , perhaps due to renal ischemia caused by cyst expansion , probably contributes to the early development of hypertension in <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Osteosclerosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nose <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> proptosis <END> ( Raine syndrome ) : further delineation .
We describe a newborn girl with a lethal sclerosing bone dysplasia leading to prenatal skeletal alterations and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nose <END> and midface , <START:PHENOTYPE> small jaw <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , hypertrophied gums , <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcifications <END> , and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosclerosis <END> .
There is a remarkable similarity between our patient and six previously reported infants subsequently categorized as having a distinct entity : Raine syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> is postulated based on parental consanguinity in several of the previous cases and in our patient .

A new <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome .
We have studied a three-generation family with 11 moderately to severely retarded males and three mildly retarded females ( presumably manifesting carriers ) .
The patients have a phenotype different from that of all other previously described types of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> MR ( XLMR ) .
These include <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , " coarse " facial appearance including <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> and supraorbital ridges , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal tip <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nostrils <END> , and thick lips .
All postpubertal males had <START:PHENOTYPE> macroorchidism <END> ( volume greater than 25 ml ) .
Chromosomes were normal including fragile X analysis .
X-ray findings of skull , spine , and hands were normal .
The intellectually normal relatives do not resemble their affected relatives except for increased head size and testicular size .
These findings suggest a new variant of XLMR different from fragile <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> MR , the Coffin-Lowry syndrome , and other XLMR conditions .
Inheritance of proliferative breast disease in <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> kindreds .
Previous studies have emphasized that genetic susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> is rare and is expressed primarily as premenopausal <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , or both .
Proliferative breast disease ( PBD ) is a significant risk factor for the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and appears to be a precursor lesion .
PBD and <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> were studied in 103 women from 20 kindreds that were selected for the presence of two first degree relatives with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and in 31 control women .
Physical examination , screening mammography , and four-quadrant fine-needle breast aspirates were performed .
Cytologic analysis of breast aspirates revealed PBD in 35 % of clinically normal female first degree relatives of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> cases and in 13% of controls .
Genetic analysis suggests that genetic susceptibility causes both PBD and <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in these kindreds .
This study supports the hypothesis that this susceptibility is responsible for a considerable portion of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , including unilateral and postmenopausal <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Intellectual disability <END> is associated with increased runs of homozygosity in simplex <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Intellectual disability <END> ( ID) , often attributed to autosomal-recessive mutations , occurs in 40% of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) .
For this reason , we conducted a genome-wide analysis of runs of homozygosity ( ROH ) in simplex ASD-affected families consisting of a proband diagnosed with ASD and at least one unaffected sibling .
In these families , probands with an IQ â‰¤ 70 show more ROH than their unaffected siblings , whereas probands with an IQ > 70 do not show this excess .
Although ASD is far more common in males than in females , the proportion of females increases with decreasing IQ. Our data do support an association between ROH burden and <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> diagnosis in girls ; however , we are not able to show that this effect is independent of low IQ.
We have also discovered several <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> candidate genes on the basis of finding (1 ) a single gene that is within an ROH interval and that is recurrent in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> or (2 ) a gene that is within an <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> ROH block and that harbors a homozygous , rare deleterious variant upon analysis of exome-sequencing data .
In summary , our data suggest a distinct genetic architecture for participants with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and co-occurring <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> and that this architecture could involve a role for recessively inherited loci for this <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> subgroup .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Robin sequence <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft mandible <END> , pre/postaxial hand anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
We report on 5 unrelated Brazilian children with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Robin sequence <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft mandible <END> , pre/postaxial hand anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
Genetic aspects and phenotypic manifestations are compared with those of previous reports of acrofacial dysostoses and with other <START:PHENOTYPE> Robin sequence <END> syndromes .
We suspect that these patients present a previously undescribed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
DNAJC6 is responsible for juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> with phenotypic variability .
Familial parkinson 's disease is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous .
By mapping the disease locus with a lod score of 5 .13 to a < 3.5 Mbp region at 1p31 .3 in a consanguineous family and subsequent exome sequencing analysis , we identified homozygous truncating mutation p.Q734X in DNAJC6 .
Four members of the family were afflicted with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> that presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , pyramidal signs and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , as well as varying degrees of a progressive neurological disease .
Recently a splicing mutation in the same gene was reported in two brothers with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> that was not L-Dopa responsive and not accompanied by pyramidal signs or <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Also , an 80-kb deletion that included DNAJC6 sequences was identified in a boy reported as having obesity , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> but not any signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
The phenotype of our study family resembles both of those families , which among themselves do not share any clinical features .
Our findings further establish DNAJC6 as a juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> gene , and expand the spectrums of the <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> phenotype and DNAJC6 mutation .
DNAJC6 encodes the neuronal co-chaperone auxilin .
We found that its transcript is highly significantly more abundant in brain as compared to the non-neural tissues assayed .

Unilateral renal aplasia in <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> Kallmann 's syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Unilateral renal agenesis <END> is an uncommon association with Kallmann 's syndrome ( KS ) ( <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism <END> and olfactory defect ) .
We have investigated affected individuals from six pedigrees : five with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> KS , and one with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> KS and <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> ichthyosis ( XLI ) .
Seventeen affected individuals have had renal imaging performed , and six scans demonstrated only one kidney .
In addition , two pedigrees had males who died in the neonatal period with bilateral renal agenesis .
Only two of the four affected individuals in the family with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> KS and <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> ichthyosis ( Pedigree 6 ) showed <START:PHENOTYPE> unilateral renal agenesis <END> , despite all four patients demonstrating an interstitial deletion within the short arm of the X-chromosome .
These data indicate that <START:PHENOTYPE> unilateral renal agenesis <END> is much commoner than previously suspected in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> Kallmann 's syndrome , but that it may have incomplete penetrance within a family .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> : benign familial <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> or a new syndrome ?
During the course of a clinical study of Sotos syndrome , six out of 79 probands failed to fit the phenotype of Sotos syndrome but showed remarkable similarities to each other and to a further 11 first- and second-degree relatives .
Clinical features in these index cases included <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , greater than +3.5 SD ; normal or near normal birth weight and length with subsequent relative <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ; variable <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> ; and typical face , characterised by a square outline with <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , a " dished-out " mid-face , <START:PHENOTYPE> biparietal narrowing <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> .
All recorded bone ages were less than the 75th centile , and two were below the 10th centile .
The authors believe the original diagnosis was incorrect and that these cases likely represent a previously undescribed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> syndrome .
Tear function and ocular surface changes in <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
To describe the ocular surface disorder in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
A prospective , case-controlled study .
Seventy-five eyes of 38 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> seen at Uludag University School of Medicine , Department of Ophthalmology , from March 2000 through April 2001 , and 80 eyes of 40 normal control subjects were studied .
The subjects underwent routine ophthalmic examinations , corneal sensitivity measurements , Schirmer test , tear film breakup time ( BUT) , fluorescein and rose bengal staining of the ocular surface , and conjunctival impression cytology .
Patients and control subjects were compared for corneal sensitivity , tear function , ocular surface staining parameters , goblet cell density , and squamous metaplasia grade .
The relation of these parameters to the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> progression was also investigated .
The mean corneal sensitivity was significantly lower in <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> patients compared with control subjects ( P < 0.001 ) .
The BUT values were also significantly lower in the <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> group .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> had significantly higher fluorescein and rose bengal staining scores ( P < 0.001 ) .
Corneal sensitivity and tear function changes seemed to get worse with advanced stages of <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
Impression cytology showed goblet cell loss and conjunctival squamous metaplasia , both of which again related to the extent of progression of <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
The ocular surface disease in <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> is characterized by disorder of tear quality , squamous metaplasia , and goblet cell loss , all of which seem to relate to the extent of <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> progression .
Essential <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> and duodenal ulceration .
A " new " dominantly inherited condition .
The familial occurrence of essential <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> combined with ( congenital ) <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , duodenal ulceration and a narcolepsy-like sleep disturbance caused by an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> gene with high penetrance and fairly uniform expressivity is reported in a family of Swedish-Finnish ancestry .
Twelve of 17 affected family members had essential <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> which began between 30-40 years of age and which could be controlled temporarily by alcohol ; this resulted in alcoholism in several affected individuals .
The most severly affected persons showed <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar signs <END> which may reflect a possible pathogenetic relationship of the syndrome to the genetic cerebellar atrophies .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nystagmus <END> , observed in 12 of 17 affected family members ( eight of whom were also affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> ) usually was congenital and accompanied by refractive errors .
Duodenal ulcers occurred almost exclusively in individuals with the neurological syndrome , and preceded its onset in some cases .
The ulcer disease therefore seems to be a component manifestation of the syndrome and is interpreted as a pleiotropic effect of the gene which also causes the <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> and sleep disturbance .
Cushing 's syndrome in patients with the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> .
Reports of Cushing 's syndrome in patients with the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> are rare , although up to 30 percent of gastrinomas contain ACTH-like immunoreactivity .
We prospectively examined 75 patients with the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> for Cushing 's syndrome .
Three of 59 patients ( 5 percent ) with the sporadic form of the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> had Cushing 's syndrome , with severe symptoms due to ectopic production of ACTH .
Each of these patients had metastatic gastrinoma , responded poorly to chemotherapy , and died within three years of the diagnosis of both syndromes .
Three of 16 patients ( 19 percent ) with the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> and multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> endocrine neoplasia <END> type 1 had Cushing 's syndrome due to pituitary production of ACTH , and their symptoms were mild .
The gastrinoma in these patients was localized , and the prognosis was excellent .
Thus , Cushing 's syndrome is more common in patients with the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> than was previously reported , occurring in 8 percent of all cases .
Furthermore , Cushing 's syndrome in patients with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> and in those with multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> endocrine neoplasia <END> type 1 differ in incidence , cause , clinical severity , extent of gastrinoma , the need for therapy , and prognosis .
All patients with the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> and all patients with multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> endocrine neoplasia <END> type 1 should be screened for Cushing 's syndrome .
Vertical transmission of the Ohdo <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> syndrome .
Ohdo <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> syndrome ( OBS ) is a multiple congenital anomalies-mental retardation syndrome composed of <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , dental hypoplasia , partial <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Previously reported cases of OBS have been sporadic except for the report by Ohdo et al . [ 1986 , J Med Genet 23:242-244 ] that described two affected sisters and a first cousin favoring autosomal recessive inheritance .
The original report by Ohdo et al . [ 1986 ] may reflect nonpenetrance of an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder or genetic heterogeneity of OBS .
We report on a child and the mother who have <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , dental anomalies , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Chromosome analysis in both showed a balanced paracentric inversion of the long arm of chromosome 9 , which was also present in two phenotypically normal sibs of the mother .
This is the first report of vertical transmission of OBS suggestive of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
X-linked dominant and mitochondrial inheritance are other possible modes of inheritance .
Importance of <START:PHENOTYPE> dural ectasia <END> in phenotypic assessment of Marfan 's syndrome .
Early identification of Marfan 's syndrome is fundamental in the prevention of aortic dilatation , but the wide phenotypic expression of the disorder makes the clinical diagnosis very difficult .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dural ectasia <END> has been classified as a major diagnostic criterion ; however , its prevalence is not known .
We aimed to identify the true prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dural ectasia <END> in Marfan 's syndrome , and to investigate its relation to aortic pathology .
A magnetic-resonance-imaging ( MRI ) study of the thoracic aorta and of the lumbosacral spine was done in an inclusive series of 83 patients with Marfan 's syndrome to assess the presence and degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> dural ectasia <END> and aortic involvement ; 12 patients were younger than 18 years .
100 individuals who underwent MRI of the lumbar spine for routine clinical indications represented the control group ; none of them had any potential causes for <START:PHENOTYPE> dural ectasia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dural ectasia <END> was identified in 76 (92% ) patients and none of the control group .
The severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> dural ectasia <END> was related to age ; the mean ( SD ) age of patients with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> dural ectasia <END> was 26 years ( 14 ) whereas that of those with severe disease ( meningocele ) was 36 years (9 ) ( p= 0.038 ) . 11 of 12 patients younger than 18 years had <START:PHENOTYPE> dural ectasia <END> .
No association was found between aortic dilatation and <START:PHENOTYPE> dural ectasia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dural ectasia <END> is a highly characteristic sign of Marfan 's syndrome , even at an early age .
A novel form of <START:PHENOTYPE> pontocerebellar hypoplasia <END> maps to chromosome 7q11-21 . To describe a novel form of <START:PHENOTYPE> pontocerebellar hypoplasia <END> ( PCH ) and map its genetic locus .
PCH is a heterogeneous group of disorders that are characterized by abnormally small cerebellum and brainstem .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> has been implied in many cases , but no genetic loci have been mapped to date .
The authors studied a consanguineous family from the Sultanate of Oman with three siblings with a novel form of PCH .
The authors performed clinical studies and linkage analysis of this pedigree .
The clinical features of the affected children include <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> during the first year of life , hypotonia with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and optic atrophy.
Imaging studies showed a small pons and cerebellum , prominent sulci and lateral ventricles , and decreased cerebral white matter volume .
A lack of dyskinesias distinguishes this pedigree from PCH type 2 . Genetic studies of this family revealed evidence of significant linkage to chromosome 7q11-21 ( maximum multipoint lod score 3.23 ) .
This pedigree represents a novel form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> PCH , which the authors propose to call cerebellar atrophy with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( CLAM ) .
This disorder maps to chromosome 7q11-21 , and this locus was named CLAM .
This report represents the first identification of a genetic locus for PCH .
A case of Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome .
Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome was first described by Lenz et al in 1955 .
The cardinal features of the syndrome are <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> or anophthalmos , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow shoulders <END> , other skeletal anomalies , and dental and urogenital malformations .
Here we present a case of Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome who shows the typical characteristics and , additionally , dysgenesis of the corpus callosum associated with dilatation of the lateral ventricles .
The patient , a 13 year old male , was referred to our hospital by a dental hospital for genetic counselling .
On physical examination , height , weight , and head circumference were below the 3rd centile and he had brachymicrocephaly , a preauricular tag , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , missing teeth , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow shoulders <END> , long , proximally placed thumbs , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and a normal IQ. Ophthalmological examination showed <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , sclerocornea , absence of the pupil , no vision in the left eye and decreased vision and a small pupil in the right eye in addition to his bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> .
Cranial MRI showed dilatation of the lateral ventricles and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum .
A Scottish family with Bazex-DuprÃ©-Christol syndrome : follicular atrophoderma , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypotrichosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> .
Bazex-Dup re-Christol syndrome ( BDCS ) is an X linked dominant disorder of the hair follicle characterised by follicular atrophoderma , multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> milia <END> , and localised <START:PHENOTYPE> hypohidrosis <END> .
Follicular atrophoderma ( FA ) are follicular funnel shaped depressions , "ice pick marks " , seen most commonly on the dorsum of the hands .
We describe the first known Scottish family with this syndrome , five affected members spanning three generations .
They have <START:PHENOTYPE> hypohidrosis <END> confined to the face , <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse hair <END> , dry skin , <START:PHENOTYPE> milia <END> , and follicular atrophoderma .
All the adults have a history of multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> .
None of them has any skeletal feature suggestive of Gorlin 's syndrome .
The clinical features , skin histology , and scanning electron microscopic ( SEM ) examination of the hair are described and illustrated .
The features are compared with 15 previous reports of BDCS and four reports in which this is a possible diagnosis are also reviewed .
BDCS should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with early onset or familial <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> male pseudohermaphroditism <END> and Wilms ' tumor ( Drash syndrome ) : a distinctive glomerular lesion--report of 10 cases .
We report on 10 children , less than 2 years of age , who presented with a genuine type of glomerulopathy : <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse mesangial sclerosis <END> .
In 5 , the <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> male pseudohermaphroditism <END> ( MPH ) and Wilms ' tumor ( WT) ; in 3 with MPH and in 2 with WT.
The <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> was characterized by its very early onset , between the age of 2 weeks and 18 months .
Eight patients presented with a <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> with ( 7 cases ) or without ( 1 case ) <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
All , but one , who is in advanced RF at 11 years of age , progressed to chronic or <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal failure <END> ( ESRF ) within a few months to 2 years from the onset .
One additional child presented with advanced renal failure at the age of 8 months and the last one , who was hypertensive , developed an anuria related to thrombosis of renal veins at 1 year of age .
Drash syndrome is characterized by the association of a " nephron disorder " with MPH and WT.
We propose , on the basis of our histological findings , to extend the concept of Drash syndrome to patients who , in addition to the <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , have either WT or MPH and to consider the distinctive glomerular lesions presented by all these patients as their common denominator .
The pathogenesis of this glomerulopathy is obscure .
Its early onset , its association with a dysembryoplastic tumor and/or with <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadal dysgenesis <END> both suggest an antenatal dysgenetic process .
Neu-Laxova syndrome : detailed prenatal diagnostic and post-mortem findings and literature review .
Neu-Laxova syndrome ( NLS ) is a lethal , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> multiple malformation syndrome with many features resulting from severe skin restriction and <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased fetal movement <END> .
It is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth restriction <END> ( IUGR) , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , central nervous system ( CNS ) anomalies , limb deformities , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic lungs <END> , edema , and abnormal facial features including severe <START:PHENOTYPE> proptosis <END> with ectropion , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , flattened nose , and malformed ears .
We present two new patients with NLS with striking prenatal diagnostic findings and detailed post-mortem examinations and review the previously described cases in the literature .
Data from these patients suggest that the NLS represents a heterogeneous phenotype .
Prenatal ultrasound findings of marked <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular proptosis <END> in a growth restricted , edematous fetus should prompt consideration of a diagnosis of the NLS .

Relation between tumour necrosis factor polymorphism TNFalpha-308 and risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha affects immune response and airway inflammation , which are characteristics of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Genetic factors may impact TNFalpha levels , and several polymorphisms in the TNF gene cluster on chromosome 6p21 have been associated with TNFalpha production and potential increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
The present paper evaluates the relation between two single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the TNF gene cluster and <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> risk .
The SNPs investigated here are guanine ( G ) to adenosine ( A ) substitutions in the TNFalpha and lymphotoxin alpha ( LTalpha ) genes .
The TNFalpha SNP is at position -308 in the promoter region ( TNFalpha-308 ) , while the LTalpha SNP is in the first intron NcoI recognition sequence ( LTalpha-NcoI ) .
( For both SNPs the G allele is denoted as 1 , and the A allele 2. ) We determined TNFalpha-308 and LTalpha-NcoI genotypes in 511 individuals : 236 <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> cases and 275 non-asthmatic controls .
Data were analysed by logistic regression of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> status on the genotypes and potential confounders .
TNFalpha-308*2 was positively associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , and this relation was strengthened when restricting cases to individuals reporting acute <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> : the adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) comparing carriers of one or two TNFalpha-308*2 alleles versus none was 1.86 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI )=1.03-3.34 , P= 0.04 ) .
Further restricting the subjects to those with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , and those of European-American ancestry strengthened the association even more : adjusted OR=3.16 ( 95 % CI=1.04-9.66 ; P= 0.04 ) .
LTalpha-NcoI*1 was weakly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , and analysis of both genes suggests that only the TNFalpha-308*2 allele increases risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal dysplasia <END> : report of two additional cases .
In recent years , several patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal dysplasia <END> have been described .
We have studied two additional patients with similar findings .
The question of whether <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal dysplasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> are distinct entities remains unanswered .
Identification of other patients in the future may provide additional information .
Pathogenesis of acidosis in hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> fructose intolerance <END> .
An 18-yr-old man with a classical history of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> fructose intolerance <END> ( HFI ) developed typical biochemical changes following an oral fructose load : fructosemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperuricemia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> metabolic acidosis <END> .
Hypokalemia ( 3.1 meq/liter ) was also noted .
Three aspects of this case expand the published literature on this syndrome : (1 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> Metabolic acidosis <END> was found to be due to both <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> proximal renal tubular acidosis <END> ( RTA ) .
We could quantitate the relative contribution of each , and found that urinary bicarbonate loss due to proximal RTA accounted for less than 10 % of the fall in serum bicarbonate .
The major cause of the <START:PHENOTYPE> metabolic acidosis <END> was <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> .
(2 ) Hypokalemia was found to be due to movement of potassium out of the extracellular space rather than to urinary loss .
Potassium may have entered cells with phosphate or may have been sequestered in the gastrointestinal tract .
(3 ) The coexistence of proximal RTA and acidemia made it possible to study the effect of acidemia on the urine-blood partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( PCO2 ) gradient in alkaline urine ( U-B PCO2 ) .
The U-B PCO2 measured during acidemia was much higher at the same urine bicarbonate concentration than in normal controls during alkalemia , providing evidence in humans that acidemia stimulates distal nephron hydrogen-ion secretion .
Opitz oculo-genito-laryngeal syndrome : a rare cause of recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> aspiration <END> pneumonia in an adult .
A 64 year old woman presented with persistent and severe symptoms due to recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> aspiration <END> pneumonias associated with oesophageal reflux .
She had had multiple miscarriages and her son at birth had <START:PHENOTYPE> widely spaced eyes <END> ( hypertelorism) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> , and an <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> .
Her daughter has mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> and her daughter 's son had neonatal inspiratory stridor , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , all features now recognised as typical of the Opitz oculo-genito-laryngeal syndrome .
This syndrome is genetically heterogeneous with autosomal dominant ( linked to chromosome 22q21 ) and X-linked ( linked to Xp22 ) inheritance .
This family 's history and genetic linkage data are consistent with linkage to Xp22 .
The proband is a manifesting carrier of this syndrome ; her history of recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> aspiration <END> is probably secondary to pharyngeal neuromuscular incoordination aggravating gastro-oesophageal reflux .
Obtaining a family history gives a vital clue to the diagnosis of Opitz oculo-genito-laryngeal syndrome .
It is also suggested that this condition should be included in the differential diagnosis of recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> aspiration <END> pneumonia .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> elliptocytosis <END> : clinical , laboratory , and ultrastructural features in infants and children .
Clinical , biochemical and ultrastructural assessment of five Black children from four unrelated kindreds , who had morphologic and laboratory features of <START:PHENOTYPE> hereditary pyropoikilocytosis <END> ( HP ) is described .
In two of the unrelated propositi , both with relatives having <START:PHENOTYPE> elliptocytosis <END> , the apparent HP gradually evolved into <START:PHENOTYPE> elliptocytosis <END> .
The mode of inheritance appeared to be autosomal dominant in one family and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> in the other .
None of the three children from two separate families with true HP had a parent with HP or <START:PHENOTYPE> elliptocytosis <END> .
A sixth Black child , whose mother also had <START:PHENOTYPE> elliptocytosis <END> , demonstrated typical <START:PHENOTYPE> elliptocytosis <END> from birth and never demonstrated the HP phenotype .
Sequential quantitation of heat induced red cell fragmentation using histogram analyses revealed unchanged findings in three patients with true HP but progressive amelioration in the two patients with HP phenotype who eventually developed elliptocytic morphology .
Previously unreported lesions in both true and apparent HP patients included endovesicle formation and submembrane particles , which were detected by electron microscopy , an increase in Heinz body formation , and elevation of oxidized glutathione levels .
Our study demonstrates shared abnormalities present both in some neonates with <START:PHENOTYPE> elliptocytosis <END> and in neonates with HP , which preclude the diagnosis of HP in infancy and provide further evidence of the heterogeneity of the <START:PHENOTYPE> elliptocytosis <END> syndrome .
Evidence that <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> may represent the lower tail of a normal distribution of reading ability .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dyslexia <END> is now widely believed to be a biologically based disorder that is distinct from other , less specific reading problems .
According to this view , reading ability is considered to follow a bimodal distribution , with <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> as the lower mode .
We hypothesized that , instead , reading ability follows a normal distribution , with <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> at the lower end of the continuum .
We used data from the Connecticut Longitudinal Study , a sample survey of 414 Connecticut children who entered kindergarten in 1983 and were followed as a longitudinal cohort .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dyslexia <END> was defined in terms of a discrepancy score , which represents the difference between actual reading achievement and achievement predicted on the basis of measures of intelligence .
Data were available from intelligence tests administered in grades 1 , 3 , and 5 and achievement tests administered yearly in grades 1 through 6 . For each child there were 108 possible discrepancy scores ( [ 3 x 3 years ] x [2 x 6 years] ) based on combinations of the ability scores ( full-scale , verbal , and performance IQ) in each of three years and two achievement scores ( reading and mathematics ) in each of six years .
We demonstrated that each of the discrepancy scores followed a univariate normal distribution and that the interrelation of two different discrepancy scores followed a bivariate normal distribution .
At most , only 9 of 108 discrepancy scores ( 8 .3 percent ) and 171 of 3402 pairs of discrepancy scores ( 5. 0 percent ) were significantly different ( at the 5 percent level ) from the expected scores--well within the expected values for data with univariate and bivariate normal distributions , respectively .
We also examined the stability of <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> over time .
The normal-distribution model predicted ( and the data indicated ) that only 7 of the 25 children ( 28 percent ) classified as having <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> in grade 1 would also be classified as having <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> in grade 3 . Reading difficulties , including <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> , occur as part of a continuum that also includes normal reading ability .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dyslexia <END> is not an all-or-none phenomenon , but like hypertension , occurs in degrees .
The variability inherent in the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> can be both quantified and predicted with use of the normal-distribution model .
Phenotypic spectrum associated with CASK loss-of-function mutations .
Heterozygous mutations in the CASK gene in Xp11 .4 have been shown to be associated with a distinct brain malformation phenotype in females , including disproportionate pontine and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
The study characterised the CASK alteration in 20 new female patients by molecular karyotyping , fluorescence in situ hybridisation , sequencing , reverse transcriptase ( RT) and/or quantitative real-time PCR . Clinical and brain imaging data of a total of 25 patients were reviewed .
11 submicroscopic copy number alterations , including nine deletions of ~11 kb to 4.5 Mb and two duplications , all covering ( part of ) CASK , four splice , four nonsense , and one 1 bp deletion are reported .
These heterozygous CASK mutations most likely lead to a null allele .
Brain imaging consistently showed diffuse brainstem and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> with a <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated fourth ventricle <END> , but of remarkably varying degrees .
Analysis of 20 patients in this study , and five previously reported patients , revealed a core clinical phenotype comprising severe developmental delay/intellectual disability , severe postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , often associated with growth retardation , ( axial ) hypotonia with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertonia <END> of extremities , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic nerve hypoplasia <END> , and/or other eye abnormalities .
A recognisable facial phenotype emerged , including prominent and <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> and tip , small or <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , small chin , and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> .
These findings define the phenotypic spectrum associated with CASK loss-of-function mutations .
The combination of developmental and brain imaging features together with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> facial dysmorphism <END> is highly suggestive of this disorder and should prompt subsequent testing of the CASK gene .
A distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ataxia maps to chromosome 12 in an inbred family from Jordan .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> ataxias are a heterogeneous group of rare disorders characterized by early onset ataxia associated with neurologic , ophthalmologic or systemic signs .
The ataxias associated with myoclonus , epilepsy and progressive neurological degeneration are usually included with the progressive myoclonus epilepsies , one of which is Unverricht-Lundborg disease .
We identified four siblings with ataxia , juvenile onset progressive action <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> atonic seizures <END> from a Jordanian family .
The mode of inheritance of this syndrome is <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
We performed a genome-wide screen for linkage and fine mapped the region that contains the disease locus .
The four affected siblings have ataxia noted at the onset of walking with <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and bulbar features , but no cerebellar hypoplasia on MRI .
They all developed a fine <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> that progressed to a coarse action <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , as well as <START:PHENOTYPE> atonic seizures <END> .
Treatment with valproate fully controlled the seizures and improved the <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , but did not change the course of the ataxia .
We mapped the gene responsible for this disorder to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 12 .
A recently described <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> variant of Unverricht-Lundborg disease also maps to the same region .
We discuss the similarities and differences between our family and the family with the Unverricht-Lundborg disease variant .
Homozygosity mapping of Marinesco-SjÃ¶gren syndrome to 5q31 .
Marinesco-SjÃ¶gren syndrome ( MSS) , first described in 1931 , is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition characterised by somatic and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> and cerebellar ataxia .
Progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> was later reported to be also a cardinal sign of MSS , with <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathic changes <END> on muscle biopsies .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism <END> and skeletal deformities related to pronounced hypotonia were also reported .
The major differential diagnosis of MSS is the syndrome defined by <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , facial dysmorphism and <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral neuropathy <END> ( CCFDN) , which is localised to 18qter .
Using homozygosity mapping strategy in two large consanguineous families of Turkish and Norwegian origin , respectively , we have identified the MSS locus on chromosome 5q31 .
LOD score calculation , including the consanguinity loops , gave a maximum value of 2 .9 and 5.6 at theta= 0 for the Turkish and the Norwegian families , respectively , indicating linkage between the disease and the D5S1995-D5S436 haplotype spanning a 9.3 cM interval .
Patients of the two families presented with the strict clinical features of MSS .
On the other hand , the study of two smaller French and Italian families , initially diagnosed as presenting an atypical MS syndrome , clearly excluded linkage from both the MSS locus on 5q31 and the CCFDN locus in 18qter .
Patients of the two excluded families had all MSS features ( but the <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathic changes <END> ) plus <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral neuropathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and various combinations of microcornea , hearing impairment , seizures , Type I diabetes , cerebral atrophy and leucoencephalopathy , indicating that only the pure MSS syndrome is a homogeneous genetic entity .
Mutations in the COCH gene are a frequent cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> progressive cochleo-vestibular dysfunction , but not of Meniere 's disease .
The COCH gene is the only gene identified in man that causes autosomal dominantly inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> associated with vestibular dysfunction .
The condition is rare and only five mutations have been reported worldwide .
All affected families showed a similar progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> and vestibular dysfunction .
Since Meniere 's disease-like symptoms have also been described in some families , it was suggested that COCH mutations might be present in some patients diagnosed with Meniere 's disease .
In this study , using a Japanese population , we performed a COCH mutation analysis in 23 patients from independent families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> , four of whom reported vestibular symptoms , and also in 20 Meniere 's patients .
While a new point mutation , A119 T, was found in a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> and vestibular symptoms , no mutations were found in the Meniere 's patients .
Like all other previously identified COCH mutations , the mutation identified here is a missense mutation located in the FCH domain of the protein .
The current mutation is located in close spatial proximity to W117 , in which a mutation ( W117R ) had previously been associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> .
Model building suggests that , like the W117R mutation , the A119 T mutation does not affect the structural integrity of the FCH domain , but may interfere with the interaction with a yet unknown binding partner .
We conclude that mutations in the COCH gene are responsible for a significant fraction of patients with autosomal dominantly inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> accompanied by vestibular symptoms , but not for dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> without vestibular dysfunction , or sporadic Meniere 's disease .
Genetic pleiotropy between <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and obesity in a community-based sample of twins .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> and obesity are common conditions that are strongly associated .
This association might be due to shared genetic or environmental causes .
We sought to determine whether a shared genetic cause is responsible for the association between <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and obesity and to estimate the magnitude of shared genetic cause .
The analyses were performed with 1001 monozygotic and 383 dizygotic same-sex twin pairs within the University of Washington Twin Registry .
The presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> was determined by self-report of a physician diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , and body mass index ( BMI ) was calculated by using self-reported height and weight .
Obesity was defined as a BMI of 30 or greater .
The association between <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and BMI was assessed by means of mixed-effects ordinal regression .
Twin correlations examined the association of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and obesity .
Univariate and bivariate structural equation models estimated the components of variance attributable to genetic and environmental effects .
A strong association between <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and BMI was identified in the sample population ( P < .001 ) .
Substantial heritability was detected for <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( 53% ) and obesity ( 77% ) , which is indicative of additive genetic influences on each disorder .
The best-fitting model of shared components of variance indicated that 8 % of the genetic component of obesity is shared with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
The covariation between obesity and <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> is predominantly caused by shared genetic risk factors for both conditions .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Headache <END> and Chiari type I malformation : occurrence in female monozygotic twins and first-degree relatives .
The Chiari type I malformation has recently been reported in three generations of a family , including female monozygotic twins .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Headache <END> was the main symptom in several family members .
Various <START:PHENOTYPE> headache <END> patterns consistent with migraine without aura , cough <START:PHENOTYPE> headache <END> , tension <START:PHENOTYPE> headache <END> and hypoliquorrhoeic <START:PHENOTYPE> headache <END> were present , and different patterns might coexist in the same patient .
In the twins and their mother , who all had a <START:PHENOTYPE> headache <END> consistent with migraine without aura , there were atypical features such as occipital pain location , lack of side-shift of the pain , lack of ergotamine effect and precipitation of attacks by Valsalva-like manoeuvres .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> headache <END> was significantly relieved by operation in the one twin with major herniation and the most marked <START:PHENOTYPE> headache <END> .
We suggest that in these patients the migraine-like <START:PHENOTYPE> headache <END> mimics true migraine but that there is a causal relationship between the different <START:PHENOTYPE> headache <END> types reported and the malformation .
Ectodermal dysplasia-like syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> due to contiguous gene deletion : further clinical and molecular delineation of del(2q32 ) syndrome .
We report on a patient with an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 2 at 2q31.2q33.2 .
She had prenatal and postnatal growth retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , facial dysmorphism , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> talipes equinovarus <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , and ectodermal anomalies .
She showed thin , atrophic skin , sparse , brittle , slowly growing hair , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormally shaped teeth <END> , normal sweating , and normal fingernails , consistent with a diagnosis of ectodermal dysplasia .
Array CGH analysis ( Agilent 44K ) showed the deletion to span 26 Mb , between cytogenetic bands 2q31.2 and 2q33 .
The deletion leads to hemizygosity for the HOXD cluster and its regulatory elements , COL3A1 / COL5A2 , GTF3C3 , CASP8 , CASP10 , and SABT2 could perhaps interfere with long range control of DLX1 and DLX2 expression .
This girl confirms the existence of a clinically recognizable 2q32 microdeletion syndrome , as recently delineated by Van Buggenhout et al . and confirms a novel putative locus for ectodermal dysplasia on chromosome 2q31q33 .
We recommend considering cytogenetic and/or molecular screening for del(2q32 ) in patients with developmental disability and ectodermal dysplasia-like phenotype , including <START:PHENOTYPE> thin skin <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> , dysplastic teeth , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> .
Large recurrent microdeletions associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Reduced fecundity , associated with severe mental disorders , places negative selection pressure on risk alleles and may explain , in part , why common variants have not been found that confer risk of disorders such as <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Thus , rare variants may account for a larger fraction of the overall genetic risk than previously assumed .
In contrast to rare single nucleotide mutations , rare copy number variations ( CNVs ) can be detected using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism arrays .
This has led to the identification of CNVs associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
In a genome-wide search for CNVs associating with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , we used a population-based sample to identify de novo CNVs by analysing 9,878 transmissions from parents to offspring .
The 66 de novo CNVs identified were tested for association in a sample of 1 ,433 <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> cases and 33 ,250 controls .
Three deletions at 1q21.1 , 15q11 .2 and 15q13.3 showing nominal association with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> in the first sample ( phase I ) were followed up in a second sample of 3,285 cases and 7 ,951 controls ( phase II ) .
All three deletions significantly associate with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and related psychoses in the combined sample .
The identification of these rare , recurrent risk variants , having occurred independently in multiple founders and being subject to negative selection , is important in itself .
CNV analysis may also point the way to the identification of additional and more prevalent risk variants in genes and pathways involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia : a disease apparently of desmosome and gap junction formation .
A previously unrecognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome affecting oral , nasal , vaginal , urethral , anal , bladder , and conjunctival mucosa with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , follicular keratosis , nonscarring <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , and terminal lung disease is described in a four-generation kindred of German extraction .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , tearing , and <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> in infancy heralds the development of keratitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal vascularization <END> , and lens <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
Repeated corneal transplants have failed .
Red , periorificial mucosal lesions involving the above structures are noted by 1 year of age and may persist throughout life .
Chronic rhinorrhea and repeated upper respiratory infections frequently progress to bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> accompanied by loss of hair , diarrhea , occasional <START:PHENOTYPE> melena <END> , enuresis , pyuria , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Spontaneous pneumothorax is frequent , terminating in fibrocystic-type lung disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> cor pulmonale <END> .
Women have had repeated abnormal vaginal PAP smears .
Histologically the mucosal epithelium shows dyshesion , thinning of the epithelial layer , and dyskeratosis .
Mucosal PAP smears show lack of epithelial maturation , cytoplasmic vacuoles and inclusions , and individual cell dyskeratosis .
Histochemically there is a lack of cornification and keratinization .
Ultrastructural studies show lack of keratohyalin granules , a paucity of desmosomes , intercellular accumulations , cytoplasmic vacuolization , and formation of bands and aggregates of filamentous fibers and structures in the cytoplasm resembling desmosomes and gap junctions .
The condition is probably a panepithelial cell defect of desmosomal and gap junction structure most prominently affecting mucosal epithelia associated with an increased susceptibility to a variety of adventitious organisms .
[ A case of ceruloplasmin deficiency which showed <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and iron deposition in the brain] .
A 55 -year-old female with progressed <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> was reported .
There was no family history of the same symptoms although her brothers , sisters and a son showed hypoceruloplasminemia and decrease of the serum copper content .
On physical examination , <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> torticollis <END> , choreic involuntary movement of respiratory muscles , hyperreflexia in extremities and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> were noted .
Blood analysis revealed microcytic hypochromic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , decrease of copper content of the serum and urine .
Serum ferritin concentration was increased .
Serum ceruloplasmin could not be detected .
Biopsy of the liver showed that copper content in the liver was slightly increased and iron content was remarkably increased .
On MRI study , dentate nucleus of the cerebellum , the thalamus , the putamen and the caudate nucleus and the liver showed low intensity in both T1 and T2 weighted images .
Based on increased iron content in the liver , the radiological findings of the brain suggested deposition of iron in the brain .
This deposition was considered as caused by deficiency of function of ceruloplasmin as ferroxidase .
This disorder is suggested as a new disease due to ceruloplasmin deficiency different from Wilson 's disease .
Multi-system neurological disease is common in patients with OPA1 mutations .
Additional neurological features have recently been described in seven families transmitting pathogenic mutations in OPA1 , the most common cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> optic atrophy.
However , the frequency of these syndromal 'dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> plus ' variants and the extent of neurological involvement have not been established .
In this large multi-centre study of 104 patients from 45 independent families , including 60 new cases , we show that extra-ocular neurological complications are common in OPA1 disease , and affect up to 20% of all mutational carriers .
Bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> beginning in late childhood and early adulthood was a prominent manifestation , followed by a combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral neuropathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> from the third decade of life onwards .
We also identified novel clinical presentations with spastic paraparesis mimicking hereditary spastic paraplegia , and a multiple sclerosis-like illness .
In contrast to initial reports , multi-system neurological disease was associated with all mutational subtypes , although there was an increased risk with missense mutations [odds ratio = 3.06 , 95 % confidence interval = 1.44-6.49 ; P = 0.0027] , and mutations located within the guanosine triphosphate-ase region ( odds ratio = 2.29 , 95 % confidence interval = 1.08-4.82 ; P = 0.0271 ) .
Histochemical and molecular characterization of skeletal muscle biopsies revealed the presence of cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibres and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in the majority of patients harbouring OPA1 mutations , even in those with isolated optic nerve involvement .
However , the cytochrome c oxidase-deficient load was over four times higher in the dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> + group compared to the pure optic <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> group , implicating a causal role for these secondary mitochondrial DNA defects in disease pathophysiology .
Individuals with dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> plus phenotypes also had significantly worse visual outcomes , and careful surveillance is therefore mandatory to optimize the detection and management of neurological disability in a group of patients who already have significant <START:PHENOTYPE> visual impairment <END> .
Hereditary hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome : the endocrine tumor gene HRPT2 maps to chromosome 1q21-q31 .
The syndrome of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> and jaw tumors ( HPT- JT) is characterized by inheritance , in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern , of recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> parathyroid adenomas <END> , fibro-osseous tumors of the mandible and/or maxilla , <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> parathyroid carcinoma <END> .
This syndrome is clinically and genetically distinct from other endocrine neoplasia syndromes and appears to result from mutation of an endocrine tumor gene designated " HRPT2 . "
We studied five HPT- JT families ( 59 persons , 20 affected ) ; using PCR-based markers , we instituted a genomewide linkage search after excluding several candidate genes .
Lod scores were calculated at various recombination fractions ( theta) , penetrance 90% .
We mapped HRPT2 to the long arm of chromosome 1 ( 1q21-q31 ) .
The maximal lod score was 6.1 0 at theta = .0 with marker D1S212 , or > 10(6 ) odds in favor of linkage .
In six hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> families ( 96 persons , 29 affected ) , we found no linkage to 1q markers closely linked with HRPT2 ( lod scores -15 .6 [ D1S191 ] and -17 . 8 [ D1S196 ] , theta = .001 ) .
Nine <START:PHENOTYPE> parathyroid adenomas <END> and one <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> from nine members of three HPT- JT families were examined for loss of heterozygosity at linked loci .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> parathyroid adenomas <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> showed no loss of heterozygosity for these DNA markers .
Our data establish that HRPT2 , an endocrine tumor gene on the long arm of chromosome 1 , is responsible for the HPT- JT syndrome but not for the classical hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> syndrome .
PARK6-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> occurs in several European families .
The Parkin gene on 6q25.2-27 is responsible for about 5 0 % of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and less than 20% of sporadic early-onset cases .
We recently mapped a novel locus for early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> ( PARK6 ) on chromosome 1p35-p36 in a large family from Sicily .
We now confirm linkage to PARK6 in eight additional families with Parkin-negative <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> from four different European countries .
The maximum cumulative pairwise LOD score was 5.39 for marker D1S478 .
Multipoint linkage analysis gave the highest cumulative LOD score of 6.29 for marker D1S478 .
Haplotype construction and determination of the smallest region of homozygosity in one consanguineous family has reduced the candidate interval to a 9cM region between markers D1S483 and D1S2674 .
No common haplotype could be detected , excluding a common founder effect .
These families share some clinical features with the phenotype reported for European Parkin-positive cases , with a wide range of ages at onset ( up to 68 yrs ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> slow progression <END> .
However , features typical of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , including <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> at onset and sleep benefit , were not observed in PARK6-linked families , thus making the clinical presentation of late-onset cases indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson 's disease . PARK6 appears to be an important locus for early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> in European Parkin-negative patients .
A novel locus for hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( HSP ) are classified clinically as pure when progressive spasticity occurs in isolation or complicated when other neurologic abnormalities are present .
At least 22 genetic loci have been linked to HSP , 8 of which are <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ( ARHSP ) .
HSP complicated with the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> ( HSP-TCC ) is a common subtype of HSP .
One genetic locus has been identified on chromosome 15q13-q15 ( SPG11 ) for HSP-TCC , but some HSP-TC C families have not been linked to this locus .
The authors characterized two families clinically and radiologically and performed a genome-wide scan and linkage analysis .
The two families had complicated ARHSP .
The affected individuals in Family A had <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , whereas in Family B two of three affected individuals had <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
In both families linkage analysis identified a locus on chromosome 8 between markers D8S1820 and D8S532 with the highest combined lod score of 7. 077 at marker D8S505 .
This 9 cM interval located on 8p12-p11 .21 represents a new locus for ARHSP-TC C .
Neuregulin and KIF13B genes , located within this interval , are interesting functional candidate genes for this HSP form .
Two consanguineous families with complicated <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> were clinically characterized and genetically mapped to a new locus on 8p12-p11 .21 .
Association and linkage of atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> with chromosome 13q12-14 and 5q31-33 markers .
Atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects 10-20% of the population .
Linkage of atopy , <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> allergic rhinitis <END> , and total serum IgE levels to several different chromosomal regions have been described extensively , but little is known about the genetic control of atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> .
We tested for the association and linkage between atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> and five chromosomal regions : 5q31-33 , 6p21.3 , 12q15-24.1 , 13q12-31 , and 14q11 .2/14q32 .1-32.3 . Marker analysis was performed in two Caucasian populations : (i ) 192 unrelated German children with atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> and 59 non-atopic children from a German birth cohort study ( MAS '90) , parental DNA was tested in 77 of 192 children with atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> ; ( ii ) 40 Swedish families with at least one family member with atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> selected from the International Study of <START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> and Allergy in Children .
Evidence for linkage and allelic association for atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> was observed for markers on chromosome 13q12-14 and 5q31-33 .
Non-specific X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> aphasia <END> exhibiting genetic linkage to chromosomal region Xp11 .
A new type of non-specific X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> is described in a three generation family .
The three affected males had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( IQ 20 to 30) , mutism , growth failure , <START:PHENOTYPE> frequent infections <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and the following minor anomalies : <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , frontal hair whorl , <START:PHENOTYPE> square face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large mouth <END> , thick lips , and <START:PHENOTYPE> prognathism <END> .
There was not a characteristic facies .
Normal laboratory studies on the proband included a karyotype with fragile X screening , skeletal survey , blood amino acid , urine organic acid , and HGPRT levels .
Linkage analysis was performed with 10 X chromosome DNA probes of which probe DXS255 at chromosomal region Xp11 .22 gave a maximal two point lod score of 2.1 0 if phase was inferred and 1.2 0 if it was not .
Crossovers were shown with probes mapping to regions Xp22 , Xp21 , and Xq28 .
Comparison of these patients with 80 X linked causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , including 41 which might be classified as 'non-specific ' , showed no other disorders compatible with the phenotypic and linkage data .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital cataracts <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> facial dysmorphism <END> neuropathy syndrome , a novel complex genetic disease in Balkan Gypsies : clinical and electrophysiological observations .
During a study of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom in Bulgaria , a previously unrecognized neurological disorder was encountered , mainly in Wallachian Gypsies , who represent a relatively recent genetic isolate .
The disorder has been termed the <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> facial dysmorphism <END> neuropathy ( CCFDN ) syndrome to emphasize its salient features .
Fifty individuals from 19 extended pedigrees were identified and examined clinically and electrophysiologically .
At least 1 patient from each family was admitted to the hospital in Sofia for full investigation .
Pedigree analysis indicates <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
The disorder is recognized in infancy by the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> and microcorneas .
A predominantly motor neuropathy beginning in the lower limbs and later affecting the upper limbs develops during childhood and leads to severe disability by the third decade .
Associated neurological features are a moderate nonprogressive cognitive deficit in most affected individuals together with pyramidal signs and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> chorea <END> in some .
Accompanying nonneurological features include <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , characteristic <START:PHENOTYPE> facial dysmorphism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism <END> .
Nerve conduction studies suggest a hypomyelinating/demyelinating neuropathy , confirmed by nerve biopsy .
The CCFDN syndrome is thus a pleomorphic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder displaying a combination of neurological and nonneurological features .
Mutations in the gene coding for the pre-mRNA splicing factor , PRPF31 , in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinitis pigmentosa <END> is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder .
It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the peripheral retina , leading to night blindness and loss of the peripheral visual field .
PRPF31 is one of four pre-mRNA splicing factors identified as causing <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , with incomplete penetrance being the unique feature associated with mutations in this gene .
The purpose of this study was to identify PRPF31 mutations in a cohort of 118 cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> and determine the genotype-phenotype correlation emerging from the spectrum of mutations in this gene .
Probands with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> underwent ophthalmic evaluation .
Blood samples were obtained , genomic DNA was isolated , and PRPF31 exons along with adjacent splice junctions were amplified by PCR and screened by direct sequencing .
In the 118 individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , six mutations were identified , of which four were novel .
One previously known splice site mutation was identified in two other apparently unrelated families .
Mutations in PRPF31 causing adRP were present in nearly 5 % of a mixed U.K . population .
The age of onset and the severity of the disease varied with different mutations .
In addition , individuals carrying the same mutation showed a range of phenotypic variation , suggesting the involvement of other modifying genes .
The phenotypic spectrum of CADASIL : clinical findings in 102 cases .
Cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> ( CADASIL ) is an increasingly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder that leads to cerebrovascular manifestations in early adulthood .
This study delineates the phenotypic spectrum and the natural history of the disease in 102 affected individuals from 29 families with biopsy-proven CADASIL .
Recurrent ischemic episodes ( transient ischemic attack [ TIA] or <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> ) were the most frequent presentation found in 71 % of the cases ( mean age at onset , 46 .1 years ; range , 30-66 years ; SD , 9. 0 years ) .
Forty-eight percent of the cases had developed cognitive deficits .
Dementia ( 28% ) was frequently accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> gait disturbance <END> (90% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> urinary incontinence <END> ( 86% ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudobulbar palsy <END> (52% ) .
Thirty-nine patients ( 38% ) had a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> ( mean age at onset , 26. 0 years ; SD , 8.2 years ) , which was classified as <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> with aura in 87 % of the cases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Psychiatric disturbances <END> were present in 30% of the cases , with adjustment disorder ( 24% ) being the most frequent diagnosis .
Ten patients (1 0% ) had a history of epileptic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
To delineate the functional consequences of ischemic deficits , we studied the extent of disability in different age groups .
The full spectrum of disability was seen in all groups older than age 45 . Fifty-five percent of the patients older than age 60 were unable to walk without assistance .
However , 14 % in this age group exhibited no disability at all . Kaplan-Meier analysis disclosed median survival times of 64 years ( males ) and 69 years ( females ) .
An investigation of the 18 multiplex families revealed marked intrafamilial variations .
Cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome .
We describe two boys with the cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome ( CCMS ) .
Both patients presented with Pierre Robin anomaly and <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory insufficiency <END> and died 12 hours and 10 months after birth .
The first boy had muscular hypotonia , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> glossoptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short palate <END> , preauricular tag , paraumbilical fibroma , and a small and narrow thorax .
His chest roentgenographs showed marked hypoplasia of the first to tenth rib , multiple posterior rib-gaps in the only four ossified ribs .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Tracheomalacia <END> and stenosis of the left ureter was observed during autopsy .
No structural cerebral anomalies were observed .
Respiratory distress necessitated a tracheostomy in the second boy .
He had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> glossoptosis <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft soft palate <END> were noted .
His chest roentgenograph showed a bell-shaped , <START:PHENOTYPE> small thorax <END> with multiple dorsal rib-gap defects .
CCMS is a rare disorder often associated with Pierre Robin anomaly .
Chest roentgenographs show the typical posterior rib-gap defects , which are quite variable .
CCMS usually occurs as an isolated event in a family .
Of 41 reported families four reports describe horizontal and two describe vertical transmission of CCMS .
This might imply genetic heterogeneity with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Inter- and intrafamilial expression is variable .
Careful family studies are necessary before genetic counseling is given .
Cherubism , <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival fibromatosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deficiency <END> ( Ramon syndrome ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
This is a report on four persons in one family with a condition similar to that described by Ramon et al [ Oral Surg 24:436-48 , 1967 ] in two sibs born to a consanguineous couple .
Our patients also had <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deficiency <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , cherubism due to fibrous dysplasia of the maxillae , <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival fibromatosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , and stunted growth .
This appears to be an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait in both families .
Our patients are the second set reported with this syndrome ; they also have <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile rheumatoid arthritis <END> , which was not described in the family reported by Ramon et al [ Oral Surg 24:436-48 , 1967 ] .
We conclude that the Ramon syndrome should also include <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
Cerebellar ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and sensorineural hearing loss ( CAPOS ) : a new syndrome .
There are a large number of well recognised syndromes comprising cerebellar ataxia in association with other neurological features .
We report three family members who presented with a relapsing , early onset cerebellar ataxia , associated with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
All three patients have <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> ( in the absence of a peripheral neuropathy) , a <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> deformity , and show varying degrees of severity .
Extensive neurological investigations have been normal , and the aetiology and pathophysiology of this disorder remain unclear .
This may represent a separate syndrome of early onset cerebellar ataxia with associated features ( " cerebellar ataxia plus " ) , which is likely to either have an autosomal dominant or maternal mitochondrial pattern of inheritance .
The recognition of this association under the acronym of CAPOS ( cerebellar ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> ) may help in the delineation of a new syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> , and primary <START:PHENOTYPE> amenorrhea <END> .
A dominant trait .
The syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> is a rare but well-documented <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder .
Although <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> has been repeatedly confirmed , several observers have noted that transmission of the trait is predominantly through an affected male parent .
To our knowledge , no published observations have accounted for this unusual differential transmission .
Described here is a family with typical features of this disorder and in addition primary <START:PHENOTYPE> amenorrhea <END> in the affected women .
The primary <START:PHENOTYPE> amenorrhea <END> , which has not been previously documented in this disorder , does account for differential transmission in this family and possibly in other families .
Since affected individuals are treated by ophthalmologists , the possible occurrence of this extraocular manifestation should be recognized in the management of patients and their families .
Advances in hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> refers to a group of clinically similar disorders whose primary feature is insidiously progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> lower extremity weakness <END> and spasticity .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> is genetically diverse : loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ( chromosome 8p ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> ( chromosome 2p , 14q , and 15q ) , and x-linked hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> have been identified .
The existence of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> families for whom the disorder is unlinked to these loci indicates the existence of additional , as yet undiscovered , hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> loci .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> exhibits axonal degeneration that is maximal at the terminal portions of the longest central nervous system axons .
Efforts to positionally clone the hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> gene are in progress .
A two base pair deletion in the PQBP1 gene is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> has been traditionally divided into syndromic ( S-XLMR ) and non-syndromic forms ( NS-XLMR) , although the borderlines between these phenotypes begin to vanish and mutations in a single gene , for example PQBP1 , can cause S-XLMR as well as NS-XLMR .
Here , we report two maternal cousins with an apparently X-linked phenotype of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MR) , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , choroid <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> renal hypoplasia <END> , and spastic paraplegia .
By multipoint linkage analysis with markers spanning the entire X-chromosome we mapped the disease locus to a 28-Mb interval between Xp11 .4 and Xq12 , including the BCOR gene .
A missense mutation in BCOR was described in a family with Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome , a phenotype showing substantial overlapping features with that described in the two cousins .
However , no mutation in the BCOR gene was found in both patients .
Subsequent mutation analysis of PQBP1 , located within the delineated linkage interval in Xp11 .23 , revealed a 2-bp deletion , c.461 _462delAG , that cosegregated with the disease .
Notably , the same mutation is associated with the Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome , another form of S-XLMR .
Haplotype analysis suggests a germline mosaicism of the 2-bp deletion in the maternal grandmother of both affected individuals .
In summary , our findings demonstrate for the first time that mutations in PQBP1 are associated with an S-XLMR phenotype including <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , thereby further extending the clinical spectrum of phenotypes associated with PQBP1 mutations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ectopia lentis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic root dilatation <END> in congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> .
Congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> ( CCA ) was described by Beals and Hecht as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder distinct from Marfan syndrome and comprising joint contractures , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , scoliosis , and a distinct " <START:PHENOTYPE> crumpled ear <END> " deformity .
While the disorder is similar to Marfan syndrome , it was split from it due to the distinct physical appearance of the patients and , more importantly , the lack of heart and eye findings .
Since the original report , several CCA patients have been found to have <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> , structural cardiac anomalies , and occasionally aortic root dilatations similar to those seen in Marfan syndrome .
We report on a patient with CCA with bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic root dilatation <END> .
Our review of the literature of CCA showed that serial echocardiography and careful eye examinations have not become a standard of medical practice in this condition .
Partly this may be due to a lack of documented cases of CCA having severe <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> and cardiac complications .
This patient underscores the need for periodic eye and echocardiographic evaluations of all CCA patients .
Dominantly inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> renal adysplasia <END> .
We are reporting on 7 families with both unilateral and bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> renal agenesis <END> ( or severe dysplasia ) .
This condition , termed hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> renal adysplasia <END> ( HRA ) [ Buchta et al , 1973 ] , is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait with incomplete penetrance and variable expression .
Review of the literature on familial <START:PHENOTYPE> renal agenesis <END> suggests that HRA is more common than previously supposed and may account for most recurrences of bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> renal agenesis <END> ( BRA) , even when the parents are normal .
There are no consistent phenotypic differences between sporadic and familial <START:PHENOTYPE> renal agenesis <END> .
Associated non-urogenital anomalies , although more frequent in sporadic cases , have been reported in HRA .
Use of several approaches , including the Weinberg Proband Method , segregation analysis , and empiric risk estimation , leads to the conclusion that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> is the most likely pattern of transmission for most cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> renal agenesis <END> .
Penetrance is between 5 0 % and 90% .
Ultrasound study of the kidneys of parents , sibs , and other relatives is recommended in all families in which there is an individual with unilateral or bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> renal agenesis <END> .
The empiric risk for recurrence of BRA in sibs has been estimated at 3.5 % [ Carter , et al , 1979 ] but in the offspring of affected or obligate heterozygotes for HRA , the empiric risk of bilateral severe <START:PHENOTYPE> renal adysplasia <END> is 15-20% .
Inheritance of human <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> : evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission in high-risk families .
Segregation analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in families can provide the logical basis and the specific genetic models for mapping and identifying genes responsible for human <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Patterns of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> occurrence in families were investigated by complex segregation analysis .
In a sample of 1579 nuclear families ascertained through a population-based series of probands , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model with a highly penetrant susceptibility allele fully explained disease clustering .
From the maximum-likelihood Mendelian model , the frequency of the susceptibility allele was 0.0006 in the general population , and lifetime risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> was 0.82 among susceptible women and 0.08 among women without the susceptibility allele .
Inherited susceptibility affected only 4% of families in the sample : multiple cases of this relatively common disease occurred in other families by chance .
The same genetic models , with higher gene frequency , explained disease clustering in an extended kindred at high risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Evidence for a highly penetrant , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> susceptibility allele for <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in a high-risk family and the general population suggests that high-risk families can serve as models for understanding <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in the population as a whole .
Novel compound heterozygous SLC4A1 mutations in Thai patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> distal renal tubular acidosis <END> .
Mutations in the SLC4A1 gene have been found to cause either autosomal dominant ( AD ) or <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ( AR ) <START:PHENOTYPE> distal renal tubular acidosis <END> (dRTA ) .
The SLC4A1 mutations causing AD dRTA were reported in white patients , whereas those associated with AR dRTA were often found in Southeast Asia . Here , the authors report additional novel SLC4A1 mutations in 3 patients with AR dRTA from 2 unrelated Thai families .
The patients and members of their families were clinically studied .
Red cell morphology and sulfate influx were examined .
The SLC4A1 gene was screened , analyzed , and confirmed for mutations by molecular genetic techniques .
In the first family , the patient had dRTA , <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , and hypokalemic-hyperchloremic <START:PHENOTYPE> metabolic acidosis <END> with a urine pH level of 7.00 .
He had novel compound heterozygous SLC4A1 G701D/S773 P mutations , inherited from clinically normal heterozygous mother and father .
In the second family , the patient and his sister had dRTA and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis ( SAO ) with different clinical severity .
The patient had proximal muscle weakness , <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , hypokalemia , normal anion gap <START:PHENOTYPE> metabolic acidosis <END> , and urine pH level of 6.8 0 .
His sister was asymptomatic but the urine pH level could not be lowered to below 5.5 0 after a short acid load .
Both siblings had compound heterozygous SLC4A1 SAO/R602H mutations .
Two novel compound heterozygous SLC4A1 G701D/S773 P and SAO/R602H mutations were identified in Thai patients with AR dRTA .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> associated with calf hypertrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> in three Italian families : evidence for a novel CMD syndrome .
We describe four Italian patients ( aged 3 , 4 , 12 , and 13 years ) affected by a novel autosomal form of recessive congenital muscular dystrophy.
These patients were from three non-consanguineous families and presented an almost identical phenotype .
This was characterized by hypotonia at birth , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> associated with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> absent speech <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> inability to walk <END> and almost no interest in their surroundings .
In addition , all patients had a striking enlargement of the calf and quadriceps muscles .
Ophthalmologic examination revealed no structural ocular abnormalities in any of the children ; one patient had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> .
In all cases a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed an abnormal posterior cranial fossa with enlargement of the cisterna magna and variable hypoplasia of the vermis of the cerebellum .
Abnormality of the white matter was also present in all patients , in the form of patchy signal most evident in the periventricular areas .
Serum CK was grossly elevated in all .
The muscle biopsy from all cases showed dystrophic changes compatible with congenital muscular dystrophy.
Immunofluorescence studies showed mild to moderate partial deficiency of laminin alpha 2 chain .
Linkage analysis in the only informative family excluded the known loci for congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> , including laminin alpha 2 chain on chromosome 6q2 , the Fukuyama congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> locus on 9q3 and the muscle-eye-brain disease on chromosome 1p3 .
We propose that this represent a novel severe variant of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> , with associated central nervous system involvement .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with ASPM mutation shows simplified cortical gyration with antero-posterior gradient pre- and post-natally .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> is a disorder of brain development characterized by a congenitally small but normally formed brain , and non-progressive mild-to-moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Most cases are inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> pattern , with genetic heterogeneity , the ASPM locus being most common .
Postnatal imaging data are scarce and prenatal imaging unreported .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> with simplified gyral pattern shares features with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , but it is not clear whether these disorders are part of a phenotypic continuum .
We examined a consanguineous family with a daughter affected with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and an ongoing pregnancy .
We performed prenatal and postnatal brain magnetic resonance imaging and genetic analyses in the course of genetic evaluation .
The affected daughter and the fetus were homozygous for polymorphic markers linked to the ASPM locus , and we identified a novel , truncating ASPM mutation by direct sequencing of the gene .
Imaging at 30 and 35 gestational weeks showed <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with simplified gyration , more severe anteriorly .
The antero-posterior gradient of gyration persisted 1 week after birth .
Brain imaging in the affected sister also showed some degree of a predominantly anterior simplification of gyration .
Our data suggest that one form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> is allelic to at least a subset of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with simplified gyral pattern , and that the neuronal depletion associated with the ASPM defect predominantly affects the anterior cortex .
Familial pulmonary arterial hypertension , leucopenia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> : a probable new familial syndrome with multisystem involvement .
We present two siblings with identical clinical findings that seem to represent a previously unreported familial syndrome .
Major findings involve three systems : pulmonary arterial hypertension , cardiac abnormalities including secundum-type <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> , and the hematopoietic system with intermittent <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphopenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> monocytosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> .
The siblings also shared several minor abnormalities : <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus carinatum <END> , long fingers , proximally placed thumb , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> .
The male proband also had bilateral inguinal hernias and <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> .
The same findings in two siblings suggest a genetic cause--either an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder or germline mosaicism in one parent for a dominant mutation .
Investigations revealed a bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 polymorphism in intron 4 in only one sibling , which was also present in unaffected maternal relatives .
Hereditary vascular <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , cerebroretinal vasculopathy , and hereditary endotheliopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> map to a single locus on chromosome 3p21.1-p21.3 .
We performed a genomewide search for linkage in an extended Dutch family with hereditary vascular <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> and Raynaud phenomenon .
Patients with vascular <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> are characterized by microangiopathy of the retina , accompanied by microaneurysms and telangiectatic capillaries .
The genome search , using a high throughput capillary sequencer , revealed significant evidence of linkage to chromosome 3p21.1-p21.3 ( maximum pairwise LOD score 5.25 , with D3S1578 ) .
Testing of two additional families that had a similar phenotype , cerebroretinal vasculopathy , and hereditary endotheliopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> , revealed linkage to the same chromosomal region ( combined maximum LOD score 6.30 , with D3S1588 ) .
Haplotype analysis of all three families defined a 3-cM candidate region between D3S1578 and D3S3564 .
Our study shows that three <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> vasculopathy syndromes with prominent cerebroretinal manifestations map to the same 3-cM interval on 3p21 , suggesting a common locus .
An oculocerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> syndrome .
An oculocerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> syndrome consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dolichocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> , small , <START:PHENOTYPE> widely spaced teeth <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized hypopigmentation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , progressive neurological manifestations and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypochromic anemia <END> is described in sibs .
The finding of parental consanguinity supports <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
The syndrome resembles the Cross syndrome ( 1 ,2 ) .
Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy plus <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> is caused by a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA point mutation .
A novel point mutation in the ND6 subunit of complex I at position 14 ,459 of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( MTND6* LDY T14459A ) was identified as a candidate mutation for the highly tissue-specific disease .
Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy plus <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
Since the MTND6* LDYT14459 A mutation was identified in a single family , other pedigrees with the mutation are needed to confirm its association with the disease .
Clinical , biochemical , and genetic characterization is reported in two additional pedigrees .
Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy developed in two family members in one pedigree .
The daughter had clinically silent basal ganglia lesions .
In a second pedigree , a single individual presented with childhood-onset generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral basal ganglia lesions <END> .
Patient groups that included individuals with Leigh 's disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> plus complex neurodegeneration , and Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy did not harbor the MTND6* LDYT14459 A mutation , suggesting that this mutation displays a high degree of tissue specificity , thus producing a narrow phenotypic range .
These results confirm the association of the MTND6* LDYT14459 A mutation with Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
As the first genetic abnormality that has been identified to cause generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , this mutation suggests that nuclear DNA or <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations in oxidative phosphorylation genes are important considerations in the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
Multilocus linkage of familial hyperkalaemia and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> type II , to chromosomes 1q31-42 and 17p11-q21 .
Essential <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> is a common multifactorial trait .
The molecular basis of a number of rare diseases that after blood pressure in humans has been established , identifying pathways that may be involved in more common forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> type II ( PHAII , also known as familial hyperkalaemia and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> or Gordon 's syndrome ; OMIM #145260 ) , is characterized by hyperkalaemia despite normal renal glomerular filtration , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and correction of physiologic abnormalities by thiazide diuretics .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperchloremia <END> , metabolic acidosis and suppressed plasma renin activity are variable associated findings .
The pathogenesis of PHAII is unknown , although clinical studies indicate an abnormality in renal ion transport .
As thiazide diuretics are among the most efficacious agents in the treatment of essential <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , understanding the pathogenesis of PHAII may be of relevance to more common forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
Analysis of linkage in eight PHAII families showing <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission demonstrates locus heterogeneity of this trait , with a multilocus lod score of 8 .1 for linkage of PHAII to chromosomes 1q31-q42 and 17p11-q21 .
Interestingly , the chromosome-17 locus overlaps a syntenic interval in rat that contains a blood pressure quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) .
Our findings provide a first step toward identification of the molecular basis of PHAII.
Clinical and genetic analysis of a large Dutch family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> vascular <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> and Raynaud 's phenomenon .
We describe an extended Dutch family with a new hereditary disorder : <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> vascular <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> and Raynaud 's phenomenon .
Information was obtained on 289 family members ( 15 1 males , 138 females) , of whom 198 were personally interviewed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinopathy <END> was found in 20 ( 6 .9% ) of the family members , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> in 65 ( 22.5% ) and Raynaud 's phenomenon in 50 ( 17 .3% ) .
A combination of all three symptoms was found in 11 subjects .
In a genetic linkage analysis we firstly excluded several candidate loci .
Subsequently , 75 % of the autosomal genome was excluded in a genome-wide search .
The following conclusions were drawn .
First , genetic factors are involved in Raynaud 's phenomenon .
Secondly , the genetic linkage of <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> with vascular <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> and Raynaud 's phenomenon supports a vascular aetiology of this disorder .
Finding the gene for this family may help to elucidate the genetic background of <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> and of vascular disorders in general .
Recurrent mutations in DNAJC5 cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Kufs disease .
We sought to identify the molecular basis of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of Kufs disease , an <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis .
We used a combination of classic linkage analysis and Next Generation Sequencing to map and identify mutations in DNAJC5 in a total of three families .
We analyzed the clinical manifestations in 20 individuals with mutation in DNAJC5 .
We report here the mapping and the identification of a p.L116del mutation in DNAJC5 segregating with the disease in two distinct American families , as well as a p.L115 R mutation in an additional family .
The age of onset and clinical manifestations were very homogeneous among mutation positive individuals , including generalized tonic-clonic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , speech deterioration , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , and premature death .
A few individuals also exhibited <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
DNAJC5 , which encodes the cysteine string protein ( CSPÎ±) , a presynaptic protein implicated in neurodegeneration , causes <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Kufs disease .
The leucine residues at positions 115 and 116 are hotspots for mutations and result in a homogeneous phenotype of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with onset around 30 years old . Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/ S .
The telecanthus-hypospadias syndrome .
The telecanthus-hypospadias ( BBB ) syndrome is characterised by widely spaced inner ocular canthi and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> of variable degree .
Heterozygous females have <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> .
We have summarised the historical and phenotypic findings of 21 patients in seven previous publications .
We have also had the opportunity to evaluate personally 12 families with a total of 18 affected males .
The most frequent anomalies in patients previously reported are <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> 21/21 , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> 19/21 , cleft lip/palate or uvula 7/ 21 , high , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> 15 /15 , cranial abnormality 6/21 , congenital heart defect 5/21 , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> 9/21 , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> 11 /17 .
In our series , the most frequent anomalies include <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> 18 /18 , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> 18 /18 , cleft lip/palate or uvula 8/18 , high , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> 10/11 , cranial abnormality 12 /18 , congenital heart defect 3/18 , upper urinary tract anomaly 4/9 , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> 10/12 .
There is also an increased incidence of like-sex twinning , 11 /18 in our families .
This syndrome must be more common than reflected in published reports .
Based upon the observation that males are much more severely affected than females and the lack of male to male transmission , it appears that this condition is most likely to be inherited in an X linked fashion .
Further elucidation of the phenotype and documentation of the inheritance is needed .
The distinction between the telecanthus-hypospadias syndrome and the G syndrome also needs further clarification .
X-exome sequencing identifies a HDAC8 variant in a large pedigree with X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> truncal obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gynaecomastia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> and unusual face .
We present a large Dutch family with seven males affected by a novel syndrome of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gynaecomastia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> truncal obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and recognisable craniofacial manifestations resembling but not identical to Wilson-Turner syndrome .
Seven female relatives show a much milder expression of the phenotype .
We performed X chromosome exome ( X-exome ) sequencing in five individuals from this family and identified a novel intronic variant in the histone deacetylase 8 gene ( HDAC8 ) , c.164+5G >A , which disturbs the normal splicing of exon 2 resulting in exon skipping , and introduces a premature stop at the beginning of the histone deacetylase catalytic domain .
The identified variant completely segregates in this family and was absent in 96 Dutch controls and available databases .
Affected female carriers showed a notably skewed X-inactivation pattern in lymphocytes in which the mutated X-chromosome was completely inactivated .
HDAC8 is a member of the protein family of histone deacetylases that play a major role in epigenetic gene silencing during development .
HDAC8 specifically controls the patterning of the skull with the mouse HDAC8 knock-out showing craniofacial deformities of the skull .
The present family provides the first evidence for involvement of HDAC8 in a syndromic form of <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> .
Prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> in a United States population : the Brick Township , New Jersey , investigation .
This study determined the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> for a defined community , Brick Township , New Jersey , using current diagnostic and epidemiologic methods .
The target population was children who were 3 to 10 years of age in 1998 , who were residents of Brick Township at any point during that year , and who had an <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorder .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> spectrum disorder was defined as autistic disorder , pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified ( PDD-NOS) , and Asperger disorder .
The study used 4 sources for active case finding : special education records , records from local clinicians providing diagnosis or treatment for developmental or behavioral disabilities , lists of children from community parent groups , and families who volunteered for participation in the study in response to media attention .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> diagnosis was verified ( or ruled out ) for 71 % of the children through clinical assessment .
The assessment included medical and developmental history , physical and neurologic evaluation , assessment of intellectual and behavioral functioning , and administration of the <START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic .
The prevalence of all <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorders combined was 6.7 cases per 1000 children .
The prevalence for children whose condition met full diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder was 4. 0 cases per 1000 children , and the prevalence for PDD-NOS and Asperger disorder was 2.7 cases per 1000 children .
Characteristics of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> in this study were similar to those in previous studies of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
The prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> in Brick Township seems to be higher than that in other studies , particularly studies conducted in the United States , but within the range of a few recent studies in smaller populations that used more thorough case-finding methods .
Velo-facio-skeletal syndrome in a mother and daughter .
We present a woman and her daughter with an apparently new <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> syndrome associated with facial and skeletal anomalies and hypernasality .
Manifestations included <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> with broad and <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthal folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow and high arched palate <END> , mild mesomelic brachymelia , short broad hands , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent finger pads <END> , hyperextensibility of hand joints , <START:PHENOTYPE> small feet <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nasal voice <END> , and normal intelligence .
The mother had short stubby thumbs and the daughter had <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly angulated ears <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> .
The morphology of the nose and the hypernasality are reminiscent to those in the velo-cardio-facial syndrome .
High resolution banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization studies showed no evidence of 22q11 deletions .
Differentiation from Aarskog syndrome and Robinow syndrome is discussed .
Limb reduction defects and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysplasia <END> : confirmation of a new , apparently lethal , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> MCA syndrome .
We report on 2 sibs , a male and a female , who died shortly after birth from <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> .
They combined growth retardation with a Potter-like face , complete <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> of the upper limbs , <START:PHENOTYPE> rib anomalies <END> ( mainly severe hypoplasia of the 6 upper ribs ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysplasia <END> , and external genital abnormalities .
We hypothesize that these cases represent evidence for the existence of the " new syndrome " described by Ulbright et al . ( Am J Med Genet 17 :667-668 , 1984 ) .
This syndrome appears lethal because of the severe <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysplasia <END> that causes <START:PHENOTYPE> oligohydramnios <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> .
Its mode of inheritance seems to be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
Clinical observations on 56 patients .
To study the clinical profile and kindreds of patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> ( FUM ) .
Retrospective case series .
Tertiary referral center .
Medical charts of 4500 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> were reviewed for family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
The clinical profile of these patients and their kindreds were studied to determine the incidence of FUM and pattern of inheritance .
The association of FUM to cutaneous melanoma , familial atypical mole and melanoma syndrome , and other nonmelanocytic cancers was analyzed using statistical methods .
Of 4500 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> , 56 patients in 27 families ( 0.6% ) had a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> in all 56 familial patients was unilateral .
In 17 cases ( 63% ) , the second affected relative was a first-degree relative .
In the remainder , the second affected relative was a second- ( 22% ) and third-degree ( 15% ) relative .
In 25 families ( 93% ) only two members were affected , and in two families ( 7% ) three members had <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
Patients with FUM were four times as likely to have a second primary malignant neoplasm than were people in the general population .
However , no evidence was seem that unaffected kindreds of patients with FUM were at higher risk of having a second primary malignant neoplasm .
Familial involvement in <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> is rare .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> most often ( 63% ) affects first-degree relatives , rarely affects more than two persons in a family , and may be associated with a generalized inherited predisposition to cancer .
Further genetic studies are necessary to fully characterize FUM syndrome .
A Korean kindred with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> nocturnal frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
A Korean family had distinctive clinical and neuroimaging features and carried the same genetic mutation that was found in a previously described Japanese kindred with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> nocturnal frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
To describe the first Korean family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> nocturnal frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Members of a large family , including 9 affected individuals from 3 generations , underwent a comprehensive genetic , clinical , electroencephalographic , neuropsychological , and neuroimaging evaluation .
Affected members were tested for possible mutations in transmembrane regions 1 through 3 of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha4 subunit ( CHRNA4 ) by direct sequencing and subsequent restriction analysis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> began in childhood , presenting as nocturnal episodes of staring , confusion , shouting , perioral movements , unintelligible speech , and hand waving .
Some patients had ictal or interictal epileptiform activity in the temporal and/or frontocentral areas .
Neurological examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging results showed no abnormalities , except that all patients available for testing had mild to moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 with positron emission tomography showed mild decreased glucose uptake in the superior and middle frontal regions , more so on the left than on the right .
Patient response to carbamazepine was poor .
All affected members were heterozygous for the CHRNA4 Ser252Leu mutation .
Disorders associated with mutations in the transmembrane region 2 of CHRNA4 are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous .
Distinctive features of this kindred include (1 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in all affected members available for testing , (2 ) abnormal brain findings on fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 with positron emission tomography , (3 ) poor response to carbamazepine , and (4 ) full penetrance .
Linkage analysis in British and French families with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> .
Idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> is most commonly caused by an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> gene or genes with <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced penetrance <END> .
An idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> locus has been mapped to chromosome 9q34 in one large non-Jewish and several Jewish kindreds in the USA .
Linkage analysis was performed in 27 ( 26 British , one French ) small families with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> , three of which were Ashkenazi Jewish , using the highly polymorphic loci argininosuccinate synthetase ( ASS ) and Abelson oncogene ( ABL ) which map to 9q34 .
The cumulative lod score for the more informative ASS locus at a recombination fraction of 0.001 was -6.72 .
A large component of this score was derived from three non-Jewish families , indistinguishable clinically from the others , in which individual lod scores excluded a disease locus tightly linked to ASS . Analysis of all the data using HOMOG showed significant heterogeneity , but evidence for linkage of an idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> gene to 9q34 in a subset of families .
The allelic association observed between ASS/ABL and idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> in Ashkenazi families in the USA was also present in British Jewish kindreds .
These data suggest genetic heterogeneity in idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> but indicate the existence of a locus for idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> at 9q34 in both Jewish and non-Jewish kindreds in the UK .
X-linked VACTERL with hydrocephalus syndrome : further delineation of the phenotype caused by FANCB mutations .
X-linked VACTERL-hydrocephalus syndrome ( X-linked VACTERL-H ) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in the gene FANCB which underlies Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> Anemia <END> ( FA ) complementation group B . Cells from affected males have <START:PHENOTYPE> increased chromosome breakage <END> on exposure to DNA cross-linking agents .
Only five FANCB mutations found in six affected males , including an affected uncle and nephew , have been reported .
We have identified FANCB mutations in a further four affected families .
The VACTERL-H phenotype segregates as an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> trait in three of these .
Each mutation is predicted to truncate the FANCB open reading frame and results in highly skewed X-inactivation in unaffected carrier females .
Phenotypic data were available on six affected males .
Comparison of the clinical findings in our patients with published clinical data ( total 12 patients ) shows that <START:PHENOTYPE> ventriculomegaly <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> absent thumbs <END> and radii , vertebral defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> renal agenesis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> are the major phenotypic signs in affected males .
Less frequent are brain , pituitary , ear and eye malformations , gastrointestinal atresias ( esophageal , duodenal and anal) , <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheoesophageal fistula <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lung segmentation defects <END> , and small genitalia .
Three of six of our patients survived the perinatal period .
One boy lived up to 2 years 10 months but developed aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> and died of renal failure .
These data show that loss-of-function FANCB mutations result in a recognizable , multiple malformation phenotype in hemizygous males for which we propose clinical criteria to aid diagnosis .

Recurrent 16p11 .2 microdeletions in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> is a childhood neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic component , yet the identification of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> susceptibility loci remains elusive .
We investigated 180 <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> probands and 372 control subjects by array comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH ) using a 19K whole-genome tiling path bacterial artificial chromosome microarray to identify submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements specific to <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
We discovered a recurrent 16p11 .2 microdeletion in two probands with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and none in controls .
The deletion spans approximately 50 0-kb and is flanked by approximately 147-kb segmental duplications ( SDs ) that are >99 % identical , a common characteristic of genomic disorders .
We assessed the frequency of this new <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> genomic disorder by screening an additional 532 probands and 465 controls by quantitative PCR and identified two more patients but no controls with the microdeletion , indicating a combined frequency of 0.6 % ( 4/71 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> versus 0/837 controls ; Fisher exact test P = 0.044 ) .
We confirmed all 16p11 .2 deletions using fluorescence in situ hybridization , microsatellite analyses and aCGH , and mapped the approximate deletion breakpoints to the edges of the flanking SDs using a custom-designed high-density oligonucleotide microarray .
Bioinformatic analysis localized 12 of the 25 genes within the microdeletion to nodes in one interaction network .
We performed phenotype analyses and found no striking features that distinguish patients with the 16p11 .2 microdeletion as a distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> subtype .
Our work reports the first frequency , breakpoint , bioinformatic and phenotypic analyses of a de novo 16p11 .2 microdeletion that represents one of the most common recurrent genomic disorders associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> to date .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Postnatal growth failure <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , mental retardation , cataracts , large joint contractures , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical dysplasia <END> , and cerebellar atrophy.
We describe two sibs with postnatal-onset growth deficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , cataract , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent supraorbital ridge <END> , large joint contractures , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> , and mental retardation .
The combination appears to constitute a previously undescribed syndrome inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> pattern .

Unknown diagnosis in two male cousins with facial abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal EEG <END> , and severe psychomotor retardation .
We report two male cousins with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> absent ear lobes <END> , high-arched palates , <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal EEG <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> .
Both cousins have consanguineous parents .
Differential diagnoses are discussed and the possibility that we might be reporting on a new syndrome is raised .

Investigation of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and GABA receptor subunit genes in multiple ethnic groups .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> is a neurodevelopmental disorder of complex genetics , characterized by impairment in social interaction and communication , as well as repetitive behavior .
Multiple lines of evidence , including alterations in levels of GABA and GABA receptors in autistic patients , indicate that the GABAergic system , which is responsible for synaptic inhibition in the adult brain , may be involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Previous studies in our lab indicated association of noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) within a GABA receptor subunit gene on chromosome 4 , GABRA4 , and interaction between SNPs in GABRA4 and GABRB1 ( also on chromosome 4) , within Caucasian <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> patients .
Studies of genetic variation in African-American <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> families are rare .
Analysis of 557 Caucasian and an independent population of 54 African-American families with 35 SNPs within GABRB1 and GABRA4 strengthened the evidence for involvement of GABRA4 in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> risk in Caucasians ( rs175 99165 , p= 0.0015 ; rs1912960 , p= 0.0073 ; and rs175 99416 , p= 0.0040 ) and gave evidence of significant association in African-Americans ( rs2280073 , p= 0.0287 and rs16859788 , p= 0.0253 ) .
The GABRA4 and GABRB1 interaction was also confirmed in the Caucasian dataset ( most significant pair , rs1912960 and rs2351299 ; p= 0.004 ) .
Analysis of the subset of families with a positive history of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> activity in at least one <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> patient revealed no association to GABRA4 ; however , three SNPs within GABRB1 showed significant allelic association ; rs2351299 ( p= 0.0163 ) , rs4482737 ( p= 0.0339) , and rs3832300 ( p= 0.0253 ) .
These results confirmed our earlier findings , indicating GABRA4 and GABRB1 as genes contributing to <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> susceptibility , extending the effect to multiple ethnic groups and suggesting <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> as a stratifying phenotype .
Autosomally inherited recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic ataxia <END> , macular <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal dystrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> and vertically oval temporally tilted discs .
Report of a Bedouin family--a new syndrome .
A Bedouin family is described with an unusual form of <START:PHENOTYPE> spinocerebellar degeneration <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spastic ataxia <END> was found to be associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , macular <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal dystrophy <END> and non-axial <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , in the absence of retardation of somatic or mental maturation .
Immunological abnormalities were common .
Genetic analysis revealed that the pedigree is expressing the transmission and segregation of a single mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> gene .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder with <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vertigo <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tinnitus <END> .
The authors report an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> that is clinically distinct from the other episodic ataxias .
Vestibular ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> vertigo <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tinnitus <END> , and interictal <START:PHENOTYPE> myokymia <END> are prominent ; attacks are diminished by acetazolamide .
Linkage analyses of markers flanking the EA1 and EA2 loci demonstrate genetic exclusion from the other <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> episodic ataxias .
The authors suggest EA3 for periodic vestibulocerebellar ataxia and EA4 for the disorder described here .
Transmission of the dysgnathia complex from mother to daughter .
We report the first observation of parent-to-child transmission of dysgnathia , a rare disorder characterized by severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular hypoplasia <END> or agenesis , ear anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> microstomia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microglossia <END> .
Patient 1 was noted prenatally by ultrasound to have severe <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> and , after birth , abnormal ears with canal stenosis and non-contiguous lobules located dorsally to the rest of the pinnae , normal zygomata , severe jaw immobility and <START:PHENOTYPE> microstomia <END> with an opening of only 4 to 5 mm , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic tongue <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
The 21-year-old mother of patient 1 was born with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> requiring tracheostomy , <START:PHENOTYPE> microglossia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> with filiform alveolar bands , abnormal pinnae , and decreased conductive hearing .
Dysgnathia is thought to result from a defect in the development of the first branchial arch .
A similar phenotype has been seen in Otx2 haplo-insufficiency and endothelin-1 homozygous null mice , suggesting that these genes contribute to branchial arch development .
Our report of a long-surviving mother and her daughter with non-syndromal dysgnathia may lead to identification of the molecular basis of these findings and provide insight into the genetics of first branchial arch formation .
The survival of patient 1 and patient 2 beyond the neonatal period has implications for improvements in prenatal diagnosis and counseling and for neonatal treatment of this condition .

Irish study on high-density <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> families : field methods and power to detect linkage .
Large samples of multiplex pedigrees will probably be needed to detect susceptibility loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> by linkage analysis .
Standardized ascertainment of such pedigrees from culturally and ethnically homogeneous populations may improve the probability of detection and replication of linkage .
The Irish Study of High-Density <START:PHENOTYPE> Schizophrenia <END> Families ( ISHDSF ) was formed from standardized ascertainment of multiplex <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> families in 39 psychiatric facilities covering over 90 % of the population in Ireland and Northern Ireland .
We here describe a phenotypic sample and a subset thereof , the linkage sample .
Individuals were included in the phenotypic sample if adequate diagnostic information , based on personal interview and/or hospital record , was available .
Only individuals with available DNA were included in the linkage sample .
Inclusion of a pedigree into the phenotypic sample required at least two first , second , or third degree relatives with non-affective psychosis ( NAP ) , one whom had <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ( S ) or poor-outcome schizo-affective disorder ( PO-SAD ) .
Entry into the linkage sample required DNA samples on at least two individuals with NAP , of whom at least one had S or PO-SAD .
Affection was defined by narrow , intermediate , and broad criteria .
The phenotypic sample contained 277 pedigrees and 1 ,77 0 individuals and the linkage sample 265 pedigrees and 1 ,408 individuals .
Using the intermediate definition of affection , the phenotypic sample contained 837 affected individuals and 526 affected sibling pairs .
Parallel figures for the linkage sample were 700 and 42 0.
Individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> from these multiplex pedigrees resembled epidemiologically sampled cases with respect to age at onset , gender distribution , and most clinical symptoms , although they were more thought-disordered and had a poorer outcome .
Power analyses based on the model of linkage heterogeneity indicated that the ISHDSF should be able to detect a major locus that influences susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> in as few as 20% of families .
Compared to first-degree relatives of epidemiologically sampled schizophrenic probands , first-degree relatives of schizophrenic members from the ISHDSF had a similar risk for schizotypal personality disorder , affective illness , alcoholism , and anxiety disorder .
With sufficient resources , large-scale ascertainment of multiplex <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> pedigrees is feasible , especially in countries with catchmented psychiatric care and stable populations .
Although somewhat more severely ill , schizophrenic members of such pedigrees appear to clinically resemble typical schizophrenic patients .
Our ascertainment process for multiplex <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> families did not select for excess familial risk for affective illness or alcoholism .
With its large sample ascertained in a standardized manner from a relatively homogeneous population , the ISHDSF provides considerable power to detect susceptibility loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple epiphyseal dysplasia <END> ( ribbing type ) with rhizomelic shortness , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> in two unrelated patients .
We report on two unrelated patients with an apparently new syndrome .
In each family they are the only affected members , their parents are not consanguineous , and paternal and maternal ages are not advanced .
At birth each patient was noted to have a marked Robin phenotype ( cleft of the secondary palate and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> ) plus rhizomelic shortness .
Delay in the appearance of long bone epiphyses was noted and followed by small fragmented and later very <START:PHENOTYPE> flat epiphyses <END> of all long bones .
The fibulae are short and radial heads dislocated .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Scoliosis <END> and marked <START:PHENOTYPE> genu valgum <END> developed in both .
Both patients have normal intelligence , vision , and hearing .
Both have mildly <START:PHENOTYPE> upward slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal tip <END> , and apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> .
Macrocephaly-Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita without <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis marmorata <END> ?
We report on two patients with clinical manifestations consistent with a diagnosis of macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita ( M-CMTC ) .
Both showed <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> high forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> , capillary hemangiomata involving philtrum , nose , and lips , and redundant skin .
In addition , the first had <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis marmorata <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> .
The second had postaxial <START:PHENOTYPE> polydactyly <END> of hands and feet , cutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> of third and fourth right fingers and of second and third right toes without evident <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis marmorata <END> .
A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed cerebral alterations in both patients .
The first had bilateral cortical dysplasia with frontal bilateral myelinization defect of corona radiata .
The second had mild intertonsillar widening , cavum septi pellucidi , small porencephalic areas in the anterolateral region of cellae , and subsequently developed a nonobstructive <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> .
Reviewing all reported cases we propose a new criterion for M-CMTC diagnosis .
Maternally inherited duplication of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome in a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> proximal tubulopathy <END> , diabetes mellitus , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
Two sisters in the first year of life presented with a <START:PHENOTYPE> proximal tubulopathy <END> of unknown etiology .
They subsequently developed a pluritissular disorder including diabetes mellitus , skin abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy with ragged-red fibers , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
Their mother had <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , ophthalmoplegia , and muscle weakness .
Analysis of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> respiratory chain showed a complex III deficiency in both skeletal muscle and lymphocytes of the second girl .
Southern blot analysis provided evidence for a heteroplasmic partial duplication of the mtDNA ( 26 kb ) , involving one full-length and one partly deleted <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome and with one single abnormal junction between the genes for ATPase 6 and cytochrome b . Using PCR amplification of lymphocyte DNA , we were able to detect minute amounts of duplicated molecules in the mother , which provided evidence for maternal inheritance of the partial duplication .
While maternal transmission of point mutations have been reported in Leber disease , retinitis pigmentosa , and MERRF disease , this observation is , to our knowledge , the first example of a maternally inherited duplication of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome in man .
New FKRP mutations causing <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and central nervous system abnormalities .
Identification of a founder mutation in Tunisian families .
The congenital muscular dystrophies ( CMD ) constitute a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> myopathies .
Patients show congenital hypotonia , muscle weakness , and dystrophic changes on muscle biopsy .
Mutations in four genes ( FKT1 , POMGnT1 , POMT1 , FKRP ) encoding putative glycosyltransferases have been identified in a subset of patients characterized by a deficient glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan on muscle biopsy .
FKRP mutations account for a broad spectrum of patients with muscular dystrophy , from a severe congenital form with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MDC1C ) to a much milder limb-girdle muscular dystrophy ( LGMD2I ) .
We identified two novel homozygous missense FKRP mutations , one , A455 D , in six unrelated Tunisian patients and the other , V405L , in an Algerian boy .
The patients , between the ages of 3 and 12 years , presented with a severe form of MDC1C with <START:PHENOTYPE> calf hypertrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> high serum creatine kinase <END> levels .
None had ever walked .
Two had cardiac dysfunction and one strabismus .
They all had <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar cysts <END> , and hypoplasia of the vermis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> White matter abnormalities <END> were found in five , mostly when cranial magnetic resonance imaging was performed at a young age .
These abnormalities were shown to regress in one patient , as has been observed in patients with Fukuyama CMD . Identification of a new microsatellite close to the FKRP gene allowed us to confirm the founder origin of the Tunisian mutation .
These results strongly suggest that particular FKRP mutations in the homozygous state induce structural and clinical neurological lesions in addition to muscular dystrophy.
They also relate MDC1C to other CMD with abnormal protein glycosylation and disordered brain function .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinal detachment <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , facial dysmorphism , generalized osteoporosis , immobile spine and <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> in a consanguinous kindred--a possible new syndrome .
We report on a consanguineous family with 6 children ( out of 7 ) affected by a spondylo-ocular syndrome .
Clinical features include <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , loss of vision due to <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> , facial dysmorphism , facial hypotonia , normal height with disproportional short trunk , immobile spine with thorakal <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphosis <END> and reduced lumbal lordosis .
On ophthalmological examination of the index patient , a dense <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and complete <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> could be detected on the right eye .
On the left eye , an absent lens nucleus was found , but no <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> .
On radiological examination , there was generalized moderate osteoporosis ; the spine showed marked <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> and the bone age was advanced .
On laboratory investigations , a normal excretion of amino acids , mucopolysaccharides and oligosaccharides could be found .
The phenotypical spectrum observed in the 6 affected individuals was rather uniform .
The karyotype was normal in all affected children .
This hitherto undescribed combination of oculo-skeletal symptoms shows most resemblance with connective tissue disorders , suggesting a range of candidate genes for mutation analysis .
Gerodermia osteodysplastica and wrinkly skin syndrome : are they the same ?
Gerodermia osteodysplastica ( GO ) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by premature aging , wrinkled , and lax skin with reduced elasticity which is more marked on the dorsum of the hands and feet associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperextensible joints <END> and osteoporosis .
The wrinkly skin syndrome ( WSS ) is characterized by wrinkled skin over the dorsum of the hands , feet , and abdomen ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperextensible joints <END> , particularly of the hands ; <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal failure to thrive <END> ; and mental and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
We report on five children from two consanguineous Arab families with features overlapping both GO and WSS .
All five children had similar dysmorphic facial features consisting of broad and <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> with epicanthal folds , prominent bulbous nose , flat malar region , and large protruding ears .
All had wrinkling of the skin more marked on the dorsum of the hands , feet , and abdomen ; hyperextensibility of the joints , particularly of the hands ; and aged appearance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Intrauterine growth retardation <END> , subsequent <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and variable degree of osteoporosis was also present in all of them .
The older three children developed progressive prognathism .
We suggest that GO and WSS could represent variable manifestation of the same disorder .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> : a clinical and genetic study .
A clinical and genetic study of 6 kindreds ( 13 patients ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> is presented .
Evidence is presented to indicate that two separate <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> genes are involved .
One of these causes clinical disease with onset in early childhood ( birth--8 years ) , which is relatively benign and in which proximal selectively of muscle involvement is not marked .
A separate <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> gene causes a disease with onset in adult life ( median age 37 years ) , showing marked initial proximal selectively ; this disease may be more rapid in its clinical progression .
Penetrance of both genes approaches 100% .
Incidence figures are presented ; less than 2% of all cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> childhood onset <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> , but 30% of adult onset cases , are due to an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> gene transmitted from an affected parent .
Implications for prognosis , diagnosis and genetic counselling are discussed .
A review of 11 kindreds of dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> in the literature is presented .
Loss-of-function mutations in the cathepsin C gene result in <START:PHENOTYPE> periodontal disease <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratosis <END> .
Papillon-LefÃ¨vre syndrome , or keratosis palmoplantaris with periodontopathia ( PLS , MIM 245000) , is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder that is mainly ascertained by dentists because of the <START:PHENOTYPE> severe periodontitis <END> that afflicts patients .
Both the deciduous and permanent dentitions are affected , resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> premature tooth loss <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Palmoplantar keratosis <END> , varying from mild psoriasiform scaly skin to overt hyperkeratosis , typically develops within the first three years of life .
Keratosis also affects other sites such as elbows and knees .
Most PLS patients display both <START:PHENOTYPE> periodontitis <END> and hyperkeratosis .
Some patients have only <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratosis <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> periodontitis <END> , and in rare individuals the <START:PHENOTYPE> periodontitis <END> is mild and of late onset .
The PLS locus has been mapped to chromosome 11q14-q21 ( refs 7 , 8 , 9 ) .
Using homozygosity mapping in eight small consanguineous families , we have narrowed the candidate region to a 1.2-cM interval between D11S4082 and D11 S931 .
The gene ( CTSC ) encoding the lysosomal protease cathepsin C ( or dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I ) lies within this interval .
We defined the genomic structure of CTSC and found mutations in all eight families .
In two of these families we used a functional assay to demonstrate an almost total loss of cathepsin C activity in PLS patients and reduced activity in obligate carriers .
Coexistence of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> and factor V Leiden--effect on thrombosis .
Venous and arterial <START:PHENOTYPE> thromboembolism <END> occurs in only about one third of patients homozygous for <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> , which suggests that other , contributory factors are necessary for the development of thrombosis in these patients .
Factor V Leiden , an R506Q mutation in the gene coding for factor V , is the most common cause of familial thrombosis and could be a potentiating factor .
We determined activated partial-thromboplastin times in the presence and absence of activated protein C and tested for the factor V Leiden mutation in 45 members of seven unrelated consanguineous kindreds in which at least 1 member was homozygous for <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> .
Thrombosis ( venous , arterial , or both ) occurred in 6 of 11 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> ( age , 0.2 to 8 years ) .
All six also had the factor V Leiden mutation .
One patient with prenatally diagnosed <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> who was also heterozygous for factor V Leiden has received warfarin therapy since birth and has not had thrombosis ( age , 18 months ) .
Of four patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> who did not have factor V Leiden , none had thrombosis ( ages at this writing , 1 to 17 years ) .
Three women who were heterozygous for both <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> and factor V Leiden had recurrent fetal loss and placental infarctions .
Patients with concurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> and factor V Leiden can have an increased risk of thrombosis .
Screening for factor V Leiden may be indicated in patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> and their family members .
Presumably Azorean disease in a presumably non-Portuguese family .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> motor system degeneration ( ADMSD ) is a hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> that has been reported previously only in Portuguese families from the Azores Islands . <START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebellar ataxia <END> , pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs , amyotrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , abnormal eye movements , and <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent eyes <END> are variably present .
Four members of a family had <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , dystonic posturing , a variety of abnormal eye movements , and <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent eyes <END> resulting from lid retraction .
Eight other family members had a similar disease .
The combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , abnormal eye movements , and <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent eyes <END> has been reported only in ADMSD .
The family reported here may be the first example of ADMSD in a non-Portuguese family .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Syringomyelia <END> in twin brothers discordant for <START:PHENOTYPE> Chiari I malformation <END> : case report .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> outside of trauma , tumor , or infection has been reported .
Cases are presented that highlight the possible connection between familial <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> and the Chiari 0 malformation .
We report on 11-year-old twin brothers both with <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> .
Magnetic resonance imaging further revealed that one brother had <START:PHENOTYPE> Chiari I malformation <END> and the other had Chiari 0 malformation .
Both underwent posterior fossa decompression with radiologic improvement of their syringes .
These case reports lend credence to earlier reports of improvement in <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> following posterior fossa decompression in the absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> Chiari I malformation <END> , the so-called Chiari 0 malformation .
In addition , these case reports should influence the manner in which familial <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> without tonsillar ectopia is defined and addressed , that is , posterior fossa decompression versus shunting of the syrinx , thereby addressing the potential cause of the <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> and not only the enlarged cavity itself .
A dominantly inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> spondylometaphyseal dysplasia <END> with " corner fractures " and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia <END> ( SMD ) is a term applied to a varied group of skeletal dysplasias that principally involve the spine and the metaphyses of long bones .
SMD Sutcliffe or " Corner Fracture " type is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , developmental <START:PHENOTYPE> coxa vara <END> , fragmented appearance of the metaphyses ( " corner fractures" ) , abnormally shaped vertebrae , <START:PHENOTYPE> odontoid hypoplasia <END> , and dominant inheritance .
We report a family with a dominantly inherited SMD with " corner fractures " and severe , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> but neither <START:PHENOTYPE> coxa vara <END> nor odontoid abnormalities .
This could either represent phenotypic variability in SMD- " Corner Fracture " type , or be a new , dominantly inherited SMD .
The presence of severe , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> is present in all members of this family , and not typically seen in SMD- " Corner Fracture " type , supporting our hypothesis that this might represent a new , dominantly inherited SMD .

Spectrum of brain changes in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> and FKRP gene mutations .
To report the spectrum of brain magnetic resonance imaging findings in 13 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> and FKRP gene mutations and to explore possible genotype-phenotype correlations .
We retrospectively reviewed brain magnetic resonance imaging in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> and FKRP gene mutations .
Thirteen patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> and mutations in the FKRP gene .
Five of the 13 patients had the typical phenotype originally described for <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> ( MDC1C ) with normal intelligence and normal brain magnetic resonance imaging while 3 other patients had isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar cysts <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> without any other sign of posterior fossa of supratentorial abnormalities .
In the remaining 5 patients <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar cysts <END> were associated with structural brain changes involving the posterior fossa and the cortex , ranging from focal unilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia to marked cerebellar dysplasia and pontine hypoplasia .
In 2 of these 5 patients the severity and distribution of changes resembled muscle-eye-brain disease in 1 patient who had mild Walker-Warburg syndrome .
The distribution of FKRP gene mutations identified in this group of patients did not reveal any obvious association with the severity of central nervous system involvement .
The severity of central nervous system involvement observed in our patients in contrast broadly reflected the severity of the disruption of alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation .
In particular , dystroglycan expression was almost absent in the patients with muscle-eye-brain diseaselike phenotype and less severely reduced in the patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> ( MDC1C ) with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar cysts <END> .
This study further highlights the central role that dystroglycan has in neuronal migration .
A novel EFNB1 mutation ( c.712delG ) in a family with craniofrontonasal syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> .
We report on the occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital diaphragmatic hernia <END> in a family with craniofrontonasal syndrome found to have a previously unreported mutation in EFNB1 .
The female proband presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid nasal tip <END> , widow 's peak , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , and a widened metopic suture .
Her father was noted to have <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , widow 's peak , and a history of pectus carinatum .
He was found to have a previously unreported mutation in exon 5 of EFNB1 predicted to cause premature protein truncation .
The parents of the proband previously had a female fetus with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital diaphragmatic hernia <END> .
The occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital diaphragmatic hernia <END> , phenotypic differences between males and females , and utility of molecular testing in craniofrontonasal syndrome are demonstrated .

Clericuzio-type <START:PHENOTYPE> poikiloderma <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> syndrome in three sibs with mutations in the C16orf57 gene : delineation of the phenotype .
We report on three sibs who have <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Clericuzio-type <START:PHENOTYPE> poikiloderma <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> ( PN ) syndrome .
Recently , this consanguineous family was reported and shown to be informative in identifying the C16orf57 gene as the causative gene for this syndrome .
Here we present the clinical data in detail .
PN is a distinct and recognizable entity belonging to the group of <START:PHENOTYPE> poikiloderma <END> syndromes among which Rothmund-Thomson is perhaps the best described and understood .
PN is characterized by cutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> poikiloderma <END> , hyperkeratotic nails , generalized hyperkeratosis on palms and soles , <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent pulmonary infections <END> .
In order to delineate the phenotype of this rare genodermatosis , the clinical presentation together with the molecular investigations in our patients are reported and compared to those from the literature .

Nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> in an African-American boy : a rare case illustrating gene-environment interaction .
We present an 8-year-old African-American boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> and nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome ( NBCCS ) who exhibited the radiosensitive response of <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> ( BCC ) formation in the area irradiated for <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> .
Such a response is well-documented in Caucasian NBCCS patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> .
The propositus was diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> at the age of 2 years and underwent surgery , chemotherapy , and craniospinal irradiation .
At the age of 6 years , he was diagnosed with NBCCS following his presentation with a large odontogenic keratocyst of the mandible , pits of the palms and soles and numerous BCCs in the area of the back and neck that had been irradiated previously for <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> .
Examination of other relatives showed that the propositus ' mother also had NBCCS but was more mildly affected ; in particular , she had no BCCs .
This case illustrates complex gene-environment interaction , in that increased skin pigmentation in African-Americans is presumably protective against ultraviolet , but not ionizing , radiation .
This case and other similar cases in the literature show the importance of considering NBCCS in the differential diagnosis of any patient who presents with a <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> , especially before the age of 5 years , and of examining other close relatives for signs of NBCCS to determine the patient 's at-risk status .
Finally , for individuals who are radiosensitive , protocols that utilize chemotherapy in lieu of radiotherapy should be considered .
FISH studies in 45 patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome : deletions associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic left heart <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> death in infancy <END> .
Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome ( RTS ) is a dominant Mendelian disorder characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , a typical facies , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad thumbs <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
Previous reports indicated that 4-25% of RTS patients have a submicroscopic 16p13.3 deletion of the CBP gene .
Using FISH and cosmid probes RT100 , RT191 and RT203 we studied 45 RTS patients from Germany , the Czech Republic , Austria and Turkey and found four deletions ( 8 .9% , pooled data including other studies : 11% ) .
All deletions were interstitial; three spanned the CBP gene ( RT100-RT2 03 ) and one was smaller ( RT10 0 only ) .
Previous studies reported no phenotype-genotype correlation between RTS patients with or without a deletion .
Our findings suggest a more severe phenotype .
The mean age at presentation was 0.96 years in patients with a deletion as against 11 .12 years in those without .
Patients A and B with a deletion died in infancy which is rare in RTS and was not observed among the other patients .
Patients A and D had <START:PHENOTYPE> accessory spleens <END> , Patient A with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic left heart <END> , abnormal pulmonary lobulation and renal agenesis .
This is the second report of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic left heart <END> and the first report of <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> with RTS .
The signs suggest a developmental field defect ( disturbance of laterality ) either as a newly recognised pattern of RTS , or alternatively a novel contiguous gene syndrome .
Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> : identification of the same <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> ND1 mutation in six pedigrees . Biochemical and molecular genetic evidence is presented that in six independent pedigrees the development of Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> ( LHON ) is due to the same primary mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> ND1 gene .
A LHON family from the Newcastle area of Great Britain was analyzed in depth to determine the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genetic etiology of their disease .
Biochemical assays of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> electron transport in organelles isolated from the platelet/white-blood-cell fraction have established that the members of this family have a substantial and specific lowering of flux through complex I ( NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase ) .
To determine the site of the primary <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> gene mutation in this pedigree , all seven <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> complex I genes were sequenced , in their entirety , from two family members .
The primary mutation was identified as a homoplasmic transition at nucleotide 3460 , which results in the substitution of threonine for alanine at position 52 of the ND1 protein .
This residue occurs within a very highly conserved hydrophilic loop , is invariantly alanine or glycine in all ND1 proteins , and is adjacent to an invariant aspartic acid residue .
This is only the second instance in which both a biochemical abnormality and a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> gene mutation have been identified in an LHON pedigree .
The sequence analysis of the ND81 gene was extended to a further 11 , unrelated LHON pedigrees that had been screened previously and found not to carry the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> ND4/R340H mutation .
The ND1/A52 T mutation at nucleotide 3460 was found in five of these 11 pedigrees .
In contrast , this sequence change was not found in any of the 47 non-LHON controls .
The possible role of secondary complex I mutations in the etiology of LHON is also addressed in these studies .
Two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> trichiasis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> entropion <END> and corneal scarring , sensorineural hearing loss , progressive thinning of scalp hair , mild learning difficulties and distinct facial features .
A new syndrome ?
Two brothers with very similar phenotypes involving <START:PHENOTYPE> trichiasis <END> ( misdirected lashes) , <START:PHENOTYPE> entropion <END> with corneal abrasions , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , progressive thinning of the scalp hair , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural hearing impairment <END> , mild learning difficulties , and inguinal hernias are described .
They have similar , distinctive facial features with <START:PHENOTYPE> deep-set eyes <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> .
Both brothers are carriers of a maternally inherited apparently balanced translocation of chromosomes 11 and 18 : 46 , XY , t(11 ;18 ) ( p13;q21)mat .
However , this is thought to be coincidental , since their younger brother also carries this translocation and is phenotypically normal .
Although they have many features that are found in the <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> syndromes , their combination of features is distinct and has to our knowledge not been previously reported .
Bilateral sensorineural deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> partial agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnoid cysts <END> in two sisters .
We describe two sisters ( ages 10 and 3 years , respectively ) with a normal development and a combination of congenital sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> partial agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnoid cyst <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> .
Neither girl has distinctive physical anomalies .
In the oldest girl , there was a hearing loss of 80 dB bilaterally , and the most severe loss on audiogram was seen at 2,000-4,000 Hz .
In the youngest girl , there was a hearing loss of 100 dB bilaterally .
Above 2,000 Hz no neural reactions were seen .
Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging in one girl and computed tomography in the other showed a <START:PHENOTYPE> partial agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> and a cyst in the pineal region , causing an aqueduct stenosis by compression and consequent <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> .
The parents have normal hearing , and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormalities .
They are nonconsanguineous but from the same small village .
This is the first report of a combination of congenital sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> partial agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , and an <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnoid cyst <END> .
The pattern of inheritance is probably <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> : a family containing a manifesting heterozygote , and an affected male married to a female with autosomal recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> .
A pedigree of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> is presented containing nine affected males and 10 heterozygous females .
One carrier female showed ocular changes similar to those of affected males .
She is considered to be a manifesting heterozygote , a situation explained by the Lyon hypothesis .
One affected male married a female with autosomal recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> and produced one daughter with the fundus changes of the carrier state of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> , and one son with normal eyes .
The daughter did not show any evidence of the additive effect of the two different genes for <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> and autosomal recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> .
Large , rare chromosomal deletions associated with severe early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> is a highly heritable and genetically heterogeneous disorder .
Here we investigated the contribution of copy number variation to <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in 300 Caucasian patients with severe early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , 143 of whom also had developmental delay . Large ( >50 0 kilobases) , rare ( <1% ) deletions were significantly enriched in patients compared to 7 ,366 controls ( P < 0.001 ) .
We identified several rare copy number variants that were recurrent in patients but absent or at much lower prevalence in controls .
We identified five patients with overlapping deletions on chromosome 16p11 .2 that were found in 2 out of 7 ,366 controls ( P < 5 x 10( -5) ) .
In three patients the deletion co-segregated with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .
Two patients harboured a larger de novo 16p11 .2 deletion , extending through a 593-kilobase region previously associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and mental retardation ; both of these patients had mild developmental delay in addition to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .
In an independent sample of 1, 062 patients with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> alone , the smaller 16p11 .2 deletion was found in an additional two patients .
All 16p11 .2 deletions encompass several genes but include SH2B1 , which is known to be involved in leptin and insulin signalling .
Deletion carriers exhibited hyperphagia and severe insulin resistance disproportionate for the degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .
We show that copy number variation contributes significantly to the genetic architecture of human <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .
New clinical findings in the Richieri-Costa/Pereira type of acrofacial dysostosis .
The Richieri-Costa/Pereira form of acrofacial dysostosis is an autosomal-recessive condition characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Pierre-Robin sequence <END> , preaxial and postaxial abnormalities in hands , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> talipes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft mandible <END> and malformations of the larynx .
We report female infant presenting with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , a hypoplasic clavicle , median mandible cleft , bilateral hand abnormalities and <START:PHENOTYPE> talipes <END> , laryngeal malformations , <START:PHENOTYPE> hip subluxation <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> acetabular dysplasia <END> and mesomelic shortening of limbs .
A few reported patients have clavicular hyploplasia but <START:PHENOTYPE> hip subluxation <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> acetabular dysplasia <END> and mesomelic shortening of limbs have not been described .
The original Lujan syndrome family has a novel missense mutation ( p.N1007S ) in the MED12 gene .
A novel missense mutation in the mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 12 ( MED12 ) gene has been found in the original family with Lujan syndrome and in a second family ( K9359 ) that was initially considered to have Opitz-Kaveggia ( FG ) syndrome .
A different missense mutation in the MED12 gene has been reported previously in the original family with FG syndrome and in five other families with compatible clinical findings .
Neither sequence alteration has been found in over 1400 control X chromosomes .
Lujan ( Lujan-Fryns ) syndrome is characterised by tall stature with asthenic habitus , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , a tall <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> maxillary hypoplasia <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high narrow palate <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> dental crowding <END> , a small or receding chin , long hands with hyperextensible digits , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypernasal speech <END> , hypotonia , mild-to-moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , behavioural aberrations and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum .
Although Lujan syndrome has not been previously considered to be in the differential diagnosis of FG syndrome , there are some overlapping clinical manifestations .
Specifically , these are dysgenesis of the corpus callosum , macrocephaly/relative <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , a tall forehead , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and behavioural disturbances .
Thus , it seems that these two X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndromes are allelic , with mutations in the MED12 gene .
Identification of tissue transglutaminase as the autoantigen of <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Celiac disease <END> is characterized by small intestinal damage with loss of absorptive villi and hyperplasia of the crypts , typically leading to malabsorption .
In addition to nutrient deficiencies , prolonged <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> is associated with an increased risk for malignancy , especially intestinal T- cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Celiac disease <END> is precipitated by ingestion of the protein gliadin , a component of wheat gluten , and usually resolves on its withdrawal .
Gliadin initiates mucosal damage which involves an immunological process in individuals with a genetic predisposition .
However , the mechanism responsible for the small intestinal damage characteristic of <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> is still under debate .
Small intestinal biopsy with the demonstration of a flat mucosa which is reversed on a gluten-free diet is considered the main approach for diagnosis of classical <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> .
In addition , IgA antibodies against gliadin and endomysium , a structure of the smooth muscle connective tissue , are valuable tools for the detection of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> and for therapy control .
Incidence rates of childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> range from 1:300 in Western Ireland to 1:470 0 in other European countries , and subclinical cases detected by serological screening revealed prevalences of 3.3 and 4 per 1000 in Italy and the USA , respectively .
IgA antibodies to endomysium are particularly specific indicators of <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> , suggesting that this structure contains one or more target autoantigens that play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease .
However , the identification of the endomysial autoantigen(s ) has remained elusive .
We identified tissue transglutaminase as the unknown endomysial autoantigen .
Interestingly , gliadin is a preferred substrate for this enzyme , giving rise to novel antigenic epitopes .
Hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy : clinical and pathologic variants in a family .
We describe a family showing dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy.
Three patients appeared through three successive generations and displayed a wide variety of clinical pictures .
The male proband with onset in childhood showed progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome .
The father experienced <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> starting in middle age ; the paternal grandmother had progressive symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> choreiform movements <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , but neither <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> nor <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in senescence .
Neuropathologic examination of two patients , the proband and the paternal grandmother , revealed combined degeneration of the dentatorubral and pallidoluysian systems and obvious degeneration involving the striatum in the proband and the cerebellar cortex in the grandmother .
The present study indicates that this disease can include many clinical and pathologic variants even in the same family .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spastic paraplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and neuropathy is linked to chromosome 11q13 .
We report an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> neurodegenerative disorder in 25 white members from a large inbred Brazilian family , 22 of whom were evaluated clinically .
This condition is characterized by (1 ) subnormal vision secondary to apparently nonprogressive congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ; (2 ) onset of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> in infancy ; (3 ) onset of progressive motor and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory axonal neuropathy <END> in late childhood/early adolescence ; (4 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> starting in the third decade of life ; (5 ) exacerbated acoustic startle response ; and (6 ) progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> and spine deformities .
Motor handicap was severe , and all patients were wheelchair bound after 15 years old .
We performed a genome-wide screen including 25 affected individuals and 49 of their unaffected relatives .
Linkage was detected at 11q13 region with a maximum logarithm of odds score of +14 .43 , obtained with marker D11 S1883 .
The candidate region , which lies between D11S1908 and D11 S1889 , encompasses approximately 4.8Mb and has more than 100 genes and expressed sequences .
We propose the acronym SPOAN ( <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and neuropathy ) for this complex syndrome .
Familial progressive renal tubulopathy.
We report herein data on 6 male patients with progressive tubulopathy.
These patients belonged to two families : the propositus , his father , a paternal first cousin , two paternal uncles , and a maternal uncle .
A 7-year-old proband had mild proteinuria ( 1 g/day ) , consisting of beta 2-microglobulin , alpha 1-microglobulin and lysozyme , and <START:PHENOTYPE> aminoaciduria <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Glycosuria <END> and acidosis were absent .
A 38-year-old father had mild proteinuria ( 2 g/day ) , including low-molecular-weight protein .
Hypokalemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> , phosphaturia , <START:PHENOTYPE> aminoaciduria <END> , and reduced urinary concentrating ability were also present .
The other 4 affected family members also had <START:PHENOTYPE> low-molecular-weight proteinuria <END> , detected by screening for beta 2-microglobulin .
In addition , there were several abnormalities ; <START:PHENOTYPE> aminoaciduria <END> in all 6 , phosphaturia in 4 of 6 , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> in all 6 and <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> in 2 of 6 patients .
Tubular dysfunction was more severe in the older subjects , hence , the disease seems to progress with age .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> low-molecular-weight proteinuria <END> is apparently a progressive disease linked to a X-linked or to an autosomal dominant inheritance .
A locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> posterior polar cataract <END> on chromosome 1p . <START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous lens disease .
Here we report the linkage of a locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> posterior polar cataract <END> ( CPP ) to the distal short arm of chromosome 1 . To map the CPP locus we performed molecular genetic linkage analysis using microsatellite markers in a three-generation pedigree .
After exclusion of 13 known loci and candidate lens genes for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cataract , we obtained significantly positive LOD scores for markers D1S508 ( Z = 3.14 , theta = 0 ) and D1S468 ( Z = 2.71 , theta = 0 ) . Multipoint analysis gave a maximum LOD score of 3.48 ( theta = 0.07 ) between markers D1S508 and D1S468 .
From haplotype data , however , CPP probably lies in the telomeric interval D1S2845-1pter , which includes the locus for the clinically distinct Volkman <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> ( CCV ) .
This study provides the first evidence for genetic heterogeneity of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> posterior polar cataract <END> for which a locus had been linked previously to chromosome 16q .
Familial amyotrophic <START:PHENOTYPE> chorea <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> .
New clinical and laboratory investigations .
A 46-year-old man , the son of normal nonconsanguinous parents , had a rare progressive neurological illness that began in midlife and was characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , buccolingual dyskinesia , orofacial <START:PHENOTYPE> tics <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> choreiform movements <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> , and neurogenic muscle atrophy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Acanthocytosis <END> was present .
The serum creatine kinase level was elevated and normobetalipoproteinemia was noted .
A brother had a similar disorder .
These clinical and laboratory characteristics are consistent with those of previously reported cases of neuroacanthocytosis , ie , familial amyotrophic <START:PHENOTYPE> chorea <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> ( FACWA ) .
Features not previously reported in cases of FACWA and noted in our index patient are as follows : an increased level of free sialic acid was detected in the serum ; haloperidol administered in high doses decreased the orofacial <START:PHENOTYPE> tics <END> ; absence of the McLeod blood group phenotype was noted ; and Hispanic-Puerto Rican ancestry was documented .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Acute lymphoblastic leukemia <END> in a child with the CHIME neuroectodermal dysplasia syndrome .
The " CHIME " syndrome ( MIM#280000 ) is a rare neuroectodermal disorder comprised of Colobomas of the eye , Heart defects , Ichthyosiform dermatosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> , and Ear defects .
We report on the sixth child with this syndrome and the first of these to develop <START:PHENOTYPE> acute lymphoblastic leukemia <END> at age 4 1/2 years .
Her major problems included a migratory ichthyosiform dermatosis , multiple skin infections and infestations , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal coloboma <END> , developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> macrosomia <END> , facial anomalies , a <START:PHENOTYPE> duplicated renal collecting system <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> .
Histologic examination of the skin demonstrated findings of an epidermal nevus with deep rete pegs , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> , and a markedly increased granular layer .
The cause of the CHIME syndrome is unknown , but the disorder is easily recognized because of the striking phenotype .
The diagnosis is important to make because of the potential for associated congenital heart disease , neurologic compromise , possible <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> , and possible association with malignancy .
Clinical characteristics of a chromosome 17-linked rapidly progressive familial <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> .
To describe symptoms , signs , neuroimaging results , and neuropathologic findings in patients from a family with chromosome 17q21-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> .
Multiple case report with genetic investigations .
The disease was observed in a Swedish family and documented in 3 generations .
Four siblings are described in this article .
A rapidly progressive dementia with genetic linkage to chromosome 17q21 was observed .
The mean age of onset was 51 years and the average duration of disease to death was 3 years .
Two patients started with speech disturbances leading to a progressive , nonfluent <START:PHENOTYPE> aphasia <END> , 1 patient had onset symptoms of leg <START:PHENOTYPE> apraxia <END> and akinesia and muscular rigidity , and in 1 patient reckless driving was the first symptom .
Loss of spontaneous speech developed later in all patients and emotional bluntness in 3 of the patients .
Cerebral perfusion was decreased in the frontal areas in all patients .
In the person with <START:PHENOTYPE> apraxia <END> as the onset symptom , the cerebral blood flow was also diminished in the left hemisphere , where a slight atrophy was detected on magnetic resonance imaging scans .
At the postmortem examination , slight <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> of the parietal lobes was observed in this patient .
In all patients there was a frontocentral degeneration of the cortex with discrete microvacuolation and <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> .
Clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , an early age of onset , a rapid disease progression , and variable onset symptoms were seen in these patients .
Two other clinically distinct diseases , dementia with pallido-ponto-nigral degeneration and a disinhibition-dementia-parkinsonism-amyotrophy complex , have recently been mapped to chromosome 17q21 .
In the family described in this article , genetic linkage was detected to the same region , suggesting the possibility that these diseases may originate from pathogenic mutations in the same gene .
Brain tumor-polyposis syndrome : two genetic diseases ?
This report presents a comprehensive and statistical analysis of the brain tumor-polyposis ( BTP ) cases referred to as Turcot 's syndrome in the literature .
BTP patients encompass a heterogeneous group that can be classified into two statistically distinct clinical entities based on phenotype of the polyps ( P = .0001 ) , presence of colorectal cancer ( P = .0001 ) , type of brain neoplasm , ie , <START:PHENOTYPE> glioma <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> ( P = .0001 ) , presence of skin lesions ( P = .0004 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> cafe-au-lait spots <END> ( P = .0008 ) , as well as consanguinity ( P = .0135 ) .
The first entity ( BTP syndrome type 1 ) consists of patients who have <START:PHENOTYPE> glioma <END> and colorectal adenomas without polyposis ( non-FAP cases) , and their siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> glioma <END> and/or colorectal adenomas .
For these patients , we show that the patient 's age at malignant <START:PHENOTYPE> glioma <END> occurrence is less than 20 years (5 0 to 80 years in the general population ) , which strongly supports the existence of an underlying genetic cause .
The neoplasms of these patients show DNA replication errors , which suggests a relationship with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC) , a disease characterized by germline alterations in DNA mismatch repair genes .
The second entity ( BTP syndrome type 2 ) consists of patients with a CNS tumor that occurs in a familial adenomatous polyposis kindred ( FAP cases ) .
These patients carry germline mutations in the APC gene , which suggests that mutations in this gene might predispose to brain tumors .
Risk analysis shows increased incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> in FAP patients , but APC mutations are not found in sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> glioma <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> .
Therefore , further investigations should establish whether the occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> in an FAP family represents a variant of FAP .
Phenotypic features of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> : case-control study .
To identify phenotypic features of <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> that can be used to reduce <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> and thereby increase power in linkage analysis .
Despite exciting discoveries in several rare pedigrees , the genetic basis of common <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> remains a mystery .
The major drawback of studying common febrile seizure disorder is etiologic and <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> .
A linkage sample must therefore be classified a priori on phenotypic criteria likely to reflect genetically homogeneous subgroups .
Eighty-three cases ( children with one or more febrile seizure plus first-degree family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> ) and 101 controls ( children with one or more febrile seizure but no first-degree family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> ) were compared for association of phenotypic features in an unmatched case-control design .
Odds ratios were calculated using univariate and multivariate methods .
Recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> was the only phenotypic feature significantly associated with first-degree family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> ( OR 2.1 , 95 % CI 1 .15 to 3.88 ) .
First-degree family history and later occurrence of afebrile seizures ( OR 3.47 , 95 % CI 0.94 to 12 .78 ) were independently associated with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> .
Complex features did not show familial aggregation .
The authors suggest recurrent and afebrile seizures as criteria on which to subgroup a linkage sample .
These subgroups will not be evident at the time of the initial febrile seizure .
Meticulous and prospective collection of phenotypic and family data are recommended .
A new locus on chromosome 12p13.3 for pseudohypoaldosteronism type II , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II ( PHA2 ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of volume-dependent low-renin <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> and hyperchloremic acidosis but also by a normal glomerular filtration rate .
These features , together with the correction of blood pressure and metabolic abnormalities by small doses of thiazide diuretics , suggest a primary renal tubular defect .
Two loci have previously been mapped at low resolution to chromosome 1q31-42 ( PHA2A) and 17p11-q21 ( PHA2B ) .
We have now analyzed a new , large French pedigree , in which 12 affected members over three generations confirmed the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Affected subjects had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> together with long-term <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> ( range 5.2-6.2 mmol/liter ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperchloremia <END> ( range : 100-109 mmol/liter ) , normal plasma creatinine ( range : 63-129 mmol/liter ) and low renin levels .
Genetic linkage was excluded for both PHA2A and PHA2B loci ( all LOD scores Z<-3.2 at recombination fraction [theta] 0) , as well as for the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter gene .
A genome-wide scan using 383 microsatellite markers showed a strong linkage with the chromosome 12p13 region ( maximum LOD score Z=6 .18 , straight theta=0 , at D12 S99 ) . Haplotype analysis using 10 additional polymorphic markers led to a minimum 13-cM interval flanked by D12S1652 and D12S336 , thus defining a new PHA2C locus .
Analysis of two obvious candidate genes ( SCNN1A and GNb3 ) located within the interval showed no deleterious mutation .
In conclusion , we hereby demonstrate further genetic heterogeneity of this Mendelian form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and identify a new PHA2C locus , the most compelling and precise linkage interval described to date .
Women with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome are at increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal , dominantly inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> caused by mutations in the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene TW IST1 .
This syndrome has hitherto not been associated with an increased risk of cancer .
However , recent studies , using a murine breast tumor model , have shown that Twist may act as a key regulator of metastasis and that the gene is overexpressed in subsets of sporadic human breast cancers .
Here , we report a novel association between the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
In 15 Swedish Saethre-Chotzen families , 15 of 29 (52% ) women carriers over the age of 25 had developed <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
At least four patients developed <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> before 40 years of age , and five between 40 and 50 years of age .
The observed cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> ( n = 15 ) are significantly higher than expected ( n = 0.89) , which gives a standardized incidence ratio ( SIR) of 16 .8 0 ( 95 % CI 1.54-32.06 ) .
Our finding of a high frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in women with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome identifies <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> as an important and previously unrecognized symptom characteristic of this syndrome .
The results strongly suggest that women carriers of this syndrome would benefit from genetic counseling and enrolment in surveillance programs including yearly mammography.
Our results also indicate that the TWIST1 gene may be a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> susceptibility gene .
Additional studies are , however , necessary to reveal the mechanism by which TWIST1 may predispose to early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in Saethre-Chotzen patients .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pancreatic hypoplasia <END> presenting with neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> in association with congenital heart defect and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic hypoplasia <END> is a rare cause of neonatal diabetes .
We report on a series of three patients with pancreatic agenesis and congenital heart defects .
All had abdominal scan evidence of pancreatic agenesis .
In addition , Patient 1 had a ventricular septal defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> patent ductus arteriosus <END> and pulmonary artery stenosis ; Patient 2 had a <START:PHENOTYPE> truncus arteriosus <END> and Patient 3 had <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> .
Two of the three patients have <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
All three patients were isolated cases within the family .
Investigations included sequencing of GCK , ABCC8 , IPF1 , NEUROD1 , PTF1A , HNF1B , INS , ISL1 , NGN3 , HHEX , G6PC2 , TCF7L2 , SOX4 , FOXP3 ( Patients 1 and 2) , GATA4 and KCNJ11 genes ( all three patients) , but no mutations were found .
Genetic investigation to exclude paternal UPD 6 , methylation aberrations and duplications of 6q24 was also negative in all three .
22q11 deletion was excluded in all three patients .
Array CGH in Patient (1 ) showed a approximately 250 kb , paternally inherited duplication of chromosome 12q [arr cgh 12q24.33 ( B35 : CHR12 :1318 08577 -1320576 49++ ) pat] , not found in the other two patients .
Permanent neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic hypoplasia <END> with congenital heart defects has been reported before and may represent a distinct condition .
We discuss this rare association and review previously reported literature .

OA1 mutations and deletions in <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> ( OA1 ) , Nettleship-Falls type , is characterized by decreased ocular pigmentation , foveal hypoplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> photodysphoria <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced visual acuity <END> .
Affected males usually demonstrate melanin macroglobules on skin biopsy .
We now report results of deletion and mutation screening of the full-length OA1 gene in 29 unrelated North American and Australian <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> ( OA ) probands , including five with additional , nonocular phenotypic abnormalities ( Schnur et al . 1994 ) .
We detected 13 intragenic gene deletions , including 3 of exon 1 , 2 of exon 2 , 2 of exon 4 , and 6 others , which span exons 2-8 .
Eight new missense mutations were identified , which cluster within exons 1 , 2 , 3 , and 6 in conserved and/or putative transmembrane domains of the protein .
There was also a splice acceptor-site mutation , a nonsense mutation , a single base deletion , and a previously reported 17- bp exon 1 deletion .
All patients with nonocular phenotypic abnormalities had detectable mutations .
In summary , 26 ( approximately 90% ) of 29 probands had detectable alterations of OA1 , thus confirming that OA1 is the major locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> OA .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> midline cleft syndrome resembling familial <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> .
We have detected a previously unrecognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome characterized by : <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ; craniofacial anomalies including cleft lip and anterior cleft palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> and antimongoloid slant ; skeletal anomalies , notably of the foot and spine ; and chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> .
Despite similarities to familial <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> , this disorder appears to be a distinct entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Incomplete penetrance <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> variable expressivity <END> accompany transmission of the abnormal allele through four generations of a large kindred .
Three of the four affected males survived past 20 years of age ; the fourth is an infant .
All three affected females died very early in infancy .
[Familial idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> vitamin E deficiency <END> associated with cerebellar atrophy] .
Sibling cases of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> vitamin E deficiency <END> accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , polyneuropathy and mental retardation were reported .
Case 1 was a 37-year-old male who developed progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> gait disturbance <END> , deformity of the feet and head <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> from childhood , after normal delivery and development of early childhood .
On physical examination , he had cataract , high arched palate and <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> .
Neurological examination revealed mental retardation ( WAI S 68 ) , scanning speech , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular atrophy <END> of the face and extremities with predominance in the lower limbs , absent Achilles tendon reflex , disturbance of superficial and deep sensation predominant in distal limbs , and marked gait <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> was both cerebellar and sensory in nature .
Laboratory data of the blood showed no significant abnormalities including blood glucose and vitamin B12 except a markedly low level of serum vitamin E .
The brain CT scan revealed severe cerebellar atrophy and marked dilatation of the cisterna magna and the subarachnoid space around the cerebellum .
Motor nerve conduction velocity in the leg was decreased .
Biopsy specimen from the quadriceps muscle showed neurogenic atrophy.
Sural nerve biopsy revealed decrease in large myelinated fibers with axonal degeneration and regeneration .
Oral administration of alpha-tocopherol acetate , 600 mg per day , diminished <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> significantly .
Based on lysosomal enzyme activity in leukocytes , clinical and laboratory examination , lipidosis or spinocerebellar degeneration was excluded .
Chronic lipid malabsorption or beta lipoprotein deficiency which can cause decrease in vitamin E absorption , was not recognized .
On oral loading with 2 g of alpha-tocopherol acetate , the decrease rate of serum vitamin E was normal .
Consequently the low vitamin E was considered to have resulted from selective impairment of vitamin E absorption .( ABSTR ACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
<START:PHENOTYPE> Acanthocytosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pallidal degeneration <END> : a report of three patients , including the second reported case with hypoprebetalipoproteinemia ( HARP syndrome ) .
We describe an example of a variant of Hallervorden-Spatz disease , characterized by hypoprebeta-lipoproteinemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pallidal degeneration <END> ( HARP syndrome ) , in an 18-year-old woman who presented with longstanding intellectual subnormality , night blindness , and a 2-year history of orobuccolingual <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> causing <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> .
Investigation showed <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> and hypoprebetalipoproteinemia , and electroretinograms were typical of tapetoretinal degeneration .
T2-weighted MRI showed decreased signal intensity in the pallidal nuclei with central hyperintensity , constituting the "eye-of-the-tiger " sign .
The patient 's sister and mother have a similar lipid disorder but no retinal or neurologic disease .
We also report two patients with clinical and radiologic features similar to those of the patient with HARP syndrome but who had normal lipid studies .
These various combinations of components of HARP syndrome may be caused by several distinct genetic diseases or may represent variable manifestations of a contiguous gene defect .
A filamin A splice mutation resulting in a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> facial dysmorphism <END> , periventricular nodular <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> , and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> reminiscent of cerebro-fronto-facial syndrome .
Mutations of the filamin A locus ( FLNA ) on Xq28 have been established in girls with periventricular nodular <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> and in patients with otopalatodigital and overlapping phenotypes , the pathogenesis of these phenotypes being thought to be quite distinct .
To date only six male cases of periventricular nodular <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> ( PVNH ) have been reported and these almost invariably associated with severe neurological signs .
We report a new phenotype of male PVNH , with relatively normal development , no <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> or other neurological abnormality , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> facial dysmorphism <END> and without a discernible skeletal phenotype .
This phenotype is associated with a splice site mutation in FLNA c.1923C>T , resulting in the generation of both normal and aberrant mRNA .
We postulate that the patient retains enough FLNA function to avoid the usual lethality associated with loss of function mutations in males and suggest that the severe <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> may be a clue to the molecular aetiology of other X linked conditions associated with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> .
An association between neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> primary hyperparathyroidism <END> and familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> in three kindreds .
Four cases of neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> primary hyperparathyroidism <END> occurred in three families ; familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> was present in each kindred .
The diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> was based on the following features ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> in many relatives ( eight to 16 per kindred ) , without other features of the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes ; recognition of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> before the age of 10 in one to three relatives ; hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> in all relatives tested ( five to 14 per kindred ) ; and abnormal serum calcium levels despite parathyroidectomy in all additional relatives ( one to five per kindred ) undergoing this operation .
The association of two uncommon syndromes ( neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> primary hyperparathyroidism <END> and familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> ) in these kindreds suggests that the two syndromes share a common genetic cause within each kindred .
Precocious familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> with reduced fractional urate clearance and normal purine enzymes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Gout <END> is primarily a disease of middle-aged males and is unusual in females and adolescent males .
We describe 21 young men and women ( mean age 28 years ) referred because of precocious <START:PHENOTYPE> onset <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperuricaemia <END> .
Fifteen patients had a family history , but known hereditary causes of primary or secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperuricaemia <END> were excluded .
A high proportion ( 14/21 ) also had reduced renal function , but there was no clear relationship between this and the <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperuricaemia <END> .
Only two patients were hypertensive .
A striking abnormality was that the uric acid clearance relative to creatinine [ FEur ] was subnormal ( mean 4.4 +/- 1.4 per cent ) in 15 /21 patients , including all seven females .
A dominantly inherited defect in renal tubular urate handling , leading to a reduced endogenous urate clearance , is the most likely explanation for the <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperuricaemia <END> in this group .
Only six patients , all male had a normal [ FEur ] ( mean 8.6 +/- 1. 0 per cent ) .
The results confirm that young men and women with gout-or <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperuricaemia <END> disproportionate to the renal dysfunction-should always be investigated , not only for purine defects , but also for abnormalities of renal urate handling .
Since the abnormality described here was found also in symptomless subjects , the families of such patients must also be studied .
Early identification is important since treatment may ameliorate the renal damage .
Although rare , the number of such patients seen in a single referral unit suggests that this type of renal tubular defect in urate handling is more common than suspected and may only come to attention through an isolated episode of precocious <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> , when renal function may already be impaired .
SPG11 mutations cause Kjellin syndrome , a hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> and central <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( ARHSP ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> ( TCC ) is genetically heterogenous and approximately 35 % of patients carry mutations in either of the SPG11 or SPG15 genes .
Disease onset is during the first three decades of life with <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> and mental impairment .
Peripheral neuropathy and amyotrophy may occur .
Kjellin syndrome is characterized by central <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> in addition to ARHSP-TC C and the disease is associated with mutations in the SPG15 gene .
We identified five patients in four unrelated kindreds with <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> and mental impairment .
Magnetic resonance imaging revealed TCC , atrophy elsewhere in the brain and increased T2 signal intensity in the periventricular white matter .
Probands from the four kindreds were screened for mutations in the SPG11 gene .
All patients were found homozygous or compound heterozygous for truncating SPG11 mutations of which four are reported for the first time .
Ophthalmological investigations revealed that the four index cases have central <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> consistent with Kjellin syndrome .
PET examinations with N-[11 C-methyl]-L-deuterodeprenyl ( DED ) and fluor-18 2-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) were performed in two patients with Kjellin syndrome .
We observed a reduced glucose uptake in the thalami , anterior cingulum , and sensorimotor cortex indicating neuronal loss , and an increased DED binding in the thalami and pons which suggests astrogliosis .
From our results we extend the SPG11 associated phenotype to comprise also Kjellin syndrome , previously found to be associated with mutations in the SPG15 gene .
We anticipate that degeneration of the central retina is a common and previously unrecognized feature in SPG11 related disease . (c ) 2009 Wiley-Liss , Inc .
Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoperistalsis <END> syndrome ( MMIHS) , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder : clinical reports and review of the literature .
We present 2 new patients with the megacystis-microcolon-intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoperistalsis <END> syndrome ( MMIHS) , review the literature , and discuss the prenatal diagnosis and treatment .
MMIHS , as reported in 43 cases , is usually lethal .
Most children die during the first year of life , and only 3 children survived their first year .
We report the 6th pair of sibs with the disease .
Overall , 17 patients reported have had sibs with MMIHS or the parents were consanguineous ; 4 times the parents were first , cousins , confirming that this is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder .
The present 2 children , whose parents also were first cousins , were of different sex .
They had typical MMIHS with <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal distension <END> due to pronounced <START:PHENOTYPE> megacystis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcolon <END> , and microileum , involving the distal part of the ileum , <START:PHENOTYPE> malrotation <END> of the gut , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal hypoperistalsis <END> .
Neither surgery nor medical treatment was successful and the children died at the age of 19 days and 2 1/2 months , respectively .
There is no cure for the disease .
However , a new protkinetic drug , Cisapride might be worth trying in these cases .
Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of MMIHS might be possible .
De novo LMNA mutations cause a new form of congenital muscular dystrophy.
To describe a new entity of congenital muscular dystrophies caused by de novo LMNA mutations .
Fifteen patients presenting with a <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> of onset in the first year of life were subjected to neurological and genetic evaluation .
Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed for all patients .
The 15 patients presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> in the first year of life , and all had de novo heterozygous LMNA mutations .
Three of them had severe early-onset disease , no motor development , and the rest experienced development of a "dropped head " syndrome phenotype .
Despite <START:PHENOTYPE> variable severity <END> , there was a consistent clinical pattern .
Patients typically presented with selective axial <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> and wasting of the cervicoaxial muscles .
Limb involvement was predominantly proximal in upper extremities and distal in lower extremities .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Talipes <END> feet and a <START:PHENOTYPE> rigid spine <END> with thoracic <START:PHENOTYPE> lordosis <END> developed early .
Proximal <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures <END> appeared later , most often in lower limbs , sparing the elbows .
Ten children required ventilatory support , three continuously through tracheotomy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cardiac arrhythmias <END> were observed in four of the oldest patients but were symptomatic only in one .
Creatine kinase levels were mild to moderately increased .
Muscle biopsies showed dystrophic changes in nine children and nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathic changes <END> in the remaining .
Markedly atrophic fibers were common , most often type 1 , and a few patients showed positive inflammatory markers .
The LMNA mutations identified appear to correlate with a relatively severe phenotype .
Our results further broaden the spectrum of laminopathies and define a new disease entity that we suggest is best classified as a congenital muscular dystrophy ( LMNA- related congenital muscular dystrophy , or L-CMD ) .
Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy.
New genetic considerations .
Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> ( LHON ) is a maternally inherited disease that causes bilateral central <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> , predominantly in young men .
Recently , this disorder has been associated with point mutations in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome .
The clinical characteristics of LHON are reviewed with special attention to recent advances in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genetics .
Literature from the mid-19th century to the present is reviewed .
Major review articles that include multiple large pedigrees in their analysis are featured .
Special emphasis is placed on the recent reports on <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA abnormalities associated with this disease .
The older literature is reviewed critically with an understanding that some of the patients included as examples of LHON may have had a different disease .
The more current references are assessed in regard to their inclusion of appropriate and complete <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA analysis .
Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> , a maternally inherited disease primarily of young men , results in bilateral , acute or subacute , central <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> and , ultimately , optic atrophy.
Point mutations in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genes encoding proteins essential to oxidative phosphorylation have been associated with this disorder .
Primary mutations include those found at positions 11778 , 3460 , and , possibly , 15257 and 14484 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> , nuclear , and environmental factors may modify phenotypic expression .
Genetic analysis has allowed for a broader view of what constitutes the clinical phenotype of LHON .
Mutations in the human RAX homeobox gene in a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Anophthalmia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> are among the most common ocular birth defects and a significant cause of congenital blindness .
The etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> is diverse , with multiple genetic mutations associated with each of these conditions , along with potential environmental causes .
Based on findings that mutations in the Rx/Rax homeobox genes in mice and fish lead to defects in retinal development and result in animal models of <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> , we screened 75 individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> for mutations in the human RAX gene .
We identified a single proband from this population who is a compound heterozygote for mutations in the RAX gene .
This individual carries a truncated allele ( Q147X ) and a missense mutation ( R192Q) , both within the DNA-binding homeodomain of the RAX protein , and we have characterized the biochemical properties of these mutations in vitro .
Parents and grandparents of the proband were found to be carriers without visible ocular defects , consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> pattern .
This is the first report of genetic mutations in the human RAX gene .
Alport syndrome .
A review of the ocular manifestations .
Alport syndrome has a prevalence of 1/5000 , and 85 % of patients have the X-linked form , where affected males develop renal failure and usually have a high-tone <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> by the age of 20.
The typical ocular associations are a dot-and-fleck retinopathy which occurs in about 85 % of affected adult males , <START:PHENOTYPE> anterior lenticonus <END> which occurs in about 25% , and the rare posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy.
The retinopathy and <START:PHENOTYPE> anterior lenticonus <END> are not usually demonstrated in childhood but worsen with time so that the retinal lesion is often present at the onset of renal failure , and the <START:PHENOTYPE> anterior lenticonus <END> , later .
The demonstration of a dot-and-fleck retinopathy in any individual with a family history of Alport syndrome or with <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal disease <END> is diagnostic of Alport syndrome .
The presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> anterior lenticonus <END> or posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy in any individual is highly suggestive of the diagnosis of Alport syndrome .
Additional ocular features described in X-linked Alport syndrome include other corneal dystrophies , microcornea , arcus , iris atrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , spontaneous lens rupture , spherophakia , posterior lenticonus , a poor macular reflex , fluorescein angiogram hyperfluorescence , electrooculogram and electroretinogram abnormalities , and retinal pigmentation .
All mutations demonstrated to date in X-linked Alport syndrome have affected the COL4A5 gene which encodes the alpha 5 chain of type IV collagen .
This protein is probably common to the basement membranes of the glomerulus , cochlea , retina , lens capsule , and cornea .
However , the alpha 3( IV) and 4( IV) as well as the alpha 5( IV) collagen chains are usually absent from the affected basement membranes , because the abnormal alpha 5( IV) molecule interferes with the stability of all three .
The loss of these collagen molecules from the affected basement membranes results in an abnormal ultrastructural appearance .
The ocular and other clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Alport syndrome are identical to those seen in X-linked disease , while retinopathy and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> are the only ocular abnormalities described in the rare autosomal dominant form of Alport syndrome .
There are no ocular associations of thin basement membrane disease which is a common disease that probably represents the heterozygous expression of X-linked or <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Alport syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria <END> : further clinical delineation .
It has recently been recognized that <START:PHENOTYPE> D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria <END> is a distinct neurometabolic disorder with a severe and a mild phenotype .
Whereas the clinical and neuroimaging findings of the severe phenotype were homogeneous among the patients , the findings in the mild phenotype were much more variable , leaving the clinical picture poorly defined .
We were able to collect the clinical , biochemical and neuroimaging data on an additional 8 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria <END> , 4 with the severe and 4 with the mild phenotype .
With the new information , it becomes clear that the mild phenotype shares the essential characteristics of the severe phenotype .
The most frequent findings , regardless of the clinical phenotype , are <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , hypotonia and <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> .
Additional findings , mainly occurring in the severe phenotype , are <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic vomiting <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> inspiratory stridor <END> and apnoeas .
The most consistent MRI finding is enlargement of the lateral ventricles , occipital more than frontal .
Regardless of the clinical phenotype , early MRI shows in addition <START:PHENOTYPE> subependymal cysts <END> and signs of delayed cerebral maturation .
Later MRI may reveal multifocal cerebral white-matter abnormalities .
Two patients had vascular abnormalities , but it is as yet unclear whether these are related to <START:PHENOTYPE> D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria <END> or are incidental findings .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , mental retardation , and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia--Lowry-Wood syndrome .
We describe a brother and a sister with a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , mental retardation , and multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> epiphyseal dysplasia <END> .
The parents were normal .
This appears to be the second example of the syndrome first described by Lowry and Wood [ 1975 ] in two boys who had <START:PHENOTYPE> epiphyseal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> ; one of these patients was mildly mentally retarded .
The Lowry-Wood syndrome probably is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
Studies of microcephalic primordial dwarfism II: the osteodysplastic type II of primordial dwarfism .
We describe three unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> ( IUGR ) and nearly identical bone changes .
In certain respects , they share similarities with the Seckel syndrome : small forehead , moderately <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , pronounced intrauterine and <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Differences from the Seckel syndrome include disproportionate shortness of forearms and legs in the first years of life , <START:PHENOTYPE> brachymesophalangy <END> , brachymetacarpy I , V-shaped flare of at least the distal femoral metaphyses , triangular shape of the distal femoral epiphyses , a high and <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow pelvis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proximal femoral epiphysiolysis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> coxa vara <END> .
Hormone studies in two cases demonstrated no gross disturbances , especially no deficit of hGH and somatomedin .
Two previously reported cases referred to as Seckel syndrome had nearly identical bone changes .
The cause of this " new " type of IUGR remains unclear .
Association between <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> with ocular misalignment and polyalanine length variation in PMX2B.
The increased incidence of minor physical anomalies ( MPAs ) in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> is the fundamental basis for the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> etiology .
Ocular misalignment , or strabismus , falls into the category of MPAs , but this phenotype has not been assessed in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
This study reveals that a subtype of strabismus , constant exotropia , displays marked association with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ( P= 0.00000000906 ) . To assess the genetic mechanisms , we examined the transcription factor genes ARIX ( recently identified as a causative gene for syndromic strabismus ) and its paralogue , PMX2B.
We identified frequent deletion/insertion polymorphisms in the 20-alanine homopolymer stretch of PMX2B , with a modest association between these functional polymorphisms and constant exotropia in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ( P= 0.029 ) .
The polymorphisms were also associated with overall <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ( P= 0.012 ) and more specifically with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> manifesting strabismus ( P= 0.004 ) .
These results suggest a possible interaction between PMX2B and other schizophrenia-precipitating factors , increasing the risk of the combined phenotypes .
This study also highlights the unique nature of the polyalanine length variations found in PMX2B.
In contrast with other transcription factor genes , the variations in PMX2B show a high prevalence , with deletions being more common than insertions .
Additionally , the polymorphisms are of ancient origin and stably transmitted , with mild phenotypic effects .
In summary , our study lends further support to the disruption of neurodevelopment in the etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , by demonstrating the association of a specific MPA , in this case , constant exotropia with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , along with molecular variations in a possible causative gene .
Action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome : characterization of a unique cerebro-renal disorder .
Action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome ( AMRF ) is a distinctive form of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> epilepsy associated with renal dysfunction .
The syndrome was not recognized prior to the advent of dialysis and renal transplantation because of its rapidly fatal course if <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> is untreated .
The first and only description of AMRF was in four French Canadian patients in three families ( Andermann et al. , 1986 ) .
We now describe 15 individuals with AMRF from five countries , including a follow-up of the four French Canadian patients , allowing a more complete characterization of this disease .
Our 15 patients with AMRF belong to nine different families .
Segregation analyses were compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
In addition , our findings show that AMRF can present with either renal or neurological features .
Tremor ( onset 17-26 years , mean 19.8 years , median 19 years ) and progressively disabling action <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> ( onset 14-29 years , mean 21.7 years , median 21 years ) , with <START:PHENOTYPE> infrequent generalized seizures <END> ( onset 20-28 years , mean 22.7 years , median 22 years ) and cerebellar features are characteristic .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Proteinuria <END> , detected between ages 9 and 30 years in all cases , progressed to <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> in 12 out of 15 patients within 0-8 years after <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> detection .
Brain autopsy in two patients revealed extraneuronal pigment accumulation .
Renal biopsies showed collapsing glomerulopathy , a severe variant of <START:PHENOTYPE> focal glomerulosclerosis <END> .
This study extends the AMRF phenotype , and demonstrates a more extensive ethnic and geographic distribution of a syndrome originally believed to be confined to individuals of French Canadian ancestry .
The independent progression of neurological and renal disorders in AMRF suggests a unitary molecular lesion with pleiotropic effects .
Our results demonstrate that the renal lesion in AMRF is a recessive form of collapsing glomerulopathy.
Genes identified for <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> and involved with the function of the glomerular basement membrane and related proteins are thus good candidates .
Treatment can improve quality of life and extend the lifespan of these patients .
Dialysis and renal transplantation are effective for the renal but not the neurological features , which continue to progress even in the presence of normalized renal function ; the latter can be managed with anti-myoclonic and anti-epileptic drugs .
MYO1E mutations and childhood familial <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> is a kidney disease that is manifested as the <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
It is often resistant to glucocorticoid therapy and progresses to end-stage renal disease in 50 to 70 % of patients .
Genetic studies have shown that familial <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> is a disease of the podocytes , which are major components of the glomerular filtration barrier .
However , the molecular cause in over half the cases of primary <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> is unknown , and effective treatments have been elusive .
We performed whole-genome linkage analysis followed by high-throughput sequencing of the positive-linkage area in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> ( index family ) and sequenced a newly discovered gene in 52 unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> .
Immunohistochemical studies were performed on human kidney-biopsy specimens and cultured podocytes .
Expression studies in vitro were performed to characterize the functional consequences of the mutations identified .
We identified two mutations ( A159 P and Y695X ) in MYO1E , which encodes a nonmuscle class I myosin , myosin 1E ( Myo1E ) .
The mutations in MYO1E segregated with <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> in two independent pedigrees ( the index family and Family 2 ) . Patients were homozygous for the mutations and did not have a response to glucocorticoid therapy .
Electron microscopy showed thickening and disorganization of the glomerular basement membrane .
Normal expression of Myo1E was documented in control human kidney-biopsy specimens in vivo and in glomerular podocytes in vitro .
Transfection studies revealed abnormal subcellular localization and function of the A159 P-Myo1 E mutant .
The Y695X mutation causes loss of calmodulin binding and of the tail domains of Myo1E .
MYO1E mutations are associated with childhood-onset , glucocorticoid-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> .
Our data provide evidence of a role of Myo1E in podocyte function and the consequent integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier .
A nonsense mutation ( W9X ) in CRYAA causes <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> in an inbred Jewish Persian family .
To identify the genetic defect causing <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> in two inbred families .
Linkage analysis was performed with polymorphic markers close to 14 loci previously shown to be involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> .
In one of the families a gene segregating with the disease was analyzed by single-strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) and eventually sequenced .
Three polymorphic markers close to the CRYAA gene located on chromosome 21q segregated with the disease phenotype in one of the families , but not in the other .
Sequencing of the CRYAA in this Jewish Persian family revealed a G-to-A substitution , resulting in the formation of a premature stop codon ( W9X ) .
A nonsense mutation in the CRYAA gene causes <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> in one family .
This constitutes the first description of the molecular defect underlying nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> .
That there was no linkage to this locus in another family provides evidence for genetic heterogeneity .
Clinical and molecular cytogenetic characterisation of a newly recognised microdeletion syndrome involving 2p15 -16 .1 .
During whole genome microarray-based comparative genomic hybridisation ( array CGH ) screening of subjects with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , we identified two unrelated individuals with a similar de novo interstitial microdeletion at 2p15-2p16 .1 .
Both individuals share a similar clinical phenotype including moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , autism/autistic features , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , structural brain anomalies including cortical dysplasia/pachygyria , renal anomalies ( multicystic kidney , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> ) , digital <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> visual impairment <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , neuromotor deficits , communication and attention impairments , and a distinctive pattern of craniofacial features .
Dysmorphic craniofacial features include progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , flat occiput , widened inner canthal distance , small palpebral fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , long and straight eyelashes , broad and high nasal root extending to a widened , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent nasal tip <END> with elongated , smooth philtrum , rounding of the upper vermillion border and everted lower lips .
Clinical assessments , and cytogenetic , array CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridisation ( FISH ) analyses were performed .
The microdeletions discovered in each individual measured 4.5 Mb and 5.7 Mb , spanning the chromosome 2p region from 57 . 2 to 61 .7 Mb and from 56 to 61 .7 Mb , respectively .
Each deleted clone in this range demonstrated a dosage reduction from two to one copy in each proband except for clone RP11-79K21 , which was present in three copies in each proband and in four copies in their respective parents ( two per each chromosome 2 homologue ) .
The common constellation of features found in the two affected subjects indicates that they have a newly recognised microdeletion syndrome involving haploinsufficiency of one or more genes deleted within at least a 4.5- Mb segment of the 2p15 -16 .1 region .
Blepharophimosis-mental retardation ( BMR ) syndromes : A proposed clinical classification of the so-called Ohdo syndrome , and delineation of two new BMR syndromes , one X-linked and one <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
We report on 11 patients from 8 families with a <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome ( BMRS ) phenotype .
Using current nosology , five sporadic patients have Ohdo syndrome , associated with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> in two of them ( thus also compatible with a diagnosis of Young-Simpson syndrome ) .
In two affected sibs with milder phenotype , compensated <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> was demonstrated .
In another family , an affected boy was born to the unaffected sister of a previously reported patient .
Finally , in the last sibship , two affected boys in addition had severe microcephaly and neurological anomalies .
A definitive clinical and etiologic classification of BMRS is lacking , but closer phenotypic analysis should lead to a more useful appraisal of the BMRS phenotype .
We suggest discontinuing the systematic use of the term " Ohdo syndrome " when referring to patients with BMRS .
We propose a classification of BMRS into five groups : (1 ) del( 3p ) syndrome , ( possibly overlooked in older reports ) ; (2 ) BMRS , Ohdo type , limited to the original patients of Ohdo ; (3 ) BMRS SBBYS ( Say-Barber/Biesecker/Young-Simpson ) type , with distinctive dysmorphic features and inconstant anomalies including heart defect , optic atrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , hypoplastic teeth , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , joint limitations , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> .
BMRS type SBBYS is probably an etiologically heterogeneous phenotype , as AD and apparently AR forms exist ; (4 ) BMRS , MKB ( Maat-Kievit-Brunner ) type , with coarse , triangular face , which is probably sex-linked ; (5 ) BMRS V ( Verloes ) type , a probable new type with severe microcephaly , hypsarrhythmia , adducted thumbs , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and abnormal genitalia , which is likely <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
Types MKB and V are newly described here .

Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> protein S deficiency <END> in young adults with arterial occlusive disease .
Protein S is the vitamin K dependent cofactor of activated protein C . It has an important role in the regulation of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> protein S deficiency <END> is associated with familial venous thrombophilia .
Since a few patients with arterial occlusions have been reported to be protein S deficient , it is speculated that hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> protein S deficiency <END> may be also a risk factor for the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> arterial thrombosis <END> .
In a group of 37 consecutive patients with arterial occlusive disease presenting before the age of 45 , three patients were found heterozygous for hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> protein S deficiency <END> . None of the patients had a protein C deficiency or an antithrombin III deficiency .
Family investigations showed a clear association between the hereditary deficiency and venous thrombosis , but a relation between the deficiency and <START:PHENOTYPE> arterial thrombosis <END> was less obvious .
A review of previous literature on patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> arterial thrombosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> protein S deficiency <END> revealed that more extensive studies are needed to demonstrate whether or not hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> protein S deficiency <END> is a risk factor for the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> arterial thrombosis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> diffuse Lewy body disease .
We describe a Japanese family with <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and later-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
The proband developed <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> at the age of 61 years , followed by <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> starting when she was 67 .
Her uncle , who was also her husband , died at the age of 78 years after 7- and 5-year histories of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , respectively .
Pathological examination of these two patients showed marked neuronal loss with Lewy bodies ( LBs ) in the brain stem pigmented nuclei and numerous cortical LBs and ubiquitin-positive hippocampal CA2/3 neurites were observed .
The proband also had many amyloid plaques .
Their two sons developed similar <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> at the ages of 39 and 28 years and also suffered later-on-set <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
The apolipoprotein E genotype of the proband , her uncle and one of their sons was epsilon3/4 and that of the other son was epsilon4/4 .
These findings strongly suggest that this family has <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> diffuse LB disease .
Clinical genetics of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> keloids <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Keloids <END> are proliferative fibrous growths that result from an excessive tissue response to skin trauma .
Most <START:PHENOTYPE> keloids <END> occur sporadically , but some cases are familial .
However , the genetics of keloid formation have only rarely been documented , and the mode of inheritance is not known .
To elucidate the clinical genetic characteristics of keloid wound-healing disorder .
We studied the clinical and genetic characteristics of 14 pedigrees with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> keloids <END> .
The ethnicity of these families is mostly African American ( n = 10 ) , but also white ( n = 1 ) , Japanese ( n = 2) , and African Caribbean ( n = 1 ) .
The pedigrees account for 341 family members , of whom 96 displayed <START:PHENOTYPE> keloids <END> .
Of the affected family members , 36 are male and 60 are female .
The age of onset varies from early childhood to late adulthood .
There is variable expression of <START:PHENOTYPE> keloids <END> within the same families : some affected members have only minor earlobe <START:PHENOTYPE> keloids <END> , whereas others have very severe <START:PHENOTYPE> keloids <END> affecting large areas of the body .
In the described pedigrees , 7 individuals are obligate unaffected carriers , revealing nonpenetrance in about 6.8 % of keloid gene carriers .
Syndromes associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> keloids <END> , namely Rubinstein-Taybi and Goeminne syndrome , were not found in these families .
Additionally , linkage to the gene loci of these syndromes and X-chromosomal linkage were excluded .
The pattern of inheritance observed in these families is consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode with incomplete clinical penetrance and variable expression .
This is the most comprehensive collection of keloid families described to date , and it allows for the first time the elucidation of the clinical genetic characteristics of the familial form of this wound-healing disorder .
Familial aggregation and heritability of <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pyloric stenosis <END> is the most common condition requiring surgery in the first months of life .
Case reports have suggested familial aggregation , but to what extent this is caused by common environment or inheritance is unknown .
To investigate familial aggregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> from monozygotic twins to fourth-generation relatives according to sex and maternal and paternal contributions and to estimate disease heritability .
Population-based cohort study of 1 ,999 ,738 children born in Denmark between 1977 and 2008 and followed up for the first year of life , during which 3362 children had surgery for <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> .
Familial aggregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> , evaluated by rate ratios .
The incidence rate ( per 1000 person-years ) of <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> in the first year of life was 1.8 for singletons and 3.1 for twins .
The rate ratios of <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> were 182 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI] , 70 .7-467 ) for monozygotic twins , 29.4 ( 95 % CI , 9.45 -91 .5 ) for dizygotic twins , 18 .5 ( 95 % CI , 13.7-25.1 ) for siblings , 4.99 ( 95 % CI , 2.59-9.65 ) for half-siblings , 3.06 ( 95 % CI , 2.10-4.44 ) for cousins , and 1.6 0 ( 95 % CI , 0.51-4.99 ) for half-cousins .
We found no difference in rate ratios for maternal and paternal relatives of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> and no difference according to sex of cohort member or sex of relative .
The heritability of <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> was 87% .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pyloric stenosis <END> in Danish children shows strong familial aggregation and heritability .
Genotype-phenotype studies in nail-patella syndrome show that LMX1B mutation location is involved in the risk of developing nephropathy.
Nail-patella syndrome ( NPS ) is characterized by developmental defects of dorsal limb structures , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and is caused by heterozygous mutations in the LIM homeodomain transcription factor LMX1B .
In order to identify possible genotype-phenotype correlations , we performed LMX1B mutation analysis and comprehensive investigations of limb , renal , ocular , and audiological characteristics in 106 subjects from 32 NPS families .
Remarkable phenotypic variability at the individual , intrafamilial , and interfamilial level was observed for different NPS manifestations .
Quantitative urinanalysis revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> in 21.3% of individuals .
Microalbuminuria was detected in 21.7% of subjects without overt <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> .
Interestingly , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> appeared significantly more frequent in females .
A significant association was established between the presence of clinically relevant renal involvement in an NPS patient and a positive family history of nephropathy.
We identified normal-tension <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> ( NTG ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural hearing impairment <END> as new symptoms associated with NPS .
Sequencing of LMX1B revealed 18 different mutations , including six novel variants , in 28 families .
Individuals with an LMX1B mutation located in the homeodomain showed significantly more frequent and higher values of <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> compared to subjects carrying mutations in the LIM domains .
No clear genotype-phenotype association was apparent for extrarenal manifestations .
This is the first study indicating that family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> and mutation location might be important in precipitating individual risks for developing NPS renal disease .
We suggest that the NPS phenotype is broader than previously described and that NTG and <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> are part of NPS .
Further studies on modifier factors are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying phenotypic heterogeneity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> epidermolysis bullosa simplex .
Generalized phenotypic features suggestive of junctional or dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa , and association with neuromuscular diseases .
With few exceptions , epidermolysis bullosa ( EB ) simplex is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by rather localized and recurrent nonscarring blister formation ; mucous membranes and other organs are usually uninvolved .
Recently , two patients were described with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> of EB simplex associated with muscular dystrophy.
We now describe four additional patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> EB simplex , three of whom had associated <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> or congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis .
These patients had generalized cutaneous findings , including <START:PHENOTYPE> milia <END> , atrophic scarring , <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dystrophy <END> , and scalp <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , which have been classically attributed to either junctional or dystrophic EB . Each patient had significant oral cavity involvement , and in two , marked growth retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> were also present .
Our findings suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> EB simplex may be characterized by rather severe cutaneous and extracutaneous disease activity , and may be associated with at least two distinct neuromuscular diseases .
Angelman syndrome : correlations between <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> phenotypes and genotypes .
We compared <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> phenotypes with genotypes of Angelman syndrome ( AS ) , including chromosome 15q11 -13 deletions ( class I) , uniparental disomy ( class II) , methylation imprinting abnormalities ( class III) , and mutation in the UBE3A gene ( class IV ) . Twenty patients were prospectively selected based on clinical cytogenetic and molecular diagnosis of AS . All patients had 6 to 72 hours of closed-circuit television videotaping and digitized electroencephalogrpahic ( EEG ) telemetry .
Patients from all genotypic classes had characteristic EEGs with diffuse bifrontally dominant high-amplitude 1- to 3-Hz notched or triphasic or polyphasic slow waves , or slow and sharp waves .
Class I patients had severe intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , most frequently with atypical absences and myoclonias and less frequently with generalized extensor tonic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> or flexor spasms .
Epileptic spasms were recorded in AS patients as old as 41 years .
Aged-matched class II , III , and IV patients had either no <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> or drug-responsive mild <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with relatively infrequent atypical absences , myoclonias , or atonic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
In conclusion , maternally inherited chromosome 15q11 -13 deletions produce severe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Loss-of-function UBE3A mutations , uniparental disomy , or methylation imprint abnormalities in AS are associated with relatively mild <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Involvement of other genes in the chromosome 15q11 -13 deletion , such as GABRB3 , may explain severe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in AS .
Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> ( HMSNCA ) : a new disease .
Seven patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> ( HMSNCA ) are presented .
This is the first comprehensive evaluation of what is a unique disorder , half way between the cerebellar atrophies and the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies .
In addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> and peripheral neuropathy , the most frequent features in HMSNCA were nystagmus , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental impairment <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> .
Pyramidal signs or autonomic nerve dysfunction was never revealed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Scoliosis <END> or kyphoscoliosis was not noted .
Progression of the disorder was very slow , most of the patients being ambulatory more than 10 years after the onset .
Most of the patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> .
Half-life periods of serum albumin were normal and decreased synthesis of albumin in the liver was suspected .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> was strongly suggested , because of healthy consanguineous parents and affected siblings in these families .
The segregation ratio was 0.32 +/- 0.1 0 and was close to the expected ratio of 0.25 in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital hypoparathyroidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> , extreme growth failure with developmental delay and dysmorphic features--another case of this new syndrome .
A 4-year-old Saudi female child with extreme failure to thrive , striking dysmorphic features , developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypoparathyroidism <END> , UTI , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , chronic otitis media , chronic non-specific gastroenteritis and repeated life-threatening infections was followed from birth .
She was the product of first-cousin consanguineous marriage .
She had striking facies with frontal prominence , <START:PHENOTYPE> deep-set eyes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , beaked nose , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> with thin upper lip , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , large floppy ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid uvula <END> , and growth retardation with SD score less than -2 for height , weight and head circumference .
We believe these features which include <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypoparathyroidism <END> , severe growth failure and developmental delay in the absence of chromosomal abnormality represent a newly described genetically determined syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperphosphatasia <END> with neurologic deficit : a pyridoxine-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> disorder ?
This report describes the case of a 4 1/2-year-old female with developmental delay and tonic-clonic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , persistently elevated serum alkaline phosphatase activity , and low serum pyridoxal 5 ' -phosphate .
Born at term to consanguineous parents , she was dysmorphic and delayed at 5 months .
At 11 months , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and microcephaly were evident but skeletal and cerebral imaging , karyotyping , and genetic metabolic tests were unremarkable .
Serum alkaline phosphatase activity , however , was elevated ( 1.3 +/- 0.6 times greater than the upper limit of normal ) on seven occasions between 5 months and 4( 1/2 ) years of age .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperphosphatasia <END> with neurologic deficit ( MIM #239300) , a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder , was diagnosed .
The low serum levels of pyridoxal 5 ' -phosphate ( 6 nmol/L ; normal >2 0 nmol/L ) prompted a pyridoxine challenge .
A clinically significant but paradoxical response was observed .
On electroencephalography , diffuse delta slow waves ( 1-2 Hz ) were observed , suggestive of stage 3 or 4 slow-wave sleep .
With daily administration of 100 mg pyridoxine and withdrawal of phenobarbital , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were not evident .
We suggest that serum alkaline phosphatase should be measured in cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> with paradoxical electroencephalographic response to pyridoxine .
Conversely , pyridoxine challenge should be considered in cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphosphatasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and neurologic deficit .
Confirmation of RAX gene involvement in human <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microphthalmia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> are at the severe end of the spectrum of abnormalities in ocular development .
Mutations in several genes have been involved in syndromic and non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> .
Previously , RAX recessive mutations were implicated in a single patient with right <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> , left <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> .
In this study , we report the findings of novel compound heterozygous RAX mutations in a child with bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> .
Both mutations are located in exon 3 . c.664delT is a frameshifting deletion predicted to introduce a premature stop codon ( p.Ser222ArgfsX62 ) , and c.909C> G is a nonsense mutation with similar consequences ( p.Tyr303X ) .
This is the second report of a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> caused by RAX mutations .
These findings confirm that RAX plays a major role in the early stages of eye development and is involved in human <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Neuroblastoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal cell carcinoma <END> .
Occurrence in a single patient .
A 26-year-old woman had a <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> during infancy ; an extra-adrenal <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> at age 16 years , with hepatic recurrences during the next ten years ; and multifocal <START:PHENOTYPE> renal cell carcinoma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Neuroblastoma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> , despite their common embryologic origin , to our knowledge have not been previously reported as separate tumors in the same patient .
Although many attributes of the patient 's tumors suggest a hereditary disorder , thorough investigation disclosed no evidence of heritable conditions associated with any of these tumors in the patient or her family members .
Long-term observation of persons surviving after treatment of <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> will be necessary to determine whether this case represents a previously unidentified tumor predisposition or a <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> occurrence .
A rare type of low birthweight dwarfism : the Dubowitz syndrome .
Two patients with the Dubowitz syndrome are presented .
This presumably recessive inherited syndrome was first defined by Grosse et al . ( 1971 ) .
So far 11 patients with this syndrome have been described .
Major clinical findings are intrauterine and <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> , considerable <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> , hyperextensibility of joints , <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> and a characteristic appearance of the face due to marked <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , broadening of the bridge and tip of the nose and retrognathia .
Minor anomalies as clinodactylyl of the firth digits , cutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly of toes <END> , foot deformity , <START:PHENOTYPE> sacral dimple <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> may be seen .
The exclusion of the non genetic fetal alcohol syndrome presents serious diagnostic problems .
Phenotypic spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> neurodegeneration <END> associated with mutations in the PLA2G6 gene ( PLAN ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Neurodegeneration <END> associated with brain iron accumulation ( NBIA) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders in which disruption of cellular mechanisms leads to accumulation of iron in the basal ganglia .
This group includes patients with recently discovered mutations in the PLA2G6 gene encoding a calcium-independent phospholipase A2 enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycerophospholipids .
Previously , children with PLA2G6 mutations have been diagnosed with several different disorders and we wished to better define the phenotype of PLA2G6- associated <START:PHENOTYPE> neurodegeneration <END> .
Detailed review of the clinical and genetic features of 14 and radiologic features of 13 of these patients with PLA2G6 mutations was undertaken .
Median age of symptom presentation was 14 months .
One third of the cohort presented following an intercurrent illness .
The children had progressive cognitive and motor skill regression , with evidence of axial hypotonia , four limb <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , bulbar dysfunction , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> .
All patients developed <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
Most patients had optic atrophy.
Brain imaging demonstrated cerebellar cortical atrophy and <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> in all patients .
Changes consistent with increased iron deposition were identified in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra .
Novel corpus callosum changes are also reported .
We describe a cohort of patients with PLA2G6-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> neurodegeneration <END> ( PLAN ) .
Although patients with PLAN have previously been diagnosed with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> neurodegeneration <END> associated with brain iron accumulation , and Karak syndrome , they display a characteristic clinical and radiologic phenotype .
PLA2G6 mutational analysis will negate the need for more invasive diagnostic procedures such as tissue biopsy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Osteosarcoma <END> following <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> : age at onset and latency period .
In order to assess the role of genetic predisposition in the induction of radiation-induced tumors , we performed statistical analysis on data from the literature and from our own Institute with regard to the age at onset and the latency period of <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> as the second primary tumor for <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> with or without subsequent radiotherapy .
In <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> survivors who subsequently developed <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> , the age at onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> was young ( average of 12 months ) in both unilateral and bilateral forms .
This suggests that all or almost all of the patients were genetically predisposed by a mutation of one allele of the RB1 gene .
For <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> patients , osteosarcomas occurred 1.2 years earlier inside than outside the radiation field .
The latency period between radiotherapy and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> onset was 1.3 years shorter inside than outside the radiation field .
Interestingly , a bimodal distribution of latency periods was observed for osteosarcomas arising inside , but not outside the radiation field : 40% occurred after a short latency , while the latency of the remaining 60 % was comparable to that of <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> occurring outside the radiation field .
This suggests that different mechanisms may be involved in radiocarcinogenesis .
A radiation-induced mutation of the second RB1 allele may be the cause of osteosarcomas occurring after a short delay , while other genes may be affected in those occurring after a longer delay .
A splice site variant in the sodium channel gene SCN1A confers risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> .
Our aim was to investigate whether the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> is influenced by a common functional polymorphism in the sodium channel gene SCN1A .
This single nucleotide polymorphism ( IVS5N+5 G>A , rs3812718 ) was shown to modify the proportion of two alternative transcripts of the channel .
We performed an exploratory case-control association analysis in 90 adult epilepsy patients with childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> vs 486 epilepsy patients without a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> and also vs 701 population controls .
In the replication step , we investigated children with <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> without concomitant epilepsy at the time of their inclusion .
We compared the genotypes of 55 of those children against population controls and performed a within-family association analysis in an additional 88 child-parent trios with <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> .
We observed a significant association of the splice-site interrupting A-allele with <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> ( p value in the exploratory step : 0.000017 ; joint p value of the replication : 0.00069 ) .
Our data suggest that the A-allele of this variant confers a threefold genotype relative risk in homozygotes and accounts for a population attributable fraction of up to 5 0 % for the etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> .
The A-allele of the SCN1A single nucleotide polymorphism IVS5N+5 G>A ( rs3812718 ) represents a common and relevant risk factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> .
A limitation of the present study is that patients of the exploratory and replication steps differed in aspects of their phenotype ( <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> with and without additional epilepsy ) .
Association of three genetic loci with uric acid concentration and risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> : a genome-wide association study .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperuricaemia <END> , a highly heritable trait , is a key risk factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> .
We aimed to identify novel genes associated with serum uric acid concentration and <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> .
Genome-wide association studies were done for serum uric acid in 7699 participants in the Framingham cohort and in 4148 participants in the Rotterdam cohort .
Genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) were replicated in white ( n=11 024) and black ( n=3843 ) individuals who took part in the study of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ( ARIC ) .
The SNPs that reached genome-wide significant association with uric acid in either the Framingham cohort ( p<5. 0 x 10( -8) ) or the Rotterdam cohort ( p<1. 0 x 10( -7) ) were evaluated with <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> .
The results obtained in white participants were combined using meta-analysis .
Three loci in the Framingham cohort and two in the Rotterdam cohort showed genome-wide association with uric acid .
Top SNPs in each locus were : missense rs16890979 in SLC2A9 ( p=7. 0 x 10( -168 ) and 2 .9 x 10( -18 ) for white and black participants , respectively ) ; missense rs2231142 in ABCG2 ( p=2.5 x 10( -60 ) and 9.8 x 10( -4) ) , and rs1165205 in SLC17A3 ( p=3.3 x 10( -26 ) and 0.33 ) .
All SNPs were direction-consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> in white participants : rs16890979 ( OR 0.59 per T allele , 95 % CI 0.52-0.68 , p=7. 0 x 10( -14) ) , rs2231142 ( 1.74 , 1.51 -1 .99 , p=3.3 x 10( -15 ) ) , and rs1165205 ( 0.85 , 0.77- 0.94 , p= 0.002 ) .
In black participants of the ARIC study , rs2231142 was direction-consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> ( 1.71 , 1.06-2.77 , p= 0.028 ) .
An additive genetic risk score of high-risk alleles at the three loci showed graded associations with uric acid ( 272-351 mumol/L in the Framingham cohort , 269-386 mumol/L in the Rotterdam cohort , and 303-426 mumol/L in white participants of the ARIC study ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> ( frequency 2-13% in the Framingham cohort , 2-8 % in the Rotterdam cohort , and 1-18 % in white participants in the ARIC study ) .
We identified three genetic loci associated with uric acid concentration and <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> .
A score based on genes with a putative role in renal urate handling showed a substantial risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome of distinctive face showing <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent eyes <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , ear anomalies , and learning disability .
We report on three patients from two families with apparently a novel clinical entity .
The main features of which include unusual craniofacial dysmorphism with <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent eyes <END> , flat midface , Cupid 's bow configuration of the upper lip , low-set , <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated <END> small ears , as well as conductive hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , heart defect , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
We suggest that this entity is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder given the occurrence in a mother and daughter as well as in an unrelated boy .

Oligophrenin 1 ( OPHN1 ) gene mutation causes syndromic X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , rostral ventricular enlargement and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
We identified an oligophrenin 1 ( OPHN1 ) gene mutation in a family with five brothers affected by a recognizable pattern of clinical and neuroradiological hallmarks .
The distinctive phenotype comprised moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , myoclonic-astatic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> and hypogenitalism .
Neuroimaging displayed fronto-temporal atrophy with rostral enlargement of the lateral ventricles , lower vermian agenesis and asymmetric <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
Mutation analysis of the OPHN1 gene on Xq12 disclosed a genomic deletion of exon 19 causing a frameshift .
Notably , OPHN1 mutations have been previously reported as a rare cause of non-syndromic X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Our findings , however , indicate that OPHN1 mutations result in a recognizable syndrome .
In addition , identification of OPHN1 as a further gene associated with epileptic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> will help to unravel aetiologic factors of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Phenotype of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> mapping to chromosome 14q32 .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> ( OMIM: 309700 ) may occur in isolation or in association with a variety of systemic malformations .
Isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> may be inherited as an autosomal dominant , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , or an X linked trait .
Based on a whole genome linkage analysis , in a six generation consanguineous family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> , the first locus for isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> was mapped to chromosome 14q32 .
Eight members of this family underwent clinical examination to determine the nature of the <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> phenotype associated with this locus .
All affected individuals in this family suffered from bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> in association with anterior segment abnormalities , and the best visual acuity achieved was " perception of light " .
Corneal changes included partial or complete congenital sclerocornea , and the later development of corneal vascularisation and anterior staphyloma .
Intraocular pressure , as measured by Schiotz tonometry , was greatly elevated in many cases .
This combination of ocular defects suggests an embryological disorder involving tissues derived from both the neuroectoderm and neural crest . Other families with defects in the <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> gene located on 14q32 may have a similar ocular phenotype aiding their identification .
Association between <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> and deleterious mutations in the RECQL4 gene in Rothmund-Thomson syndrome .
Rothmund-Thomson syndrome ( RTS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder associated with an increased predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> .
Children with RTS typically present with a characteristic skin rash ( poikiloderma) , <START:PHENOTYPE> small stature <END> , and skeletal dysplasias .
Mutations in the RECQL4 gene , which encodes a RecQ DNA helicase , have been reported in a few RTS patients .
We examined whether a predisposition to developing <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> among an international cohort of RTS patients was associated with a distinctive pattern of mutations in the RECQL4 gene .
We obtained clinical information about and biologic samples from 33 RTS patients ( age range = 1-30 years ) .
Eleven patients were diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> .
All 21 exons and 13 short introns of the RECQL4 gene were sequenced from the genomic DNA of all subjects .
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> among patients with and without mutations predicted to produce a truncated RECQL4 protein .
Twenty-three RTS patients , including all 11 <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> patients , carried at least one of 19 truncating mutations in their RECQL4 genes .
The incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> was 0.00 per year in truncating mutation-negative patients (10 0 person-years of observation ) and 0.05 per year in truncating mutation-positive patients ( 230 person-years of observation ) ( P =.037 ; two-sided log-rank test ) .
Mutations predicted to result in the loss of RECQL4 protein function occurred in approximately two-thirds of RTS patients and are associated with risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> .
Molecular diagnosis has the potential to identify those children with RTS who are at high risk of this cancer .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lissencephaly <END> type III , stippled epiphyses and loose , thick skin : a new recessively inherited syndrome .
We report on two new cases of syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> in two consanguineous sibs , with skeletal abnormality , born to young , healthy , second cousin parents with healthy children .
In Case 1 , fetal ultrasound screening at 32 weeks of gestation showed microcephaly , skin infiltration and equinovarus feet .
MRI disclosed cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> agyria <END> , hypoplastic cerebral mantle and posterior <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> .
The propositus , a boy , died soon after birth at term .
In Case 2 , fetal ultrasound study performed at 16 weeks of gestation disclosed skin infiltration .
MRI at 22 weeks of gestation showed microcephaly with <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of corpus callosum <END> and cerebellar hypoplasia .
Pregnancy was terminated at 22 weeks of gestation .
The fetus had normal 46 , XY karyotype and similar anomalies found in the index case , with cranio-facial edema and <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> .
X-ray films showed epiphyseal stippling of cervical vertebrae , feet and sacrum .
Metacarpal bones were shortened with hypoplastic distal phalanges .
Neuropathological findings were concordant with the pattern described in type III <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> : an agyric brain with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic brain stem <END> and cerebellum , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> of the cortical plate , matrix zone , basal ganglia , brainstem nuclei and spinal cord with axonal swelling and microcalcification .
This entity seems to be a new syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> type III , because of epiphyseal calcifications and metacarpophalangeal bone dysplasia .

X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , with <START:PHENOTYPE> aqueductal stenosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and adduction-flexion deformity of the thumbs .
Report of a family .
A new family is reported of a Bickers-Adams-Edwards syndrome .
This family has been studied up to three generations .
Two female carriers are known .
Among the six male children who are affected , four are severely mentally retarded , have <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> of the legs , and survived with a mild <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , and two show a more severe and rapid progression of head enlargement .
A partial <START:PHENOTYPE> aqueductal stenosis <END> , with remarkable ventricular dilatation , has been demonstrated by pneumoence-phalography in three boys .
A deformity of the thumbs links these six children together .
One of them has been treated by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt , when 18 months old , without any improvement in the neurological condition .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deficiency <END> is much more severe than could be expected from the degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , at least as estimated clinically by the <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hydrocephalus <END> is precocious , and the ventricular dilatation very advanced when seen by PEG studies .
Recognition of the female carriers is not possible .
The identification of a recurrent phosphoglycerate kinase mutation associated with chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> haemolytic anaemia <END> and neurological dysfunction in a family from USA .
Phosphoglycerate kinase ( PGK ) deficiency is a rare X-linked disease that is characterised by mild to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> haemolytic anaemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rhabdomyolysis <END> , and variable defects in the central nervous system .
In a white American family , two sons presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> haemolytic anaemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
The diagnosis of PGK deficiency was made based on the remarkably low ( <5 % of normal ) erythrocyte PGK enzyme activity level and the identification of a missense ( c . 491A --> T) PGK1 gene mutation .
This mutation results in an Asp164Val amino acid substitution , which has previously been designated PGK-Amiens and PGK-New York .
The two new patients have the full clinical syndrome of PGK deficiency including <START:PHENOTYPE> haemolytic anaemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and in the proband , hemiplegic migraines , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> and muscle fatigue .
The PGK-Amiens /New York mutation had previously been found in a French patient and also in a large Chinese-Australian kindred , indicating that either the c . 91A --> T mutation is a recurrent mutation or that there is shared ancestry between the patients that have been identified so far with the mutation .
Haplotype analysis of the c . 91A --> T mutation indicated that this was a recurrent mutation .
Congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> .
Report of four additional families and review of literature .
We report here four families with congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> ( CCA ) in which a wide range of phenotypic expression is observed .
In one family with a large number of affected individuals the condition is mildly expressed .
These individuals usually have crumpled ears , camptodactyly with ulnar deviation of the fingers , <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> , limited elbow and/or knee extension , and hypoplasia of the calf muscles .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Arachnodactyly <END> is not a constant feature .
No spinal deformities are present and only the proband has <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> deformities .
With time , affecteds have experienced spontaneous improvement of their contractures and their condition in adulthood has not interfered with a normal lifestyle .
Within this family there is little phenotypic variation between affected individuals .
Those affected within each of the other families have had varying degrees of severity of the condition .
A review of 29 other kindreds described in the literature with congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> shows that in this condition the most common features are abnormally formed ears , camptodactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> , limited movement of the elbows and knees , and underdevelopment of the calf muscles .
Spontaneous improvement of the contractures with age is reported in 94 % of cases .
Kyphosis , scoliosis or <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> occurred in 5 0 % and these defects were present in those who where more severely affected with CCA .
No ocular problems have been reported in this syndrome , but congenital heart defects have occurred in 14 .7% .
Marfan syndrome is the most important condition to differentiate from congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> since these two conditions are similar phenotypically .
However , in the former there are frequently serious ocular and cardiovascular problems which lead to significant morbidity and/or early death .
The Dubowitz syndrome .
The Dubowitz syndrome is a rare , autosomal , recessively inherited disorder of intrauterine and <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and such characteristic facial anomalies as <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , broadening of the bridge and tip of the nose , abnormal ears and retrogenia .
Further findings include <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> in the affected males , and brachy-clinodactyly of the fifth fingers .
Thirty-three cases with this syndrome have been reported in the literature .
Five additional patients are presented .
All five are sporadic cases .
The diagnostic symptoms and the differential diagnosis are discussed .
Family studies in <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> ( systemic sclerosis ) demonstrating an HLA-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> increased chromosomal breakage rate <END> in cultured lymphocytes .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> increased chromosomal breakage rate <END> ( ICBR ) was found in 27 of 28 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> ( systemic sclerosis , SS ) - 5 with the syndrome including <START:PHENOTYPE> calcinosis <END> cutis , Raynaud phenomenon , esophagus hypomotility , <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerodactyly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> telangiectasia <END> ( CREST) , 4 incomplete CREST, 1 overlapping syndrome , 18 progressive systemic sclerosis ( PSS ) .
Not only the patients , but also about half of their first-degree relatives showed an <START:PHENOTYPE> increased chromosomal breakage rate <END> ( more than 5 breaks per 100 metaphases ) .
This character segregated as a dominant marker in nine families of <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> patients .
In the six informative of the nine families , the ICBR trait showed close linkage with the HLA region on chromosome 6 ( total lod score 5.5 at theta = 0 ) .
In these families , ICBR was predominantly observed in linkage with HLA haplotype A1 , Cw7 , B8 , C4AQ0B1 , DR3 which is frequently observed in autoimmune diseases .
The nature of the agent inducing chromosomal breakage in cultured lymphocytes of some , but not all family members of <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> patients remains to be clarified .
Phenotypes Associated with SHOX Deficiency .
Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis ( LWD ) ( MIM 127300 ) is a dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasia characterized phenotypically by <START:PHENOTYPE> Madelung wrist deformity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mesomelia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
LWD can now be defined genetically by haploinsufficiency of the SHOX ( <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> homeobox-containing ) gene .
We have studied 21 LWD families ( 43 affected LWD subjects , including 32 females and 11 males , ages 3-56 yr ) with confirmed SHOX abnormalities .
We investigated the relationship between SHOX mutations , height deficit , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Madelung deformity <END> to determine the contribution of SHOX haploinsufficiency to the LWD and Turner syndrome ( TS ) phenotypes .
Also , we examined the effects of age , gender , and female puberty ( estrogen ) on the LWD phenotype .
SHOX deletions were present in affected individuals from 17 families ( 81% ) , and point mutations were detected in 4 families ( 19% ) .
In the LWD subjects , height deficits ranged from -4.6 to + 0.6 SD ( mean +/- SD = -2.2 +/- 1.0 ) .
There were no statistically significant effects of age , gender , pubertal status , or parental origin of SHOX mutations on height z-score .
The height deficit in LWD is approximately two thirds that of TS . <START:PHENOTYPE> Madelung deformity <END> was present in 74 % of LWD children and adults and was more frequent and severe in females than males .
The prevalence of the <START:PHENOTYPE> Madelung deformity <END> was higher in the LWD vs . a TS population .
The prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> increased carrying angle <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> was similar in the two populations .
In conclusion , SHOX deletions or mutations accounted for all of our LWD cases .
SHOX haploinsufficiency accounts for most , but not all , of the TS height deficit .
The LWD phenotype shows some gender- and age-related differences .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , infantile spasms , <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> in two sibs .
Two boys are described with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , infantile spasms , <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> and an early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
The autopsy findings of one patient are described in detail .
Polymicrogyria was the most prominent feature and the kidneys showed <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> .
These findings have been described as a clinical entity , the leading symptoms being congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> and mental retardation , accompanied by various other clinical symptoms .
A review of the literature suggests an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance .
Mutation of the gene encoding human TTF-2 associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid agenesis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> occurs in one of every three to four thousand newborns , owing to complete or partial failure of thyroid gland development .
Although <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid hypoplasia <END> has recently been associated with mutations in the thyrotropin ( TSH ) receptor , the cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid agenesis <END> is unknown .
Proteins including thyroid transcription factors 1 ( TTF-1 ; refs 4,5 ) and 2 ( TTF-2 ; refs 6 ,7 ) and Pax8 ( refs 8 ,9 ) are abundant in the developing mouse thyroid and are known to regulate genes expressed during its differentiation ( for example , thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin genes ) .
TTF-2 is a member of the forkhead/winged-helix domain transcription factor family , many of which are key regulators of embryogenesis .
Here we report that the transcription factor FKHL15 ( ref . 11 ) is the human homologue of mouse TTF-2 (encoded by the Titf2 gene ) and that two siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid agenesis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> are homozygous for a missense mutation ( Ala65 Val ) within its forkhead domain .
The mutant protein exhibits impaired DNA binding and loss of transcriptional function .
Our observations represent the first description of a genetic cause for <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid agenesis <END> .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of vision <END> in early childhood with a fatal course .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> disease with , in almost all patients , a fatal course in early childhood , occurring in a five-generation family is described .
The 12 affected boys had early-onset floppiness , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , liability to infections especially of the upper respiratory tract , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , and later , a flaccid <START:PHENOTYPE> tetraplegia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> .
Eleven boys died before the age of 5 years .
One boy is still alive at the age of 12 years , but in addition to the above-mentioned signs , he must be ventilated at night and is nearly blind due to optic atrophy.
In the only patient whose central nervous system could be examined at the time of autopsy , an almost complete absence of myelin in the posterior columns of the spinal cord was found .
This may be the main pathological substrate for the neurological findings .
No biochemical or immunological defects were detected .
The family also counted 16 healthy male siblings and 13 definite of 28 possible female carriers .
Some carriers developed a <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> in early adulthood .
As far as is known now , this disease has not been described before .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ichthyosis <END> follicularis , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> ( IFAP ) syndrome : clinical and neuropathological observations in a 33-year-old man .
The syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> ( IFAP ) is an uncommon neuroichthyosis described in only 10 males so far .
We report on a man with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> with apparently normal development in early infancy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Photophobia <END> and generalized myoclonicastatic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> began during or after the first year of age and were associated with progressive impairment of motor skills and mental abilities .
He died at 33 years of age .
Neuropathological findings showed an unusual deformation of the temporal lobes and olivocerebellar atrophy.
Cytogenetic and molecular studies did not uncover deletions in either Xp22.2 to 3 or in Xq27.3 to qter .
Case report supporting that the Barber-Say and ablepharon <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> syndromes could represent one disorder .
We report on a 7-year-old girl with unequivocal features of Barber-Say syndrome ( BSS ) : generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> especially at the back , dry <START:PHENOTYPE> lax skin <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thin lips <END> , cup-shaped ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> bulbous nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nipples <END> , and abnormal external genitalia .
She also demonstrated conductive <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> and microblepharon .
BSS has been reported with <START:PHENOTYPE> ectropion <END> ( not present in our patient ) , but ablepharon and microblepharon ( i .e. , absent or hypoplastic eyelids ) have always been considered as hallmarks of ablepharon <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> syndrome ( AMS ) .
This is the first report of microblepharon in BSS . Other authors have discussed that BSS and AMS could possibly represent one syndrome , and our report supports this hypothesis .
Multiple defects of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> respiratory chain in a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalopathy ( MERRF ) : a clinical , biochemical and molecular study .
We describe a young man with a progressive neurological disorder including <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and ragged red fibres--MERRF ) .
Multiple abnormalities of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> respiratory chain in skeletal muscle are shown by direct measurement of the flux through the individual complexes , low-temperature redox spectroscopy and decreased immunodetectable subunits of complexes I and IV by immunoblotting .
No abnormality of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA was found .
This is the first report of combined defects of complexes I , III and IV as a cause of this clinical syndrome .
However , we propose that the occurrence of multiple respiratory chain defects may be more common than previously recognised and that this particular combination of defects , involving complexes I , III and IV , may be the predominant biochemical abnormality in MERRF .
Fryns syndrome without <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> .
Report on a new case and review of the literature .
Fryns syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse facies <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> , distal limb hypoplasia and malformations of the cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , genitourinary and central nervous systems .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Diaphragmatic hernia <END> is a leading diagnostic feature in Fryns syndrome , recorded in more than 80% of cases .
We report a newborn with clinical features of Fryns syndrome except the <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> .
Cases of Fryns syndrome without <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> are reviewed .
Even in the absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> , pulmonary anomalies are described in Fryns syndrome , especially <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> .
Fetal mice , exposed to nitrofen , have a high incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital diaphragmatic hernia <END> and other malformations similar to that seen in Fryns syndrome .
Nitrofen might target molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in Fryns syndrome .
Familial bulbo-spinal <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular atrophy <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> testicular atrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory neuropathy <END> ( Kennedy-Alter-Sung syndrome ) .
Autopsy case report of two brothers .
Autopsy cases of two brothers with bulbo-spinal <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular atrophy <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> testicular atrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory neuropathy <END> are reported .
The disease started with finger <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , proximal muscle weakness and facial muscle twitching at the second and fourth decades , accompanied by bulbar signs and glove-stocking type sensory disturbance .
Systemic neurogenic patterns and diminished sensory nerve action potential amplitudes were recorded by electrophysiological studies .
A marked loss of myelinated fibers was noticed upon sural nerve biopsy .
Gonadal hormone values were normal , except for elevated urinary estrogen .
Postmortem examinations revealed a remarkable degeneration of the facial and hypoglossal nuclei , and the spinal cord motoneurons .
The skeletal muscles and the tongue showed <START:PHENOTYPE> neurogenic muscular atrophy <END> with fatty replacement .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Testicular atrophy <END> was prominent showing hyalinized seminiferous tubuli with nodular and diffuse Leydig cell hyperplasia , containing estrogen immunoreactive substance .
These clinical and histological features seemed to be highly compatible with those of Kennedy-Alter-Sung type bulbo-spinal muscular atrophy.
The involvement of sensory peripheral nerves , however , was a distinct feature of this family .
Cosegregation of open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and the nail-patella syndrome .
To evaluate two families ascertained only for the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in which both nail-patella syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> occur in several generations and to determine whether the two diseases are genetically related .
Ophthalmologic examinations and orthopedic examinations were performed .
DNA samples from family members were screened with a microsatellite repeat marker at the argininosuccinate synthetase ( ASS ) locus at 9q34 , and linkage analysis was performed .
Six patients with open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> were found among 13 patients with nail-patella syndrome in family UM:47 .
Seven patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> were found among 11 patients with nail-patella syndrome in family UM:65 .
In both families , all individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> also had nail-patella syndrome .
Two-point linkage analysis resulted in a lod score of 2 .98 at a recombination fraction of 0.00 for open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and nail-patella syndrome .
Linkage results presented here provide strong evidence that the orthopedic and nail anomalies in these two families result from the same nail-patella syndrome locus that has been previously linked to markers at 9q34 . These data provide indirect evidence for a possible <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> locus at 9q34 and do not allow us to distinguish whether the <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is the result of the nail-patella syndrome mutation or whether there is a separate locus responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in these families .
These studies suggest a need for ophthalmologic examination of individuals with nail-patella syndrome .
Lymphedema-lymphangiectasia-mental retardation ( Hennekam ) syndrome : a review .
The Hennekam syndrome is an infrequently reported heritable entity characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> , lymphangiectasia , and developmental delay .
Here we add an additional 8 patients , and compare their findings to the 16 cases from the literature .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> is usually congenital , can be markedly asymmetrical , and , often , gradually progressive .
Complications such as <START:PHENOTYPE> erysipelas <END> are common .
The lymphangiectasias are present in the intestines , but have also been found in the pleura , pericardium , thyroid gland , and kidney .
Several patients have demonstrated congenital cardiac and blood vessel anomalies , pointing to a disturbance of angiogenesis in at least some of the patients .
Facial features are variable , and are chiefly characterized , in a typical patient , by a <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> , flat and <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> .
Facial features are thought to mirror the extent of intrauterine facial <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> , or may be caused by lymphatic obstruction that affects the early migration of neural crest tissue .
Other anomalies have included <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , dental anomalies , hearing loss , and renal anomalies .
The psychomotor development varies widely , even within a single family , from almost normal development to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Convulsions are common .
The existence of 10 familial cases , equal sex ratio , increased parental consanguinity rate ( 4/2 0 families) , and absence of vertical transmission are consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> pattern of inheritance .
It seems likely that most ( but not all ) manifestations of the entity can be explained as sequences of impaired prenatal and postnatal lymphatic flow , suggesting that the causative gene(s ) should have a major function in lymphangiogenesis .

An additional manifestation in acrocallosal syndrome : temporal lobe hypoplasia .
Acrocallosal Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder which is characterized by moderate to <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and polydactyly of fingers and toes .
The spectrum of this syndrome is very variable .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Prominent forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> and mandible , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large anterior fontanelle <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> tapered fingers <END> , omphalocele and <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> are some other common findings in this syndrome .
Twenty percent of the patients have associated brain abnormalities such as cerebral atrophy , hypothalamic dysfunction , small cerebrum , micropolygyria , hypoplasia of pons , hypoplasia of cerebellar hemispheres , hypoplasia of medulla oblongata , agenesis or hypoplasia of cerebellar vermis and corpus callosum abnormalities .
Here we present a 10-month-old female infant with clinical and radiological findings indicative of acrocallosal syndrome .
She was noted to have craniofacial abnormalities suggestive of acrocallosal syndrome , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and polydactyly .
MRI revealed cerebral atrophy , corpus callosum agenesis , dilated lateral ventricules and unilateral right temporal lobe hypoplasia , the latter not previously reported in the spectrum of this syndrome .
Based on this observation we conclude the importance of screening brain abnormalities and present temporal lobe hypoplasia as a new additional anomaly in this syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Iris coloboma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> : a new syndrome .
To sibs and an unrelated single patient have a combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The London Dysmorphology Database was used to determine whether this is a new syndrome .
Linkage mapping of a severe <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome .
A four-generation Swedish family with a new type of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome was recently reported by Gustavson et al .
The complex syndrome includes <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , optical atrophy with decreased vision or <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing defect <END> , characteristic facial features , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and restricted joint motility .
The patients die during infancy or early in childhood .
Twenty-one family members , including two affected males , were available for study .
Linkage analysis was conducted in the family by using 11 RFLP markers and 10 VNTR markers spread along the X chromosome .
A hypervariable short tandem repeat of DXS294 at Xq26 showed a peak two-point lod score of 3.35 at zero recombination fraction .
Calculations using the same markers revealed a multipoint peak lod score of 3.65 at DXS294 . Crossover events with the centromeric marker DXS424 and the telomeric marker DXS297 delimit a probable region for the gene localization .
It is noteworthy that hte disease loci of two other syndromes with overlapping clinical manifestations recently were shown by Turner et al . and Pettigrew et al . to be linked to markers at Xq26 .
Further delineation of the Cohen syndrome ; report on <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal dystrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> leukopenia <END> and consanguinity .
Six new patients with the Cohen syndrome are reported from Finland and 25 published cases from elsewhere are reviewed .
New findings are consanguinity among two pairs of parents , granulocytopenia , and marked ophthalmological changes : <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased visual acuity <END> , hemeralopia , constricted visual fields , <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal dystrophy <END> with bull 's-eye-like maculae and pigmentary deposits , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and isoelectric electroretinogram .
Previously known features of the Cohen syndrome ( non-progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , peculiar facies , slender hands and feet , floppiness , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed puberty <END> ) are confirmed or revised .
The ophthalmological features merit attention in the previous and future suspected cases of the Cohen syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> can be taken for granted .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hemifacial spasm <END> : report of cases and review of literature .
We describe clinical characteristics of 10 patients ( five families ) with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hemifacial spasm <END> , with reviews of 13 patients hitherto reported in the literature .
There is no clear difference in clinical manifestations between sporadic and familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hemifacial spasms <END> .
There is no definite inheritance pattern , but may be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> with low penetrance .
The ages of onset of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hemifacial spasm <END> are variable , but occasionally can occur at early years of life .
There is a left-side predominance with respect to the affected side of cases with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hemifacial spasm <END> .
Similar to sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> hemifacial spasm <END> , vascular decompression was effective , suggesting that vascular compression is involved in generating <START:PHENOTYPE> hemifacial spasm <END> even in the familial cases .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hemifacial spasm <END> may not be a rare disorder , but may possibly be overlooked .
Clarifying the role of genetic susceptibility in pathophysiological mechanisms underlying <START:PHENOTYPE> hemifacial spasm <END> is an important approach toward better understanding of the pathogenesis of cranial rhizopathies .
Larsen syndrome associated with severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> .
Larsen syndrome associated with severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> : Larsen syndrome ( LS ) is characterized by the association of flattened facies with a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , dislocation of hips , elbows and knees , <START:PHENOTYPE> equinovarus <END> or valgus deformities of the feet , long and tapering fingers , normal intelligence .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hydrocephalus <END> has rarely been reported in association with LS .
In this article , a newborn infant with the classical features of LS and severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> is presented .
Our purpose was to emphasize the importance of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> in infants with LS and to highlight the management of cases of LS associated with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> .
Further clinical delineation and increased morbidity in males with osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis : an X-linked disorder ?
Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis ( OS-CS ) is a bone dysplasia characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , palate anomalies , hearing deficits , and mental retardation .
The radiographic findings include cranial sclerosis , linear striations in the long bones and iliac wings , small poorly aerated sinuses , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> increased bone density <END> .
The sensory deficits are disabling , but the condition generally is not life threatening .
We describe 4 brothers with the characteristics of OS-CS , 3 of whom have died from more serious complications of the disorder .
The mother of these children , and her only daughter , have the mildest phenotype with the typical linear striations in the long bones and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> .
OS-CS is thought to be autosomal dominant with complete penetrance and variable expressivity .
Our observations could be consistent with X-linkage , since there is milder expression in the female relatives .
In addition , we recognize <START:PHENOTYPE> absent fibulae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malrotation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> as new manifestations as well as congenital heart disease .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cluster headache <END> is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder in some families : a complex segregation analysis .
We investigated the mode of inheritance of <START:PHENOTYPE> cluster headache <END> in 370 families .
The probands were from a neurological clinic in Jutland and two departments of neurology in Copenhagen County , Denmark .
The criteria of the International Headache Society were used .
The patterns of segregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> cluster headache <END> were assessed by complex segregation analysis performed with the computer program POINTE R .
Of the 370 probands with <START:PHENOTYPE> cluster headache <END> , 25 had 36 relatives with <START:PHENOTYPE> cluster headache <END> .
The segregation analysis suggests that <START:PHENOTYPE> cluster headache <END> has an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> gene ( p < 0.10 ) with a penetrance of 0.30-0.34 in males and 0.17- 0.21 in females .
The gene is present in 3 to 4% of males and 7 to 10 % of females with <START:PHENOTYPE> cluster headache <END> .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> gene has a role in <START:PHENOTYPE> cluster headache <END> in some families .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> associated with polydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> unilateral renal agenesis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital deafness <END> : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
An association of <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> with polydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> unilateral renal agenesis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital deafness <END> is described in sibs ( brother and sister ) of consanguineous parents .
It is suggested that this might represent a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
Mutations in GMPPA cause a glycosylation disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autonomic dysfunction <END> .
In guanosine diphosphate ( GDP)-mannose pyrophosphorylase A ( GMPPA) , we identified a homozygous nonsense mutation that segregated with <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed developmental milestones <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> gait abnormalities <END> in a consanguineous Pakistani pedigree .
Mutations in GMPPA were subsequently found in ten additional individuals from eight independent families affected by the combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> , and neurological deficits .
This autosomal-recessive disorder shows many similarities with triple A syndrome , which is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> , and variable neurological deficits in combination with adrenal insufficiency .
GMPPA is a largely uncharacterized homolog of GMPPB .
GMPPB catalyzes the formation of GDP-mannose , which is an essential precursor of glycan moieties of glycoproteins and glycolipids and is associated with congenital and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies with hypoglycosylation of Î±-dystroglycan .
Surprisingly , GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase activity was unchanged and GDP-mannose levels were strongly increased in lymphoblasts of individuals with GMPPA mutations .
This suggests that GMPPA might serve as a GMPPB regulatory subunit mediating feedback inhibition of GMPPB instead of displaying catalytic enzyme activity itself .
Thus , a triple-A-like syndrome can be added to the growing list of congenital disorders of glycosylation , in which dysregulation rather than mere enzyme deficiency is the basal pathophysiological mechanism .

A genome-wide scan for <START:PHENOTYPE> preeclampsia <END> in the Netherlands .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Preeclampsia <END> , hallmarked by de novo <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> in pregnancy , has a familial tendency .
Recently , a large Icelandic genome-wide scan provided evidence for a maternal susceptibility locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> preeclampsia <END> on chromosome 2p13 which was confirmed by a genome scan from Australia and New Zealand ( NZ ) .
The current study reports on a genome-wide scan of Dutch affected sib-pair families .
In total 67 Dutch affected sib-pair families , comprising at least two siblings with proteinuric <START:PHENOTYPE> preeclampsia <END> , eclampsia or HELLP-syndrome , were typed for 293 polymorphic markers throughout the genome and linkage analysis was performed .
The highest allele sharing lod score of 1 .99 was seen on chromosome 12q at 109.5 cM . Two peaks overlapped in the same regions between the Dutch and Icelandic genome-wide scan at chromosome 3p and chromosome 15 q . No overlap was seen on 2p. Re-analysis in 38 families without HELLP-syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> preeclampsia <END> families ) and 34 families with at least one sibling with HELLP syndrome ( HELLP families) , revealed two peaks with suggestive evidence for linkage in the non-HELLP families on chromosome 10q ( lod score 2.38 , D10S1432 , 93 .9 cM ) and 22q ( lod score 2.41 , D22S685 , 32.4 cM ) .
The peak on 12q appeared to be associated with HELLP syndrome ; it increased to a lod score of 2.1 in the HELLP families and almost disappeared in the <START:PHENOTYPE> preeclampsia <END> families .
A nominal peak on chromosome 11 in the <START:PHENOTYPE> preeclampsia <END> families showed overlap with the second highest peak in the Australian/NZ study .
Results from our Dutch genome-wide scan indicate that HELLP syndrome might have a different genetic background than <START:PHENOTYPE> preeclampsia <END> .
Reduction of false negative results in screening of newborns for <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> and other disabilities ( including <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> thromboembolism <END> ) in patients who have <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> as a result of a deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase can be prevented by the screening of newborns with measurement of blood methionine , followed by the early treatment of affected infants .
Many infants with this disorder , however , are not identified by screening and have irreversible brain damage .
We reviewed the results of neonatal screening for <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> over a period of 32 years in New England . Additional specimens were requested for repeated analysis when blood methionine measurements were at or above the established cutoff level .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Homocystinuria <END> due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency was confirmed by quantitative amino acid analyses .
For the first 23.5 years of the review period , the blood methionine cutoff value was 2 mg per deciliter ( 134 micromol per liter ) .
Among the 2.2 million infants screened during that period , 8 with <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> were identified ( 1:275 ,000 ) .
In 1990 , the cutoff value was reduced to 1 mg per deciliter ( 67 micromol per liter ) .
Among the 1 .1 million infants screened in the subsequent 8.5 years , 7 with the disorder were identified ( 1 :157 , 000 ) .
During the latter period , the specimens were collected from six of the seven infants when they were two days of age or less ; five of the six had blood methionine concentrations below 2 mg per deciliter .
Use of the reduced cutoff level increased the false positive rate from 0.006 percent to 0.03 percent .
A cutoff level for blood methionine of 1 mg per deciliter in neonatal screening tests for <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> should identify affected infants who have only slightly elevated concentrations of methionine and reduce the frequency of false negative results .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> simple <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> .
Congenital bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> is a rare malformation of the eye , which ranges from extreme to mild reduction of total axial length .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microphthalmos <END> may occur as an isolated ocular abnormality or as part of a systemic disorder , and different classifications of the condition have been attempted .
We describe a large pedigree with 14 persons in four generations affected with bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> without other ocular or systemic signs .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait with complete penetrance is proposed .
Five subjects underwent a complete ophthalmological evaluation .
The total axial length was measured by A scan ultrasonography in all persons .
Ultrasonography showed a reduction of the total axial length ( range 18 .4-19.7 mm ) and a reduced vitreous cavity length ( range 11 .4-13.5 mm ) in all investigated patients .
All the patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> ( range 8-9.7 mm ) .
No other ocular anomalies or associated systemic malformations were found .
A review of published reports also suggests that simple , partial , posterior , pure <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nanophthalmos <END> are similar clinical entities sharing total axial length and vitreous cavity length reduction .
Therefore , the term simple <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> is proposed to identify these clinical conditions .
Mulvihill-Smith syndrome : case report and review .
We report a 20 year old man with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , microcephaly , unusual facies , numerous <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmented naevi <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypodontia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> high pitched voice <END> .
Tympner et al had assumed that the patient had a new syndrome of " progressive combined <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> and ectomesodermal dysplasia " .
We show here that the condition is identical to the Mulvihill-Smith syndrome ( McKusick 176 690) , a progeroid disorder described in four or possibly five sporadic cases to date .
We describe his clinical progress up to the age of 20 years .
Our patient suffered from <START:PHENOTYPE> severe viral infections <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> allergic rhinitis <END> and conjunctivitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed puberty <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> , modest achievement in high school , and reactive depression .
The immunological , facioskeletal , and dental abnormalities are presented in detail .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Macrostomia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectropion <END> , atrophic skin , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> : another observation .
We report on a boy with bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> ectropion <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bulbous nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin lips <END> , abnormal ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> of the forehead , neck and back , atrophic skin with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nipples <END> .
Cause and inheritance are unknown .
Association of a dominantly inherited hyperphosphorylated paraprotein target with sporadic and familial <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple myeloma <END> and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance : a case-control study .
Chronic antigenic stimulation might have a role in the pathogenesis of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance ( MGUS ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple myeloma <END> .
The aim of this study was to search for factors underlying the autoimmunogenicity of paratarg-7 , a frequent antigenic target of paraproteins in MGUS and <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple myeloma <END> .
Between January , 2005 , and February , 2009 , serum and peripheral blood cells were obtained from consecutive patients with MGUS or <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple myeloma <END> and healthy blood donors , and paratarg-7 was analysed by DNA sequencing , SDS-PAGE , isoelectric focusing , and western blotting .
Mutations or polymorphisms of paratarg-7 were not noted , but hyperphosphorylation was detected in 35 ( 13 .9% ) of 252 patients with MGUS or <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple myeloma <END> , all of whom had an anti-paratarg-7-specific paraprotein .
Analysis of eight families showed that hyperphosphorylated paratarg-7 is inherited in a dominant fashion , and that carriers of hyperphosphorylated paratarg-7 have an increased risk of developing MGUS and <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple myeloma <END> ( odds ratio [ OR] 7.9 , 95 % CI 2.8-22.6 ; p= 0.0001 ) .
Familial MGUS and <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple myeloma <END> were associated with a dominant inheritance of hyperphosphorylated paratarg-7 , enabling family members at increased risk for MGUS or <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple myeloma <END> to be identified .
That only patients with MGUS or <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple myeloma <END> who are carriers of hyperphosphorylated paratarg-7 had a paratarg-7-specific paraprotein suggests that the hyperphosphorylation of paratarg-7 induces auto-immunity and is involved in the pathogenesis of MGUS and <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple myeloma <END> ; for example , by chronic antigenic stimulation .

Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
We studied a new hereditary syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> in six affected members of one kindred .
In all patients , the manifestations of disease began in early childhood .
The characteristic features are <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , increased renal phosphate clearance ( the ratio between the maximal tubular reabsorption rate for phosphorus and the glomerular filtration rate [Tm P/GFR] is 2 to 4 S.D . below the age-related mean ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> ( 8 .6 mg of urinary calcium per kilogram of body weight per 24 hours vs . the upper normal value of 4.0) , normal serum calcium levels , increased gastrointestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus , an elevated serum concentration of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D ( 390 +/- 99 pg per milliliter vs . the upper normal value of 110 ) , and suppressed parathyroid function ( an immunoreactive parathyroid hormone level of 0.33 +/- 0.1 ng per milliliter and a cyclic AMP level of 1.39 +/- 0.12 nmol per deciliter of glomerular filtrate vs . the lower normal values of 0.3 and 1.5 , respectively ) .
Long-term phosphate supplementation as the sole therapy resulted in reversal of all clinical and biochemical abnormalities except the decreased Tm P/GFR .
We propose that the pivotal defect in this syndrome is a renal phosphate leak resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> with an appropriate elevation of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D levels , which causes increased calcium absorption , parathyroid suppression , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
This syndrome may represent one end of a spectrum of hereditary absorptive <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
Our observations support the importance of phosphate as a mediator in controlling 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D production in human beings .
A complex phenotype of peripheral neuropathy , myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> hoarseness <END> , and hearing loss is linked to an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mutation in MYH14 .
Both peripheral neuropathy and distal myopathy are well-established inherited neuromuscular disorders characterized by progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> and atrophy of the distal limb muscles .
A complex phenotype of peripheral neuropathy , myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> hoarseness <END> , and hearing loss was diagnosed in a large <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Korean family .
A high density single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP)-based linkage study mapped the underlying gene to a region on chromosome 19q13.3 .
The maximum multipoint LOD score was 3.794 .
Sequencing of 34 positional candidate genes in the segregating haplotype revealed a novel c.2822G>T ( p.Arg941 Leu ) mutation in the gene MYH14 , which encodes the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain 14 . Clinically we observed a sequential pattern of the onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> starting from the anterior to the posterior leg muscle compartments followed by involvement of intrinsic hand and proximal muscles .
The hearing loss and <START:PHENOTYPE> hoarseness <END> followed the onset of distal <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> .
Histopathologic and electrodiagnostic studies revealed both chronic neuropathic and myopathic features in the affected patients .
Although mutations in MYH14 have been shown to cause nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> hearing loss ( DFNA4 ) , the peripheral neuropathy , myopathy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hoarseness <END> have not been associated with MYH14 .
Therefore , we suggest that the identified mutation in MYH14 significantly expands the phenotypic spectrum of this gene . Â© 2011 Wiley-Liss , Inc .
Neuropathologic heterogeneity in HDDD1 : a familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions and progranulin mutation .
Hereditary dysphasic <START:PHENOTYPE> disinhibition <END> dementia ( HDDD ) describes a familial disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> personality changes <END> , and language and memory deficits .
The neuropathology includes frontotemporal lobar atrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> and , in most cases , abundant Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles ( NFTs ) .
A Pick/Alzheimer 's spectrum was proposed for the original family ( HDDD1 ) .
Here we report the clinicopathologic case of an HDDD1 individual using modern immunohistochemical methods , contemporary neuropathologic diagnostic criteria to distinguish different frontotemporal lobar degenerations ( FTL Ds ) , and progranulin ( PRGN ) mutation analysis .
Clinical onset was at age 62 years with <START:PHENOTYPE> personality changes <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> disinhibition <END> , followed by nonfluent <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphasia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> memory loss <END> that progressed to muteness and total dependence with death at age 84 years .
There was severe generalized brain atrophy ( weight=57 0 g ) . Histopathology showed superficial microvacuolation , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> , and ubiquitin-positive , tau-negative cytoplasmic and intranuclear neuronal inclusions in frontal , temporal , and parietal cortices .
There were also frequent neuritic plaques and NFTs in parietal and occipital cortices .
The case met neuropathologic criteria for both FTLD with ubiquitin-positive , tau-negative inclusions ( FTL D-U) , and Alzheimer disease ( Braak NFT stage V ) .
We discovered a novel pathogenic PGRN mutation c.5913 A> G ( IVS6-2 A>G ) segregating with FTL D-U in this kindred .
In conclusion , HDDD1 is an FTL D-U caused by a PGRN mutation and is neuropathologically heterogeneous with Alzheimer disease as a common comorbidity .
Axial <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> . Clinical , laboratory and genetic investigation of an affected mother and son .
Axial osteomalacia--a rare osteosclerotic bone disorder characterized by axial skeleton pain , coarsening of the trabecular bone pattern on radiographs of the axial but not appendicular skeleton , and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> on biopsy of a rib or iliac crest--has been reported in 10 apparently sporadic cases , all of which were in middle-aged or elderly Caucasian men .
The etiology is unknown but has been postulated to be a bone cell defect .
We describe the clinical , laboratory , pathologic and family study of a black mother and son with axial <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> associated with polycystic liver and kidney disease .
Investigation of the son suggested that radiographic <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosclerosis <END> can be detected in early adulthood .
Limited skeletal survey of his three children revealed no abnormalities .
Examination of undecalcified iliac crest bone after in vivo tetracycline labeling revealed severe <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> in the son despite normal circulating calcium , inorganic phosphate and vitamin D metabolite levels and persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase activity .
Although osteoblasts appeared flat and inactive , histochemical studies showed intense alkaline phosphatase activity in the osteoblasts along most trabecular bone surfaces .
Electron microscopy revealed intact matrix vesicles within unmineralized osteoid .
The presence also of unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> in the son--characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> proximal muscle weakness <END> , persistently <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated circulating creatine phosphokinase <END> levels and pathogenic changes of <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> on biopsy of quadriceps muscle--together with impaired bone mineralization , suggests that a disorder of vitamin D action may be involved in the pathogenesis of this unusual condition .
Axial <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> affects blacks as well as Caucasians , women as well as men , may be familial , and may perhaps be a developmental abnormality inherited in association with polycystic kidney and liver disease .
Expanding the clinical spectrum of the 16p11 .2 chromosomal rearrangements : three patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> .
16p11 .2 rearrangements are associated with developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorder , behavioral problems ( especially attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , dysmorphic features , and abnormal head size .
In addition , congenital anomalies and abnormal brain findings were frequently observed in patients with these rearrangements .
We identified and performed a detailed microarray , phenotypic , and radiological characterization of three new patients with 16p11 .2 rearrangements : two deletion patients and one patient with the reciprocal duplication .
All patients have a heterozygous loss (deletion ) or gain ( duplication ) corresponding to chromosomal coordinates ( chr16 : 29 528 190-30 107 184 ) with a minimal size of 579 kb .
The deletion patients had language delay and learning disabilities and one met criteria for pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified .
The duplication patient received a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and had academic deficits and behavioral problems .
The patients with deletion had long cervicothoracic <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> and the duplication patient had long thoracolumbar <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> in one patient with deletion was associated with Chiari malformation .
Our findings highlight the broad spectrum of clinical and neurological manifestations in patients with 16p11 .2 rearrangements .
Our observation suggests that genes ( or a single gene ) within the implicated interval have significant roles in the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> .
A more comprehensive and systematic research is warranted to study the frequency and spectrum of malformations in the central nervous system in these patients .
Haplotype transmission analysis provides evidence of association for DISC1 to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and suggests sex-dependent effects .
We have previously reported a linkage peak on 1q42 in a Finnish <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> sample .
In this study we genotyped 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) from 1q42 covering the three candidate genes TR AX , DISC1 and DISC2 , using a study sample of 458 Finnish families ascertained for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Two-point and haplotype association analysis revealed a significant region of interest within the DISC1 gene .
A common haplotype ( HEP3 ) was observed to be significantly under-transmitted to affected individuals ( P= 0.0031 ) .
HEP3 represents a two SNP haplotype spanning from intron 1 to exon 2 of DISC1 .
This haplotype also displayed sex differences in transmission distortion , the under-transmission being significant only to affected females ( P= 0.00024 ) .
Three other regions of interest were observed in the TRAX and DISC genes .
However , analysis of only those families with complete genotype information specifically highlights the HEP3 haplotype as a true observation .
The finding of a common under-transmitted SNP haplotype might imply that this particular allele offers some protection from the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Analysis of component-traits of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , derived from the Operational Criteria Checklist of Psychotic Illness ( OCCPI) , displayed association of HEP3 to features of the general phenotype of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , including traits representing <START:PHENOTYPE> delusions <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> and negative symptoms .
This study provides further evidence for the hypothesis that the DISC1 gene is involved in the aetiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , and implies a putative sex difference for the effect of the gene .
Our findings would also encourage more detailed analyses of the effect of DISC1 on the component-traits of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Mutational screening of VSX1 in <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> patients from the European population .
To perform mutational screening of the visual system homeobox gene 1 ( VSX1 ; MIM#605020) in patients with sporadic and familial <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> ( MIM#148300 ) in a European population and , for the first time , report the mutational analysis of the two newly identified VSX1exons .
VSX1sequence variants in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> were evaluated by direct sequencing of the entire coding region , including two novel exons .
In familial <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> cases , segregation of potentially pathogenic VSX1variants was assessed to determine pathogenicity .
Transcript analysis was carried out on splice site and synonymous sequence variants not detected in controls .
A total of 66 unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> from the European population ( 27 with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> ; 39 with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> ) were analysed for VSX1 mutations .
Four sequence variants were not observed in 100 healthy control individuals : c.432C> G ( p.D144E ) , c.479 G>A ( p.G16 0D) , c.78 9C> T ( p.S263S) , and an intronic change c.844-13T> A ( numbered with respect to NM_014588 ) .
Segregation was not detected for p.D144E and c.844-13T> A .
The change in p.G16 0D was observed in two patients with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
Although predicted to alter VSX1 splicing , p.S263 S had no effect on transcript processing .
Four known SNPs were detected and the following polymorphic variants were observed in <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> patients and controls : c.711 T> A ( NM_199425 ; p.P237P ) , c.844-5_-6ins T ( NM_014588 ) , c.*28G>T ( DQ854811 / DQ854812 ) , and c.*50G>A ( DQ8548 09/ DQ854810 ) .
VSX1has a minor role in <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> pathogenesis .
The pathogenicity of p.G16 0D remains controversial and this change may represent a rare polymorphism or genetic modifier .
Further evidence is provided that the previously reported variant , p.D144E , is a polymorphism .
A distinct form of <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> ( SEMDJL )-leptodactylic type : radiological characteristics in seven new patients .
This study presents seven cases of a rare but distinctive form of <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with joint laxity-leptodactylic or Hall type to emphasize the characteristic clinical and radiological findings .
A multiinstitutional retrospective review was performed on seven patients .
The patient population consisted of one family with an affected mother and two siblings and four unrelated patients ; there were one adult , aged 40 years , and six children , ranging in age from 3 to 12 years .
The gender ratio of females to males was 5 to 2 .
We reviewed the clinical data and skeletal surveys and focused on radiographs of the pelvis , knees , hands , and spine .
The outstanding clinical features were <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , and multiple dislocations and/or ligamentous laxity of the large joints , particularly at the knees with a <START:PHENOTYPE> genu valgum <END> or varum deformity .
Of seven patients , six patients showed normal intellect but one patient had mild mental retardation .
The main radiological features included small , <START:PHENOTYPE> irregular epiphyses <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal irregularity <END> with vertical striations that was a constant finding at the knees , constricted femoral necks , delayed ossification of the carpal bones , and slender metacarpals .
Progressive thoracolumbar <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> was evident with aging ; however , the vertebral bodies appeared normal in height or mild <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> was noted .
In view of the orthopedic management of multiple joint dislocations and ligamentous laxity of the large joints , awareness of this disease entity and diagnostic precision solely based on radiological findings is of importance , particularly as the disorder is currently more common than initially reported .
The Myhre syndrome : report of two cases .
Two unrelated patients , aged 19 and 6 years , were studied and diagnosed as having Myhre syndrome ( MS ) .
This review , together with three previous cases , permits further delineation of MS .
The main features are : <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypertrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased joint mobility <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thick calvarium <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad ribs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic iliac wings <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> short tubular bones <END> .
Advanced paternal age at the propositi 's birth suggests an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mutation as the cause of MS .
Clinical and linkage study on a consanguineous Chinese family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> high <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> .
A linkage study on <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> high <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( arHM ) has not been reported , although several loci for autosomal dominant high <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( adHM ) have been mapped .
Data from a consanguineous Chinese family with arHM were collected to map the genetic locus associated with this condition .
Phenotypic information and DNA samples were collected from family members .
A genome-wide linkage scan combined with homozygosity mapping was performed by using 382 microsatellite DNA markers from the entire genome spaced at intervals of about 10 cM .
The pedigree and clinical data of the family indicate that the high <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> is <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
A genome-wide scan of chromosomes 1-22 gave a LOD score greater than 1. 0 for 22 markers .
Linkage to most of these markers was not supported by closely flanking markers except for three possible loci on chromosomes 11 , 14 , and 17 . Fine mapping and haplotype analysis provide evidence for a locus at 14q22.1-q24.2 in a 25.23 Mb region between markers D14S984 and D14S999 with a maximum LOD score of 2.19 . All 11 microsatellite markers inside the linkage interval as well as haplotype construction point to a gene at this locus .
Linkage elsewhere on chromosome 11 and chromosome 17 could not be excluded due to the small size of the family .
Pedigree and clinical data suggest that an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> gene is responsible for high <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> in a consanguineous Chinese family .
Genome-wide linkage analysis was used to map the gene for high <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> to a few limited loci .
The resultant information should help future studies identify the gene for arHM .
To our knowledge , this report is the first clinical and linkage study on a consanguineous family with arHM .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Palmoplantar keratoderma <END> , pseudo-ainhum , and universal atrichia : A new patient and review of the palmoplantar keratoderma-congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Palmoplantar keratoderma <END> ( PPK ) may concur with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> ( CA ) in various genodermatoses .
We report on a 10-year-old girl with generalized atrichia and a severe form of PPK causing pseudo-ainhum , <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerodactyly <END> , and contractures , a phenotype not consistent with any well-defined condition .
Non-specific additional findings comprised mild <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dystrophy <END> and widespread keratosis pilaris including ulerythema ophryogenes .
Direct sequencing of the GJB2 and LOR coding regions yielded normal results .
A review identified two additional sporadic and four familial cases with PPK and CA . Comparison between familial cases suggested the existence of two genetically and phenotypically distinct types of PPK-CA : (i ) an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> ( StevanoviÄ‡ type) , a variable and benign phenotype without significant hand complications , and ( ii ) a more complex <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> variant ( Wallis type ) with contractures , <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerodactyly <END> , and pseudo-ainhum .
Nuclear <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> may represent an additional although not constant finding in the Wallis type PPK-CA .
Further reports are required to test this preliminary conclusion .
Significant linkage to airway responsiveness on chromosome 12q24 in families of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> in Costa Rica .
Although <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> is a major public health problem in certain Hispanic subgroups in the United States and Latin America , only one genome scan for <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> has included Hispanic individuals .
Because of small sample size , that study had limited statistical power to detect linkage to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and its intermediate phenotypes in Hispanic participants . To identify genomic regions that contain susceptibility genes for <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and airway responsiveness in an isolated Hispanic population living in the Central Valley of Costa Rica , we conducted a genome-wide linkage analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( n = 638 ) and airway responsiveness ( n = 488 ) in members of eight large pedigrees of Costa Rican children with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Nonparametric multipoint linkage analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> was conducted by the NPL-PAI R allele-sharing statistic , and variance component models were used for the multipoint linkage analysis of airway responsiveness as a quantitative phenotype .
All linkage analyses were repeated after exclusion of the phenotypic data of former and current smokers .
Chromosome 12q showed some evidence of linkage to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , particularly in nonsmokers ( P < 0.01 ) .
Among nonsmokers , there was suggestive evidence of linkage to airway responsiveness on chromosome 12q24.31 ( LOD = 2.33 at 146 cM ) .
After genotyping 18 additional short-tandem repeat markers on chromosome 12q , there was significant evidence of linkage to airway responsiveness on chromosome 12q24.31 ( LOD = 3.79 at 144 cM) , with a relatively narrow 1.5- LOD unit support interval for the observed linkage peak ( 142-147 cM ) .
Our results suggest that chromosome 12q24.31 contains a locus ( or loci ) that influence a critical intermediate phenotype of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( airway responsiveness ) in Costa Ricans .
Familial occurrence of lumbar <START:PHENOTYPE> spondylolysis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> spondylolisthesis <END> .
In a Finnish kindred consisting of 192 descendants from two marriages of a male ancestor born in 1868 , the lumbar spines of 105 of the 170 living members were X-rayed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spondylolysis <END> was found in 22 individuals .
In addition , six of them had <START:PHENOTYPE> spondylolisthesis <END> , four had <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida occulta <END> , and two had a transitional lumbar/sacral vertebra .
Seven members of the kindred without <START:PHENOTYPE> spondylolysis <END> had <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida occulta <END> and 10 had transitional lumbar vertebrae .
The pedigree is consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> and incomplete ( about 75% ) penetrance for <START:PHENOTYPE> spondylolysis <END> .
It raises the question of a common aetiology for several congenital disturbances in the formation of lumbar vertebrae and possibly supports the concept of variable expressivity of a " <START:PHENOTYPE> spondylolysis <END> gene " .
A syndrome of facial dysmorphia , birth defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> myelodysplasia <END> and immunodeficiency in three sibs of consanguineous parents .
We report on three sibs ( two females , one male ) with a syndrome including physical and mental <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , facial dysmorphia , an <START:PHENOTYPE> increased number of skin folds <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> .
Pulmonary infections were especially severe and frequent , leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Steatorrhea <END> was intermittent .
A sweat test was normal .
Congenital heart defect was present in two sibs and vesico-ureteral reflux was diagnosed in two sibs .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Neutropenia <END> was the most obvious immunological defect .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myelodysplasia <END> was noted .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Acute myeloblastic leukemia <END> developed in one sib .
The healthy parents of the patients are first cousins .
The consanguinity of the parents points-to an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance of this new syndrome but a mitochondrial disorder cannot be excluded .
Familial syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures of the hands <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> genital anomalies <END> .
Two teen-age XY brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> genital abnormalities <END> , and contractures of their hands are described .
They have <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized osteoporosis <END> and a history of frequent fractures .
Their endocrinologic evaluation was normal except for mild glucose intolerance and delayed , but normal puberty .
Although these brothers are similar to individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome , their unusual hand contractures , clinically significant <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> , and lack of hypotonia indicate that they represent a different entity .
A biologic definition of Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> from transcriptional and genomic profiling .
The distinction between Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> and diffuse large-B-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> is unclear .
We used transcriptional and genomic profiling to define Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> more precisely and to distinguish subgroups in other types of mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas .
We performed gene-expression profiling using Affymetrix U133A GeneChips with RNA from 220 mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas , including a core group of 8 Burkitt 's lymphomas that met all World Health Organization ( WHO ) criteria .
A molecular signature for Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> was generated , and chromosomal abnormalities were detected with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and array-based comparative genomic hybridization .
We used the molecular signature for Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> to identify 44 cases : 11 had the morphologic features of diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas , 4 were unclassifiable mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas , and 29 had a classic or atypical Burkitt 's morphologic appearance .
Also , five did not have a detectable IG-myc Burkitt 's translocation , whereas the others contained an IG-myc fusion , mostly in simple karyotypes .
Of the 176 lymphomas without the molecular signature for Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> , 155 were diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas .
Of these 155 cases , 21 percent had a chromosomal breakpoint at the myc locus associated with complex chromosomal changes and an unfavorable clinical course .
Our molecular definition of Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> clarifies and extends the spectrum of the WHO criteria for Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> .
In mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas without a gene signature for Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> , chromosomal breakpoints at the myc locus were associated with an adverse clinical outcome .

Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> : host resistance and second primary tumors .
Data for 26 cases of nonradiogenic osteosarcomas that developed in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> and in their close relatives were collected from the literature and analyzed .
The distribution of unaffected and unilaterally and bilaterally affected cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> agreed with the expectation that risk to <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> did not differ by the phenotypes of the gene carriers .
This finding indicated not only that increased risk to second primary tumors was a pleiotropic effect of the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> gene but also that host resistance to the gene effects was tissue-specific .
The risk of gene carriers to nonradiogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> was estimated at 1.2% , and the relative risk was estimated at 230 . Liability of the gene carriers to <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> could be regarded as a multifactorial threshold character , and heritability was estimated at 71 % . Results of analyses of ages at diagnosis suggested that nonradiogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> developed slightly earlier in carriers of the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> gene than in children not carrying the gene .
These findings are discussed in the light of the host resistance model in which genes involved in tissue resistance must be suppressors to an error in differentiation ( presumably a crucial event in malignant transformation ) and radiogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> in gene carriers is ascribed to the accumulation of induced mutations in that suppressor system .
Additional case of NeuhÃ¤user <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome with congenital hypotonia .
We report on a 3-1/2-year-old Spanish girl with the NeuhÃ¤user <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome .
A review shows that <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and , presumably , hypotonia , are the major manifestations for diagnosis .
The facial appearance of the typical cases is characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , long upper lip , and <START:PHENOTYPE> small mandible <END> .
Inherited multicentric osteolysis with arthritis : a variant resembling Torg syndrome in a Saudi family .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> multicentric osteolytic disorders of childhood-Torg , Winchester , and FranÃ§ois syndromes-predominantly affect the carpal , tarsal , and interphalangeal joints , and their progressive bone loss and crippling arthritic deformities mimic severe juvenile rheumatoid arthritis .
In a consanguineous Saudi Arabian family two affected sibs with facial anomalies and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> displayed a distal arthropathy of the metacarpal , metatarsal , and interphalangeal joints starting in the first few months of life that eventually progressed to the proximal joints and resulted in crippling ankylosis and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized osteopenia <END> .
Facial changes included <START:PHENOTYPE> proptosis <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bulbous nose <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
In addition , they had large , painful fibrocollagenous palmar and plantar pads and mild body <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> .
Affected individuals were of normal intelligence and had normal renal function .
Routine hematologic , chemistry , and rheumatoid studies were within normal limits .
Histologic examination of bone marrow and an interphalangeal joint biopsy were not informative .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> , clinical , and radiologic characteristics of the affected sibs suggested that they had a form of multicentric osteolysis most closely resembling the Torg syndrome , but with a unique facial appearance , fibrocollagenous pads , and body <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> not noted in the original description of the syndrome .

Familial lethal skeletal dysplasia with <START:PHENOTYPE> cloverleaf skull <END> and multiple anomalies of brain , eye , face and heart : a new autosomal recessive multiple congenital anomalies syndrome .
We report on a 'new ' lethal familial short-limb bone dysplasia associated with multiple anomalies in three sibs born to Arabic-Muslim consanguineous healthy parents .
Clinical abnormalities included short limbs and short hands , <START:PHENOTYPE> cloverleaf skull <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , wide anterior fontanel , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , bilateral microphthalmia , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , low-set ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow chest <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> , cardiac <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> ( VSD ) and agenesis of the corpus callosum .
Radiological abnormalities included <START:PHENOTYPE> cloverleaf skull <END> , hypoplastic clavicles and scapulae , thin , wavy cupped ribs , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat vertebral bodies <END> with coronal clefting and several unossified vertebral pedicles and hypo-ossification of the pubic bone .
The main changes noted in the long bones consisted of short-bowed long bones with abnormal metaphyses and unossified epiphyses .
Chondro-osseous morphology documented degenerating chondrocytes with disorganization of the hypertrophied cartilage and short disorganized columns of hypertrophied areas .
An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance seems most likely .
A <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutation as a cause of Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy.
Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> is a maternally inherited disease associated with the late onset of bilateral loss of central vision and cardiac dysrhythmias .
The maternal inheritance is explained by the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> origin of the disease .
Analysis of the sequence of a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA has indicated that a single nucleotide change at position 11778 is associated with this disease .
This mutation converts the 340th amino acid of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 from an arginine to a histidine and eliminates an SfaNI endonuclease restriction site .
A survey of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA of three independent families with this disease ( an American black and two white European families ) and 10 controls confirmed that this SfaNI site is associated with the disease .
A phylogenetic tree for <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA polymorphism and sequence variants from three probands with Leber 's disease and four controls was constructed , and the mutation at position 11778 was found to be associated with two <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA backgrounds--an American black <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA and a European <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA .
Thus , this mutation must have arisen twice independently .
Since the mutation correlated with symptoms of Leber 's disease in both cases , these findings indicate that the mutation is a cause of the disease .
This genetic analysis has identified the specific point mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA that results in Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy.
Heterogeneity for congenital generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> in seventeen patients from Oman .
Seventeen children with congenital generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> or Berardinelli-Seip Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> Lipodystrophy <END> ( BSCL ) from 12 consanguineous sibships were observed in Oman .
All children had widespread absence of adipose tissue from infancy together with apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle hypertrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> .
They did not appear to represent a single homogenous entity , and it was possible to subclassify the cases into two distinct groups .
In the first group of seven cases , the features were similar to other published cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> , raised insulin levels , and <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> .
In this group , there was an association between the degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> and the severity of the disorder .
Molecular analysis of these cases showed homozygosity at the BSCL2 locus on chromosome 11q13 in four of the seven cases .
In the second group of ten cases , there were striking abnormalities in both skeletal and nonskeletal muscle .
Reduced exercise tolerance and percussion myoxedema were observed in skeletal muscle , while infantile hypertrophic <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> , prominent veins ( phlebomegaly) , disturbance of cardiac rhythm , and cardiomyopathy were observed in nonskeletal muscle .
There was evidence against homozygosity in some cases for the known loci for BSCL , and this group may represent a new clinical syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> at a different genetic location .

Chromosome 1p36 deletions : the clinical phenotype and molecular characterization of a common newly delineated syndrome .
Deletions of the distal short arm of chromosome 1 ( 1p36 ) represent a common , newly delineated deletion syndrome , characterized by moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> growth delay <END> , and dysmorphic features .
Previous cytogenetic underascertainment of this chromosomal deletion has made it difficult to characterize the clinical and molecular aspects of the syndrome .
Recent advances in cytogenetic technology , particularly FISH , have greatly improved the ability to identify 1p36 deletions and have allowed a clearer definition of the clinical phenotype and molecular characteristics of this syndrome .
We have identified 14 patients with chromosome 1p36 deletions and have assessed the frequency of each phenotypic feature and clinical manifestation in the 13 patients with pure 1p36 deletions .
The physical extent and parental origin of each deletion were determined by use of FISH probes on cytogenetic preparations and by analysis of polymorphic DNA markers in the patients and their available parents .
Clinical examinations revealed that the most common features and medical problems in patients with this deletion syndrome include <START:PHENOTYPE> large anterior fontanelle <END> (100% ) , motor delay /hypotonia (92%) , moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> (92%) , <START:PHENOTYPE> growth delay <END> ( 85% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> pointed chin <END> (8 0% ) , eye/vision problems ( 75% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( 72%) , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> ( 65% ) , clinodactyly and/or short fifth finger(s ) ( 64% ) , low-set ear(s ) ( 59% ) , ear asymmetry ( 57% ) , hearing deficits ( 56% ) , abusive behavior ( 56% ) , thickened ear helices ( 53% ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> deep-set eyes <END> (5 0% ) .
FISH and DNA polymorphism analysis showed that there is no uniform region of deletion but , rather , a spectrum of different deletion sizes with a common minimal region of deletion overlap.
Loss-of-function mutations in a calcium-channel alpha1-subunit gene in Xp11 .23 cause incomplete <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital stationary night blindness <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital stationary night blindness <END> ( CSNB ) is a recessive non-progressive retinal disorder characterized by night blindness , <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased visual acuity <END> , myopia , nystagmus and strabismus .
Two distinct clinical entities of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> CSNB have been proposed .
Patients with complete CSNB show moderate to <START:PHENOTYPE> severe myopia <END> , undetectable rod function and a normal cone response , whereas patients with incomplete CSNB show moderate myopia to hyperopia and subnormal but measurable rod and cone function .
The electrophysiological and psychophysical features of these clinical entities suggest a defect in retinal neurotransmission .
The apparent clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> CSNB reflects the recently described <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> in which the locus for complete CSNB ( CSNB1 ) was mapped to Xp11 .4 , and the locus for incomplete CSNB ( CSNB2 ) was refined within Xp11 .23 ( ref . 5 ) .
A novel retina-specific gene mapping to the CSNB2 minimal region was characterized and found to have similarity to voltage-gated L-type calcium channel alpha1-subunit genes .
Mutation analysis of this new alpha1-subunit gene , CACNA1F , in 20 families with incomplete CSNB revealed six different mutations that are all predicted to cause premature protein truncation .
These findings establish that loss-of-function mutations in CACNA1F cause incomplete CSNB , making this disorder an example of a human channelopathy of the retina .
Defective protein glycosylation in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndrome .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> is a genetically heterogeneous condition presenting with loose and <START:PHENOTYPE> redundant skin folds <END> , decreased elasticity of the skin , connective tissue involvement and a highly variable spectrum of associated features .
The most common forms are inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> or dominant fashion .
Fibulin 5 and elastin mutations were detected in a limited number of patients , but in most cases the etiology is not known .
Based on a previous observation of an <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal transferrin isoelectric focusing <END> pattern in a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> indicating an N-glycosylation defect , we performed a screening for disorders of protein glycosylation in unrelated children with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndrome , including a recently developed test for defective O-glycosylation .
Here , we describe five patients from consanguineous marriages with a <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndrome with skeletal and joint involvement , developmental delay and neurological findings .
Three of these five children have an inborn error of glycan biosynthesis affecting the synthesis of both N- and O-linked glycans .
Two patients had normal glycosylation patterns .
All known causes of secondary glycosylation disorders were excluded in the children .
No mutations were found in the FBLN5 gene .
In conclusion , we have identified a new combined glycosylation defect with a distinct clinical phenotype .
Our results suggest that a combined defect of glycosylation might be a causative factor in congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> .
This is the first report where abnormal N- and O-linked glycosylation is implicated in the etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and deafness ( DIDMOAD syndrome ) .
A clinical study in two Sudanese families .
Four Sudanese children with DIDMOAD syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and deafness ) are reported .
They were two boys ( aged 15 and 16 years ) in one family and a boy and a girl ( aged 16 and 6 years , respectively ) in another family .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Diabetes mellitus <END> was first to appear ( at 3-8 years ) followed by deafness and visual failure ; and the disease ended fatally in one patient ( aged 20 years ) .
In the other three , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> was confirmed using water deprivation test for 8 hours .
The maximum urine osmolality ranged between 131-523 mOsm/kg , whereas the corresponding plasma osmolality ranged between 315-332 mOsm/kg .
Slight further improvement in urine concentration was observed in 2 of the patients following the use of desmopressin ( DDAVP , 20 micrograms intranasally ) .
Intravenous pyelography , voiding cystourethrography and ultrasound revealed severe bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> , dilated ureters and distended bladder without vesicoureteral reflux in the three patients .
With the high rate of consanguinity prevalent in North Africa and the Middle East , we recommend examining children who present with <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> in this region for features of DIDMOAD syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial inheritance <END> in a mitochondrially mediated disease .
Mendelian inheritance involves the transmission to successive generations of DNA contained in genes in the nucleus , but DNA is also contained in mitochondria , where it is believed to be responsible for the encoding of certain <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> enzymes .
Since nearly all <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA is maternally transmitted , one might expect a nonmendelian pattern of inheritance in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> cytopathy , a syndrome in which there are abnormalities in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> structure and deficiencies in a variety of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> enzymes .
We studied the pedigrees of 6 affected families whose members we had examined personally and of 24 families described in the literature .
In 27 families , exclusively maternal transmission occurred ; in 3 there was also paternal transmission in one generation .
Altogether , 51 mothers but only 3 fathers had transmitted the condition .
These results are consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> cytopathy ; the inheritance and enzyme defects of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> cytopathy can be considered in the light of recent evidence that subunits of respiratory-enzyme complexes are encoded solely by <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA .
The occasional paternal transmission may be explained if certain enzyme subunits that are encoded by nuclear DNA are affected .
Craniofacioskeletal syndrome : an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> disorder with early lethality in males .
A syndrome with multisystem manifestations has been observed in three generations of a Caucasian family .
The findings in seven females provide a composite clinical picture of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , small retroverted ears , full tip of the nose overhanging the columella , <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thin upper lip <END> , soft tissue excrescences at the angle of the mouth , <START:PHENOTYPE> small mandible <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small hands <END> and feet with brachydactyly , finger V clinodactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat feet <END> , an excessive number of fingerprint arches , and mild impairment of cognitive function .
Two males were more severely affected and died in the initial months of life .
They showed <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , broad cranium with wide sutures and fontanelles , cardiac defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> small hands <END> and feet with abnormal digital creases and small nails , and genital abnormalities .
The affected males had low serum calcium in the neonatal period .
Serum calcium , phosphorous , and parathormone levels in the females were normal .
Radiographs showed cortical thickening of the long bones , underdevelopment of the frontal sinuses , narrow pelvis and hypoplasia of the middle phalanx of finger five .
MRI of the brain showed slightly reduced brain volumes and an extra gyrus of the superior temporal region .
X-inactivation studies showed near complete skewing in two affected females , but were not informative in three others .
X-linkage as the mode of inheritance is proposed on the basis of different severity in males/females , complete skewing of X-inactivation in informative females , and a lod score ( 1.5 ) suggestive of linkage to markers in Xq26-q27.

Opitz <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> syndrome .
We report on a patient with Opitz <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> syndrome .
The girl was the first-born child of consanguineous parents and had <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> , apparent hypertelorism , <START:PHENOTYPE> upslanted palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small nose <END> with broad root , abnormally modeled ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> loose skin <END> , polysyndactyly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent clitoris <END> and labia majora .
In addition , a complex cardiovascular defect ( Eisenmenger disease ) was observed .
The patient was mentally retarded .
New X-linked syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> is linked to DXS255 .
We describe 14 males from 3 successive generations in a family who have X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR) , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> speech difficulties <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> emotional lability <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tapering fingers <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> small feet <END> .
Linkage analysis using markers spread along the X chromosome demonstrated a gene localisation close to the centromere .
Maximum lod scores for markers near the centromere , all at theta = 0.00 , were 1.36 for DXS72 , and 1.46 for DXYS1 .
The closest flanking markers which showed recombination were DXS84 and DXS94 , defining the physical localisation within Xp21.1-q22 .
DXS255 was fully informative with lod-1 confidence interval for theta of 0.00-0.12 .
Clinical findings and linkage data in this family distinguish it from the BÃ¶rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome and other previously described XLMR syndromes .
Distinct patterns of respiratory difficulty in young children with achondroplasia : a clinical , sleep , and lung function study .
Achondroplasia can result in respiratory difficulty in early infancy .
The aim of this study was to document lung growth during infancy , together with the cause of any cardiorespiratory and sleep dysfunction .
Seventeen prospectively ascertained infants ( 14 boys and three girls ) with respiratory symptoms starting before 1 year of age underwent clinical , sleep , and lung function studies .
Three distinct groups were identified .
Group 1 ( n = 6 ) were the least symptomatic and only had obstructive sleep <START:PHENOTYPE> apnoea <END> .
Group 2 ( n = 6 ) had obstructive sleep <START:PHENOTYPE> apnoea <END> of muscular aetiology and , neurologically , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> small foramen magnum <END> were common .
Group 3 ( n = 5 ) , the most severely affected group , all developed cor pulmonale , with three deaths occurring as a result of terminal cardiorespiratory failure .
All five had obstructive sleep <START:PHENOTYPE> apnoea <END> with a muscular aetiology ( a <START:PHENOTYPE> small foramen magnum <END> predominated ) with severe or moderately severe gastro-oesophageal reflux .
Initially , lung function studies found no evidence of restriction or reduced lung volumes standardised according to weight .
However , with growth these infants had worsening function , with raised airway resistance and severe reductions in respiratory compliance .
These groups appear to be distinct phenotypes with distinct anatomical aetiologies : " relative " adenotonsillar hypertrophy , resulting from a degree of midfacial hypoplasia ( group 1 ) ; muscular <START:PHENOTYPE> upper airway obstruction <END> along with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , resulting from jugular foramen stenosis ( group 2 ) ; and muscular <START:PHENOTYPE> upper airway obstruction <END> , but without <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , resulting from hypoglossal canal stenosis with or without foramen magnum compression and no jugular foramen stenosis ( group 3 ) .
The aetiology of these abnormalities is consistent with localised alteration of chondrocranial development : rostral , intermediary and caudal in groups 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .
Cohen syndrome in the Ohio Amish .
We describe eight members from two large Amish kindreds who share a phenotype characterized by early-onset pigmentary retinopathy and <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , global developmental delay and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hyperextensibility <END> , small hands and feet , common facial appearance , and friendly disposition .
Several of the children had intermittent granulocytopenia .
The phenotypic occurrence in three siblings coupled with the increased coefficient of inbreeding in the Amish suggested that this disorder is <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> and due to a single founder allele .
Despite similarity to the clinical features of Cohen syndrome , experienced dysmorphologists attending the 23rd David W . Smith Workshop suggested the facial gestalt of the Amish children was inconsistent with this diagnosis .
We mapped the locus responsible for these individuals ' phenotype to chromosome 8q22-q23 , which contains the recently discovered Cohen syndrome gene , COH1 .
Complete sequencing of the COH1 gene identified a likely disease-causing frameshift mutation and a missense mutation in the Amish patients .
A comparison of features among different Cohen syndrome populations with shared linkage to the COH1 locus or known COH1 gene mutations may allow for the determination of improved clinical criteria on which to suspect the diagnosis of Cohen syndrome .
We conclude that facial gestalt seems to be an unreliable indicator of Cohen syndrome between ethnic populations , although it is quite consistent among affected individuals within a particular ethnic group .
Other features common to almost all individuals with proven COH1 mutations , such as retinal dystrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , global developmental delay , hypotonia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hyperextensibility <END> appear to be better clinical indicators of this disorder .

Localization of a novel locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , PARK6 , on human chromosome 1p35-p36 .
The cause of Parkinson disease ( PD ) is still unknown , but genetic factors have recently been implicated in the etiology of the disease .
So far , four loci responsible for autosomal dominant PD have been identified .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> ( ARJP ) is a clinically and genetically distinct entity ; typical PD features are associated with early onset , sustained response to levodopa , and early occurrence of levodopa-induced dyskinesias , which are often severe .
To date , only one ARJP gene , Parkin , has been identified , and multiple mutations have been detected both in families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and in sporadic cases .
The Parkin-associated phenotype is broad , and some cases are indistinguishable from idiopathic PD .
In > or = 5 0 % of families with ARJP that have been analyzed , no mutations could be detected in the Parkin gene .
We identified a large Sicilian family with four definitely affected members ( the Marsala kindred ) .
The phenotype was characterized by early-onset ( range 32-48 years ) <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , with <START:PHENOTYPE> slow progression <END> and sustained response to levodopa .
Linkage of the disease to the Parkin gene was excluded .
A genomewide homozygosity screen was performed in the family .
Linkage analysis and haplotype construction allowed identification of a single region of homozygosity shared by all the affected members , spanning 12 .5 cM on the short arm of chromosome 1 . This region contains a novel locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , PARK6 .
A maximum LOD score 4.01 at recombination fraction .00 was obtained for marker D1S199 .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> associated with cone dysfunction .
Bornholm eye disease ( BED ) consists of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> , high cylinder , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic nerve hypoplasia <END> , reduced electroretinographic flicker with abnormal photopic responses , and <START:PHENOTYPE> deuteranopia <END> .
The disease maps to chromosome Xq28 and is the first designated high-grade myopia locus ( MYP1 ) .
We studied a second family from Minnesota with a similar X-linked phenotype , also of Danish descent .
All affected males had <START:PHENOTYPE> protanopia <END> instead of <START:PHENOTYPE> deuteranopia <END> .
X chromosome genotyping , fine-point mapping , and haplotype analysis of the DNA from 22 Minnesota family individuals ( 8 affected males and 5 carrier females ) and 6 members of the original family with BED were performed .
Haplotype comparisons and mutation screening of the red-green cone pigment gene array were performed on DNA from both kindreds .
Significant maximum logarithm of odds scores of 3.38 and 3.11 at theta = 0.0 were obtained with polymorphic microsatellite markers DXS8106 and DXYS154 , respectively , in the Minnesota family .
Haplotype analysis defined an interval of 34.4 cM at chromosome Xq27.3-Xq28 .
Affected males had a red-green pigment hybrid gene consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> protanopia <END> .
We genotyped Xq27-28 polymorphic markers of the family with BED , and narrowed the critical interval to 6.8 cM .
The haplotypes of the affected individuals were different from those of the Minnesota pedigree .
Bornholm eye disease-affected individuals showed the presence of a green-red hybrid gene consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> deuteranopia <END> .
Because of the close geographic origin of the 2 families , we expected affected individuals to have the same haplotype in the vicinity of the same mutation .
Mapping studies , however , suggested independent mutations of the same gene .
The red-green and green-red hybrid genes are common X-linked color vision defects , and thus are unrelated to the <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> and other eye abnormalities in these 2 families .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> with possible cone dysfunction has been mapped to chromosome Xq28 with intervals of 34.4 and 6.8 centimorgan for 2 families of Danish origin .
Genetic diagnosis of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> in a South European outbreed population : influence of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor gene mutations on treatment response to simvastatin in total , LDL , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol .
The aims of this study were to examine the presence of mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene among subjects clinically diagnosed with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> and to analyze whether the molecular diagnosis helps to predict the response to simvastatin treatment in our familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> population .
Fifty-five probands and 128 related subjects with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> were studied .
Genetic diagnosis was carried out following a three-step protocol based on Southern blot and PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis .
A randomized clinical trial with simvastatin was conducted in 42 genetically diagnosed subjects with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> classified as carriers of null mutations ( n = 22 ) and of defective mutations ( n = 20) .
A mutation-causing familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> was identified in 46 probands ( 84% ) .
In 41 of them ( 89% ) , a total of 28 point mutations were detected , 13 of which have not been previously described .
The remaining five probands ( 11% ) were carriers of large rearrangements .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> with null mutations showed a poor response to simvastatin treatment .
The mean percentage reduction of plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in these subjects were significantly lower ( 24.8 +/- 10.3 vs . 34.8 +/- 10 .9 , P = 0.04 and 30.0 +/- 39.8 vs . 46 .1 +/- 18 .2 , P = 0.02 , respectively ) than in subjects with defective mutations .
Baseline and posttreatment high-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma values were significantly lower in subjects with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> with null mutations ( P < 0.001 ) .
In an outbreed Caucasian population , a three-step protocol for genetic screening detected a mutation in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene in a high percentage ( 84% ) of subjects with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> .
Subjects with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> with null mutations ( class I ) showed lower plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values and a poor low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to simvastatin treatment .
Mutation of solute carrier SLC16A12 associates with a syndrome combining juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> .
Unobstructed vision requires a particular refractive index of the lens , a measure based on the organization of the structural proteins within the differentiated lens cells .
To ensure an intact lens structure , homeostasis within the lens cells is indispensable .
Alterations of the lens structure result in opacity and lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> .
Renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> is defined by elevated glucose level in the urine without hyperglycemia and without evidence of morphological renal anomalies .
In a Swiss family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , and renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> , we have identified a nonsense mutation in a member of the carboxylic acid transporter family SLC16 .
The underlying gene defect in SLC16A12 resides within a 3 cM region on chromosome 10q23.13 defined by linkage mapping of this phenotype .
We found tissue-specific variability of SLC16A12 transcript levels in control samples , with high expression in the eye and kidney , the two organs affected by this syndrome .
This report demonstrates biological relevance of this solute carrier .
We hypothesize that SLC16A12 is important for lens and kidney homeostasis and discuss its potential role in age-related <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> .
Male <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in Cowden syndrome patients with germline PTEN mutations .
Cowden syndrome ( CS ) ( OMIM 158350 ) is a multiple hamartoma syndrome associated with germline mutations in the PTEN tumour suppressor gene .
While CS is characterised most commonly by non-cancerous lesions ( mucocutaneous trichilemmomas , acral and <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoses <END> , and papillomatous papules) , it is also associated with an increased susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> ( in females ) and thyroid cancer , as well as non-cancerous conditions of the breast and thyroid .
Here we report two cases of male <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> occurring in patients with classical CS phenotypes and germline PTEN mutations .
The first subject was diagnosed with CS indicated primarily by mucocutaneous papillomatosis , facial trichilemmomas , and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> with frontal bossing at the age of 31 years .
He developed <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> at 41 years and subsequently died of the disease .
A PTEN mutation , c.802delG , was identified in this subject , yet none of his family members showed evidence of a CS phenotype , suggesting that this PTEN mutation may be a de novo occurrence .
The second subject had a CS phenotype including multiple trichilemmomas and <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid adenoma <END> , developed male <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> at 43 years , and died of the disease at 57 years .
He was a carrier of a PTEN mutation c.347-351delACAAT that cosegregated with the CS phenotype in affected family members .
These two cases of male <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> associated with germline PTEN mutations and the CS phenotype suggest that CS may be associated with an increased risk of early onset male as well as female <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Missense mutations in the rod domain of the lamin A/ C gene as causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and conduction-system disease .
Inherited mutations cause approximately 35 percent of cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ; however , few genes associated with this disease have been identified .
Previously , we located a gene defect that was responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and conduction-system disease on chromosome 1p1-q21 , where nuclear-envelope proteins lamin A and lamin C are encoded by the LMNA ( lamin A/C ) gene .
Mutations in the head or tail domain of this gene cause Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy , a childhood-onset disease characterized by joint contractures and in some cases by abnormalities of cardiac conduction during adulthood .
We evaluated 11 families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and conduction-system disease .
Sequences of the lamin A/ C exons were determined in probands from each family , and variants were confirmed by restriction-enzyme digestion .
The genotypes of the family members were ascertained .
Five novel missense mutations were identified : four in the alpha-helical-rod domain of the lamin A/ C gene , and one in the lamin C tail domain .
Each mutation caused heritable , progressive conduction-system disease (sinus bradycardia , atrioventricular conduction block , or atrial arrhythmias ) and dilated cardiomyopathy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Heart failure <END> and sudden death occurred frequently within these families .
No family members with mutations had either joint contractures or skeletal myopathy.
Serum creatine kinase levels were normal in family members with mutations of the lamin rod but mildly elevated in some family members with a defect in the tail domain of lamin C . Genetic defects in distinct domains of the nuclear-envelope proteins lamin A and lamin C selectively cause <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> with conduction-system disease or <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.
Missense mutations in the rod domain of the lamin A/ C gene provide a genetic cause for <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and indicate that this intermediate filament protein has an important role in cardiac conduction and contractility .
The FG syndrome : report of a large Italian series .
Initially described as a rare MCA/MR syndrome occurring only in boys , due to a recessive mutation on the X chromosome [ Opitz and Kaveggia , 1974 ] , the FG syndrome ( FGS ) now emerges as a more common disorder also occurring in girls .
Based on over 50 reported cases , FGS is associated with developmental delay ( especially speech ) , hypotonia , postnatal onset relative macrocephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , frontal hair upsweep , telecanthus , or <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> , thin vermilion border of the upper lip , relatively short fingers with <START:PHENOTYPE> broad thumbs <END> and halluces , <START:PHENOTYPE> persistent fetal fingertip pads <END> , anal anomalies , and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> .
Major malformations are rare , and include <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> , anal agenesis , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , and congenital heart defects .
Abnormal EEGs and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> have been reported in almost 70 % of patients .
Brain MRI shows corpus callosum abnormalities associated with dilatation of lateral ventricles and , less frequently , periventricular nodular <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopias <END> , mild cerebellar defects , and reduced periventricular white matter .
Chiari 1 malformation seems to be frequent .
The behavior phenotype appears to be characterized by ADHD , and relatively less developed language , fine motor and executive function skills ; whereas visual-spatial abilities seem to be a relative strength .
Five candidate loci are already known but no gene identified .
We describe 25 patients referred to the Stella Maris Institute for evaluation of DD/MR , and diagnosed as FGS .
They were between 2 and 15 1/2 years at the first observation .
High resolution banding , FRAXA/FRAXE DNA analysis , and subtelomere FISH analysis were performed in all of them , and all had normal results .
Thirteen patients were followed-up from 6 months to 9 years .
Our report focuses on physical , neurological , developmental findings , and natural history of FGS . Experience with our series of patients suggests that the syndrome may be common , and should be routinely considered in the evaluation of children and adolescents with DD/MR .
Genetic study of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> : association of uveal and cutaneous melanoma with cutaneous and ocular nevi .
To evaluate a kindred with familial uveal and cutaneous melanoma and to identify potential genetic and environmental factors that may predispose individuals to develop <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
Family-based case report with detailed clinical and genetic evaluation .
Ten siblings in a single nuclear family .
Evaluation of a large sibship via family history , complete eye and skin examinations , environmental risk factor questionnaire , and genetic testing , as well as a MEDLINE search of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> kindreds .
Cutaneous and ocular nevi , benign and malignant neoplasms of skin and other sites , brief skin cancer risk assessment tool risk classification for cutaneous melanoma , DNA sequencing of p16INK4a and p14ARF genes , and citations on familial <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
The proband and his mother had <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> , 3 cutaneous melanomas occurred among 2 siblings , and 2 other siblings had basal cell carcinomas .
No germline mutations were detected in the melanoma-associated tumor suppressor genes p16INK4a and p14ARF .
Seven out of 10 siblings had a history of cutaneous and/or ocular nevi .
Of the 3 subjects without nevi , 2 had histories of eye or skin malignancies ( 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> , 1 basal cell carcinoma ) .
Three of the 10 siblings had relevant ocular findings ( 2 choroidal nevi , 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> ) .
Six were also found to be in the "high-risk " classification for cutaneous malignancies based on scores from a previously validated risk assessment tool .
This family , combined with the 91 previously reported familial <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> kindreds , brings to 92 the total number thus far recorded .
Our results strengthen the association between <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> , atypical nevi , and cutaneous melanoma .
This relationship supports the recommendation that individuals with a personal or family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> , particularly in combination with atypical nevi , should be regularly screened for uveal and cutaneous melanoma .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cloacal exstrophy <END> : an epidemiologic study from the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cloacal exstrophy <END> presents as a complex abdominal wall defect thought to result from a mesodermal abnormality .
Anatomically , its main components are <START:PHENOTYPE> Omphalocele <END> , bladder <START:PHENOTYPE> Exstrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Imperforate anus <END> . Other associated malformations include renal malformations and Spine defects ( OEIS complex ) .
Historically , the prevalence ranges from 1 in 200,000 to 400,000 births , with higher rates in females .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cloacal exstrophy <END> is likely etiologically heterogeneous as suggested by its recurrence in families and occurrence in monozygotic twins .
The defect has been described in infants with limb-body wall , with trisomy 18 , and in one pregnancy exposed to Dilantin and diazepam .
Due to its rarity , the use of a nonspecific diagnostic code for case identification , and lack of validation of the clinical findings , <START:PHENOTYPE> cloacal exstrophy <END> remains an epidemiologic challenge .
The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence , associated anomalies and maternal characteristics among infants born with cloacal exstrophy.
We used data from the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research submitted from 18 birth defect surveillance programs representing 24 countries .
Cases were clinically evaluated locally and reviewed centrally by two authors .
Cases of persistent cloaca were excluded .
A total of 186 cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> cloacal exstrophy <END> were identified .
Overall prevalence was 1 in 131 ,579 births : ranging from 1 in 44 ,444 births in Wales to 1 in 269 ,464 births in South America . Live birth prevalence was 1 in 184 ,195 births .
Prevalence ratios did not vary by maternal age .
Forty-two ( 22.6% ) cases met the criteria for the OEIS complex , whereas 60 (32.3% ) were classified as OEI and 18 ( 9.7% ) as EIS ( one with suspected VATER ( 0.5% ) ) . Other findings included two cases with trisomy 13 ( one without a karyotype confirmation ) , one with mosaic trisomy 12 ( 0.5% ) , one with mosaic 45 , X ( 0.5% ) and one classified as having amnion band sequence ( 0.5% ) .
Twenty-seven ( 14.5% ) infants had other anomalies unrelated to cloacal exstrophy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cloacal exstrophy <END> is a rare anomaly with variability in prevalence by geographic location .
The proportion of cases classified as OEIS complex was lower in this study than previously reported .
Among all cases , 54 .8 % were reported to have an <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> .

Mutations of ARX are associated with striking pleiotropy and consistent genotype-phenotype correlation .
We recently identified mutations of ARX in nine genotypic males with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with abnormal genitalia ( XLAG ) , and in several female relatives with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ( ACC ) .
We now report 13 novel and two recurrent mutations of ARX , and one nucleotide change of uncertain significance in 20 genotypic males from 16 families .
Most had XLAG , but two had hydranencephaly and abnormal genitalia , and three males from one family had Proud syndrome or ACC with abnormal genitalia .
We obtained detailed clinical information on all 29 affected males , including the nine previously reported subjects .
Premature termination mutations consisting of large deletions , frameshifts , nonsense mutations , and splice site mutations in exons 1 to 4 caused XLAG or hydranencephaly with abnormal genitalia .
Nonconservative missense mutations within the homeobox caused less severe XLAG , while conservative substitution in the homeodomain caused Proud syndrome .
A nonconservative missense mutation near the C-terminal aristaless domain caused unusually severe XLAG with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and mild cerebellar hypoplasia .
In addition , several less severe phenotypes without malformations have been reported , including <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with cryptogenic infantile spasms ( West syndrome ) , other <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> types , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> or autism , and nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The ARX mutations associated with these phenotypes have included polyalanine expansions or duplications , missense mutations , and one deletion of exon 5 . Together , the group of phenotypes associated with ARX mutations demonstrates remarkable pleiotropy , but also comprises a nearly continuous series of developmental disorders that begins with hydranencephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , and ends with a series of overlapping syndromes with apparently normal brain structure .

Clinical spectrum of CADASIL : a study of 7 families .
Cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.
Cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> ( CADASIL ) is an inherited arterial disease of the brain recently mapped to chromosome 19 .
We studied 148 subjects belonging to seven families by magnetic resonance imaging and genetic linkage analysis . 45 family members ( 23 males and 22 females ) were clinically affected .
Frequent signs were recurrent subcortical ischaemic events ( 84% ) , progressive or stepwise <START:PHENOTYPE> subcortical dementia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudobulbar palsy <END> ( 31% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> with aura ( 22%) , and mood disorders with severe depressive episodes (20% ) .
All symptomatic subjects had prominent signal abnormalities on MRI with hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images in the subcortical white-matter and basal ganglia which were also present in 19 asymptomatic subjects .
The age at onset of symptoms was mean 45 ( SD [1 0-6] ) years , with attacks of <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> with aura occurring earlier in life ( 38 .1 [8.03 ] years ) than ischaemic events ( 49.3 [1 0.7 ] years ) .
The mean age at death was 64.5 (1 0.6 ) years .
On the basis of MRI data , the penetrance of the disease appears complete between 30 and 40 years of age .
Genetic analysis showed strong linkage to the CADASIL locus for all seven families , suggesting genetic homogeneity .
CADASIL is a hereditary cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> with aura , mood disorders and dementia .
The diagnosis should be considered not only in patients with recurrent small subcortical infarcts leading to dementia , but also in patients with transient ischaemic attacks , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> with aura or severe mood disturbances , whenever MRI reveals prominent signal abnormalities in the subcortical white-matter and basal ganglia .
Clinical and MRI investigations of family members are then crucial for the diagnosis which can be confirmed by genetic linkage analysis .
The disease is probably largely undiagnosed .
Maternally inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> and myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
A family is described with familial myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy.
The disorder follows a maternal inheritance pattern consistent with a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( mtDNA ) mutation .
The large kindred permitted exclusion of autosomal dominant , recessive , and X-linked patterns of transmission .
Several characteristics of the inheritance and variability of expression within the pedigree are consistent with recently acquired knowledge about the genetics of human mtDNA .
The clinical spectrum of disease is compatible with a proportionality model of mutant and wild-type mtDNAs .
Muscle biopsies of affected patients showed an increased number of abnormal muscle mitochondria .
Serum levels of pyruvate or pyruvate and lactate were elevated .
The most severely affected patient had constant myoclonic jerking , dementia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , hearing loss , and hypoventilation .
Cerebral dysfunction in patients with mild involvement was marked by prominent photic driving seen on electroencephalograms and high-amplitude visual and somatosensory evoked responses but no <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , or dementia .
The individual clinical features of the disease worsen over time for all patients ; however , mildly affected patients have not become moderately affected and moderately affected patients have not become severely affected .
Identification and characterization of an Xq26-q27 duplication in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> panhypopituitarism <END> suggests the involvement of two distinct genes .
We investigated a family with a duplication , dup(X )q26-q27 , that was present in two brothers , their mother , and their maternal grandmother .
The brothers carrying the duplication displayed <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> panhypopituitarism <END> , whereas a third healthy brother inherited the normal X chromosome .
Preferential inactivation of the X chromosome containing the duplication was evident in healthy carrier females .
We determined the boundaries of the Xq26-q27 duplication .
Via interphase FISH analysis we narrowed down each of the two breakpoint regions to approximately 300-kb intervals .
The proximal breakpoint is located in Xq26.1 between DXS1114 and HPRT and is contained in YAC yWXD599 , while the distal breakpoint is located in Xq27.3 between DXS369 and DXS1200 and contained in YAC yWXD75 8 .
The duplication comprises about 13 Mb .
Evidence from the literature points to a predisposing gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida <END> in Xq27.
We hypothesize that the <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida <END> in the two brothers may be due to interruption of a critical gene in the Xq27 breakpoint region .
Several candidate genes were mapped to the Xq27 critical region but none was shown to be disrupted by the duplication event .
Recently , M . LagerstrÃ¶m-FermÃ©r et al . ( 1997 , Am . J . Hum . Genet . 60 , 91 0-916 ) reported on a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> panhypopituitarism <END> associated with a duplication in Xq26 ; however , no details were reported on the extent of the duplication .
Our study corroborates their hypothesis that <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> panhypopituitarism <END> is likely to be caused by a gene encoding a dosage-sensitive protein involved in pituitary development .
We place the putative gene between DXS1114 and DXS1200 , corresponding to the interval defined by the duplication in the present family .

Familial absorptive hypercalciuria and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> .
Hypercalciuria was considered as a secondary condition when associated with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> .
Later studies suggested that hypercalciuria could lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> .
Selected members of a family spanning five generations were studied .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Renal tubular acidosis <END> was present in eight subjects in three consecutive generations .
Increased 24-hour urinary calcium excretion was present in nine subjects in three consecutive generations , alone in the younger generation , and in combination with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> in the older generation .
Calcium loading tests showed the absorptive nature of hypercalciuria in nine of 18 subjects studied .
This report suggests that in this family the absorptive hypercalciuria is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> genetic defect with complete penetrance and variable expressivity which leads to <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> .
Prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> in an urban population in the United States : impact of ethnicity .
Despite the increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease ( NAFLD) , its pathogenesis and clinical significance remain poorly defined .
In this study , we examined and compared the distribution of hepatic triglyceride content ( HTGC ) in 2,287 subjects from a multiethnic , population-based sample (32 .1 % white , 48 .3% black , and 17.5 % Hispanic ) using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy .
HTGC varied over a wide range ( 0.0%-41 .7% ; median , 3.6% ) in the population .
Almost one third of the population had <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> , and most subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> had normal levels of serum alanine aminotransferase ( 79% ) .
The frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> varied significantly with ethnicity ( 45 % in Hispanics ; 33% in whites ; 24% in blacks ) and sex ( 42 % in white men ; 24% in white women ) .
The higher prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> in Hispanics was due to the higher prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance in this ethnic group .
However , the lower frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> in blacks was not explained by ethnic differences in body mass index , insulin resistance , ethanol ingestion , or medication use .
The prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> was greater in men than women among whites , but not in blacks or Hispanics .
The ethnic differences in the frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> in this study mirror those observed previously for NAFLD-related cirrhosis ( Hispanics > whites > blacks ) .
In conclusion , the significant ethnic and sex differences in the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> documented in this study may have a profound impact on susceptibility to steatosis-related liver disease .
Manifestations in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> bone fragility and limb-girdle myopathy.
We report on an unusual family with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> limb-girdle type of <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> and bone fragility .
This family was previously reported by Henry et al . [ 1958 ] as <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> progressive limb girdle " muscular dystrophy " with propensity to fractures and defective healing of long bones .
Clinical , biochemical , and radiological aspects were evaluated in eight living relatives in this family ( three males and five females ) and in eight deceased individuals .
The average age-of-onset of the limb-girdle <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> was 31 years occurring in 87 % of affected individuals .
The average age of onset of fractures was 24 years occurring in 88 % of affected individuals .
Biochemical analysis showed a mean alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) of 64 U/L ( normal 30-120) and borderline high creatine kinase ( CK ) of 213 U/L ( normal 4-220) .
Radiographs revealed coarse trabeculation , patchy sclerosis , cortical thickening , and narrowing of the medullary cavity with an appearance not considered typical of Paget disease of bone ( PDB ) or of fibrous dysplasia .
Results of nerve conduction studies were normal , and electromyograms and muscle biopsies documented non-specific <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathic changes <END> .
There is <START:PHENOTYPE> premature graying <END> with thin hair , <START:PHENOTYPE> thin skin <END> , hernias and the affected individuals appear older than their chronological age , and three members had a clotting disorder .
Linkage analysis for markers for the chromosome 9p22.3-q12 locus indicated that the disorder in this family does not segregate with markers in the critical region of limb-girdle/inclusion body <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , PDB , and frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) [ IBMPFD , OMIM #605382 ] .
Sequencing of Valosin-containing protein ( VCP) , the gene associated with IBMPFD , did not identify mutations .
We have excluded linkage to the known loci for limb-girdle type of <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> and bone disease and excluded several candidate genes .
Elucidation of the novel molecular basis of this disorder may provide valuable links between bone , collagen and muscle , and targeted therapeutic options .

New findings in short rib syndrome .
This white infant , born at 37 weeks of gestation , had a large cranium , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> , a midline cleft lip and palate , hypoplastic chest with <START:PHENOTYPE> short ribs <END> , slightly protuberant abdomen , short limbs , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> single transverse palmar creases <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> single umbilical artery <END> , normal female external genitalia , normal ( 46 XY ) chromosomes , and radiographic findings suggesting a short-rib ( polydactyly ) syndrome type IV ( Beemer-Langer ) .
Autopsy showed <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> renal cystic dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> intrahepatic bile duct cysts <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> periportal fibrosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cysts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> absent internal genitalia <END> , an atrophic optic chiasm , absent optic nerves , a single left anterior cerebral artery , polymicrogyria , and fusion of the frontal lobes , preoptic region , mammillary bodies , and thalami .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> Peters anomaly <END> , typical facial appearance , failure to thrive , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , and other anomalies : further delineation of the Krause-Kivlin syndrome .
Two cousins and an unrelated patient , all offspring of consanguineous parents , presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> Peters anomaly <END> , unusual facial appearance , disproportionate <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , retarded skeletal maturation , and a variable degree of mental retardation .
Variable digital , cardiac , CNS , and urogenital anomalies were present .
The inheritance is probably <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
The condition is a distinct clinical entity for which we suggest the eponym Krause-Kivlin syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Peters anomaly <END> is thought to result from abnormal migration of neural crest cells .
A similar mechanism was implicated in the pathogenesis of other disorders of the anterior chamber .
The presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> Peters anomaly <END> , and possibly of other corneal endothelial disorders in a newborn infant , should alert the clinician to the possibility of this syndrome .
Communicating <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( or brain atrophy ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> were documented in two patients , potentially allowing prenatal diagnosis in secondary familial cases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Chiari I malformation <END> redefined : clinical and radiographic findings for 364 symptomatic patients .
Chiari malformations are regarded as a pathological continuum of hindbrain maldevelopments characterized by downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> Chiari I malformation <END> ( CMI ) is defined as tonsillar herniation of at least 3 to 5 mm below the foramen magnum .
Increased detection of CMI has emphasized the need for more information regarding the clinical features of the disorder .
We examined a prospective cohort of 364 symptomatic patients .
All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spine , and some were evaluated using CINE-magnetic resonance imaging and other neurodiagnostic tests .
For 50 patients and 50 age - and gender-matched control subjects , the volume of the posterior cranial fossa was calculated by the Cavalieri method .
The families of 21 patients participated in a study of familial aggregation .
There were 275 female and 89 male patients .
The age of onset was 24.9+ /-15 .8 years ( mean +/- standard deviation ) , and 89 patients ( 24% ) cited trauma as the precipitating event .
Common associated problems included <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> ( 65% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ( 42%) , and basilar invagination ( 12% ) .
Forty-three patients ( 12% ) reported positive family histories of CMI or <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> .
Pedigrees for 21 families showed patterns consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> or recessive inheritance .
The clinical syndrome of CMI was found to consist of the following : 1 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> headaches <END> , 2 ) pseudotumor-like episodes , 3 ) a Meniere 's disease-like syndrome , 4 ) lower cranial nerve signs , and 5 ) spinal cord disturbances in the absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> .
The most consistent magnetic resonance imaging findings were obliteration of the retrocerebellar cerebrospinal fluid spaces ( 364 patients) , tonsillar herniation of at least 5 mm ( 332 patients) , and varying degrees of cranial base dysplasia .
Volumetric calculations for the posterior cranial fossa revealed a significant reduction of total volume ( mean , 13.4 ml ) and a 40% reduction of cerebrospinal fluid volume ( mean , 10.8 ml) , with normal brain volume .
These data support accumulating evidence that CMI is a disorder of the para-axial mesoderm that is characterized by underdevelopment of the posterior cranial fossa and overcrowding of the normally developed hindbrain .
Tonsillar herniation of less than 5 mm does not exclude the diagnosis .
Clinical manifestations of CMI seem to be related to cerebrospinal fluid disturbances ( which are responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> headaches <END> , pseudotumor-like episodes , endolymphatic hydrops , <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> , and hydrocephalus ) and direct compression of nervous tissue .
The demonstration of familial aggregation suggests a genetic component of transmission .
Male with type II <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> .
A 5-year-old boy , who had pre- and postnatal growth retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed motor development <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , delayed closure of large fontanels , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hip dislocation <END> and characteristic facies , is described .
Disorders with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> are now divided into five types .
The patient had clinical manifestations very similar to those of <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> with bone dystrophy ( type II <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> ) .
Eighteen patients have been reported , the ratio of males to females being 5 to 14 . This is the fifth case of this disorder occurring in a male , which provides further evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Perlman syndrome : four additional cases and review .
Perlman syndrome was first described in 1973 and comprises nephromegaly with renal dysplasia and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrosomia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and multiple facial anomalies .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Polyhydramnios <END> and hypoglycaemia are often found .
Twelve children have been described from six different families .
Five came from one family whose Yemenite Jewish parents were second cousins .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> has been suggested .
Prognosis is severe with neonatal death in most children .
We report on 4 new cases of Perlman syndrome from 3 families ; all parents were non-consanguineous .
Some of the observed manifestations have been described only once in this syndrome ( cardiac defect , hepatic fibrosis with portoportal bridging , haemangioma ) or never before ( <START:PHENOTYPE> volvulus <END> , intestinal atresia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> in 1 patient , a cleft palate in another ) .
All children died within the first year .
The 2 sibs were born prematurely with nephromegaly but without hamartomas or <START:PHENOTYPE> nephroblastomatosis <END> .
This is consistent with the hypothesis that dysplastic medullary parenchyma in preterm infants develops into <START:PHENOTYPE> nephroblastomatosis <END> and hamartoma and eventually <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> .

Sib pair with previously unreported skeletal dysplasia .
We report on a consanguineous Lebanese family in which a sister and brother had <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , dysmorphic facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow chest <END> , prominent abdomen , and short limbs .
Neonatal radiographs disclosed a <START:PHENOTYPE> bell-shaped thorax <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short ribs <END> , some with a cupped end , <START:PHENOTYPE> severe platyspondyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> square iliac bones <END> , horizontal acetabula with medial and lateral spurs , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic ischia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short long bones <END> , slight widening of the distal femoral metaphyses , and absence of epiphyseal ossification of the knees .
The girl died at age 9 months as a result of respiratory insufficiency .
A clinical and radiological follow-up of the boy showed that the <START:PHENOTYPE> axial hypotonia <END> , minor anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> were still present , whereas the bone abnormalities had improved .
Differential diagnosis suggests that this is a new type of chondrodysplasia .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , malformation of brain development and <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcification <END> in sibs : pseudo-TO RCH or a new syndrome .
We report on five sibs affected by congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , growth retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> sloping forehead <END> , bitemporal grooving and micrognathia .
Generalized tonic-clonic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> started very early in life .
Postnatal brain computerized tomography ( CT) presented cortical band-like calcification , calcification of basal ganglia and brain stem while brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) revealed abnormal gyral pattern , marked loss of white matter , dysplastic ventricles , <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> , hypogenesis of corpus callosum and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
No abnormalities of the internal organs , eye , or skeleton were found to be associated with this syndrome .
Fetal Magnetic resonance imaging helped reaching the diagnosis in utero in one patient .
Three patients died in the first years of life while the others within days after birth preceded by high fever and status epilepticus .
These patients present many overlapping features with pseudo TORCH syndrome , however , the imaging findings are quite different .
We propose that the distinct pattern in these sibs constitutes genetic disorder of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , developmental brain malformation and <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcification <END> of likely <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .

Familial Mediterranean fever ( recurrent hereditary polyserositis ) in children : analysis of 88 cases .
The clinical profile , course and complications of familial Mediterranean fever ( recurrent hereditary polyserositis ) seen in 88 children over a period of 11 years are presented .
Forty eight children (55% ) started their illness below the age of 5 years , and the mean age of onset was 4.9 years .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Peritonitis <END> occurred in 85 % of children , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> in 5 0% , <START:PHENOTYPE> pleuritis <END> in 33% and erysipelas-like lesions in 16 % .
Two children developed <START:PHENOTYPE> renal amyloidosis <END> , and one third of the children were subjected to unnecessary operative surgery , reflecting the diagnostic difficulties .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> was mono-articular in 80% and polyarticular in 20% of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , and was seronegative ( rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies ) .
Human leucocyte antigen ( HLA ) typing for the B-27 antigen carried out in ten children with <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> was negative .
The synovial attack showed a wide variation in the clinical presentation , course and duration of <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , causing diagnostic difficulties .
The difficulties in the differentiation of recurrent hereditary polyserositis ( familial Mediterranean fever ) <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> from the common causes of acute and chronic juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> and the seronegative spondyloarthropathies are discussed .
Of 45 children treated with colchicine , 42 children ( 93% ) achieved a therapeutic response .
Corneal changes , hyperkeratosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , brachydactyly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> premature birth <END> : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome .
We report on an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome consisting of unique corneal epithelial changes , diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar hyperkeratosis <END> , distal <START:PHENOTYPE> onycholysis <END> , brachydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> premature birth <END> , and dental problems .
This condition has been present in seven persons in three generations of one family .
Corneal biopsies demonstrate mild dysplastic changes in the epithelium .
Skin biopsies show hyperkeratosis and acanthosis .
In both eye and skin specimens , results of stains for polysaccharides , amyloid , and tyrosine were unremarkable .
Roentgenograms of the hands show <START:PHENOTYPE> short distal phalanges <END> , short 4th metacarpals , and constriction of the heads of some of the metacarpals .
In three of four affected relatives , a variable medullary narrowness is seen .
In mode of inheritance , clinical appearance , and/or associated defects .
This syndrome appears to differ from previously reported conditions that include <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar hyperkeratosis <END> and/or corneal changes .
Pregnancy and risk of early <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 .
Early age at first full-term pregnancy and increasing parity are associated with a reduced risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
However , whether pregnancy decreases the risk of early-onset hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> is unknown .
There is concern that pregnancy may increase breast-cancer risk in carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations .
We aimed to establish whether pregnancy is a risk factor for hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
We did a matched case-control study of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in women who carry deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations .
Cases were carriers who developed <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> by age 40 years , and controls were carriers of the same age without <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , or who were diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> after age 40 years .
Women who had undergone preventive mastectomy , hysterectomy , or oophorectomy , or who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer before the age at which <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> was diagnosed in the matched case were excluded .
Information about pregnancies and pregnancy outcome was derived from a questionnaire completed by women in the course of genetic counselling .
A higher proportion of cases than controls had had a full term pregnancy ( 173 /236 vs 146/236 ; odds ratio 1.71 [95 % CI 1 .13-2.62 ] , p= 0.01 ) .
The mean number of births was also greater for cases than for controls ( 1.62 vs 1.38 , p= 0.04 ) .
The risk increased with the number of births and did not diminish with time since last pregnancy .
There were no significant differences in age at first birth or age at last birth between cases and controls .
Carriers of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations who have children are significantly more likely to develop <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> by age 40 than carriers who are nulliparous .
Each pregnancy is associated with an increased cancer risk .
An early first pregnancy does not confer protection for carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations .
Common variants in LSP1 , 2q35 and 8q24 and <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers .
Genome-wide association studies of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> have identified multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) that are associated with increased <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> risks in the general population .
In a previous study , we demonstrated that the minor alleles at three of these SNPs , in FGFR2 , TNRC9 and MAP3K1 , also confer increased risks of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers .
Three additional SNPs rs3817198 at LSP1 , rs13387042 at 2q35 and rs13281615 at 8q24 have since been reported to be associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in the general population , and in this study we evaluated their association with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> risk in 9442 BRCA1 and 5665 BRCA2 mutation carriers from 33 study centres .
The minor allele of rs3817198 was associated with increased <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> risk only for BRCA2 mutation carriers [hazard ratio ( HR ) = 1 .16 , 95 % CI : 1.07- 1.25 , P-trend = 2.8 x 10( -4) ] .
The best fit for the association of SNP rs13387042 at 2q35 with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> risk was a dominant model for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers ( BRCA1 : HR = 1 .14 , 95 % CI : 1.04-1.25 , P = 0.0047 ; BRCA2 : HR = 1 .18 95 % CI : 1.04-1.33 , P = 0.0079 ) .
SNP rs13281615 at 8q24 was not associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> for either BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers , but the estimated association for BRCA2 mutation carriers ( per-allele HR = 1.06 , 95 % CI : 0.98-1 .14 ) was consistent with odds ratio estimates derived from population-based case-control studies .
The LSP1 and 2q35 SNPs appear to interact multiplicatively on <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers .
There was no evidence that the associations vary by mutation type depending on whether the mutated protein is predicted to be stable or not .
Generalized juvenile polyposis coli .
Clinical management based on long-term observations .
Generalized juvenile polyposis occurred in five patients ( age range , 18 months to 16 years ) .
Clinical findings included <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> , weakness , <START:PHENOTYPE> rectal bleeding <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rectal prolapse <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> intussusception <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> .
Laboratory findings included <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemia <END> , and skin test anergy .
Diagnosis is achieved by double contrast enema , endoscopy , and biopsy .
Unlike patients with solitary juvenile polyps , patients with generalized involvement require surgical intervention .
Subtotal colectomy and ileoproctostomy are the procedures of choice , and we performed them in four cases .
An ileoanal-endorectal pull-through procedure was required in one patient with continued rectal disease .
All five patients are currently alive and well .
Long-term follow-up is important as polyps may persist into adult life .
Family members are at risk for developing gastrointestinal tract tumors and should be screened .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent encephalopathy <END> of childhood .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Recurrent encephalopathy <END> affecting cerebellar and extrapyramidal structures was observed in five members of two families .
The syndrome is characterized by sudden onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> truncal ataxia <END> , occasionally accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> and impairment of speech .
Choreic and <START:PHENOTYPE> athetoid movements <END> were present , and there was <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of deep tendon reflexes <END> with presence of pathological reflexes .
Onset of the disease was early in childhood .
Attacks lasted for days to weeks ; residual symptoms comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> speech impairment <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> incoordination <END> were seen in some patients .
Both sexes were affected .
The pedigrees suggest <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Pathogenesis remains unexplained by the laboratory studies done ; metabolic or immunological processes predisposed by genetic factors are suggested .
Similar reports from the literature are discussed ; no identical family could be found .
The diagnosis and prognosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> is usually caused by a mutant gene at the PKD1 locus on the short arm of chromosome 16 , but in about 4 percent of families with the disorder it is caused by unknown mutations elsewhere in the genome .
The natural course of the disease in both genetic forms is not well characterized .
We studied 17 families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> to compare presymptomatic diagnosis by ultrasonography with diagnosis by genetic-linkage studies and to relate clinical variation of the disease to whether the PKD1 mutation was implicated .
In 10 families the disorder was found to cosegregate with polymorphic DNA markers flanking the PKD1 locus , in 2 families it did not , and in 5 families linkage could not be determined .
In the 10 families with the PKD1 mutation , 46 percent of the members less than 30 years old who had a 50 percent risk of inheriting a mutation had renal cysts , as compared with 11 percent of the members of the two families without linkage ( P less than 0.001 ) .
In the PKD1 families , all 67 diagnoses made by ultrasonography were confirmed by determination of the genotype as inferred from linkage .
Forty of 48 members ( 83 percent ) less than 30 years old who inherited the PKD1 mutation had renal cysts .
All 27 members 30 years old or older who inherited the mutation had renal cysts , suggesting that the probability of a false negative diagnosis did not exceed 0.13 in this age group ( P less than 0.05 ) .
The mean ( + /- SE ) age at the onset of end-stage renal disease among members of the PKD1 families was 56 .7 +/- 1 .9 years , as compared with 69 .4 +/- 1.7 years among members with cysts in the families without linkage ( P = 0.0025 ) .
Hypertension and renal impairment were less frequent and occurred later in the families without the PKD1 mutation .
At present , in most persons with a 50 percent risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> , imaging techniques are the only mode of reaching a diagnosis before symptoms appear .
In such persons a negative ultrasonographic study during early adult life indicates that the likelihood of inheriting a PKD1 mutation is small .
In the few who inherit a non-PKD1 mutation for <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> is likely to occur relatively late in life .
Aldosterone-receptor deficiency in <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> , a syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> salt wasting <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , usually presents in infancy as high urinary levels of sodium despite <START:PHENOTYPE> hyponatremia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> , hyperreninemia , and elevated aldosterone levels .
We have investigated this syndrome for the possibility of abnormal Type I or "mineralocorticoid-like " receptors , which have intrinsic steroid specificity indistinguishable from that of renal mineralocorticoid receptors and are found in many tissues and cells , including mononuclear leukocytes .
We have studied three patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> : the 28-year-old index case in Melbourne ( Patient 1 ) and two siblings in Munich , eight and two years of age ( Patients 2 and 3) ; clinically , Patient 3 had a less severe case than his sister .
Percoll-separated control monocytes bound [3H]aldosterone with high affinity ( Kd approximately 3 nM ) and limited capacity ( 15 0 to 600 sites per cell ) .
On repeated examination , no [3H]aldosterone binding was found in monocytes from Patients 1 and 2 ; in Patient 3 , the levels were 62 sites per cell , more than 2 S.D . below those of the control .
Levels in the parents of the Munich patients ( first cousins ) were normal .
It appears that <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> is caused by a Type I receptor defect , that the defect may be complete or partial , that transmission may be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , and that the study of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> may indicate physiologic roles for Type I receptors in nonepithelial tissues .
CYP7B1 mutations in pure and complex forms of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> type 5 . Thirty-four different loci for hereditary spastic paraplegias have been mapped , and 16 responsible genes have been identified .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> forms of spastic paraplegias usually have clinically complex phenotypes but the SPG5 , SPG24 and SPG28 loci are considered to be associated with ' pure ' forms of the disease .
Very recently , five mutations in the CYP7B1 gene , encoding a cytochrome P450 oxysterol 7-alpha hydroxylase and expressed in brain and liver , have been found in SPG5 families .
We analysed the coding region and exon-intron boundaries of the CYP7B1 gene by direct sequencing in a series of 82 unrelated <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> index patients , manifesting either a pure ( n = 52 ) or a complex form ( n = 30 ) of the disease , and in 90 unrelated index patients with sporadic pure hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> .
We identified eight , including six novel , mutations in CYP7B1 segregating in nine families .
Three of these mutations were nonsense ( p.R63X , p.R112X , p.Y275X ) and five were missense mutations ( p.T297A , p.R417H , p.R417C , p.F470I , p.R486C ) , the last four clustering in exon 6 at the C-terminal end of the protein .
Residue R417 appeared as a mutational hot-spot .
The mean age at onset in 16 patients was 16 .4 +/- 12 .1 years ( range 4-47 years ) .
After a mean disease duration of 28.3 +/- 13.4 years (10-58 ) , spasticity and functional handicap were moderate to severe in all cases .
Interestingly , hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> was pure in seven SPG5 families but complex in two .
In addition , white matter hyperintensities were observed on brain magnetic resonance imaging in three patients issued from two of the seven pure families .
Lastly , the index case of one family had a chronic autoimmune hepatitis while his eldest brother died from cirrhosis and liver failure .
Whether this association is fortuitous remains unsolved , however .
The frequency of CYP7B1 mutations were 7.3% ( n = 6/82 ) in our series of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> families and 3.3% ( n = 3/90 ) in our series of sporadic pure <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> .
The recent identification of CYP7B1 as the gene responsible for SPG5 highlights a novel molecular mechanism involved in hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> determinism .
Is cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> syndrome related to <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> ?
To examine the overlap between cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> syndrome ( CVS ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> by comparing 2 subsets of children with migraine-associated and non-migraine-associated CVS .
We studied all children <18 years of age who met the consensus criteria for CVS after presentation to our pediatric gastroenterology service from 1986 to 1998 .
The clinical patterns and responses to treatment were obtained from a combination of chart reviews and structured interviews .
Among 214 children identified as having CVS , 82 % were classified as having migraine-associated CVS based on 1 of 2 criteria either a family history of migraines or subsequent development of <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine headaches <END> .
Compared with the non-migraine CVS subgroup , the <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> subset had milder episodes (2 0.7 27.3 SD vs 39.5 66 .5 emeses/episode , P =.006 ) ; more symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> ( 83 % vs 66% ) , headache ( 41 % vs 24% ) , social withdrawal (40% vs 22%) , photophobia ( 36 % vs 16 % , all P <.05 ) ; more frequent triggering events (70 % vs 49% , P =.013 ) including psychologic stress ( 39% vs 22%) , physical exhaustion ( 23% vs 3% ) , and motion sickness (1 0 % vs 0% ) ; and a higher positive response rate to anti-migraine therapy ( 79 % vs 36% , P =.002 ) .
The majority of children with CVS were subclassified as having migraine-associated CVS .
The migraine-associated subgroup had less severe <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , manifested symptoms typical of <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine headaches <END> , and had higher response rates to anti-migraine therapy .
These findings strengthen the relationship between <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> and CVS .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> type I ( chronic form ) : pathologic findings in the liver .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> type I presents with either <START:PHENOTYPE> acute hepatic failure <END> in the neonatal period or later in infancy with progressive liver dysfunction secondary to <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> .
The inevitably fatal outcome in those children with the chronic form has been transformed with the advent of liver transplantation .
Native livers from five children who received allografts were studied pathologically and compared with earlier hepatic biopsies in two of these patients that had been performed several years before transplantation .
Our findings support the conclusion that a sequence of morphologic changes from the initial micronodular <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> through an intermediate mixed cirrhotic pattern to macronodular <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> occurs .
The micronodular phase is transitory , over a period of only a few months , since mixed micronodular macronodular <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> was already present in the livers of children who received transplants by 11 months of age .
Focal hepatocellular dysplasia was present in one of the livers with mixed <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> but was not identified in the other two cases .
Macronodular <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> accompanied two cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> in this study .
In order to preclude the latter complication , liver replacement is necessary before the age of 2 years .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Prostate cancer <END> susceptibility locus on chromosome 1q : a confirmatory study .
Recent recognition that a predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> can be inherited has led to a search for specific genes associated with the disease .
Through a study of families with three or more affected first-degree relatives , a region on the long arm of chromosome 1 ( i .e. , 1q24-25 ) has been tentatively identified as containing a gene , HPC1 , involved in the development of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
Confirmation of this finding is needed , however , before attempts are made to isolate and characterize the putative HPC1 gene . To confirm that chromosome 1q24-25 contains a gene relevant to hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> , we analyzed an independent set of families , each with two or more affected individuals .
Fifty-nine unrelated families were selected for analysis on the sole criterion that more than one living family member was affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
DNA samples were subsequently isolated from 130 individuals with the disease .
These samples were genotyped at six polymorphic marker sequences ( D1S215 , D1S2883 , D1S466 , D1S158 , D1S518 , and D1S2757 ) covering the chromosomal region proposed to contain HPC1 .
The resulting data were analyzed by nonparametric multipoint linkage ( NPL ) methods , yielding NPL Z scores and corresponding one-sided P values .
When the entire set of 59 families was considered , the occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> ( and , presumably , the HPC1 gene ) was most tightly linked to marker D1S466 ( NPL Z score = 1.58 ; P = .0574 ) .
Analysis of the 20 families ( 51 affected individuals ) fulfilling one or more of the proposed clinical criteria for hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> ( i .e. , three or more affected individuals within one nuclear family ; affected individuals in three successive generations [maternal or paternal lineage ] ; and/or clustering of two or more individuals affected before the age of 55 years ) revealed more convincing evidence of disease linkage to chromosome 1q24-25 ( maximum NPL Z score [at marker D1S466 ] = 1.72 ; P = .0451 ) .
The 39 families ( 79 affected individuals ) that did not meet the clinical criteria for hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> exhibited no significant evidence of disease linkage to DNA sequences at chromosome 1q24-25 ( maximum NPL Z score [at marker D1S466 ] = 0.8 09 ; P = .208 ) .
The six African-American families in our study contributed disproportionately to the observation of linkage , with a maximum NPL Z score at marker D1S158 of 1.39 ( P = .0848 ) for these families .
Our data confirm that chromosome 1q24-25 is likely to contain a <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> susceptibility gene .
Future efforts at positional cloning of the HPC1 gene should focus on families who meet the proposed clinical criteria for hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
Biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease : a novel entity .
We describe a novel , biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease in 10 patients .
At onset , it appears as a subacute <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , with <START:PHENOTYPE> confusion <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> with occasional supranuclear facial nerve palsy or <START:PHENOTYPE> external ophthalmoplegia <END> , and progresses to severe cogwheel <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> and quadriparesis .
These symptoms disappear within a few days if biotin ( 5-1 0 mg/kg/day ) is administered , and there are no neurological sequelae .
They reappear within 1 month if biotin is discontinued .
Patients diagnosed late , or who have had repeated episodes , suffer from residual symptoms such as <START:PHENOTYPE> paraparesis <END> , mild mental retardation or <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
The numerous biochemical studies of intermediary metabolism , like the autoimmune and toxicological studies , enzyme assays including biotinidase , carboxylase and lysosomal activities , and bacterial and viral studies were all normal .
The aetiology may be related to a defect in the transporter of biotin across the blood-brain barrier .
The only consistent radiological abnormality was central necrosis of the head of the caudate bilaterally and complete , or partial , involvement of the putamen on brain MRI .
This was present during the initial acute <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> and remained unchanged during follow-up of 3-1 0 years .
Although its aetiology is unknown , it is important to recognize this disease , since its symptoms may be reversed and the progression of its clinical course prevented simply by providing biotin .
Identification of significant association and gene-gene interaction of GABA receptor subunit genes in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with a significant genetic component .
Existing research suggests that multiple genes contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and that epigenetic effects or gene-gene interactions are likely contributors to <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> risk .
However , these effects have not yet been identified .
Gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) , the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain , has been implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> etiology .
Fourteen known autosomal GABA receptor subunit genes were studied to look for the genes associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and their possible interactions .
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) were screened in the following genes : GABRG1 , GABRA2 , GABRA4 , and GABRB1 on chromosome 4p12 ; GABRB2 , GABRA6 , GABRA1 , GABRG2 , and GABRP on 5q34-q35 .1 ;
GABRR1 and GABRR2 on 6q15 ; and GABRA5 , GABRB3 , and GABRG3 on 15q12 .
Intronic and/or silent mutation SNPs within each gene were analyzed in 470 white families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Initially , SNPs were used in a family-based study for allelic association analysis--with the pedigree disequilibrium test and the family-based association test--and for genotypic and haplotypic association analysis--with the genotype-pedigree disequilibrium test ( geno-PDT) , the association in the presence of linkage ( APL ) test , and the haplotype family-based association test .
Next , with the use of five refined independent marker sets , extended multifactor-dimensionality reduction ( EMDR ) analysis was employed to identify the models with locus joint effects , and interaction was further verified by conditional logistic regression .
Significant allelic association was found for markers RS1912960 ( in GABRA4 ; P = .01 ) and HCV9866022 ( in GABRR2 ; P = .04 ) .
The geno-PDT found significant genotypic association for HCV8262334 ( in GABRA2 ) , RS1912960 and RS2280073 ( in GABRA4 ) , and RS2617503 and RS12187676 ( in GABRB2 ) .
Consistent with the allelic and genotypic association results , EMDR confirmed the main effect at RS1912960 ( in GABRA4 ) .
EMDR also identified a significant two-locus gene-gene effect model involving RS1912960 in GABRA4 and RS2351299 in GABRB1 .
Further support for this two-locus model came from both the multilocus geno-PDT and the APL test , which indicated a common genotype and haplotype combination positively associated with disease .
Finally , these results were also consistent with the results from the conditional logistic regression , which confirmed the interaction between GABRA4 and GABRB1 ( odds ratio = 2 .9 for interaction term ; P = .002 ) .
Through the convergence of all analyses , we conclude that GABRA4 is involved in the etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and potentially increases <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> risk through interaction with GABRB1 .
These results support the hypothesis that GABA receptor subunit genes are involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , most likely via complex gene-gene interactions .
Familial progressive subcortical <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> .
We report clinical and pathologic findings from two kindreds afflicted with a familial form of progressive subcortical <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> .
The disorder segregated as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
Onset was in the presenium and the course was slowly progressive .
Affected individuals initially manifested <START:PHENOTYPE> personality change <END> , degeneration of social ability , <START:PHENOTYPE> disinhibition <END> , psychotic symptoms , <START:PHENOTYPE> memory impairment <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> .
Later , all developed progressive dementia , frequently associated with verbal stereotypy , decreased speech output , echolalia , or manifestations of the human KlÃ¼ver- Bucy syndrome .
Terminal clinical manifestations included profound dementia , frequently with <START:PHENOTYPE> mutism <END> , dysphagia , and extrapyramidal signs .
Autopsy of seven end-stage patients revealed generalized cerebral atrophy , predominantly involving the white matter of the frontal and temporal lobes .
Microscopically , prominent fibrillary astrocytosis was present in the subcortical white matter and in the subpial and deep layers of the overlying cerebral cortex .
These changes were most pronounced in the frontal and temporal lobes , especially in the cingulate gyri and insulae .
Mild cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> accompanied the <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> , but no myelin loss was evident .
The claustra and substantia nigra also showed severe astrocytosis and degenerative changes .
Amyloid deposits and neuronal cytoskeletal inclusions were absent .
New syndrome of hydrocephalus , <START:PHENOTYPE> endocardial fibroelastosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> ( HEC syndrome ) .
We report on two unrelated male infants with similar findings of <START:PHENOTYPE> communicating hydrocephalus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> endocardial fibroelastosis <END> ( EFE ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , who died at 4 months of age .
Both mothers reported an upper respiratory infection during the first trimester of pregnancy which was further complicated by <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> in the third trimester .
The infants were diagnosed with bilateral congenital nuclear <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> at birth . Serologic tests for toxoplasmosis , rubella , cytomegalovirus , herpes simplex virus , syphilis , and galactosemia screens were negative .
Chromosome analyses were normal .
Both children developed <START:PHENOTYPE> communicating hydrocephalus <END> between one and three months after birth .
Patient 1 died suddenly at 4 months following an upper respiratory infection .
Patient 2 developed congestive heart failure and also died at 4 months .
At autopsy , both infants had enlarged hearts with <START:PHENOTYPE> endocardial fibroelastosis <END> .
No identifiable organism could be isolated .
We discuss the association of birth defects in widely separated organ systems in these patients and suggest that this may represent a genetic syndrome ; however , a viral etiology cannot entirely be excluded .
We believe this is a distinct disorder and propose the acronym HEC for hydrocephalus , EFE and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
Loss of the 3p25.3 band is critical in the manifestation of del( 3p ) syndrome : karyotype-phenotype correlation in cases with deficiency of the distal portion of the short arm of chromosome 3 . Two patients with monosomy for the distal portion of the short arm of chromosome 3 are described .
Chromosome analysis on prometaphase cells demonstrated a karyotype of 46 , XX,del(3 ) ( p25.3 ) in one patient and 46 , XX ,r(3 ) (p26.1q29) in the other .
The former patient showed characteristic clinical manifestations of the 3p- syndrome , including growth failure , mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with a <START:PHENOTYPE> flat occiput <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> triangular face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharoptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , broad and flat nose , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , down-turned mouth , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , apparently lowset and malformed ears , fingers abnormalities , and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
The latter patient had a nonspecific phenotype with mental retardation , growth failure and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
Karyotype-phenotype comparisons in the present cases and 16 previously reported cases with deficiency of the distal portion of 3p suggests that deficiency of the 3p25.3 band is critical to produce the main clinical manifestations of the del( 3p ) syndrome .
Spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 1 and Machado-Joseph disease : incidence of CAG expansions among adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> patients from 311 families with dominant , recessive , or sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
The ataxias are a complex group of diseases with both environmental and genetic causes .
Among the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> the genes for two , spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 1 ( SCA1 ) and Machado-Joseph disease ( MJD) , have been isolated .
In both of these disorders the molecular basis of disease is the expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat .
To assess the frequency of the SCA1 and MJD trinucleotide repeat expansions among individuals diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> we have collected DNA from individuals representing 311 families with adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> of unknown etiology and screened these samples for trinucleotide repeat expansions within the SCA1 and MJD genes .
Within this group there are 149 families with dominantly inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
Of these , 3% had SCA1 trinucleotide repeat expansions , whereas 21% were positive for the MJD trinucleotide expansion .
Thus , together SCA1 and MJD represent 24% of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> ataxias in our group , and the frequency of MJD is substantially greater than that of SCA1 .
For the 57 patients with MJD trinucleotide repeat expansions , a strong inverse correlation between CAG repeat size and age at onset was observed ( r = -.838 ) .
Among the MJD patients , the normal and affected ranges of CAG repeat size are 14-40 and 68-82 repeats , respectively .
For SCA1 the normal and affected ranges are much closer , containing 19-38 and 40-81 CAG repeats , respectively .
Mutations within the rhodopsin gene in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Night blindness <END> is an early symptom of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
The rod photoreceptors are responsible for night vision and use rhodopsin as the photosensitive pigment .
We found three mutations in the human rhodopsin gene ; each occurred exclusively in the affected members of some families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
Two mutations were C-to-T transitions involving separate nucleotides of codon 347 ; the third was a C-to-G transversion in codon 58 . Each mutation corresponded to a change in one amino acid residue in the rhodopsin molecule .
None of these mutations were found in 106 unrelated normal subjects who served as controls .
When the incidence of these three mutations was added to that of a previously reported mutation involving codon 23 , 27 of 150 unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> ( 18 percent ) were found to carry one of these four defects in the rhodopsin gene .
All 27 patients had abnormal rod function on monitoring of their electroretinograms .
It appears that patients with the mutation involving codon 23 probably descend from a single ancestor .
In some patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , the disease is caused by one of a variety of mutations of the rhodopsin gene .
Early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> West syndrome <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral hypomyelination <END> and reduced cerebral white matter .
Numerous numbers of pre- , peri- and postnatal damages cause <START:PHENOTYPE> West syndrome <END> in early infancy , however , etiology in many cases are not still elucidated despite intensive biochemical and neuroradiologic investigations .
We described four patients having early onset epileptic encephalopathy with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomyelination <END> and reduction in cerebral white matter .
The clinical symptoms of these patients are impaired visual attention , acquired microcephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic tetraplegia <END> , profound psychomotor delay and infantile spasms since early infancy .
All patients had striking <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomyelination <END> of cerebrum , reduced volume of white matter and cortical atrophy on MRI . Serial MRI investigations in three patients showed absence of myelination of the white matter .
On EEG , one patient revealed suppression-burst and other three had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypsarrhythmia <END> .
Despite having intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , no patient showed deterioration of neurological development .
The group of these findings is mimicking to clinical manifestations of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency , and has some overlap with progressive encephalopathy with edema , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypsarrhythmia <END> , and optic atrophy ( PEHO ) like syndrome , however it is not compatible with these two conditions .
The findings observed in our patients can be regarded as a new clinical condition associated with early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> West syndrome <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nonprogressive <END> cerebellar disorder with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> in Hutterites .
We report a <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive <END> neurological disorder in at least 11 Hutterites with healthy but consanguineous parents .
In several of the affected , hypotonia was noted at birth . Retarded motor and mental development became apparent during the first year of life .
The age of unsupported walking varied from 5-21 years .
Consistent signs were unsteady , broadly based gait and stance , exaggerated deep tendon reflexes mainly in the lower limbs , and mild to moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Variable signs were extensor plantar reflexes ( 9/11 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> ( -2SD in 8/11 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> ( 7/ 11 ) , small muscle mass ( 6/11 ) , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> intention tremor <END> ( 3/11 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> ( 1/11 ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ( 1/11 ) .
CAT scans in two affected sisters showed slight enlargement of the fourth ventricle in one and hypoplasia of the cerebellum in both .
The disorder is probably the same as that described earlier under the heading , dysequilibrium syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Achalasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
The authors report the combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in three surviving sisters and similar manifestations in a brother who died after recurrent vomiting and respiratory infections .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> in the females was relieved with an operation .
There was no demonstrable chromosomal abnormality .
In this family <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> occurred together as an apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
Familial aggregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> in progressive supranuclear palsy .
Progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau ( MAPT) .
A nonsignificant trend for positive family history has been observed in two case-control studies and several pedigrees with familial clustering of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> have been described .
Occasionally , mutations in MAPT are found in patients with a clinical phenotype similar to PSP .
In this case-control study , we compared the occurrence of dementia and <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> among first-degree relatives of patients with PSP with an age - and sex-matched control group .
Family history of dementia and <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> was collected from all first-degree relatives of patients with PSP who fulfilled the international National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke criteria for PSP .
Age - and sex-matched controls were selected from the Rotterdam Study .
Genetic testing and pathologic examination was performed in a subset of familial PSP cases .
Fifty-seven ( 33% ) of the 172 patients with PSP had at least one first-degree relative who had dementia or <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> compared to 131 ( 25% ) of the control subjects ( odds ratio [ OR] 1.5 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1. 01-2.13 ) .
In patients with PSP , more first-degree relatives with <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> were observed compared to controls , with an OR 3.9 ( 95 % CI 1 .99-7.61 ) .
Twelve patients with PSP ( 7% ) fulfilled the criteria for an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode of transmission .
The intrafamilial phenotype within these pedigrees varied among PSP , dementia , <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
Genetic studies revealed one patient with a P301L mutation in MAPT.
Pathologic examination of five familial cases confirmed the clinical diagnosis of PSP , with predominant four repeat tau pathology in affected brain areas .
This study demonstrates familial aggregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> in progressive supranuclear palsy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Heterogeneity <END> in Waardenburg 's syndrome .
Report of a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> .
A family had the following manifestations of Waardenburg 's syndrome ( WS ) : prominent nasal root , <START:PHENOTYPE> white forelock <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> premature graying of the hair <END> , freckled pigmentation of pale skin , hypoplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> heterochromia irides <END> , heterochromia of the ocular fundi , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital sensorineural hearing loss <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> heredity .
This family differs from those previously reported in that none of its members showed dystopia of the inner canthi or lower puncta .
In addition , four siblings had the combination of hyperopia-estropia-amblyopia , as well as <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> , manifested by <START:PHENOTYPE> foveal hypoplasia <END> and transilluminable irides .
Observations on this family support prior suggestions of <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> in WS .
Infants with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome do not have " true " hemangiomas .
In 1940 Kasabach and Merritt described an infant with a vascular anomaly , extensive purpura , and <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> ; they called his lesion " capillary hemangioma. " <START:PHENOTYPE> Hemangioma <END> is a benign tumor that grows in infancy and is characterized by proliferation of endothelial cells and regression during childhood .
Although Kasabach-Merritt syndrome ( KMS ) is frequently mentioned as a possible complication of <START:PHENOTYPE> hemangioma <END> , our experience suggests that the anatomic vascular lesion underlying the <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> is not a " true, " classic , involuting type of <START:PHENOTYPE> hemangioma <END> of infancy and childhood .
We reviewed the clinical and hemostasis data and the response to treatment in 22 cases of KMS , and we analyzed the biopsy specimens of 15 of them .
Clinically none of the 22 patients had classic <START:PHENOTYPE> hemangioma <END> .
There was no female preponderance .
All patients had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> ( lowest platelet count = 3000/mm3 ) and consumption of fibrinogen .
Histologically , none had the typical " capillary , " involuting type of <START:PHENOTYPE> hemangioma <END> of infancy : they exhibited either a tufted angioma or a kaposiform hemangioendothelioma pattern ; all specimens also contained numerous abnormal lymphatic-like vessels ; lymphatic malformation was the major component in two patients .
The infants exhibited a heterogeneous response to a number of therapeutic regimens , as noted in other reports .
Severe morbidity was present ; three of our patients died , and one had leg amputation .
" Residua " were , in fact , residual vascular neoplasia , variable in duration , and not a stable fibrofatty residuum , as in classic involuted <START:PHENOTYPE> hemangioma <END> ; only the hematologic phenomenon was " cured " after a period of years .
KMS is a distinctive disease of infancy , but the underlying vascular lesion is not a " true, " classic , involuting type of <START:PHENOTYPE> hemangioma <END> of infancy .
This is a different vascular tumor with a resemblance pathologically to either tufted angioma or kaposiform hemangioendothelioma in association with lymphatic-like vessels .
Whether the underlying lesion in KMS is a single anatomic entity or heterogeneous cannot be definitely concluded from this study .
We need a better understanding of the pathogenesis of KMS to improve our therapeutic management .
HLA-DRB1* 0102 is associated with TINU syndrome and bilateral , sudden-onset anterior <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> but not with interstitial nephritis alone .
Tubulointerstitial nephritis and <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> ( TI NU ) syndrome is a rare form of <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> .
Previously , the authors had demonstrated a strong association of human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) DRB1* 0102 with TI NU .
Here , the authors performed HLA analysis on subjects with isolated bilateral sudden-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> ( as in the TINU subtype ) or with isolated tubulointerstitial nephritis ( TIN ) .
Patients with sudden onset , anterior , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> not fulfilling a diagnosis of TINU were identified .
Pathology reports were reviewed to identify subjects with biopsy-proven TI N. Molecular typing of the HLA-DRB1 gene was performed by the Luminex technology-based sequence-specific oligonucleotide ( SSO ) hybridisation method ( One Lambda , Canoga Park , California ) .
HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies were compared with normal published controls ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gv/mhc/ihwg .cgi dbMHC Europe cohort ) and the published TINU cohort ( n=18 ) .
The authors included 28 subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> and 14 with TI N.
There was a significantly higher frequency of DRB1* 0102 in the isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> cohort versus in normal controls (1 0.7% vs 0.6% , respectively , p< 0.0001 ; RR 14 .3 ( 6 .9-29.8) ) .
None of the nephritis patients showed this HLA subtype .
Another association with HLA-DRB1* 08 was seen in the isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> cohort with an allele frequency of 10.7% versus 2.7% in normal controls ( p= 0.0019 ; RR 4. 0 ( 1.8-9.0) ) .
In contrast , the HLA-DRB1* 08 was not different from controls in the TINU cohort ( allele frequency 2.8% , p=not significant ) .
The incidence of HLA-DRB1* 0102 is increased in sudden-onset bilateral anterior <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> , as seen in patients with TI NU .
The same allele does not appear to occur in increased frequency in patients with isolated TI N. HLA DRB1* 0102 might predispose to this subset of <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> .
Functional haplotypes of PADI4 , encoding citrullinating enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase 4 , are associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
Individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> frequently have autoantibodies to citrullinated peptides , suggesting the involvement of the peptidylarginine deiminases citrullinating enzymes (encoded by PADI genes ) in <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
Previous linkage studies have shown that a susceptibility locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> includes four PADI genes but did not establish which PADI gene confers susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
We used a case-control linkage disequilibrium study to show that PADI type 4 is a susceptibility locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( P = 0.000008 ) .
PADI4 was expressed in hematological and <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> synovial tissues .
We also identified a haplotype of PADI4 associated with susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> that affected stability of transcripts and was associated with levels of antibody to citrullinated peptide in sera from individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
Our results imply that the PADI4 haplotype associated with susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> increases production of citrullinated peptides acting as autoantigens , resulting in heightened risk of developing the disease .
Three novel <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> mutations in the human PAX6 gene .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Aniridia <END> ( iris hypoplasia ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> congenital disorder of the eye .
Mutations in the human <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> ( PAX6 ) gene have now been identified in many patients from various ethnic groups .
In the study reported here we describe PAX6 mutations in one sporadic and five familial cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
Of the four different mutations identified , one was identical to a previously reported mutation ( C-->T transition at codon 240) , and three were novel : two in the glycine-rich region and one in the proline/serine/threonine-rich ( PST) region .
One PAX6 mutation found in the PST region was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> in an <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> family .
Another splice mutation in the PST domain occurred in an <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> patient with anosmia ( inability to smell ) .
The six new <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> cases reported here have mutations predicted to generate incomplete PAX6 proteins .
These results support the theory that human <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> is caused by haploinsufficiency of PAX6 .
Analysis of the candidate genes responsible for non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate in Japanese people .
In order to assess the association of alleles for candidate genes with non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate , DNA samples from 43 Japanese patients were compared with those from 73 control subjects with respect to the genes encoding transforming growth factor alpha ( TGFalpha) , TGFbeta and gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor beta3 ( GABRB3 ) .
The restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the 3 ' -non-coding region of the TGFalpha gene K-primer region were observed after digestion with NcoI and HinfI .
Allele 4 was the most common among cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , whereas allele 2 was the most common among controls .
A significant difference was found in this region between groups with <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> ( with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ) and controls ( chi2=1 0 .190 ; P= 0.017 ) .
Three alleles of the TGFbeta2 gene were tested , and allele 2 was the most common in both cases and controls .
The proportion of allele 2 in the case group was greater than that in the control group , showing a significant difference between cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> ( with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ) and controls ( chi(2 )=19.208 ; P< 0.0001 ) .
No significant differences in variants of TGFbeta3 or GABRB3 between case and control populations were observed .
Thus it is concluded that TGF genes play a role in craniofacial development , and that alleles of TGFalpha or/and TGFbeta2 are associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> in Japanese populations .
Parental age and seasonal variation in the births of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> : a mutation-epidemiologic study .
Statistical analysis of parental age data from 225 <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases of bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , plus ten <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases of chromosome deletion or translocation involving 13q14 that was identified as of paternal origin , revealed no evidence of paternal or maternal age effect .
Parental exposure to ionizing radiation or chemical mutagens , the effect of which is accumulated with advancing age , does not seem to play a major role in the production of germinal mutations at the responsible ( RB ) locus .
Furthermore , analysis of variation in the month of birth of 753 children with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> did not show any significant deviation from the controls or a cyclic trend .
The occurrence of nonheritable <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> is not likely to be associated with certain viruses such as human adenovirus 12 whose activity varies markedly with season .
These results , together with the fairly uniform pattern in the incidence of this tumor among different populations , suggest that most , if not all , cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> are caused by some intrinsic biological mechanisms , and not by environmental mutagens that may vary with respect to time and place .
The cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome .
The cardiofaciocutaneous ( CFC ) syndrome is a condition of sporadic occurrence , with patients showing multiple congenital anomalies and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
It is characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> relative macrocephaly <END> , a distinctive face with <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , bitemporal constriction , absence of eyebrows , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> downward-slanting palpebral fissures <END> often with <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal root <END> and a bulbous tip of the nose .
The cutaneous involvement consists of dry , hyperkeratotic , scaly skin , sparse and <START:PHENOTYPE> curly hair <END> , and cavernous haemangiomata .
Most patients have a congenital heart defect , most commonly <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonic stenosis <END> and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
The developmental delay usually is moderate to severe .
The syndrome is caused by gain-of-function mutations in four different genes BRAF , KRAS , mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase MEK1 and MEK2 , all belonging to the same RAS-extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) pathway that regulates cell differentiation , proliferation and apoptosis .
The CFC syndrome is a member of a family of syndromes that includes the Noonan and Costello syndromes , presenting with phenotypic similarities .
Noonan syndrome is caused by mutations in the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 gene ( PTP N11 ) , with a few people having a mutation in KRAS .
Costello syndrome is caused by mutations in HRAS .
The protein products of these genes also belong to the RAS-ERK pathway .
Thus , the clinical overlap of these three conditions , which often poses a problem of differential diagnosis , is explained by their pathogenetic relatedness .
Infantile cerebello-optic atrophy.
Neuropathology of the progressive encephalopathy syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypsarrhythmia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( the PEHO syndrome ) .
Uniform neuropathological changes are described in eight cases of the progressive encephalopathy syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypsarrhythmia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( PEHO syndrome ) .
Two of the autopsied patients were sisters and two other cases were familial .
Macroscopically , cerebral and pronounced <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> was seen , the essential histopathological lesions being confined to the cerebellar cortex and the optic nerve .
There was a severe <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> in the inner granular layer of the cerebellum .
The Purkinje cells were relatively preserved in number although reduced in size , deformed and slightly disaligned .
Their dendrites were horizontally oriented and the proximal axons contained abundant torpedoes .
The molecular layer was narrow .
The optic nerves were atrophic .
Serial neuroimaging studies showed that the disease process is operative during the postnatal period , although a prenatal onset cannot be excluded .
An aberrant expression of immunoreactivity against the 200-kDa neurofilament polypeptide in Purkinje cell perikarya indicated disorganization of the cytoskeleton of these cells .
The combination of clinical and pathological features of our patients differs from that observed in the few published cases of so-called primary degeneration of the granular layer .
Infantile cerebello-optic atrophy , clinically characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , blindness and early arrest in psychomotor development , thus seems to constitute a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder .
Syndromes of <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> .
A review of cardiac and non-cardiac malformations in 60 cases withspecial reference to diagnosis and prognosis .
This review presents the cardiac and non-cardiac malformations in 60 cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> with special reference to distinguishing factors which may be helpful in the clinical recognition of these syndromes .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> cases were predominantly male and presented with cyanosis .
They frequently had transposition of the great arteries ( 72% ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary stenosis <END> or atresia ( 88% ) and total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage ( 72% ) .
Deaths were caused by cardiac failure and anoxia in 57 per cent of cases .
Most of the patients died in the first year of life ( 79% ) , but longer survival is possible in the <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> syndrome .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> cases were predominantly female and survived longer .
The characteristic clinical findings were the relatively more benign presenting signs and the leftward or superiorly orientated P wave axis on the electrocardiogram .
Conotruncal abnormalities were less common and total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage did not occur .
On angiography the inferior vena caval drainage via the azygos system was clearly identified and this was present in all cases at surgery .
Our study indicated that the cardiac anomalies in <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> were less severe than they were in <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and therefore the prognosis in the former syndrome is likely to be more favourable .
Three families had two affects sibs but no single genetic factor could be identified .
The aetiology of these syndromes remains undetermined .
Meta-analysis of genetic studies in ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> : thirty-two genes involving approximately 18 ,000 cases and 58 ,000 controls .
Ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> is thought to have a polygenic basis , but identification of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> susceptibility genes and quantification of associated risks have been hampered by conflicting results from underpowered case-control studies .
We performed a meta-analysis of all candidate gene association studies in ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
Electronic databases were searched up until January 2003 for all case-control and nested case-control studies in English-language journals relating to the investigation of any candidate gene for ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> in humans .
Cases were required to have neuroimaging evidence of the diagnosis .
To maintain genetic homogeneity , only studies in white adults were included .
Studies that evaluated quantitative traits or intermediate phenotypes were excluded .
Data from 120 case-control studies were included .
Pooled odds ratios ( ORs ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) from random- and fixed-effects models were calculated .
Of 32 genes studied , 15 polymorphisms were identified for which at least 3 studies had been conducted .
Statistically significant associations with ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> were identified for factor V Leiden Arg506Gln ( OR , 1.33 ; 95 % CI , 1 .12-1.58 ) , methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T ( OR , 1.24; 95 % CI , 1.08-1.42 ) , prothrombin G20210A ( OR , 1.44 ; 95 % CI , 1 .11 -1.86 ) , and angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion ( OR , 1.21 ; 95 % CI , 1.08-1.35 ) .
These were also the most investigated candidate genes , including 4588 , 3387 , 3028 , and 2990 cases , respectively .
No statistically significant association with ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> was detected for the 3 next most investigated genes ( factor XIII , apolipoprotein E , and human platelet antigen type 1 ) .
There is a genetic component to common <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
No single gene with major effect was identified ; rather , common variants in several genes , each exerting a modest effect , contribute to the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
These findings have important implications for the design of future genetic studies and for predictive genetic testing for <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> and other multifactorial diseases .
A newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> limb girdle <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> with cardiac involvement .
Sixty-five members of three families with limb girdle <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> ( LGMD ) underwent neurological , cardiological , and ancillary investigations .
Thirty-five individuals were diagnosed as having <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> LGMD .
Symmetrical weakness started in the proximal lower limb muscles , and gradually upper limb muscles also became affected .
Early <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures <END> of the spine were absent .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Contractures of elbows <END> and Achilles tendons were either minimal or late .
Serum creatine kinase activity was normal to moderately elevated .
Electromyogram and muscle biopsy were consistent with a mild muscular dystrophy.
Cardiological abnormalities , found in more than one-half the patients , included dysrhythmias and atrioventricular ( AV ) conduction disturbances presenting as <START:PHENOTYPE> bradycardia <END> , syncopal attacks necessitating pacemaker implantation , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> .
There was a significant relation between the severity of AV conduction disturbances and age .
In nearly all patients , neuromuscular symptomatology preceded cardiological involvement .
The early recognition of this previously not described , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> LGMD with life-threatening cardiac involvement offers an opportunity for therapeutic intervention .
Neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> porencephaly <END> and adult stroke related to mutations in collagen IV A1 .
The objective of this study was to describe <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> , lacunar infarcts , microbleeds and macrobleeds in the context of a collagen IV A1 mutation .
We examined a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> porencephaly <END> , in whom a defect in collagen IV A1 was detected recently .
The patients underwent neurological , ophthalmological , and cardiological examinations and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain .
Electron microscopy of a skin biopsy was performed .
Extensive laboratory screening was performed for thrombophilia and increased bleeding tendency .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> porencephaly <END> was symptomatic in the infantile period in two patients , whereas it led to only minor neurological dysfunction in their affected mother .
However , she experienced development of recurrent strokes in her 40s .
In addition to the <START:PHENOTYPE> porencephaly <END> , all patients had a <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> , which was most severe in the mother .
Her magnetic resonance imaging results also showed lacunar infarcts , macrobleeds and a multitude of microbleeds .
No other risk factors for recurrent stroke were found .
Electron microscopy showed interruptions of the basement membrane of skin capillaries and inhomogeneous thickening of the basement membrane with pools of basement membrane fragments .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Leukoencephalopathy <END> , ischemic infarcts , microbleeds , and macrobleeds are indicative of an underlying microangiopathy , of which the best-known causes are hypertension , cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> , and cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
Mutations in collagen IV A1 , a major component of the vascular basement membrane , appear to be another risk factor .
Possible new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> , hydroceles , <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> , and characteristic facial changes .
We describe two brothers with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> of lower limbs , <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> ( ASD) , and similar facial appearance .
A sister had <START:PHENOTYPE> severe hydrops fetalis <END> , ASD , <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , and other anomalies .
This combination of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> and ASD differs from other reported cases of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> and most likely constitutes a previously unrecognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
Spondylocheiro dysplastic form of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome--an autosomal-recessive entity caused by mutations in the zinc transporter gene SLC39A13 .
We present clinical , radiological , biochemical , and genetic findings on six patients from two consanguineous families that show EDS-like features and radiological findings of a mild <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal dysplasia <END> .
The EDS-like findings comprise hyperelastic , thin , and bruisable skin , hypermobility of the small joints with a tendency to <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures <END> , protuberant eyes with <START:PHENOTYPE> bluish sclerae <END> , hands with finely wrinkled palms , atrophy of the thenar muscles , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tapering fingers <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal dysplasia <END> comprises <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopenia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> widened metaphyses <END> .
Patients have an increased ratio of total urinary pyridinolines , lysyl pyridinoline/hydroxylysyl pyridinoline ( LP/HP) , of approximately 1 as opposed to approximately 6 in EDS VI or approximately 0.2 in controls .
Lysyl and prolyl residues of collagens were underhydroxylated despite normal lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl 4-hydroxylase activities ; underhydroxylation was a generalized process as shown by mass spectrometry of the alpha1( I )- and alpha2(I )-chain-derived peptides of collagen type I and involved at least collagen types I and II. A genome-wide SNP scan and sequence analyses identified in all patients a homozygous c.483_491 del9 SLC39A13 mutation that encodes for a membrane-bound zinc transporter SLC39A13 .
We hypothesize that an increased Zn( 2+ ) content inside the endoplasmic reticulum competes with Fe( 2+) , a cofactor that is necessary for hydroxylation of lysyl and prolyl residues , and thus explains the biochemical findings .
These data suggest an entity that we have designated " spondylocheiro dysplastic form of EDS ( SCD-EDS) " to indicate a generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal dysplasia <END> involving mainly the spine ( spondylo ) and striking clinical abnormalities of the hands ( cheiro ) in addition to the EDS-like features .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Glutaric aciduria <END> type III: a distinctive non-disease ?
<START:PHENOTYPE> Glutaric aciduria <END> type III is a rare metabolic abnormality leading to persistent isolated glutaric acid excretion .
We report the clinical and biochemical phenotypes of three affected children .
The first patient is a boy with dysmorphic features and a chromosomal deletion ( monosomy 6q26-qter ) in whom a persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> (50 0 mmol/mol creatinine , normal <10 ) was detected during a routine metabolic investigation .
The second boy suffered from acute gastroenteritis and hyperthyroidism , when an excessively high urinary glutaric acid excretion was identified ( 146 0 mmol/mol creatinine ) .
The third patient is a girl with constantly elevated glutaric acid in her urine ( 290 mmol/mol creatinine ) but no symptoms of significant disease .
In all our patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> type I ( glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> type II ( multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation defect ) , and secondary forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> ( for example due to intestinal infections or mitochondrial dysfunction ) could be excluded .
Loading with the precursor amino acid lysine in all patients as well as with pipecolic acid in the third case led to an increase in urinary glutaric acid excretion , proving the endogenous origin of glutarate .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Glutaric aciduria <END> type III ( a defect reported to be caused by peroxisomal glutaryl-CoA oxidase deficiency ) is our presumptive diagnosis .
However , peroxisomal glutaryl-CoA oxidase is not well characterized and no reliable approach for the direct determination of this enzyme is available to us . To our knowledge , in the English language literature only a single patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> type III has been described .
Our cases reported here confirm the earlier assumption that <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> type III is not related to a distinctive phenotype .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Glutaric aciduria <END> type III appears to be a rare metabolic abnormality , presumably of peroxisomal metabolism .
However , its pathophysiological impact still needs further investigation .
Clinical features associated with mutations in the chromosome 1 open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> gene ( GLC1A ) A substantial proportion of cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> have a genetic basis . Mutations causing <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> have been identified in the chromosome 1 open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> gene ( GLC1A ) , which encodes a 57-kd protein known as myocilin .
The normal role of this protein and the mechanism by which mutations cause <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> are not known .
We screened 716 patients with primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and 596 control subjects for sequence changes in the GLC1A gene .
We identified 16 sequence variations that met the criteria for a probable disease-causing mutation because they altered the predicted amino acid sequence and they were found in one or more patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , in less than 1 percent of the control subjects .
These 16 mutations were found in 33 patients ( 4.6 percent ) .
Six of the mutations were found in more than 1 subject ( total , 99 ) .
Clinical features associated with these six mutations included an age at diagnosis ranging from 8 to 77 years and maximal recorded intraocular pressures ranging from 12 to 77 mm Hg . A variety of mutations in the GLC1A gene are associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
The spectrum of disease can range from juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> to typical late-onset primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
A missense mutation in the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> nocturnal frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> affects at least 2% of the population at some time in their lives .
The epilepsies are a heterogeneous group of disorders , many with an inherited component .
Although specific genes have been identified in a few rare diseases causing <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> as part of a more diffuse brain disorder , the molecular pathology of the common idiopathic epilepsies is still unknown .
Linkage has been reported for some generalised <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndromes , but only very recently for familial partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndromes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> nocturnal frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ( ADNFLE ) is a partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> causing frequent , violent , brief <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> at night , usually beginning in childhood .
The gene for ADNFLE maps to chromosome 20q13.2-q13.3 in one large Australian kindred .
The neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit ( CHRNA4 ) maps to the same region of 20q ( ref . 12 ) and the gene is expressed in all layers of the frontal cortex .
We screened affected family members for mutations within CHRNA4 and found a missense mutation that replaces serine with phenylalanine at codon 248 , a strongly conserved amino acid residue in the second transmembrane domain .
The mutation is present in all 21 available affected family members and in four obligate carriers , but not in 333 healthy control subjects .
Clinical studies in familial VCP <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> associated with Paget disease of bone and <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> .
Inclusion body <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> with Paget disease of the bone ( PDB ) and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> ( IBMPFD , OMIM 167320) , is a progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder caused by mutations in the Valousin-containing protein ( VCP , p97 or CDC48 ) gene .
IBMPFD can be difficult to diagnose .
We assembled data on a large set of families to illustrate the number and type of misdiagnoses that occurred .
Clinical analysis of 49 affected individuals in nine families indicated that 42 ( 87% ) of individuals had muscle disease .
The majority were erroneously diagnosed with limb girdle muscular dystrophy ( LGMD) , facioscapular muscular dystrophy , peroneal muscular dystrophy , late adult onset distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , spinal muscular atrophy , scapuloperoneal muscular dystrophy , or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) among others .
Muscle biopsies showed <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> characteristic of an inclusion body <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> in 7 of 18 patients ( 39% ) , however , inclusion body <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> was correctly diagnosed among individuals in only families 5 and 15 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Frontotemporal dementia <END> ( FTD ) was diagnosed in 13 individuals ( 27% ) at a mean age of 57 years ( range 48 .9-60.2 years ) ; however , several individuals had been diagnosed with Alzheimer disease . Histopathological examination of brains of three affected individuals revealed a pattern of ubiquitin positive neuronal intranuclear inclusions and dystrophic neurites .
These families expand the clinical phenotype in IBMPFD , a complex disorder caused by mutations in VCP .
The presence of PDB in 28 ( 57% ) individuals suggests that measuring serum alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity may be a useful screen for IBMPFD in patients with myopathy.

A functional variant in the 3 ' -UTR of angiopoietin-1 might reduce <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> risk by interfering with the binding efficiency of microRNA 211 .
Angiopoietin-1 is a vascular strengthening factor during vascular development and a protective factor for pathological vascular inflammation and leakage .
Brain vascular leaking and inflammation are two important pathological processes of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> ; therefore , we hypothesized that variants of the microRNA-binding site in angiopoietin-1 would affect its expression and confer a risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
To test our hypothesis , a predicted microRNA-binding site was found in the 3 ' -UTR of angiopoietin-1 using bioinformatics ; variant rs2507800 was identified to be located in the miR-211-binding site of angiopoietin-1 .
Secondly , the effects of the identified variant on angiopoietin-1 translation were assessed using a luciferase reporter assay and ELISA .
We found that the A allele of rs2507800 suppressed angiopoietin-1 translation by facilitating miR-211 binding , but not the T allele .
Subjects carrying the TT genotype had higher plasma angiopoietin-1 levels than those with the A allele .
Finally , the association of the variant with <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> was tested in 438 <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> patients and 890 controls , and replicated in an independent population of 1791 <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> patients and 1843 controls .
The TT genotype resulted in a significant reduction in overall <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> risk { OR , 0.51 [95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.36- 0.74 ] , P = 0.0003} , ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> [ OR , 0.56 ( 95 % CI , 0.36- 0.85 ) , P = 0.007 ] and hemorrhagic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> [ OR , 0.46 ( 95 % CI , 0.26- 0.80) , P = 0.007] .
These results were confirmed in an independent study .
Our results provide evidence that the TT genotype ( rs25078 00 ) in the 3 ' -UTR of angiopoietin-1 might reduce the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> by interfering with miR-211 binding .
Clinical homogeneity and genetic heterogeneity in Weill-Marchesani syndrome .
Weill-Marchesani syndrome ( WMS ) is a rare condition characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , brachydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint stiffness <END> , and characteristic eye abnormalities including microspherophakia , ectopia of lens , <START:PHENOTYPE> severe myopia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Both <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ( AR ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> ( AD ) modes of inheritance have been described for WMS .
A locus for AR WMS has recently been mapped to chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2 while mutation within the fibrillin-1 gene ( 15q21.1 ) was found in one AD WMS family .
In order to answer the question of whether or not genetic heterogeneity could be related to a clinical heterogeneity , we reviewed 128 WMS patients from the literature ( including 57 AR , 50 AD , and 21 sporadic cases) , with a particular attention to clinical features .
Statistical analyses using Fischer exact test were used to compare the proportions of 12 clinical parameters between AR and AD patients .
There was no significant difference between both groups for myopia , <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , brachydactyly , thick skin , muscular build , and mental retardation .
Significant results were found for microspherophakia ( 94 % in AR , 74 % in AD , Fischer 0.007) , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> ( 64 % in AR , 84 % in AD , Fischer 0.016 ) , joint limitations ( 49 % in AR , 77 % in AD , Fischer 0.010 ) , and cardiac anomalies ( 39% in AR , 13% in AD , Fischer 0.004 ) .
Nevertheless , we failed to distinguish AR from AD inheritance in individual cases .
These results support the clinical homogeneity but the genetic heterogeneity of WMS . Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss , Inc .
Hereditary infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiparesis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal arteriolar tortuosity <END> , and leukoencephalopathy.
The main hereditary vascular conditions involving both retinal and cerebral vessels include cerebroretinal vasculopathy , HERNS ( hereditary endotheliopathy with retinopathy , nephropathy , and stroke ) , and hereditary vascular retinopathy ; all are linked to the same locus on chromosome 3p21 . Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal arteriolar tortuosity <END> is a distinct , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> condition characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal arteriolar tortuosity <END> and recurrent retinal hemorrhages .
This condition is known to affect only retinal vessels .
Clinical and brain MRI investigations of eight members of a three-generation family and extensive biological and systemic vascular investigations within one affected family member were conducted .
Six of eight family members were clinically symptomatic ; disorders included infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiparesis <END> (2 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine with aura <END> (3) , and retinal hemorrhage (1 ) .
Five individuals had retinal arteriolar tortuosities .
A diffuse leukoencephalopathy in association with dilated perivascular spaces was observed in six individuals . Two family members had silent , deep cerebral infarcts as demonstrated on MRI .
Genetic linkage analysis strongly suggests that this disorder is not linked to the 3p21 hereditary vascular retinopathy/cerebroretinal vasculopathy/HERNS locus .
The authors describe a novel hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> condition affecting both retinal and cerebral vessels and characterized by infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiparesis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine with aura <END> , retinal hemorrhage , retinal arterial tortuosity , and leukoencephalopathy with dilatation of perivascular spaces and microbleeds on brain MRI . Investigation of additional families should help to map the gene and to better categorize the spectrum of hereditary cerebroretinal small vessel diseases .
Mice lacking doublecortin and doublecortin-like kinase 2 display altered hippocampal neuronal maturation and spontaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Mutations in doublecortin ( DCX ) are associated with intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in humans , due to a severe disorganization of the neocortex and hippocampus known as classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
However , the basis of the <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> remains unclear .
To address potential functional redundancy with murin Dcx , we targeted one of the closest homologues , doublecortin-like kinase 2 ( Dclk2 ) . Here , we report that Dcx ; Dclk2-null mice display frequent spontaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> that originate in the hippocampus , with most animals dying in the first few months of life .
Elevated hippocampal expression of c-fos and loss of somatostatin-positive interneurons were identified , both known to correlate with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Dcx and Dclk2 are coexpressed in developing hippocampus , and , in their absence , there is dosage-dependent disrupted hippocampal lamination associated with a cell-autonomous simplification of pyramidal dendritic arborizations leading to reduced inhibitory synaptic tone .
These data suggest that hippocampal dysmaturation and insufficient receptive field for inhibitory input may underlie the <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for controlling <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in these patients .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Sclerocornea <END> associated with the chromosome 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome .
Reported ocular findings in the 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome ( which encompasses the phenotypes of DiGeorge , velocardiofacial , and Takao ( conotruncal-anomaly-face ) syndromes ) have included <START:PHENOTYPE> posterior embryotoxon <END> ( prominent , anteriorly displaced Schwalbe 's line at the corneal limbus or edge ) , retinal vascular tortuosity , eyelid hooding , strabismus , and astigmatism .
We present seven 22q11 .2 patients from multiple centers with <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> , an eye finding previously unreported in the literature .
Four boys and three girls were identified with <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> , systemic DGS/VCFS findings , and fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH)-confirmed microdeletion at chromosome 22q11 .2 .
FISH diagnosis was perinatal in six patients but at 2 years of age in one child .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Sclerocornea <END> was bilateral in five patients .
Findings included descemetocele ( five eyes) , microophthalmos ( one eye ) , iridocorneal adhesions ( one bilateral case) , and severe anterior segment dysgenesis ( one eye ) .
Two patients underwent bilateral corneal transplantation ; another two were scheduled for possible unilateral transplant .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Sclerocornea <END> is a static congenital condition in which the cornea is opaque and vascularized and resembles the sclera .
The novel finding of <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> suggests that a genetic locus at 22q11 .2 may be involved in anterior segment embryogenesis .
In most of our patients , the diagnostic process was underway , but in one patient 22q11 .2 deletion was not suspected until after the child had already been undergoing treatment for <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> for 2 years .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Sclerocornea <END> should be added to the clinical manifestations of the 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome .
Ophthalmologists diagnosing <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> in children with systemic findings suggestive of 22q11 .2 deletion should ensure appropriate genetic referral .

A single BRCA2 mutation in male and female <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> families from Iceland with varied cancer phenotypes .
The BRCA2 gene on chromosome 13 has been shown to be associated with familial male and female <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Here we describe a study on BRCA2 in 21 Icelandic families , including 9 with male <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
We have previously reported linkage to the BRCA2 region in an Icelandic male <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> family and subsequently found a strong indication of linkage to BRCA2 and the same BRCA2 haplotype in <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> cases from 15 additional families , indicating a common origin .
We describe a five base-pair deletion in exon 9 of BRCA2 in an affected male from the male <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> family .
The same mutation occurs in all the families with the shared BRCA2 haplotype indicating a founder effect .
Among mutation carriers there are 12 males with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , which accounts for 40% of all males diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in Iceland over the past 40 years .
Three of them have no family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> indicating that this mutation may have variable penetrance .
The same BRCA2 mutation appears to be associated with different cancer phenotypes in this population including male and female <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , prostate cancer , pancreas cancer and ovarian cancer .
A new locus ( SPG47 ) maps to 1p13.2-1p12 in an Arabic family with complicated <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary spastic paraplegia and <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> .
The hereditary spastic paraplegias ( HSP ) are a heterogeneous group of genetic neurodegenerative disorders in which the main feature is progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> of the lower limbs due to pyramidal tract dysfunction .
Clinically HSP are divided into two forms : a pure form that presents with progressive lower limb <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> and weakness , sensory signs and bladder dysfunction , and a complicated form , associated with more extensive neurological and extra neurological signs as well as pathological findings on brain imaging .
The clinical variability observed in HSP is supported by the large underlying genetic heterogeneity .
Hereditary spastic paraplegia with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> ( HSP-TCC ) is a frequent subtype of complicated HSP clinically characterized by a <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> spastic paraparesis with cognitive impairment and <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> ( TCC ) .
SPG11 , the most frequent gene associated with HSP-TCC , encodes spatacsin , a protein of unknown function .
We describe two siblings from an Arabic consanguineous family with <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> spastic paraparesis , mental retardation , seizures , <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> periventricular white matter abnormalities <END> .
Homozygosity mapping identified a novel single candidate region of 7.3 Mb on chromosome 1p13.2-1p12 .
The finding of a new locus for AR-HSP-TC C further demonstrates the extensive genetic heterogeneity of this condition .

A new syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypoparathyroidism <END> , severe growth failure , and dysmorphic features .
Twelve infants (six boys , six girls ) with severe hypocalcaemic <START:PHENOTYPE> tetany <END> or convulsions were seen over a three year period .
Nine patients were symptomatic in the newborn period .
Their <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcaemia <END> was associated with hyperphosphataemia and very low concentrations of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone .
None of the babies suffered from congenital cardiac disease .
Cell mediated immunity , measured in five patients , was normal .
There were no chromosomal abnormalities but all patients shared several dysmorphic features including deep set eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thin lips <END> , beaked nose tip , external ear anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> of varying degree was found in all patients .
All had severe intrauterine and <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> .
Four patients have died .
The remaining eight patients are on treatments with vitamin D and calcium supplements with no change in their growth pattern .
We believe that this association of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypoparathyroidism <END> with severe growth failure and dysmorphism represents a new syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Robin sequence <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft mandible <END> , pre/postaxial hand anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfeet <END> in male patients .
We report on 2 unrelated Brazilian boys with the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Robin sequence <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft mandible <END> , pre/postaxial hand anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfeet <END> .
This is the first report of male patients .
The syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> pontocerebellar hypoplasia <END> , microcephaly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal dyskinesia <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> pontocerebellar hypoplasia <END> type 2 ) : compiled data from 10 pedigrees .
The syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> pontocerebellar hypoplasia <END> , microcephaly , severely impaired mental and motor development , and <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal dyskinesia <END> is a distinct system degeneration , previously designated <START:PHENOTYPE> pontocerebellar hypoplasia <END> type 2 ( PCH-2 ) . To further characterize its clinical and neuroimaging features , we compiled data from 10 nonrelated pedigrees .
Six pedigrees were Dutch , two Swedish , and two German .
All 16 patients showed an identical profile of virtually absent developmental milestones , early-onset severe chorea , and microcephaly together with <START:PHENOTYPE> pontocerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
Family distribution supports <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> transmission .
The present data support the PCH-2 phenotype as a distinct neurogenetic entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> foveal hypoplasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> presenile cataracts <END> .
A new syndrome .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome of mild <START:PHENOTYPE> foveal hypoplasia <END> ( visual acuity , 20/50 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nystagmus <END> , corneal pannus , and <START:PHENOTYPE> presenile cataracts <END> was seen in four patients from a single family .
There is variable expressivitly of this trait .
The differential diagnosis includes aniridia , ocular albinism , and isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> foveal hypoplasia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cataract <END> surgery is indicated for affected patients with substantial <START:PHENOTYPE> visual impairment <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> stapes ankylosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> broad thumbs <END> and toes , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperopia <END> , and skeletal anomalies is caused by heterozygous nonsense and frameshift mutations in NOG , the gene encoding noggin .
Although fixation of the stapes is usually progressive and secondary to otosclerosis , it may present congenitally , with other skeletal manifestations , as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome-such as proximal symphalangism ( SYM1 ) or multiple-synostoses syndrome ( SYNS1 ) , both of which are caused by mutations in NOG , the gene encoding noggin .
We describe a family that was ascertained to have nonsyndromic otosclerosis but was subsequently found to have a <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital stapes ankylosis <END> syndrome that included <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperopia <END> , a hemicylindrical nose , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad thumbs <END> and great toes , and other minor skeletal anomalies but lacked symphalangism .
A heterozygous nonsense NOG mutation-c.328C-->T ( Q11 0X) , predicted to truncate the latter half of the protein-was identified , and a heterozygous insertion in NOG-c.252-253insC , in which the frameshift is predicted to result in 96 novel amino acids before premature truncation-was identified in a previously described second family with a similar phenotype .
In contrast to most NOG mutations that have been reported in kindreds with SYM1 and SYNS1 , the mutations observed in these families with <START:PHENOTYPE> stapes ankylosis <END> without symphalangism are predicted to disrupt the cysteine-rich C-terminal domain .
These clinical and molecular findings suggest that (1 ) a broader range of conductive hearing-loss phenotypes are associated with NOG mutations than had previously been recognized , (2 ) patients with sporadic or familial nonsyndromic otosclerosis should be evaluated for mild features of this syndrome , and (3 ) NOG alterations should be considered in <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> with subtle clinical and skeletal features , even in the absence of symphalangism .
New <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> lethal disorder with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidneys <END> type Potter I , characteristic face , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , brachymelia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defects <END> .
We report on 3 pairs of sibs from unrelated families , who present with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidneys <END> Potter type I claimed to be specific for the ARPKD , and with microbrachycephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , large posteriorly angulated fleshy ears and various congenital malformations including <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defects <END> .
We suggest that they represent a previously unrecognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> lethal developmental disorder within the group of infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> and Potter sequence .
Mutations in CYP24A1 and idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> infantile hypercalcemia <END> .
Vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of rickets is one of the oldest and most effective prophylactic measures in medicine , having virtually eradicated rickets in North America . Given the potentially toxic effects of vitamin D , the recommendations for the optimal dose are still debated , in part owing to the increased incidence of idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> infantile hypercalcemia <END> in Britain in the 1950s during a period of high vitamin D supplementation in fortified milk products .
We investigated the molecular basis of idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> infantile hypercalcemia <END> , which is characterized by severe hypercalcemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dehydration <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> .
We used a candidate-gene approach in a cohort of familial cases of typical idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> infantile hypercalcemia <END> with suspected <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Identified mutations in the vitamin D-metabolizing enzyme CYP24A1 were evaluated with the use of a mammalian expression system .
Sequence analysis of CYP24A1 , which encodes 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase , the key enzyme of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D(3 ) degradation , revealed recessive mutations in six affected children .
In addition , CYP24A1 mutations were identified in a second cohort of infants in whom severe hypercalcemia had developed after bolus prophylaxis with vitamin D . Functional characterization revealed a complete loss of function in all CYP24A1 mutations .
The presence of CYP24A1 mutations explains the increased sensitivity to vitamin D in patients with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> infantile hypercalcemia <END> and is a genetic risk factor for the development of symptomatic hypercalcemia that may be triggered by vitamin D prophylaxis in otherwise apparently healthy infants .
Toriello-Carey syndrome : evidence for X-linked inheritance .
Toriello-Carey syndrome is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Robin sequence <END> , abnormal ears , cardiac anomalies , and hypotonia .
We describe two patients with Toriello-Carey syndrome and call attention to an unbalanced sex ratio .
The first patient , a male , was born at term by Cesarean section and manifests <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , cleft soft palate , hypoplastic right ear , anotia on the left side , cerebellar vermis hypoplasia , hydrocephalus , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , and hypoplastic left heart .
He died 2 days after birth .
The second patient is the male sib of a patient reported previously [Am J Med Genet 42 : 374-376 ; 1992 ] .
He had large fontanelles , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> , small and <START:PHENOTYPE> malformed ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , a large ventricular septal defect , and pulmonary stenosis .
At age 8 months he has growth retardation and developmental delay .
A sister is unaffected .
Review documented eight other patients with Toriello-Carey syndrome , six of whom were male .
The two female patients are less severely affected and are still alive .
Of the other male patients , all are deceased except one who is still alive at age 5 years ; he has severe growth retardation ( -3 SD) , mental retardation ( DQ44 ) , severe speech delay , and characteristic anomalies .
The predominance of affected males and the milder phenotype in the female patients suggests an X-linked gene or sex influenced gene .
POLG1 manifestations in childhood .
Mitochondrial DNA polymerase Î³ ( POLG1 ) mutations in children often manifest as Alpers syndrome , whereas in adults , a common manifestation is mitochondrial recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> syndrome ( MIRAS ) with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Because some patients with MIRAS have presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> already in childhood , we searched for POLG1 mutations in neurologic manifestations in childhood .
We investigated POLG1 in 136 children , all clinically suspected to have mitochondrial disease , with one or more of the following : <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , axonal neuropathy , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> without known <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome , epileptic encephalopathy , encephalohepatopathy , or neuropathologically verified Alpers syndrome .
Seven patients had POLG1 mutations , and all of them had severe encephalopathy with intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Four patients had died after exposure to sodium valproate .
Brain MRI showed parieto-occipital or thalamic hyperintense lesions , white matter abnormality , and atrophy.
Muscle histology and mitochondrial biochemistry results were normal in all .
POLG1 analysis should belong to the first-line DNA diagnostic tests for children with an encephalitis-like presentation evolving into epileptic encephalopathy with liver involvement ( Alpers syndrome ) , even if brain MRI and morphology , respiratory chain activities , and the amount of mitochondrial DNA in the skeletal muscle are normal .
POLG1 analysis should precede valproate therapy in pediatric patients with a typical phenotype .
However , POLG1 is not a common cause of isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> in childhood .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , costovertebral dysplasia and <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel anomaly <END> with autosomal dominant inheritance .
A malformation syndrome affecting a mother and her three daughters is reported .
The patients showed various combinations of the following malformations and anomalies : spontaneously arrested communicating <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , costovertebral dysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel anomaly <END> ( undescended scapula) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , broad and <START:PHENOTYPE> low nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nostrils <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , prominent mandibula , <START:PHENOTYPE> enamel hypoplasia <END> and increased interspace between the 1st and 2nd toes .
The occurrence of similar abnormalities in the mother and her three daughters and the variable expression of the manifestations indicate that the syndrome was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait .
Agenesis of the corpus callosum and <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hemimegalencephaly <END> in the <START:PHENOTYPE> sebaceous nevus <END> syndrome .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> sebaceous nevus <END> syndrome is sometimes associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hemimegalencephaly <END> and a group of related abnormalities including ipsilateral gyral malformation , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , especially infantile spasms , and facial hemihypertrophy.
This combination has been described as the " neurological variant of epidermal nevus syndrome. " Other brain malformations have been reported only rarely .
We report on a child with a subtle <START:PHENOTYPE> sebaceous nevus <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hemimegalencephaly <END> who also had agenesis of the corpus callosum and <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> : probable linkage to acid phosphatase-1 locus on chromosome 2 . Maximum likelihood analysis for linkage between <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> and 12 biochemical and serological markers in a single large family showed a probable linkage between <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> and the enzyme acid phosphatase-1 .
The presence of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> gene linked to acid phosphatase-1 on chromosome arm 2p and the existence of an <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> syndrome resulting from deletion of band 13 of the short arm of chromosome 11 establishes a chromosome basis for genetic heterogeneity of <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> phenotypes .
Cerebro-facio-thoracic dysplasia : report of three cases .
Three children , two girls and one boy , are described as suffering from a new syndrome , ' cerebro-facio-thoracic dysplasia ' .
The characteristic findings are <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , characteristic facies , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bushy eyebrows <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nose <END> , wide philtrum , triangular-shaped mouth , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> maxillary hypoplasia <END> , a low hairline ( especially posteriorly in the midline on the neck ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , calcified clinoid ligements , and multiple bony abnormalities in the upper thoracic vertebrae and sometimes in the cervical region , together with a variety of deformities of the upper ribs .
It seems possible that the condition is hereditary and that it may be inherited as a result of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
Inherited superactivity of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase : association of uric acid overproduction and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
Superactivity of 5- phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate ( PP-Rib-P ) synthetase , inherited as an X chromosome-linked trait , has been reported in nearly 20 families in which overproduction of uric acid is invariably present in hemizygous affected males .
Clinical manifestations of PP-Rib-P synthetase superactivity are mainly limited to <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> in early adulthood .
Neurologic deficits , including <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , have rarely been described .
We herein document the association of PP-Rib-P synthetase superactivity , <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> with excessive uric acid synthesis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> in an additional family .
Two members of a Spanish family were studied : an eight-year-old boy ( Patient 1 ) with tophaceous <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> , purine nucleotide and uric acid overproduction , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , and his 27-year-old mother ( Patient 2) , who had <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> .
Fibroblast cultures were initiated from skin biopsy specimens , and measurements of PP-Rib-P and purine nucleotide metabolism in the fibroblasts were performed .
A labile but superactive PP-Rib-P synthetase was demonstrated in the fibroblasts cultured from both Patients 1 and 2 .
The kinetic basis of PP-Rib-P synthetase superactivity in this family was resistance to purine nucleotide inhibition of enzyme activity .
More severe derangements in the enzyme and in PP-Rib-P and purine synthesis in Patient 1 ' s cells than in Patient 2 's cells suggest that Patient 1 is hemizygous and Patient 2 is heterozygous for an X chromosome-linked genetic defect .
Limited pedigree data support this view .
Compared with affected members of seven other families with PP-Rib-P synthetase superactivity , these patients are intermediate in the range of clinical expression and in the severity of the enzyme defect as measured by the degree of aberration of PP-Rib-P and purine nucleotide synthesis in fibroblasts .
Metabolic abnormalities were more severe in Patient 1 ' s cells than in the cells of most male patients ( in whom clinical expression is limited to early adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> ) but were less severe than in the cells of two patients in whom more complex enzyme defects were associated with uric acid overproduction and neurodevelopmental abnormalities ( including deafness ) in male children and adult women .
Certain defects resulting in PP-Rib-P synthetase superactivity may be causally related to neurologic impairment , most commonly <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
Recessive congenital total <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and heterozygote carrier signs caused by a novel missense CRYAA mutation ( R54C ) .
To determine the genetic basis for congenital total white <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> in three affected siblings .
Prospective interventional case series .
Clinical ophthalmic examination , venous blood sampling for linkage analyses , and diagnostic testing of identified candidate gene(s ) .
Three siblings had congenital total white <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> ; the parents and seven other siblings were asymptomatic .
Linkage analysis mapped the phenotype to Hsa 21q22.3 , the region of the gene for the alpha-A component of alpha-crystallin ( CRYAA ) , with a logarithm of odds ( LOD ) score of 2.5 . Diagnostic CRYAA sequencing revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation ( R54C ) in the three affected individuals only .
One other sibling and the two parents were heterozygotes ; these individuals had punctuate lenticular opacities evident by careful slit-lamp biomicroscopy which were not present in the noncarriers , all of whom had unremarkable ophthalmic examinations .
R54C is the second reported recessive CRYAA mutation associated with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and the first with described morphology : punctuate lenticular opacities in carriers and congenital total white <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> in homozygotes .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> may have been caused by an inductive effect on the developing cornea from the abnormal lens and/or reduced CRYAA molecular chaperoning of the cornea .
Rare chromosomal deletions and duplications increase risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Schizophrenia <END> is a severe mental disorder marked by <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delusions <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive deficits <END> and apathy , with a heritability estimated at 73 -90 % ( ref . 1 ) .
Inheritance patterns are complex , and the number and type of genetic variants involved are not understood .
Copy number variants ( CNVs ) have been identified in individual patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and also in neurodevelopmental disorders , but large-scale genome-wide surveys have not been performed .
Here we report a genome-wide survey of rare CNVs in 3,391 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and 3 ,181 ancestrally matched controls , using high-density microarrays .
For CNVs that were observed in less than 1 % of the sample and were more than 100 kilobases in length , the total burden is increased 1 .15 -fold in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> in comparison with controls .
This effect was more pronounced for rarer , single-occurrence CNVs and for those that involved genes as opposed to those that did not .
As expected , deletions were found within the region critical for velo-cardio-facial syndrome , which includes psychotic symptoms in 30% of patients .
Associations with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> were also found for large deletions on chromosome 15q13.3 and 1q21.1 .
These associations have not previously been reported , and they remained significant after genome-wide correction .
Our results provide strong support for a model of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> pathogenesis that includes the effects of multiple rare structural variants , both genome-wide and at specific loci .
TWIST gene mutation in a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> radial aplasia <END> and craniosynostosis : further evidence for heterogeneity of Baller-Gerold syndrome .
The term Baller-Gerold syndrome was coined by Cohen [ 1979 : Birth Defects 15 ( 5B ) : 13-63 ] to designate the phenotype of craniosynostosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> radial aplasia <END> .
It is thought to be a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition , which , in some patients , presents with additional abnormalities , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> anal atresia <END> .
A phenotypic overlap of Baller-Gerold and Roberts-SC phocomelia syndrome was noted when a patient with bicoronal synostosis and bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> radial hypoplasia <END> was found to have premature centromere separation , a finding characteristic of Roberts syndrome [ Huson et al. ,199 0 : J Med Genet 27:371 -375 ] . Other cases of presumed Baller-Gerold syndrome were rediagnosed as Fanconi pancytopenia , Rothmund-Thomson syndrome or VACTERL association .
These reports led to a narrowed redefinition of Baller-Gerold syndrome based on the exclusion of cytogenetic and hematopoetic abnormalities and the absence of additional malformations in patients with craniosynostosis and preaxial upper limb abnormalities .
Here we report on a patient with unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> radial aplasia <END> and bicoronal synostosis without additional malformations and without chromosome breakage , who fits this narrow definition of Baller-Gerold syndrome .
We identified a novel TWIST gene mutation in this patient , a Glu181Stop mutation predicting a premature termination of the protein carboxy-terminal to the helix 2 domain .
This report provides further evidence that Baller-Gerold is of heterogeneous cause , and a thorough evaluation is indicated to identify a possibly more specific diagnosis , including Saethre-Chotzen syndrome .
This differential diagnosis is of particular importance , as it is an autosomal dominant trait .
Therefore , the recurrence risk for parents of an affected child can be 5 0 % if one parent carries the mutation , as opposed to the 25% recurrence risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Offspring of the affected patient also have a 5 0 % risk to inherit the mutation , while the risk to bear an affected offspring for an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait is very low .
The Bowen-Conradi syndrome -- a highly lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low birth weight <END> , and joint deformities .
This paper describes six Hutterite children from five families who appear to have been affected by the same syndrome that was described in two brothers by Bowen and Conradi [1 ] .
Our additional cases confirm that the major features of the syndrome include porportionate <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rocker-bottom feet <END> , joint limitation , and failure to thrive , with death within the first year of life .
Bowen-Conradi syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait and pedigree records show that all six families now known are related to each other through two couples born in the late 1700s but that there are additional earlier possible sources of the responsible gene .
The differential diagnosis of this syndrome is discussed .
Sex linked <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> : Wilde revisited .
Sex linked recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is a rare cause of male genetic <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , estimated to account for 6.2% of male genetic <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> in 1966 .
A male excess was found in the deaf population of Ireland in 1851 .
Reevaluation of this survey of 1851 confirms sex linked <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> as a factor in the disproportionate number of deaf males and suggests that 5 % of congenital male <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> was the result of sex linked recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
This study confirms that a small but constant proportion of male <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is the result of sex linked recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
The figure derived is used to calculate an empirical risk for carrier status in female sibs of isolated cases of male <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
The phenotype of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> homeobox gene ( SHOX ) deficiency in childhood : contrasting children with Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis and Turner syndrome .
To evaluate the growth disorder and phenotype in prepubertal children with Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis ( LWD) , a dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasia , and to compare the findings from girls with Turner syndrome ( TS ) .
We studied the auxologic and phenotypic characteristics in 34 prepubertal LWD subjects ( ages 1 to 10 years ; 20 girls , 14 boys ) with confirmed <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> homeobox-containing gene ( SHOX ) abnormalities .
For comparative purposes , we evaluated similar physical and growth parameters in 76 girls with TS ( ages 1 to 19 years ) and 24 girls with LWD ( ages 1 to 15 years ) by using data collected from the postmarketing observational study , GeNeSIS.
In the clinic sample LWD subjects , height standard deviation score ranged from -5.5 to + 0.1 ( -2.3 +/- 1.3 , girls and -1.8 +/- 0.6 , boys ) .
Wrist changes related to <START:PHENOTYPE> Madelung deformity <END> were present in 18 of 34 ( 53% ) LWD subjects .
In comparing the LWD and TS populations in the GeNeSIS sample , <START:PHENOTYPE> Madelung deformity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> increased carrying angle <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> were more prevalent in the LWD population , whereas <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> was similarly prevalent in the two populations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Short stature <END> is common in both LWD ( girls and boys ) and TS ( girls ) .
Clinical clues to the diagnosis of SHOX haploinsufficiency in childhood include <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , short limbs , wrist changes , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tibial bowing <END> .
A lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple congenital contractures <END> .
We describe 16 cases of a lethal syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple congenital contractures <END> from ten families .
The main clinical findings included intrauterine growth retardation with marked fetal <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops <END> , multiple contractures , and facial abnormalities , especially <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
At autopsy , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular atrophy <END> were present .
There was a <START:PHENOTYPE> paucity of anterior horn motor neurons <END> in the four studied cases .
We think that the cases represent the same clinical entity , probably caused by homozygosity of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> gene .
The syndrome resembles the Pena-Shokeir I syndrome , but seems to differ in some respects , including length of survival and presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops <END> .
Prenatal diagnosis of this syndrome is possible after the 16th week of pregnancy with ultrasound .
Familial infantile bilateral striatal necrosis : clinical features and response to biotin treatment .
Infantile bilateral striatal necrosis ( IBSN ) encompasses several syndromes of bilateral symmetric , spongy degeneration of the caudate nucleus , putamen , and globus pallidus .
The familial form of IBSN is rare , and inheritance is either <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> or maternal .
The authors describe an Israeli Bedouin kindred in which 15 children born to consanguineous parents were affected with familial IBSN .
They evaluated the clinical and radiologic evolution of the disease in 11 patients and the cerebral pathologic findings in one patient .
Three of the children were treated with oral biotin 100 mg/day .
Inheritance was apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
The untreated children had a similar clinical picture including <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental arrest <END> beginning at the age of 7 to 15 months , <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pendular nystagmus <END> appeared at a late stage .
MRI , performed at various stages of the disease , showed severe basal ganglia atrophy.
Postmortem study in one patient showed severe atrophy of the lenticular nuclei with gliosis and loss of neurons .
Biotin , 100 mg/day , administered to the proband over a period of 15 months , may have slowed progression .
In two other children treatment was initiated earlier and appeared to arrest or improve disease .
Familial infantile bilateral striatal necrosis was inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
Clinical features included <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental arrest <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> .
Imaging and pathology showed atrophy and degeneration of the basal ganglia .
Oral biotin may have benefited three children .
Genetics of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
The genetic basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> is reviewed and the following conclusions are drawn : 1 ) The mode of inheritance of the hereditary variety of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( R ) is <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> with about 90 % penetrance .
2 ) About 68 % of inherited cases are bilateral , and about 32% , unilateral .
There is an intrafamilial correlation between penetrance as measured by segregation ratio and expressivity as measured by the fraction of bilaterally affected patients .
3 ) The vast majority of all R patients are <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases , i.e. , they are the only affected members of otherwise unaffected families .
The porportion of bilateral cases is much lower among <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> than among hereditary cases .
4 ) All bilaterally affected patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> R and patients with unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> R with more than one primary tumor have to be regarded as germ cell mutants ; they will transmit the gene to 5 0 % of their offspring .
Only 10%-12 % of unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases are germ cell mutants ; 88 %-90 % are nonhereditary ; in these cases the tumor is probably caused by a <START:PHENOTYPE> somatic mutation <END> .
5 ) In a minority of cases , deletion of the chromosome segment 13q14 ( =intersitital deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13 ) has been observed .
In addition to R , the patients show a variable degree of general or mental retardation ; often there are few external indications of a chromosome aberration . Other chromosome studies suggest anomalies of chromosome 13 in tumor tissue even in cases not showing an anomaly of this chromosome in blood cultures , and possibly a slightly increased chromosome instability .
6 ) Patients with bilateral , and possibly in general with hereditary , R run an increased risk of becoming affected with other tumor diseases , such as osseous sarcomas , in later life .
7 ) Knudson 's hypothesis of two mutational steps leading to both the hereditary and the nonhereditary variants of R is discussed critically , and the alternative possibility is suggested that in the nonhereditary variant a single mutational step--possibly a small chromosome aberration--could be enough to produce a tumor .
8 ) Evidence indicating a possible viral origin of R is cited , and animal experiments are mentioned in which R-like tumors have successfully been produced by local DNA virus inoculation .
9 ) As a consequence of improved survival and reproduction of R patients , an increased in the incidence of R and in the proportion of bilateral cases among all R patients must be anticipated .
10 ) Detailed rules for genetic counseling in families affected by R are given .
Congenital , low penetrance <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> of lower limbs maps to chromosome 6q16 .2-q22.1 in an inbred Pakistani family .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> is a rare , lymphatic disorder resulting in the chronic swelling of the extremities .
It shows wide inter- and intra-familial clinical heterogeneity as well as variability in the age of onset .
There are more than four genetically distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> conditions known and mutations in three genes have been discovered in families with <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> .
However , many other familial lymphedemas do not show linkage with the known loci , suggesting genetic heterogeneity .
Here , we describe a large inbred Pakistani family with congenital , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> confined to the lower limbs , which fades away at 40-45 years of age .
This condition segregates in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion with <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced penetrance <END> .
The features are close to primary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> I , Nonne-Milory type ( MIM 153100 ) .
We exclude this condition for linkage to the known loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> by employing highly polymorphic microsatellite markers from these intervals .
Then , through a genome-wide linkage study we show that the malformation in our family maps to chromosome 6q16 .2-q22.1 .
The highest pair-wise LOD score ( Z(max ) = 3.19 ) was obtained with microsatellite marker D6S1671 , and a multipoint score of 3.75 was obtained at 108 cM . Haplotype analysis indicated that the critical interval in this family flanks between markers D6S1716 and D6S303 .
Mutation analysis in FOXO3 , a likely candidate within this interval , did not show any pathogenic change in the affected family subjects .
Our study provides an evidence of a second locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> type I .
The discovery of the underlying gene could be helpful for the understanding of this heterogeneous hereditary condition .
Genetics of <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> and associated syndromes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microtia <END> is a congenital anomaly , characterised by a small , abnormally shaped auricle ( pinna ) .
It is usually accompanied by a narrow , blocked or <START:PHENOTYPE> absent ear <END> canal .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microtia <END> can occur as the only clinical abnormality or as part of a syndrome .
The estimated prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> is 0.8-4.2 per 10 000 births , and it is more common in men .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microtia <END> can have a genetic or environmental predisposition .
Mendelian hereditary forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> with an autosomal dominant or recessive mode of inheritance , and some forms due to chromosomal aberrations have been reported .
Several responsible genes have been identified , most of them being homeobox genes .
Mouse models have been very useful to study these genes , providing valuable information on the development of the auditory system .
In this article , we review the epidemiological characteristics of <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> and the environmental causes involved .
In addition , we discuss the development of the auditory system , specifically the relevant aspects of external and middle ear development .
The focus of this review is to discuss the genetic aspects of <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> and associated syndromes .
The clinical aspects of various disorders involving <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> are also discussed in relation to the genes that are causing them .
Familial clustering of <START:PHENOTYPE> IgA nephropathy <END> : further evidence in an Italian population .
Several lines of evidence suggest that genetic factors have an important role in the pathogenesis of immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) nephropathy.
We report the prevalence of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> IgA nephropathy <END> in a referral center in northern Italy and present the data on HLA genotypes in the families identified .
Twenty-six of 185 patients ( 14% ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> IgA nephropathy <END> investigated in Brescia , Italy , were related to at least one other patient with the disease .
Restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) analysis of HLA-DR beta and HLA-DQ alpha and beta genes , as well as polymerase chain reaction-based oligonucleotide typing , was performed in family members .
The 26 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> IgA nephropathy <END> belonged to 10 families .
Familial relationships between the patients varied greatly , ranging from parent-child to sib-pair to more distant familial relationships .
No common nephrotoxic factor was identified in the families .
The intervals separating the apparent onset of disease in relatives with <START:PHENOTYPE> IgA nephropathy <END> varied from 8 months to 13 years .
In patients with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> IgA nephropathy <END> , there was an increased incidence of HLA-DRB1* 08 compared with those with sporadic IgA nephropathy.
The study shows that a significant number of the patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> IgA nephropathy <END> followed up in Brescia had a family history of disease .
The fact that the Italian population , an ethnic group not previously examined , also presents an increased familial susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> IgA nephropathy <END> suggests that familial predisposition is a very common finding for IgA nephropathy.
Thus , clinicians should become aware that <START:PHENOTYPE> IgA nephropathy <END> may aggregate within families in a substantial number of cases .
In addition , this subgroup of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> IgA nephropathy <END> offers an ideal opportunity to elucidate the molecular genetics of this disease .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> CHARGE-like Abruzzo-Erickson syndrome and classic <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> result from TBX22 splicing mutations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ( CPX ) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the TBX22 transcription factor and is known to exhibit phenotypic variability , usually involving either a complete , partial or submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> .
This study hypothesized a possible involvement of TBX22 in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> , CHARGE-like Abruzzo-Erickson syndrome , of unknown etiology .
The phenotype extends to additional features including <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , which are suggested by the Tbx22 developmental expression pattern but not previously associated in CPX patients .
A novel TBX22 splice acceptor mutation ( c.593-5T>A ) was identified that tracked with the phenotype in this family .
A novel splice donor variant ( c.76 7+5G >A ) and a known canonical splice donor mutation ( c.76 7 +1G>A ) affecting the same exon were identified in patients with classic CPX phenotypes and were comparatively analyzed using both in silico and in vitro splicing studies .
All three variants were predicted to abolish normal mRNA splicing and an in vitro assay indicated that use of alternative splice sites was a likely outcome .
Collectively , the data showed the functional effect of several novel intronic splice site variants but most importantly confirms that TBX22 is the gene underlying Abruzzo-Erickson syndrome , expanding the phenotypic spectrum of TBX22 mutations .

Linkage heterogeneity of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> has been shown to be closely linked to the alpha-hemoglobin complex on the short arm of chromosome 16 .
We describe a five-generation kindred , descendants of Sicilian immigrants , in which the disease occurs but without linkage to the alpha-hemoglobin complex .
DNA probes were used in genetic-linkage studies on blood samples from 163 family members , of whom 71 were affected by or at risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
Diagnoses were confirmed by ultrasound examination .
In this family the frequency of recombination between the alpha-hemoglobin complex and the region previously shown to contain the mutation causing <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> exceeded 24 percent , indicating a mutation at a different locus .
The clinical findings in this family were indistinguishable from those in other families with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
We conclude that there is a second gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
This apparent heterogeneity means that prenatal and presymptomatic diagnosis must be approached with caution until a method is found to distinguish between the two forms of the disease .
A newly recognized syndrome with characteristic facial features , skeletal dysplasia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
We describe a series of seven male patients from six different families with skeletal dysplasia , characteristic facial features , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
Skeletal findings include patellar dislocation , short tubular bones , mild metaphyseal changes , brachymetacarpalia with stub thumbs , <START:PHENOTYPE> short femoral necks <END> , shallow acetabular roofs , and <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> .
Facial features include : a flattened midface with broad nasal bridge , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid uvula <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> .
All of the patients demonstrated pre-school onset of a cognitive <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> with a shortened attention span .
Some of the <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive delay <END> was masked by a warm and engaging personality .
We posit that these individuals have a newly recognized syndrome characterized by the described features .
There is some phenotypic overlap between these patients and Desbuquois dysplasia ; however molecular testing demonstrated that this is a distinct disorder .
Given the family information available for each patient , we are suspicious that the constellation of findings reported herein could be an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> syndrome .

A case of Toriello-Carey syndrome with severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheal stenosis <END> .
Toriello-Carey syndrome is rare condition characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , the <START:PHENOTYPE> Pierre Robin sequence <END> , and facial anomalies such as <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> small nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> [Toriello and Carey , 1988 ] .
In addition , tracheal and <START:PHENOTYPE> laryngeal anomalies <END> are common complications in patients with Toriello-Carey syndrome , and these anomalies can lead to death [Kataoka et al. , 2003] .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheal stenosis <END> is a life-threatening condition with high mortality .
Even if surgery is successful , several serious complications can result in a high risk of mortality .
We describe a case of a Japanese boy with Toriello-Carey syndrome who had severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheal stenosis <END> , in whom surgical tracheal plasty was avoided because of adequate respiratory care , allowing the patient to be alive at 18 months of age .

Clinical relevance of point mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor gene in patients with severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Recently , point mutations in the gene of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) receptor have been reported in two patients with severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> who developed acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) .
We investigated the frequency of these specific G-CSF receptor mutations in patients with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> undergoing treatment with r-metHuG-CSF ( Filgrastim ) and the clinical relevance of these mutations .
Nucleotides 2306 to 2561 including the critical region ( nucleotides 2384-2429) from the intracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor gene were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction .
Detection of point mutations was performed with specific restriction enzyme analysis , as well as sequencing of PCR products .
Both genomic DNA and cDNA from neutrophils and mononuclear cells were analyzed from 28 patients with severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Four of 28 patients with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> displayed a point mutation in the tested cytoplasmic region of the G-CSF receptor gene .
The point mutations replace a glutamine codon by a stop codon of the G-CSF receptor gene .
Among these four congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> patients with a mutated G-CSF receptor , two developed AML .
All four patients were investigated regularly and no correlation between occurrence of G-CSF receptor mutation and time or dose of r-metHuG-CSF treatment was found .
No point mutations in the G-CSF receptor critical domain could be detected in cells from the other 24 congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> patients .
Furthermore , we tested six family members of the two patients with AML including mothers and fathers , one sister , and one brother who suffers from congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , as well .
All family members displayed a normal G-CSF receptor gene .
After the acquisition of the G-CSF receptor mutations , the congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> patients continued to respond to G-CSF therapy with an increase in absolute neutrophils in the peripheral blood .
We conclude that the point mutations in the critical region of the intracellular part of the G-CSF receptor occur spontaneously and are not inherited .
From our data , we suggest that the described G-CSF receptor point mutations do not alter the response to treatment with r-metHuG-CSF and are not the cause of severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
A new nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> linked to Xp21.2 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is a rare cause of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> .
We have identified a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> dominant sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> , characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity in carrier females , that is linked to the Xp21.2 , which contains the Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) locus .
The auditory impairment in affected males was congenital , bilateral , profound , sensorineural , affecting all frequencies , and without evidence of radiographic abnormality of the temporal bone .
Adult carrier females manifested bilateral , mild-to-moderate high-frequency sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> of delayed onset during adulthood .
Eighteen commercially available , polymorphic markers from the X chromosome , generating a 10-15 -cM map , were initially used for identification of a candidate region .
DXS997 , located within the DMD gene , generated a two-point LOD score of 2 .91 at theta = 0 , with every carrier mother heterozygous at this locus .
Recombination events at DXS992 ( located within the DMD locus , 3 ' to exon 50 of the dystrophin gene ) and at DXS1068 ( 5 ' to the brain promoter of the dystrophin gene ) were observed .
No recombination events were noted with the following markers within the DMD locus : 5 ' DYS II , intron 44 , DXS997 , and intron 5 0 .
There was no clinical evidence of Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy in any family member .
It is likely that this family represents a new locus on the X chromosome , which when mutated results in nonsyndromic sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> and is distinct from the heterogeneous group of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> hearing losses that have been previously described .
The genetic epidemiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> bulimia <END> nervosa .
The authors seek to clarify , from both an epidemiologic and genetic perspective , the major risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> bulimia <END> nervosa and to understand the relationship between narrowly defined <START:PHENOTYPE> bulimia <END> and bulimia-like syndromes .
Personal structured psychiatric interviews were conducted with 2 ,163 female twins from a population-based register .
Psychiatric disorders were assessed using DSM-III-R criteria .
Lifetime prevalence and risk for narrowly defined <START:PHENOTYPE> bulimia <END> were 2.8 % and 4.2% , respectively .
Including bulimia-like syndromes increased these estimates to 5.7% and 8.0% , respectively .
Risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> bulimia <END> included 1 ) birth after 1960 , 2 ) low paternal care , 3 ) a history of wide weight fluctuation , dieting , or frequent exercise , 4 ) a slim ideal body image , 5 ) low self-esteem , 6 ) an external locus of control , and 7 ) high levels of neuroticism .
Significant comorbidity was found between <START:PHENOTYPE> bulimia <END> and anorexia nervosa , alcoholism , panic disorder , generalized anxiety disorder , phobia , and major depression .
Proband-wise concordance for narrowly defined <START:PHENOTYPE> bulimia <END> was 22.9% in monozygotic and 8.7% in dizygotic twins .
The best-fitting model indicated that familial aggregation was due solely to genetic factors with a heritability of liability of 55 % .
A multiple threshold model indicated that narrowly defined <START:PHENOTYPE> bulimia <END> nervosa and bulimia-like syndromes represented different levels of severity on the same continuum of liability .
The liability to fully syndromal <START:PHENOTYPE> bulimia <END> nervosa , which affects around one in 25 women at some point in their lives , is substantially influenced by both epidemiologic and genetic risk factors .
The same factors that influence the risk for narrowly defined <START:PHENOTYPE> bulimia <END> also influence the risk for less severe bulimia-like syndromes .
A new family with paroxysmal exercise induced <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> : a clinical and genetic study .
To characterise the phenotype of a family with paroxysmal exercise induced <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> ( PED ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> and establish whether it is linked to the paroxysmal non-kinesigenic <START:PHENOTYPE> dyskinesia <END> ( PNKD ) locus on chromosome 2q33-35 , the familial hemiplegic <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> ( FHM ) locus on chromosome 19p , or the familial infantile convulsions and paroxysmal <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> ( ICCA syndrome ) locus on chromosome 16 . A family , comprising 30 members , was investigated .
Fourteen family members in two generations including three spouses were examined .
Haplotypes were reconstructed for all the available family members by typing several microsatellite markers spanning the PNKD , FHM , and ICCA loci .
Additionally , the four exons containing the known FHM mutations were sequenced .
Of 14 members examined four were definitely affected and one member was affected by history .
The transmission pattern in this family was <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced penetrance <END> .
Mean age of onset in affected members was 12 ( range 9-15 years ) .
Male to female ratio was 3:1 .
Attacks of PED in affected members were predominantly dystonic and lasted between 15 and 30 minutes .
They were consistently precipitated by walking but could also occur after other exercise .
Generalisation did not occur .
Three of the affected members in the family also had <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> without aura .
Linkage of the disease to the PNKD , FHM , or ICCA loci was excluded as no common haplotype was shared by all the affected members for each locus .
In addition , direct DNA sequential analysis of the FHM gene ( CACNL1A4 ) ruled out all known FHM point mutations .
This family presented with the classic phenotype of PED and is not linked to the PNKD , FHM , or ICCA loci .
A new gene , possibly coding for an ion channel , is likely to be the underlying cause of the disease .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> transmission of diabetes and congenital hearing impairment secondary to a missense mutation in the WFS1 gene .
Mutations of the WFS1 gene have been implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> diseases , such as low-frequency sensorineural hearing impairment ( LFSNHI ) and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and/or optic atrophy.
The aim was to investigate WFS1 gene sequences in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and hearing impairment .
Three members of a family with a maternally inherited combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and hearing impairment , but no specific mutations in its mitochondrial genome , were investigated for mutations in the WFS1 gene .
This pedigree , in which the proband had non-insulin-dependent <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and congenital hearing impairment and his mother a triple combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , hearing impairment and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , was found to be associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission of the E864K mutation of the WFS1 gene .
In the light of this confirmatory study , we recommend the systematic analysis of WFS1 gene sequences in patients with parentally inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and deafness ( + /- optic atrophy) , in particular when diabetogenic mtDNA mutations have been excluded .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> hypophosphataemic <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> is associated with mutations in FGF23.
Proper serum phosphate concentrations are maintained by a complex and poorly understood process .
Identification of genes responsible for inherited disorders involving disturbances in phosphate homeostasis may provide insight into the pathways that regulate phosphate balance .
Several hereditary disorders of isolated phosphate wasting have been described , including X-linked hypophosphataemic <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> ( XLH) , hypophosphataemic bone disease ( HBD) , hereditary hypophosphataemic <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> with hypercalciuria ( HHRH ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> hypophosphataemic <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> ( ADHR ) .
Inactivating mutations of the gene PHEX , encoding a member of the neutral endopeptidase family of proteins , are responsible for XLH ( refs 6 ,7 ) .
ADHR ( MIM 193100 ) is characterized by low serum phosphorus concentrations , <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> , lower extremity deformities , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bone pain <END> and dental abscesses .
Here we describe a positional cloning approach used to identify the ADHR gene which included the annotation of 37 genes within 4 Mb of genomic sequence .
We identified missense mutations in a gene encoding a new member of the fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) family , FGF23.
These mutations in patients with ADHR represent the first mutations found in a human FGF gene .
Absence of thumbs , A/hypoplasia of radius , hypoplasia of ulnae , <START:PHENOTYPE> retarded bone age <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , hypoplastic genitalia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The previously unreported combination of bilateral absence of thumbs , aplasia of ulna at one and hypoplasia of ulna on the other side , <START:PHENOTYPE> retarded bone age <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> is described in a 5-year-old boy .
Having excluded major differential diagnoses , e.g . Fanconi anemia , RAPADILINO syndrome and VACTERL association , we hypothesize that this boy represents a new multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation ( MCA/MR ) syndrome .
Absence of hypertensive retinopathy in a Turkish kindred with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly .
A 60 member Turkish kindred with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , which cosegregates completely with brachydactyly and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , was studied .
Affected people have severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and generally die of stroke by the age of 5 0 .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> closely resembles essential <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and , accordingly , the mechanisms of blood pressure elevation are unknown .
The gene responsible was mapped to chromosome 12p.
All 29 affected family members underwent a basic physical examination and funduscopy .
Other than markedly elevated blood pressures and the residua of stroke in a few subjects , the apparent lack of end organ damage was striking , including the normal appearing fundi .
Five affected individuals were studied in a clinical research unit study .
All underwent a complete ophthalmological examination .
Fluorescein angiograms were obtained in three subjects .
Systolic blood pressures ranged from 170 to 250 mm Hg , while diastolic blood pressures ranged from 100 to 150 mm Hg in affected individuals .
In all affected subjects , the fundi were only minimally altered or clinically normal .
All three fluorescein angiograms were normal .
Despite severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> since childhood the patients showed no signs of hypertensive retinopathy.
The absence of hypertensive retinopathy in this novel form of inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> is due to an altered structure of retinal arteriolar walls or some other protective mechanism .
Since evidence of end organ damage is scarce in other organs as well , the protective mechanism appears to be generalised .
Expression of human herpesvirus 8 in <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> constitutes a group of diseases characterized by complex , lumen-occluding vascular lesions that develop in genetically susceptible persons .
The only viral infection associated with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> has been that due to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 , but neither the viral genome nor viral antigens have been demonstrated in pathologic lesions .
We examined lung-tissue samples from 16 patients with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> and 14 patients with secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> for evidence of infection with human herpesvirus 8 ( HHV-8 ) .
HHV-8 infection was ascertained immunohistochemically with use of an antibody directed against latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 ( LANA-1 ) , and a polymerase-chain-reaction ( PCR ) assay was performed on lung DNA to detect the viral cyclin gene of HHV-8 .
Sequence analysis was also performed .
In lung tissue from 10 of 16 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> ( 62 percent ) , cells within the plexiform lesions as well as cells outside the lesions were positive for LANA-1 on immunohistochemical analysis .
Tissue from the same 10 patients contained viral cyclin on PCR analysis .
No LANA-1 was detected in lung tissue from patients with secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> , although one such patient had PCR evidence of viral cyclin .
Plexiform lesions from patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> had a histologic and immunohistochemical resemblance to cutaneous Kaposi 's sarcoma lesions .
The spectrum of trigger factors and molecular mechanisms leading to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> and the formation of plexiform lesions is apparently wide , including both genetic and epigenetic factors .
Our data suggest that infection with the vasculotropic virus HHV-8 may have a pathogenetic role in <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Dextrocardia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in an infant born to consanguineous parents .
We report on an infant ( born to consanguineous parents ) with an unusual face , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dextrocardia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
This child has many traits in common with an infant recently described by Aughton [ 1990 ] as a probable new syndrome .
Ovarian failure and <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> due to a novel lamin mutation .
Two unrelated young women presented with similar dysmorphic features including severe <START:PHENOTYPE> retrognathia <END> , beaked nose , narrow chest , <START:PHENOTYPE> sloping shoulders <END> , and an acrogeric appearance of the hands and feet .
Neither had any evidence of skeletal myopathy , but both developed progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , both experienced premature ovarian failure , and both were found to have the same heterozygous novel missense mutation c.176 T> G in exon 1 of the LMNA gene , resulting in a leucine to arginine change at codon 59 ( Leu59Arg ) .
Mutations in the LMNA gene cause a variety of disorders including <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , muscular dystrophy , familial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> , progeria , atypical progeroid syndromes , and mandibuloacral dysplasia .
Genotype-phenotype correlation has been reported for some of these conditions .
Our patients are the only ones known to have the specific mutation Leu59Arg and also share a set of features not entirely consistent with any of the laminopathies previously described .
A previously reported patient with an adjacent mutation ( Ala57Pro ) had "atypical Werner syndrome " with <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , hypogonadism , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sloping shoulders <END> .
While each of these clinical features does occur in other laminopathy syndromes , these patients form a phenotypic cluster distinct from other laminopathies and clinically overlapping with Malouf syndrome .
LMNA sequencing should be considered for patients presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypergonadotropic hypogonadism <END> , including those previously diagnosed with Malouf syndrome .
Premature <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> with photomyoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , and neurodegenerative disorder in two brothers : a new syndrome ?
We describe two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , progressive neurological deterioration with photomyoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and progressive deterioration in renal function , resulting in death in the third decade of life .
Autopsy showed diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> and arteriolosclerosis of the systemic vasculature .
There was no evidence of these abnormalities in the patients ' 2 sisters or either parent .
Mitochondrial enzyme analysis documented partial deficiencies of Complex III and IV of the respiratory chain .
This deficiency was expressed in skin fibroblasts , kidney and liver but not in muscle .
This suggests that the disease-causing mutation is either in the mitochondrial or nuclear DNA . Various modes of inheritance are considered , including maternal , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , or X-linked recessive .
We suggest this is a new genetic syndrome characterized by an underlying metabolic disease and premature <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> , possibly of mitochondrial origin .
Spondyloenchondrodysplasia : clinical variability in three cases .
Spondyloenchondrodysplasia is a very rare skeletal dysplasia in which multiple enchondromata exist in the metaphyses of the long bones with <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> .
We present three patients ( two of them are sibs ) with spondyloenchondrodysplasia .
The first patient was a 10-year-old boy , who had <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and enchondromatous-like lesions in the metaphyses of the long bones and <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> on radiography.
His older sister ( 21-years old ) had received growth hormone therapy 12 years earlier due to <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and her radiological findings were similar but milder than her brother .
Both the sibs had normal intelligence and no calcification of the basal ganglia .
The third patient was a 6-year-old boy who had <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , enchondromatous-like lesions in the metaphyses of the long bones and <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> .
His cranial BT showed calcification of basal ganglia .
The findings of the two sibs in the first family were compatible with spondyloenchondrodysplasia .
The difference in clinical severity between the siblings shows the variability within the family .
The third case with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcifications <END> is compatible with spondyloenchondrodysplasia with basal ganglia calcification .
In conclusion , we suggest that family screening and cranial imaging for the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcifications <END> should be considered in every patient with the diagnosis of spondyloenchondrodysplasia .

Clinical and molecular analysis of a large family with three distinct phenotypes of progressive muscular dystrophy.
We describe a unique six-generation , highly consanguineous family originating from an isolated mountainous village in the Russian province of Daghestan .
Three separate clinical phenotypes of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> were identified in this large family .
Seven patients developed a classical limb-girdle variant of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> ( LGMD) , with disease onset at 15-30 years and loss of ambulation within a 25-year course .
The second group included three patients with a <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> distal myopathy first manifested in the late teens and confined to the tibial and calf muscles .
Each of these two phenotypes segregated independently as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait , and muscle biopsies showed non-specific myopathic changes .
Lastly , two male siblings exhibited an atypical variant of Duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> confirmed by detection of a deletion in the dystrophin gene .
To clarify the molecular basis of the polymorphic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> in this kindred , we performed molecular genetic studies on 67 family members and obtained significant evidence for linkage to chromosome 2p. A maximum pairwise lod ( logarithm of odds ) score of 5.64 was achieved at the zero recombination fraction ( i .e . at theta = 0.00 ) for locus D2S291 ; multipoint linkage analysis confirmed the most likely location of a mutant gene near D2S291 .
The patients with LGMD and those with the distal <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> phenotype share a common affected homozygous haplotype associated with the same founder chromosome ; key recombinants defined D2S286 and D2S292 to be the closest loci flanking the mutant gene .
Remarkably , two clinically distinct forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> , LGMD type 2B ( LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy , were recently mapped to the same locus .
We suggest that all three chromosome 2p-linked conditions may represent allelic disorders , i.e . different phenotypic expressions of a single gene .
Antley-Bixler syndrome : report of a patient and review of literature .
We report a patient with Antley-Bixler syndrome and review 13 patients from the literature .
The cardinal features of this condition include <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mid-face hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proptosis <END> , choanal atresia/stenosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysplastic ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , radiohumeral synostosis , long-bone fractures and <START:PHENOTYPE> femoral bowing <END> , urogenital abnormalities and a normal karyotype .
Early death was identified in 54 % of the reported cases , usually due to respiratory complications .
The oldest patient at the time of follow up was 10 years of age .
Intellectual performance has been variable (developmental testing of our patient at 30 months of age showed a range of developmental skills equivalent to 6 to 11 months of age ) .
Chronic respiratory distress , especially if accompanied by periods of apnea , may be important in the causation of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Some patients with the syndrome have normal intelligence , which suggests a normally developing brain , particularly if a craniectomy is performed to treat sutural synostosis and indicates that there may be secondary factors ( e.g. , apnea ) playing a role in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( as seen in our patient with a history of apnea ) in patients with the Antley-Bixler syndrome .
Since choanal atresia/stenosis which diminishes the airway passage is a cardinal feature of this syndrome , choanal stenting should be performed on those patients with this finding during infancy to decrease the airway obstruction .
All patients followed beyond infancy were ambulatory , including our patient at 35 months of age , who will take steps with assistance .
Although most cases are sporadic , there were reports of recurrence in siblings of both sexes in two families , suggesting an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance .
Spinal extradural arachnoid cysts associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> .
Spinal extradural arachnoid cysts ( SEDAC ) are lesions communicating to the subarachnoid space of the spinal canal via a dural defect .
SEDAC occupies intraspinal space and sometimes causes neurological disturbances .
Although most reported cases are sporadic , several familial cases have been described , suggesting a genetic etiology .
Here we report on a family with SEDAC inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode .
Detailed study showed that the family has the lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome .
Among family members examined , a total of ten in two generations manifested all or some of the following features : SEDAC , <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> .
Seven had spinal cysts , four had both SEDAC and <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> , and one had SEDAC <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> ; three did not have SEDAC .
These findings , together with rarity of both <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> in the general population , support that all of the ten members were affected with one clinical entity , the lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome .
The distribution of features illustrates the variable expressivity of clinical manifestations .
Although FOXC2 mutation analysis was not performed in our family , it is likely that SEDAC is a component manifestation of lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome and more consistent in our family than those reported .

Confirmation of ADAMTSL4 mutations for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> isolated bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ectopia lentis <END> ( EL ) is a zonular disease where alteration of the zonular fibers leads progressively to <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> .
It is most often associated with systemic diseases such as Marfan syndrome , Weill-Marchesani syndrome or homocystinuria .
Isolated non syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> ( IEL ) is reported in families with autosomal inheritance , with dominant forms being more common than recessive .
LTBP2 truncating mutations have been described as a cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> as a primary or secondary feature in patients showing ocular ( eg , glaucoma ) or extraocular manifestations ( eg , Marfanoid habitus ) .
Recently , ADAMTSL4 has been shown to be responsible for isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> in an inbred family .
Herein we show a consanguineous family that carries a novel homozygous splice mutation IVS4-1G>A/IVS4-1G>A in ADAMTSL4 responsible for isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> EL , thus confirming the involvement of this gene in this condition and underlining the major role of ADAMTS proteases in zonular fibers homeostasis .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> apathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> central hypoventilation <END> : successful long-term management .
We report a third family with six members with features of the syndrome of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> central hypoventilation <END> .
Patients with this syndrome typically die suddenly , presumably from central <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> .
Following multiple respiratory arrests , one affected member was successfully managed with aggressive pulmonary care , tracheostomy , and intermittent home mechanical ventilation , which , combined with carbidopa/levodopa , allowed for a functional lifestyle with improvement in <START:PHENOTYPE> apathy <END> , mobility , and nutritional status .
Crouzon with <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> .
Further delineation of the syndrome .
Patients with Crouzon and <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> syndrome show craniofacial features similar to those observed in patients with classic Crouzon syndrome , in addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> with peculiar characteristics .
More severe physical manifestations , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> Chiari malformation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , and atresia or stenosis of the choanas , which are unusual in individuals with classic Crouzon syndrome , are reported in these patients .
The molecular abnormality associated with Crouzon syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> ( CAN ) is a transition in the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 gene that results in an Ala391Glu mutation .
We describe two unrelated patients showing this mutation and compare their clinical features with those of other patients with CAN reported in the literature .
In addition to craniosynostosis with crouzonoid facies and <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> ( present in all patients) , melanocytic nevi , <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> or stenosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , Chiari malformations and oral abnormalities were observed in the majority of the 35 patients analyzed .
Vertebral anomalies and <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> were present with less frequency .
Some characteristics considered typical of this condition ( jaw cementomas , acanthomas and finger abnormalities ) were absent in most of the patients .
SLC7A9 mutations in all three <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> subtypes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cystinuria <END> is an inherited disorder of cystine and dibasic amino acid transport in kidney .
Subtypes are defined by the urinary cystine excretion patterns of the obligate heterozygous parents : Type I/N ( fully recessive or silent ) ; Type II/N ( high excretor ) ; Type III/N ( moderate excretor ) .
The first gene implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> ( SLC3A1 ) is associated with the Type I urinary phenotype .
A second <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> gene ( SLC7A9 ) was recently isolated , and mutations of this gene were associated with dominant ( non-Type I ) <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> alleles .
Here we report genotype-phenotype studies of SLC7A9 mutations in a cohort of well-characterized <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> probands and their family members .
Individual exons of the SLC7A9 gene were screened by single strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis and sequencing of abnormally migrating fragments .
Seven mutations were identified .
A single bp insertion ( 799insA ) was present in four patients : on Type III alleles in two patients and on Type II alleles in two patients .
These results suggest that Type II and Type III may be caused by the same mutation and , therefore , other factors must influence urinary cystine excretion .
A 4bp deletion in intron 12 ( IVS12+4delAGTA ) and a missense mutation ( 1245 G-->A , A354T ) were identified on Type III alleles .
A nonsense codon ( 1491 G-->T , E436X ) and a possible splicing mutation ( IVS9-17G -->A ) were seen in a Type I/III patient , but the mutations could not be assigned to particular alleles .
Of additional interest were two missense mutations ( 316 T- ->C , I44T and 967 C -->T , P261L ) linked to Type I alleles .
Our results provide evidence that some SLC7A9 mutations may be associated with fully recessive ( Type I ) forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> .
We also demonstrate SLC7A9 mutations in dominant Types II and III <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> .
The finding of SLC7A9 mutations in all three subtypes underscores the complex interactions between specific <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> genes and other factors influencing cystine excretion .
A simpler phenotypic classification scheme ( recessive and dominant ) for <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> is warranted .
The classification and definition of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertension <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> in pregnancy may be the result of a number of different disorders with different etiologies and pathologic characteristics .
As the causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> in pregnancy are largely unknown , a new clinical classification of the hypertensive disorders is proposed and is based solely on the physical signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> .
The classification is intended to define meaningful clinical categories by which all cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> occurring in pregnancy , labor , or the puerperium may be classified .
New definitions of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> are also proposed ; they are based on standardized methods of measurement and simple criteria of abnormality .
It is hoped that this clinical classification and associated definitions will find general acceptance so that the incidence and outcome of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and the results of research in different centers may be compared and mutual understanding achieved .
A new dominant distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> affecting posterior leg and anterior upper limb muscles .
To report a dominant , <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> early onset distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> with sparing of the tibialis anterior .
Twelve affected and two possibly affected members from an Australian kindred were examined and investigated by EMG , imaging studies , histopathology , and genetic analysis .
Affected patients had a <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> condition with symmetric , distal <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> and wasting of the anterior upper and posterior lower limbs , with sparing of tibialis anterior , even in advanced disease .
All patients remained ambulant and there was no evidence of cardiac or respiratory muscle involvement .
Serum creatine kinase levels were either normal or mildly elevated .
Imaging studies showed widespread involvement of the posterior and lateral leg compartments .
Proximal muscles were radiologically abnormal only in advanced disease .
Muscles that were mildly affected clinically appeared normal on imaging .
EMG in nine patients showed widespread <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathic changes <END> .
Muscle histopathology in four patients showed either end stage muscle or nonspecific myopathic findings without inflammation or vacuoles .
Microsatellite markers for distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> loci were analyzed and all known distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> phenotype genes and linkage regions were formally excluded by multipoint analysis .
The affected patients in this kindred display a clinically distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , with selective involvement of posterior lower and anterior upper limb muscles .
The genetic analysis suggests the existence of one more distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> locus .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> nonsyndromal <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with normal intelligence .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> is usually associated with moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
An apparently new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder comprising a characteristic facial appearance associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and normal intelligence , immunodeficiency , and increased risk for lymphoreticular malignancies has been described recently .
We report on a large Arab kindred with frequent consanguineous marriages and eight cases in five sibships with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , peculiar facies , and normal intelligence .
Of these cases , two died of an acute lymphoreticular malignancy or bronchopneumonia .
Immunological and chromosomal studies carried out for the three affected living sibs were normal .
The existence of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> nonsyndromal variant of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with normal intelligence is proposed and discussed .
Genome-wide linkage and copy number variation analysis reveals 710 kb duplication on chromosome 1p31 .3 responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Omphalocele <END> is a congenital birth defect characterised by the presence of internal organs located outside of the ventral abdominal wall .
The purpose of this study was to identify the underlying genetic mechanisms of a large <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Caucasian family with <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> .
A genetic linkage study was conducted in a large family with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission of an <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> using a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) array .
The analysis revealed significant evidence of linkage ( non-parametric NPL = 6 .93 , p= 0.0001 ; parametric logarithm of odds ( LOD ) = 2.70 under a fully penetrant dominant model ) at chromosome band 1p31 .3 . Haplotype analysis narrowed the locus to a 2.74 Mb region between markers rs2886770 ( 63014807 bp ) and rs1343981 ( 65757349 bp ) .
Molecular characterisation of this interval using array comparative genomic hybridisation followed by quantitative microsphere hybridisation analysis revealed a 710 kb duplication located at 63.5-64.2 Mb .
All affected individuals who had an <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> and shared the haplotype were positive for this duplicated region , while the duplication was absent from all normal individuals of this family .
Multipoint linkage analysis using the duplication as a marker yielded a maximum LOD score of 3.2 at 1p31 .3 under a dominant model .
The 710 kb duplication at 1p31 .3 band contains seven known genes including FOXD3 , ALG6 , ITGB3BP , KIAA1799 , DLEU2L , PGM1 , and the proximal portion of ROR1 .
Importantly , this duplication is absent from the database of genomic variants .
The present study suggests that development of an <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> in this family is controlled by overexpression of one or more genes in the duplicated region .
To the authors ' knowledge , this is the first reported association of an inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> condition with a chromosomal rearrangement .
Distal osteolysis , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and characteristic facial appearance : delineation of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> subtype of essential osteolysis .
We describe the concurrence of severe distal osteolysis , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and characteristic facial appearance with <START:PHENOTYPE> maxillary hypoplasia <END> and relative <START:PHENOTYPE> exophthalmos <END> in two adult sibs , a 57-year-old woman and her deceased brother .
Apparently they represent a distinct , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> entity in the group of the so-called essential osteolysis .
Furthermore , this observation confirms that the facial changes that may occur in patients with essential osteolysis , ie , <START:PHENOTYPE> maxillary hypoplasia <END> and relative <START:PHENOTYPE> exophthalmos <END> , may be present in all types of osteolysis , independent of their localisation or inheritance .
Characterization of a new X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , cortical malformation , and thin habitus .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) affects 1-2/1,000 males and accounts for approximately 10 % of all <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MR ) .
We have ascertained a syndromic form of XLMR segregating within a five-generation family with seven affected males .
Prominent characteristics include mild to severe MR , cortical malformation , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , thin build with distinct facial features including a long and <START:PHENOTYPE> thin face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> , almond-shaped eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> upslanting palpebral fissures <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> and behavioral problems .
Carrier females have normal physical appearance and intelligence .
This combination of features is unreported and distinct from Lujan-Fryns syndrome , Snyder-Robinson syndrome , and zinc finger DHHC domain-containing 9-associated MR .
We propose the name of this new syndrome to be CK syndrome .

The Williams <START:PHENOTYPE> elfin facies <END> syndrome .
A new perspective .
Evaluation of 19 patients with the Williams <START:PHENOTYPE> elfin facies <END> syndrome , in order to more completely delineate the total spectrum of the disorder , indicates that " infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> , peculiar facies , <START:PHENOTYPE> supravalvular aortic stenosis <END> " designation which was heretofore used is inappropriate .
Only 32 % of the patients have evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> supravalvular aortic stenosis <END> and not one of them has had documented <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> , including eight patients who had a serum calcium determination in the first year of life .
Rather , the most consistent features are growth deficiency which is predominantly of postnatal onset , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deficiency <END> , and an altered pattern of facial development which includes <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> , a stellate pattern in the iris , medial eyebrow flare , a <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> with anteverted nares , and thick lips .
The disorder is a sporadic occurrence of unknown etiology .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> in preterm infants : a hyperprostaglandinuric tubular syndrome different from Bartter syndrome .
A congenital hypokalemic tubular disorder is described with many features resembling Bartter syndrome .
Additional features include prenatal onset with <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> and premature labor ; <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> ; episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , and renal electrolyte and water wastage ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> ; and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopenia <END> .
Unlike Bartter syndrome , there is no defect in tubular reabsorption of chloride .
Urinary levels of prostaglandin E2 and 7 alpha-hydroxy-5 ,11-diketotetranorprosta-1 ,16-dioic acid are selectively elevated , indicating marked stimulation of renal and systemic PGE2 production .
Chronic suppression of PGE2 activity by indomethacin corrects most of the abnormalities , and there is an immediate decompensation of the disease on indomethacin withdrawal .
We conclude that these preterm infants have a distinct variety of hypokalemic tubular disorders rather than a variant of Bartter syndrome , because renal and systemic hyperprostaglandinism ranks high in the pathogenic chain of events , and the suppression of PGE2 hyperactivity is associated with significant improvement in the development ( and probably in the prognosis ) of the affected children .
Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with myelin folding and <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile onset <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
We describe three patients from a family with motor and sensory neuropathy accompanied by open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> demyelinating hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies ( HMSN ) include different disorders .
To our knowledge , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> HMSN has not been associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile onset <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Sural nerve pathology of the three patients were examined , and genetic analysis of the family was performed .
Result :- The most prominent pathologic finding was a highly unusual myelin abnormality consisting of irregular redundant loops and folding of the myelin sheath .
The family survey supports <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
The molecular analysis failed to demonstrate either linkage of the disease to MPZ gene , PMP22 gene , Cx32 gene , orEGR2 gene .
Analysis did not establish linkage of the disease to the locus of CMT4A , 4B , and 4C genes .
The present cases may represent a new type of HMSN accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile onset <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
A linkage between hereditary hyperferritinaemia not related to iron overload and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> .
The only genetic disorder with <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated serum ferritin <END> levels so far described is hereditary HLA- related haemochromatosis .
On the other hand , hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> is both genotypically as well as phenotypically heterogenous , and no specific locus or any useful marker has been yet identified .
We studied two Italian families in whom a combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated serum ferritin <END> not related to iron overload and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nuclear cataract <END> is transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
Affected individuals have normal serum iron and transferrin saturation , but high serum ferritin .
Red cell counts are normal and venesection therapy rapidly produces iron-deficiency anaemia .
This genetic disorder , which is characterized by hyperferritinaemia , differs from hereditary HLA- related haemochromatosis mostly for the absence of iron overload .
A gene responsible for the <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nuclear cataract <END> likely maps on chromosome 19q close to the ferritin L-subunit gene .
Within families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , serum ferritin might be an early marker of disease .
Diagnosis and treatment of homozygous <START:PHENOTYPE> protein C deficiency <END> .
Report of the Working Party on Homozygous <START:PHENOTYPE> Protein C Deficiency <END> of the Subcommittee on Protein C and Protein S , International Committee on Thrombosis and Haemostasis .
This report summarizes the documented cases of homozygous <START:PHENOTYPE> protein C deficiency <END> in the United States and Europe .
Procedures for diagnosing and treating this disorder ( both initially and over the long term ) have been compiled by a working party on homozygous <START:PHENOTYPE> protein C deficiency <END> of the Subcommittee on Protein C of the International Committee on Thrombosis and Haemostasis .
Homozygous <START:PHENOTYPE> protein C deficiency <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder that usually manifests itself by <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> fulminans and , less commonly , by massive large vein thrombosis ; severe diffuse intravascular coagulation also develops in these infants , and there is evidence of intrauterine thrombosis .
For confirmation of homozygous <START:PHENOTYPE> protein C deficiency <END> in a neonate with <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> fulminans or massive venous thrombosis , the infant should have undetectable protein C activity and both parents should be heterozygous for <START:PHENOTYPE> protein C deficiency <END> .
At the onset of symptoms , the initial treatment should be plasma ( 8 to 12 ml/kg every 12 hours ) until all lesions have healed .
Two modalities for long-term treatment are accepted as useful in these children : oral anticoagulant therapy or protein C replacement ( fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate ) .
Liver transplantation has been performed in only one child , with success .
Oral anticoagulation ( vitamin K antagonists , maintaining the prothrombin time from one and one-half to two times control values or at the International Normalized Ratio of 2.5 to 4.4 ) is our recommendation of choice for long-term treatment .
With appropriate care , these children are able to be free of coagulopathy and live relatively normal lives .
The IVIC syndrome : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> complex pleiotropic syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> radial ray hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> external ophthalmoplegia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> .
The IVIC syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> condition affecting mainly the upper limbs .
It is described from 19 living members of one family of mostly Caucasoid descent ; it came to Venezuela from the Canary Islands 140 years ago .
The new mutation appeared six generations ago .
It has complete penetrance and wide expressivity for a radial ray defect which may vary from an almost normal thumb to a severely malformed upper limb .
When present , the thumb has a long/slender metacarpal and a short distal phalanx , reflected in a typical metacarpophalangeal ( MP ) pattern profile .
Anthropometry reveals delayed growth in the forearms , clavicles , and cranium during adolescence , and permanently in the spine ; the maturation of the face , tibiae , and feet is normal .
The radial carpal bones are always affected , some being still hypoplastic at advanced ages .
Constant palmar dermatoglyphic anomalies are a high a-b ridge count , a distally placed or absent t triradius , and an increased frequency of patterns in the second interdigital area .
Extraocular muscles are involved almost always , producing <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> .
Hearing is bilaterally impaired due to a mixed congenital loss , either total or partial .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukocytosis <END> are present before the age of 50 years .
There is neither associated ectodermal dysplasia nor heart involvement [except for occasional mild , incomplete right bundle branch block ( IRBBB) ] ; <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> occurs in about 10 % of affected persons .
The possible pathogenetic relationship to the thalidomide embryopathy and to the Holt-Oram syndrome , among others , is discussed .
Body fat distribution and metabolic derangements in patients with familial partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> associated with mandibuloacral dysplasia .
Mandibuloacral dysplasia ( MAD ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder that is characterized by mandibular and <START:PHENOTYPE> clavicular hypoplasia <END> , acroosteolysis , delayed closure of cranial sutures , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> , and mottled cutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> .
It is also associated with partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> , but the pattern of fat loss has not been well characterized .
We studied body fat distribution in two male and two female patients with MAD by anthropometry , dual energy x-ray absorptiometry , and magnetic resonance imaging .
Blood glucose and insulin responses during an oral glucose tolerance test and fasting serum lipoproteins were determined .
Three of the four subjects had loss of sc fat from the extremities with normal or slight excess in the neck and truncal regions ( termed type A pattern ) .
In contrast , one patient had generalized loss of sc fat involving the face , trunk , and extremities ( type B pattern ) .
All of the patients had normal glucose tolerance but had fasting and postprandial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> suggestive of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> .
Elevated serum triglycerides with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were noted in three subjects .
We conclude that familial partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> associated with MAD presents with two types of body fat distribution patterns , both of which are associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and its metabolic complications .
Mutations in KIF11 cause autosomal-dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> variably associated with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> and chorioretinopathy.
We have identified KIF11 mutations in individuals with syndromic autosomal-dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> and/or chorioretinopathy.
Initial whole-exome sequencing revealed heterozygous KIF11 mutations in three individuals with a combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> from a microcephaly-lymphedema-chorioretinal-dysplasia cohort .
Subsequent Sanger sequencing of KIF11 in a further 15 unrelated microcephalic probands with <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinopathy <END> identified additional heterozygous mutations in 12 of them .
KIF11 encodes EG5 , a homotetramer kinesin motor .
The variety of mutations we have found ( two nonsense , two splice site , four missense , and six indels causing frameshifts ) are all predicted to have an impact on protein function .
EG5 has previously been shown to play a role in spindle assembly and function , and these findings highlight the critical role of proteins necessary for spindle formation in CNS development .
Moreover , identification of KIF11 mutations in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinopathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> suggests that EG5 is involved in the development and maintenance of retinal and lymphatic structures .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Vesicoureteral reflux <END> in asymptomatic siblings of patients with known reflux : radionuclide cystography.
The familial nature of <START:PHENOTYPE> vesicoureteral reflux <END> among siblings of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> vesicoureteral reflux <END> has been reported to be from 8 % to 32% . These included both symptomatic and asymptomatic siblings .
The incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> vesicoureteral reflux <END> in asymptomatic siblings , however , has not been studied extensively .
Sixty asymptomatic siblings of patients known to have <START:PHENOTYPE> vesicoureteral reflux <END> were studied with radionuclide voiding cystography.
Their ages ranged from 2 months to 15 years ( mean , 4.2 years ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Vesicoureteral reflux <END> was detected in 27 of 60 ( 45% ) of the siblings .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Vesicoureteral reflux <END> was unilateral in 15 and bilateral in 12 of the siblings .
Radionuclide cystography is more sensitive than radiographic cystography and results in a very low radiation dose to the patient .
The gonadal dose with radionuclide cystography is only 1. 0 to 2.0 mrads .
Because of these features , radionuclide cystography is a nearly ideal technique for the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> vesicoureteral reflux <END> in siblings of patients with known <START:PHENOTYPE> vesicoureteral reflux <END> .
All siblings ( symptomatic or asymptomatic ) of patients with known <START:PHENOTYPE> vesicoureteral reflux <END> should have a screening radionuclide cystography.
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome : notable intrafamilial phenotypic variability in a large family with Q28X TWIST mutation .
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disease characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and limb and external ear abnormalities .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Variable expressivity <END> is a well-known phenomenon in this disorder .
A large Indian family has been recently identified as carrying a nonsense TWIST mutation ( Q28 X ) in 17 members , of whom 16 were examined in detail .
Only 4 ( 25% ) of the patients showed patent <START:PHENOTYPE> craniostenosis <END> , namely , <START:PHENOTYPE> oxycephaly <END> .
The penetrance of <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> in this family is lower than previously reported in the literature .
Fifteen patients ( 93% ) had moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> .
Minor limb and external ear abnormalities were present in most patients .
Eyelid features were the hallmark of the disease for 12 members of the family , suggesting that mutations in TWIST may lead to a phenotype with mainly palpebral features and no <START:PHENOTYPE> craniostenosis <END> .
The clinical analysis of this large family clearly illustrates the significant <START:PHENOTYPE> variable expressivity <END> , probably related to haploinsufficiency because of the TWIST mutation .
This phenotypic variability remains unclear but could be the result of modifier genes and/or genetic background effect , as noticed previously in the transgenic twist-null heterozygous mice .

Mandibuloacral dysplasia type A in childhood .
Mandibuloacral dysplasia type A ( MADA ) is characterized by growth retardation , postnatal onset of craniofacial anomalies with <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular hypoplasia <END> , progressive acral <START:PHENOTYPE> osteolysis <END> , and skin changes including <START:PHENOTYPE> mottled pigmentation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> skin atrophy <END> , and lipodystrophy.
Owing to its slowly progressive course , the syndrome has been recognized in adults , and pediatric case reports are scarce .
We present the clinical case of two children in whom the diagnosis of MADA was made at an unusually early age .
A 5-year-old boy presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular proptosis <END> , thin nose , and short and bulbous distal phalanges of fingers .
A 4-year-old girl presented with round face and <START:PHENOTYPE> chubby cheeks <END> , thin nose , bulbous fingertips , and type A lipodystrophy.
In both , a skeletal survey showed <START:PHENOTYPE> wormian bones <END> , thin clavicles , <START:PHENOTYPE> short distal phalanges <END> of fingers and toes with acro-osteolysis .
Both children were found to be homozygous for the recurrent missense mutation , c.158 0G>A , ( p.R527H ) in exon 9 of the LMNA gene .
Thus , the phenotype of MADA can be manifest in preschool age ; diagnosis may be suggested by short and bulbous fingertips , facial features , and <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> , supported by the finding of acral <START:PHENOTYPE> osteolysis <END> , and confirmed by mutation analysis .
Genetic counselling in <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> : empirical data on <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> among first-degree relatives of 3095 psoriatic probands .
The risk of getting <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> dependent on the occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> in the family has been determined empirically .
Altogether 3717 families with one or both parents who had <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> have been analysed with regard to the number of children with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
The lifetime risk of getting <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> if no parent , one parent or both parents have <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> is 0.04 , 0.28 and 0.65 , respectively .
If there is already one affected child in the family , the corresponding risks are 0.24 , 0.51 and 0.83 , respectively .
The risk of getting <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> before the age of 32 years is dependent on the age-of-onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> in one affected parent .
New dominant syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> pterygium colli <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and digital anomalies .
We describe a proband and his mother who appear to have a new dominant syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> : <START:PHENOTYPE> pterygium colli <END> , unusual features , and digital anomalies .
The craniofacial abnormalities include <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> , angulated eyebrows , upward slanting of the palpebral fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and prominent low set , <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated ears <END> .
The digits are remarkable for proximally displaced small thumbs , widened interphalangeal joints , and <START:PHENOTYPE> broad terminal phalanges <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epiphyseal dysplasia <END> of the femoral head , mild vertebral abnormality , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> : report of a pedigree with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
A family is presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , femoral <START:PHENOTYPE> epiphyseal dysplasia <END> , mild vertebral changes , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myopia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> presenting in adult life were also present in some affected members .
We suggest that this disorder may be a distinct entity within the spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia group of disorders .
Preliminary exclusion of an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> gene in <START:PHENOTYPE> Leber optic atrophy <END> by linkage analysis .
The maternal inheritance in <START:PHENOTYPE> Leber optic atrophy <END> suggests that it may be caused by a cytoplasmic or <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> defect .
However , the strong male bias and the strict tissue specificity can not be readily explained by a single <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> gene defect alone .
Wallace suggested a hypothesis that the disease could be the result of an interaction between an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> gene and a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA defect .
Linkage relationships between <START:PHENOTYPE> Leber optic atrophy <END> and 15 X-chromosome markers were analyzed in three large Tasmanian families .
The results of two-point linkage analysis showed no close linkage between <START:PHENOTYPE> Leber optic atrophy <END> and any of the 15 markers .
The results of multipoint linkage analysis suggested the exclusion of the assumed <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> gene from almost the whole X chromosome in these families .
Congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ij ( CDG-Ij , DPAGT1 - CDG ) : extending the clinical and molecular spectrum of a rare disease .
Congenital disorders of glycosylation ( CDG ) are caused by enzymatic defects of the formation or processing of lipid-linked oligosaccharides and glycoproteins .
Since the majority of proteins is glycosylated , a defect in a singular CDG enzyme leads to a multisytemic disease with secondary malfunction of thousands of proteins .
CDG-Ij ( DPAGT1 - CDG ) is caused by a defect of the human DPAGT1 ( UDP-GlcNAc : Dolichol Phosphate N-Acetylglucosamine-1- Phosphotransferase) , catalyzing the first step of N-linked glycosylation .
So far the clinical phenotype of only one CDG-Ij patient has been described .
The patient showed severe <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> , intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> exotropia <END> .
Molecular studies of this patient revealed the heterozygous mutation c.66 0A> G ( Y17 0 C ; paternal ) in combination with an uncharacterized splicing defect ( maternal ) .
Two further mutations , c.890A> T ( I297F ) and c.162-8G>A as a splicing defect were detected when analyzing DPAGT1 in two affected siblings of a second family .
We report two new patients with the novel homozygous mutation , c.341 C> G ( A114 G) , causing a severe clinical phenotype , characterized by hyperexcitability , intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> .
Both our patients died within their first year of life .
With the discovery of this novel mutation and a detailed clinical description we extend the clinical features of CDG-Ij in order to improve early detection of this disease . Copyright Ã‚Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc . All rights reserved .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mesangial sclerosis <END> , and distinct eye abnormalities with microcoria : an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
We observed the occurrence of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> ( CNS ) and distinct ocular anomalies in two unrelated families .
Eleven children from both families presented with a similar course of renal disease starting with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> and renal failure prenatally or immediately after birth that resulted in death before the age of 2 months .
Kidney histopathology showed <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse mesangial sclerosis <END> ( DMS ) .
Clinically obvious eye abnormalities were recognized in six of the eight patients in whom sufficient clinical data were available .
Ocular anomalies included enlarged or large appearing corneae in some cases suggesting buphthalmos , and extremely narrow , nonreactive pupils ( microcoria ) .
Pathological examination of the eyes of two aborted fetuses revealed a more complex ocular maldevelopment including <START:PHENOTYPE> posterior lenticonus <END> as well as anomalies of cornea and retina .
On the basis of these observations and other cases in the literature , we delineate a previously unrecognized distinct entity characterized by congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> , DMS , and eye abnormalities with microcoria as the leading clinical feature .
Pedigrees of affected families with parental consanguinity support <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
We propose that this syndrome should be designated microcoria-congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrosis <END> syndrome or Pierson syndrome .
Possible overlap with Galloway-Mowat syndrome and relations to other oculo-renal syndromes are discussed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Genetic heterogeneity <END> of familial hemiplegic migraine .
Familial hemiplegic migraine ( FHM ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> variety of <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine with aura <END> .
We previously mapped a gene responsible for this disorder to the short arm of chromosome 19 , within a 30-cM interval bracketed by D19S216 and D19S215 .
Linkage analysis conducted on two large pedigrees did not show any evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> , despite their clinical differences due to the presence , in one family , of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> .
Herein we report linkage data on seven additional FHM families including another one with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
Analysis was conducted with a set of seven markers spanning the D19S216- D19S215 interval .
Two-point and multipoint lod score analyses as well as HOMOG testing provided strong evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> .
Strong evidence of linkage was obtained in two families and of absence of linkage in four families .
The posterior probability of being of the linked type was > .95 in the first two families and < .01 in four other ones .
It was not possible to draw any firm conclusion for the last family .
Thus , within the nine families so far tested , four were linked , including those with associated <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
We could not find any clinical difference between the pure FHM families regardless of whether they were linked .
In addition to the demonstration of <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> of FHM , this study also allowed us to establish that the most likely location of the gene was within an interval of 12 cM between D19S413 and D19S226 .
Kufor Rakeb disease : <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , levodopa-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> with pyramidal degeneration , <START:PHENOTYPE> supranuclear gaze palsy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Kufor Rakeb disease is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by subacute , juvenile-onset , levodopa-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , pyramidal signs , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> supranuclear gaze palsy <END> .
It was originally described more than a decade ago , and linkage analysis identified a locus on chromosome 1p36 that was previously assigned PARK9 .
We have further characterized the clinical picture and specifically re-assessed the response to levodopa in the original family , in the northern highlands of Jordan .
In the 4 surviving patients , there has been a narrowing of the therapeutic window for levodopa with the emergence of peak-dose dyskinesias with increased <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> and cognitive decline .
Several new features were identified , including facial-faucial-finger mini-myoclonus , visual <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> , and oculogyric dystonic spasms .

Identification of a locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> on chromosome 5p13.3-p15 .1 in a Chinese family .
Myopia and its extreme form , <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> , are common vision disorders worldwide , especially in Asia .
Identifying genetic markers is a useful step toward understanding the genetic basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> , particularly in the Chinese population , where it is highly prevalent .
This study was conducted to provide evidence of linkage for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> to a locus on chromosome 5p13.3-p15 .1 in a large Chinese family .
After clinical evaluation , genomic DNA from 29 members of this family was genotyped .
A genome-wide screen was then performed using 382 markers with an average inter-marker distance of 10 cM , and two-point linkage was analyzed using the MLINK program .
Mutation analysis of the candidate genes was performed using direct sequencing .
Linkage to the known <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> loci was excluded .
The genome-wide screening identified a maximum two-point LOD score of 3.71 at Î¸= 0.00 with the microsatellite marker D5S502 .
Fine mapping and haplotype analysis defined a critical region of 11 .69 cM between D5S2096 and D5S1986 on chromosome 5p13.3-p15 .1 .
Sequence analysis of the candidate genes inside the linked region did not identify any causative mutations .
A genetic locus was mapped to chromosome 5p13.3-p15 .1 in a large Chinese family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> .
The Dubowitz syndrome : a retrospective .
The purpose of the article is to update information concerning Dubowitz syndrome .
A review of the literature since the disorder was originally described in 1965 is presented .
In addition , case reports are presented for two siblings described in 1971 describing speech and dental development and current clinical findings .
Analysis of approximately 30 cases reveals prevalence of growth failure and <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , broad forehead with sparse frontal hair , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , abnormal pinnae , broad nose , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
Overt <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> or submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> is not a prevalent finding ( 16% ) .
High-pitched and hoarse voice quality appears to be a constant feature .
There is the suggestion of an association with leukemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> .
Inheritance appears clearly <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> DNA deletion with Kearns Sayre syndrome in a child with <START:PHENOTYPE> Addison disease <END> . Kearns Sayre syndrome ( KSS ) is a multisystem disorder with a confounding variety of clinical manifestations , including ocular myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinopathy <END> , heart block and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
Endocrinopathies are common in KSS , including growth hormone deficiency , hypogonadism , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> .
A variety of deletions of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( mtDNA ) are found in most cases .
We report on a 5-year-old boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> Addison disease <END> in whom further investigation revealed a 4.9 kilobase mtDNA deletion and KSS . Later he developed severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and expired .
The degree of mutant mtDNA heteroplasmy in various tissues on autopsy did not correlate well with the clinical manifestations , although this may be due at least in part to replacement with other tissue types .
Our report is the first of non-autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> Addison disease <END> in KSS and patients with KSS should be evaluated for adrenal insufficiency .
Early recognition of adrenal insufficiency is crucial to prevent mortality from this cause .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , focal segmental <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> marfanoid habitus <END> in two sibs .
Two female sibs aged 15 and 18 years with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> marfanoid habitus <END> who developed focal segmental <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> are described .
This combination of features appears to represent a unique syndrome distinct from previous reports of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> in association with the nephrotic syndrome .
The mode of inheritance is likely to be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
Localization of the gene ( or genes ) for a syndrome with X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of vision <END> and a fatal course in early childhood .
Linkage analysis is described in a family with X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , floppiness , delayed motor development , absence of deep tendon reflexes , <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of vision <END> ( MIM no . 301835 ) .
The disease has a fatal course due to the susceptibility of the patients to infections , especially of the respiratory tract .
Clinical signs indicate impairment of the posterior columns , peripheral motor and sensory neurons and the second and eighth cranial nerves and/or their nuclei .
The involvement of the posterior columns of the spinal cord is further suggested by the almost complete absence of myelinated fibers therein .
We localized the responsible gene(s ) to Xq21.33-q24 between DXS1231 and DXS1001 with a maximum lod score of 6 .97 .
The proteolipid protein gene , which codes for two myelin proteins of the central nervous system and is located in this region , was considered as a candidate gene for this disorder .
However , no mutations were found in the protein-coding part of this gene .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with thin habitus , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> : linkage to Xp21.3-p22.12 .
We reevaluated a family previously described as having nonspecific X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) by Snyder and Robinson [ 1969 : Clin Pediatr 8:669-674 ] ( MIM 309583 ) .
Clinical and DNA studies were conducted on 17 relatives , including 6 males with mild-to-moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , 3 carrier females , and 8 normal males .
In contrast to the normal appearance and minimal clinical findings reported 22 years ago , affected males were found to have a characteristic set of clinical findings .
These developed gradually over the first 2 decades , and included thin body build with diminished muscle mass , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , slight <START:PHENOTYPE> facial asymmetry <END> with a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent lower lip <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nasal speech <END> , high narrow or cleft plate , and long great toes .
Carrier females were clinically normal .
Multipoint linkage analysis indicated linkage to markers distal to the 3 ' end of DMD ( DXS41 and DXS989) , with a maximal lod score of 4.7 .
On the basis of these findings , this entity is redefined as XLMR syndrome .
Multifocal choroiditis in patients with familial juvenile systemic granulomatosis .
To document clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> in patients with familial juvenile systemic granulomatosis .
Retrospective chart review .
Ophthalmologic examination , medical history , and clinical course in 16 patients from eight families examined at six academic medical centers .
Of the 16 patients , 15 had evidence of panuveitis with multifocal choroiditis .
One patient had only an anterior <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> .
Ischemic optic neuropathy , presumably due to a small vessel vasculopathy , and retinal vasculopathy each occurred in one patient .
Ocular complications were common , including <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> in 11 , <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in six , <START:PHENOTYPE> band keratopathy <END> in six , <START:PHENOTYPE> cystoid macular edema <END> in six , and optic disk edema in six .
All 16 patients had polyarthritis , and at least nine had <START:PHENOTYPE> skin rash <END> .
Often patients were misdiagnosed initially as having either juvenile rheumatoid <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> or sarcoidosis .
Familial juvenile systemic granulomatosis is an uncommon genetic disease characterized by polyarthritis and <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> .
Panuveitis and multifocal choroiditis often may be present .
Patients with a diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> but having a family history of the disease and multifocal choroiditis should be suspected of having familial juvenile systemic granulomatosis .
Ocular complications in homocystinuria--early and late treated .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Homocystinuria <END> due to cystathionine-beta-synthetase deficiency is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder of methionine metabolism with an incidence in Ireland of 1 in 52 ,544 births .
Ocular complications in untreated patients include <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> , secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> .
There are no characteristic signs or symptoms in infancy , and early detection relies on screening of newborn babies .
Nineteen patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> were studied ; 14 received dietary treatment and vitamin supplementation starting in the newborn period .
Of these , none developed <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> after a mean follow-up of 8.2 years , compared with a 70 % dislocation rate in untreated patients with a similar follow-up period .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ectopia lentis <END> developed and progressed in five patients diagnosed later in life , despite tight biochemical control .
The risk of ocular complications in <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> can be substantially reduced in patients started on treatment within six weeks of birth .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> radial hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> triphalangeal thumbs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , and maxillary <START:PHENOTYPE> diastema <END> .
We describe a family in which eight persons ( three males , five females ) in three generations had a syndrome of bilateral and strikingly symmetrical <START:PHENOTYPE> triphalangeal thumbs <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> radial hypoplasia <END> .
The affected males also had a first-degree <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> and all affected family members had an anterior maxillary <START:PHENOTYPE> diastema <END> .
The syndrome was inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion .
Chondrodystrophic <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> ( Schwartz-Jampel syndrome ) : report of a new case and follow-up of patients initially reported in 1969 .
We report on a 9-year-old boy with chondrodystrophic <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> ( Schwartz-Jampel syndrome ) and the progress of a brother and sister with this syndrome first described in 1969 .
This is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait characterized by mask-like face , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow palpebral fissures <END> ( due to <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , blepharospasm , and abnormal orbital configuration ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> microstomia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypertrophy <END> , osteochondrodysplasia , and growth retardation .
Expressivity varies and in some sibships females are less severely affected than their brothers .
The sexual development of the sibs with chondrodystrophic <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> , who are now in the mid to late second decade , has been normal .
Linear growth rate accelerated during puberty but the adult height of the male is less than normal .
Administration of human growth hormone had no consistent effect on the growth pattern of this boy .
Genetic linkage study of high-grade <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> in a Hutterite population from South Dakota .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myopia <END> is a common , complex disorder , and severe forms have implications for blindness due to increased risk of premature cataracts , glaucoma , retinal detachment , and macular degeneration .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> ( AD ) non-syndromic high-grade <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> has been mapped to chromosomes 18p11 .31 , 12q21-23 , 17q21-23 , 7q36 , 2q37.1 , 7p15 .3 , 15q12-13 , 3q26 , 4q12 , 8p23 , 4q22-q27 , 1p36 , and Xq23-q25 .
Here , we demonstrate evidence of linkage for AD non-syndromic high-grade <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> in a large Hutterite family to a locus on chromosome 10q21.1 .
After clinical evaluation , genomic DNA was genotyped from 29 members of a Hutterite family from South Dakota ( 7 affected ) .
The average refractive error of affected individuals was -7. 04 diopters .
Microsatellite markers were used to exclude linkage to the known AD nonsyndromic high-grade <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> loci as well as to syndromic high-grade <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> loci .
A genome screen was then performed using 382 markers with an average inter-marker distance of 10 cM followed by fine-point mapping in all regions of the genome that gave positive LOD scores .
SimWalk2 software was used for multipoint linkage based on AD and autosomal recessive ( AR ) models with a penetrance of 90 % and a disease allele frequency of 0.001 .
A maximum multipoint LOD score of 3.22 was achieved under an AD model at microsatellite marker D10S1643 .
Fine point mapping and haplotype analysis defined a critical region of 2.67 cM on chromosome 10q21.1 .
Haplotype analysis demonstrated two distinct haplotypes segregating with high-grade <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , indicative of two distinct mutations occurring in the same gene .
We have identified a presumptive <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> locus for high-grade <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> based on linkage and haplotype analysis .
The gene mutated in <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile nephronophthisis <END> type 4 encodes a novel protein that interacts with nephrocystin .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephronophthisis <END> , the most common genetic cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic renal failure <END> in children , is a progressive tubulo-interstitial kidney disorder that is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
The disease is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> polyuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> and deterioration of renal function during childhood or adolescence .
The most prominent histological features are modifications of the tubules with thickening of the basement membrane , interstitial fibrosis and , in the advanced stages , medullary cysts .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephronophthisis <END> can also be associated with conditions affecting extrarenal organs , such as retinitis pigmentosa ( Senior-LÃ¸ken syndrome ) and ocular motor apraxia ( Cogan syndrome ) .
Three loci are associated with the juvenile , infantile and adolescent forms , on chromosomes 2q13 ( NPHP1 ; refs 5 ,6 ) , 9q22 ( NPHP2 ; ref . 7 ) and 3q21 ( NPHP3 ; ref . 8 ) , respectively .
NPHP1 , the only gene identified so far , encodes nephrocystin , which contains a Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain and interacts with intracytoplasmic proteins involved in cell adhesion .
Recently , a second locus associated with the juvenile form of the disease , NPHP4 , was mapped to chromosome 1p36 ( ref . 14 ) .
We carried out haplotype analysis of families affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> that were not linked to the NPHP1 , NPHP2 or NPHP3 loci , using markers covering this region .
This allowed us to reduce the NPHP4 interval to a one centimorgan interval between D1S2795 and D1S2870 , which contains six genes .
We identified five different mutations in one of these genes , designated NPHP4 , in unrelated individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> .
The NPHP4 gene encodes a 1 ,250-amino acid protein of unknown function that we named nephrocystin-4 .
We demonstrated the interaction of nephrocystin-4 with nephrocystin suggesting that these two proteins participate in a common signaling pathway .
Second consensus statement on the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy.
A consensus conference on multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) in 1998 established criteria for diagnosis that have been accepted widely .
Since then , clinical , laboratory , neuropathologic , and imaging studies have advanced the field , requiring a fresh evaluation of diagnostic criteria .
We held a second consensus conference in 2007 and present the results here .
Experts in the clinical , neuropathologic , and imaging aspects of MSA were invited to participate in a 2-day consensus conference .
Participants were divided into five groups , consisting of specialists in the parkinsonian , cerebellar , autonomic , neuropathologic , and imaging aspects of the disorder .
Each group independently wrote diagnostic criteria for its area of expertise in advance of the meeting .
These criteria were discussed and reconciled during the meeting using consensus methodology .
The new criteria retain the diagnostic categories of MSA with predominant <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and MSA with predominant <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> to designate the predominant motor features and also retain the designations of definite , probable , and possible MSA . Definite MSA requires neuropathologic demonstration of CNS alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic inclusions with neurodegenerative changes in striatonigral or olivopontocerebellar structures .
Probable MSA requires a <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> , progressive adult-onset disorder including rigorously defined autonomic failure and poorly levodopa-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
Possible MSA requires a <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> , progressive adult-onset disease including <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> and at least one feature suggesting <START:PHENOTYPE> autonomic dysfunction <END> plus one other feature that may be a clinical or a neuroimaging abnormality .
These new criteria have simplified the previous criteria , have incorporated current knowledge , and are expected to enhance future assessments of the disease .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , Brachmann-de Lange -like facial changes , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> metatarsus adductus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> : mild Brachmann-de Lange syndrome ?
We report on 4 individuals ( 3 sibs and their father ) with a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , minor facial anomalies reminiscent of a mild Brachmann-de Lange syndrome ( BDLS) , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> metatarsus adductus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> unusual dermatoglyphics <END> .
The syndrome , which seems to be inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait with variable expressivity , resembles mild BDLS .
A new clinical condition linked to a novel mutation in lamins A and C with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> lipoatrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin-resistant diabetes <END> , disseminated leukomelanodermic papules , <START:PHENOTYPE> liver steatosis <END> , and cardiomyopathy.
A-Type lamins , arising from the LMNA gene , are intermediate filaments proteins that belong to the lamina , a ubiquitous nuclear network .
Naturally occurring mutations in these proteins have been shown to be responsible for several distinct diseases that display skeletal and/or cardiac muscle or peripheral nerve involvement .
These include familial partial lipodystrophy of the Dunnigan type and the mandibuloacral dysplasia syndrome .
The pathophysiology of this group of diseases , often referred to as laminopathies , remains elusive .
We report a new condition in a 30-yr-old man exhibiting a previously undescribed heterozygous R133L LMNA mutation .
His phenotype associated generalized acquired <START:PHENOTYPE> lipoatrophy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin-resistant diabetes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> with valvular involvement , and disseminated whitish papules .
Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of the patient 's cultured skin fibroblasts revealed nuclear disorganization and abnormal distribution of A-type lamins , similar to that observed in patients harboring other LMNA mutations .
This observation broadens the clinical spectrum of laminopathies , pointing out the clinical variability of lipodystrophy and the unreported possibility of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> and skin involvement .
It emphasizes the fact that the diagnosis of genetic alterations in A-type lamins requires careful and complete clinical and morphological investigations in patients regardless of the presenting signs .
The changing purpose of Prader-Willi syndrome clinical diagnostic criteria and proposed revised criteria .
Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) is a complex , multisystem disorder .
Its major clinical features include neonatal hypotonia , developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , behavioral abnormalities , childhood-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , hypothalamic hypogonadism , and characteristic appearance .
The genetic basis of PWS is also complex .
It is caused by absence of expression of the paternally active genes in the PWS critical region on 15q11-q13 .
In approximately 70 % of cases this is the result of deletion of this region from the paternal chromosome 15 .
In approximately 28% , it is attributable to maternal uniparental disomy ( UPD ; inheritance of 2 copies of a chromosome from the mother and no copies from the father , as opposed to the normal 1 copy from each parent ) of chromosome 15 , and in <2% , it is the result of a mutation , deletion , or other defect in the imprinting center .
Clinical diagnostic criteria were established by consensus in 1993 .
Subsequently , definitive molecular genetic testing became available for laboratory diagnosis of PWS . However , identification of appropriate patients for testing remains a challenge for most practitioners because many features of the disorder are nonspecific and others can be subtle or evolve over time .
For example , hypotonic infants who are still in the failure to thrive phase of the disorder often do not have sufficient features for recognition of PWS and often are not tested .
Initial screening with these diagnostic criteria can increase the yield of molecular testing for older children and adults with nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and mental retardation .
Therefore , the purpose of clinical diagnostic criteria has shifted from assisting in making the definitive diagnosis to raising diagnostic suspicion , thereby prompting testing .
We conducted a retrospective review of patients with PWS confirmed with genetic testing to assess the validity and sensitivity of clinical diagnostic criteria published before the widespread availability of testing for all affected patients and recommend revised clinical criteria .
Charts of all 90 patients with laboratory-confirmed PWS were reviewed .
For each patient , the presence or absence of the major , minor , and supportive features listed in the published diagnostic criteria was recorded .
The sensitivity of each criterion , mean of the total number of major and minor criteria , and mean total score for each patient were calculated .
There were 68 patients with a deletion (del 15q11-q13) , 21 with maternal UPD of chromosome 15 , and 1 with a presumed imprinting defect .
Age range at the time of the most recent evaluation was 5 months to 60 years ( median : 14.5 years ; del median : 14 years ; range : 5 months-6 0 years ; UPD median : 18 years ; range : 5-42 years ) .
The sensitivities of the major criteria ranged from 49 % ( characteristic facial features ) to 98 % (developmental delay ) .
Global developmental delay and neonatal hypotonia were the 2 most consistently positive major criteria and were positive in >97 % of the patients .
Feeding problems in infancy , excessive weight gain after 1 year , hypogonadism , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphagia <END> were all present in 93 % or more of patients .
Sensitivities of the minor criteria ranged form 37% ( sleep disturbance and apneas ) to 93 % ( speech and articulation defects ) .
Interestingly , the sensitivities of 8 of the minor criteria were higher than the sensitivity of characteristic facial features , which is a major criterion .
Fifteen out of 90 patients with molecular diagnosis did not meet the clinical diagnostic criteria retrospectively .
When definitive diagnostic testing is not available , as was the case for PWS when the 1993 criteria were developed , diagnostic criteria are important to avoid overdiagnosis and to ensure that diagnostic test development is performed on appropriate samples .
When diagnostic testing is available , as is now the case for PWS , diagnostic criteria should serve to raise diagnostic suspicion , ensure that all appropriate people are tested , and avoid the expense of testing unnecessarily .
Our results indicate that the sensitivities of most of the published criteria are acceptable .
However , 16 .7% of patients with molecular diagnosis did not meet the 1993 clinical diagnostic criteria retrospectively , suggesting that the published criteria may be too exclusive .
A less strict scoring system may ensure that all appropriate people are tested .
Accordingly , we suggest revised clinical criteria to help identify the appropriate patients for DNA testing for PWS .
The suggested age groupings are based on characteristic phases of the natural history of PWS . Some of the features ( eg , neonatal hypotonia , feeding problems in infancy ) serve to diagnose the syndrome in the first few years of life , whereas others ( eg , excessive eating ) are useful during early childhood .
Similarly , hypogonadism is most useful during and after adolescence .
Some of the features like neonatal hypotonia and infantile feeding problems are less likely to be missed , whereas others such as characteristic facial features and hypogonadism ( especially in prepubertal females ) may require more careful and/or expert examination .
The issue of who should have diagnostic testing is distinct from the determination of features among confirmed patients .
Based on the sensitivities of the published criteria and our experience , we suggest testing all newborns /infants with otherwise unexplained hypotonia with <START:PHENOTYPE> poor suck <END> .
For children between 2 and 6 years of age , we consider hypotonia with history of <START:PHENOTYPE> poor suck <END> associated with global developmental delay sufficient criteria to prompt testing .
Between 6 and 12 years of age , we suggest testing those with hypotonia ( or history of hypotonia with <START:PHENOTYPE> poor suck <END> ) , global developmental delay , and excessive eating with central <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ( if uncontrolled ) .
At the ages of 13 years and above , we recommend testing patients with cognitive impairment , excessive eating with central <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ( if uncontrolled ) , and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and/or typical behavior problems ( including temper tantrums and obsessive-compulsive features ) .
Thus , we propose a lower threshold to prompt diagnostic DNA testing , leading to a higher likelihood of diagnosis of this disorder in which anticipatory guidance and intervention can significantly influence outcome .
A novel ubiquitin ligase is deficient in Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> . Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> is a recessively inherited disease characterized by congenital defects , bone marrow failure and cancer susceptibility .
Cells from individuals with Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> are highly sensitive to DNA-crosslinking drugs , such as mitomycin C ( MMC ) . Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> proteins function in a DNA damage response pathway involving breast cancer susceptibility gene products , BRCA1 and BRCA2 ( refs . 1 ,2 ) .
A key step in this pathway is monoubiquitination of FANCD2 , resulting in the redistribution of FANCD2 to nuclear foci containing BRCA1 ( ref . 3 ) .
The underlying mechanism is unclear because the five Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> proteins known to be required for this ubiquitination have no recognizable ubiquitin ligase motifs .
Here we report a new component of a Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> protein complex , called PHF9 , which possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and is essential for FANCD2 monoubiquitination in vivo .
Because PHF9 is defective in a cell line derived from an individual with Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> , we conclude that PHF9 ( also called FANCL ) represents a novel Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> complementation group ( FA-L ) .
Our data suggest that PHF9 has a crucial role in the Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> pathway as the likely catalytic subunit required for monoubiquitination of FANCD2 .
A new recognisable syndrome in three sibs with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> round face <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and developmental retardation .
We report three sibs with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> round face <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , small mouth , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , developmental retardation , relatively dark skin , and <START:PHENOTYPE> high axial triradius <END> .
The chromosomes of the three patients were normal and the parents were unrelated , healthy , and of normal intelligence .
The mother denied infections , drinking , drug intake , or exposure to known teratogenic agents during each pregnancy .
Unknown syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> exophthalmos <END> , gum hyperplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , low set ears , and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosclerosis <END> .
We report a neonate , born at term , with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> exophthalmos <END> , gum hyperplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and low set ears , who died at 86 minutes of age .
Radiographs showed diffuse sclerosis of the bones .
Walker-Warburg syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> absent auditory canals <END> .
Walker-Warburg syndrome is a lethal , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by anomalies of the central nervous system and eye .
Typical findings include <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , agyria , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dysplasia <END> , cerebellar dysgenesis , anterior chamber dysgenesis , and encephalocele .
Recently , the phenotypic spectrum has been expanded to include congenital muscular dystrophy.
Two sibs with Walker-Warburg syndrome are reported .
One sib had congenital glaucoma and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> .
The other sib had <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> absent auditory canals <END> , and pale retinas , barely within the phenotypic spectrum of the disorder .
Elevation of muscle enzymes was consistent with the diagnosis of Walker-Warburg syndrome .
Clinical and behavioral characteristics in FG syndrome .
FG syndrome is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> form of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , first described by Opitz and Kaveggia in 1974 .
Based on over 50 reported cases , FG syndrome is associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum , minor facial anomalies ( high , broad forehead with frontal cowlick , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanted palpebral fissures <END> , and small cupped auricles) , relative macrocephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad thumbs <END> and halluces , and prominent fetal fingertip pads .
Affected individuals manifest <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal hypotonia <END> and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> , which usually resolves during mid-childhood .
The hypotonia with joint hyperlaxity evolves into spasticity with joint contractures in later life .
Affability , hyperactivity , and excessive talkativeness are noted frequently in patients with FG syndrome .
Recently , we described three additional families (six additional patients ) with FG syndrome who support the localization of a gene for the FG syndrome in chromosome region Xq12-q21 [ Graham JM Jr , Tackels D , Dibbern K , Superneau D , Rodgers C , Corning K , Schwartz CE . 1998 .
Am J Med Genet 8 0:145-156 . ] .
Using these same families and one additional sporadic case of FG syndrome , we compared behavioral and personality characteristics of 6 FG boys with other boys with syndromic and nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> : eight with Down syndrome , seven with Prader-Willi syndrome , eight with nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and 13 with Williams syndrome .
Using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales , the Reiss Personality Profiles , and the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist , parents were asked to characterize the behavior and personality of their boys from ages 4 to 10 years .
When compared with Williams syndrome , the FG boys had fewer internalizing behaviors and were significantly less anxious and withdrawn but had similar socially oriented , attention-seeking behaviors .
On the Reiss Profile , FG boys were also quite similar to Williams syndrome boys .
On the Vineland Scales , FG boys demonstrated significant relative strengths in their socialization skills , consistent with their personality , tending to confirm previous descriptions of their personalities .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Blepharophimosis <END> , minor facial anomalies , genital anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> : report of two sibs with a unique syndrome .
We report on two sibs , a 2.5-year-old girl and a 10-month-old boy , with a hitherto unreported combination of congenital anomalies : <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , abnormal palate , low anterior and posterior hairlines , displaced hair whorl , apparently low-set and abnormally shaped ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> , dental anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> laryngomalacia <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , genital anomalies , hypotonia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The occurrence of a similar pattern of anomalies in two sibs of opposite sex suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
To our knowledge , this combination of anomalies has not been reported previously , and thus we propose it to be a formal genesis syndrome .

Mutations in the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase gene are responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> type III and hawkinsinuria .
The enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase ( HPD ) catalyzes the reaction of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid to homogentisic acid in the tyrosine catabolism pathway .
A deficiency in the catalytic activity of HPD may lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> type III , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by elevated levels of blood tyrosine and massive excretion of tyrosine derivatives into urine .
It has been postulated that hawkinsinuria , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterized by the excretion of 'hawkinsin, ' may also be a result of HPD deficiency .
Hawkinsin is a sulfur amino acid identified as ( 2-l-cystein-S-yl , 4-dihydroxycyclohex-5-en-1-yl)acetic acid .
Patients with hawkinsinuria excrete this metabolite in their urine throughout their life , although symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> metabolic acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> improve in the first year of life .
We performed analyses of the HPD gene in a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> type III and two unrelated patients with hawkinsinuria .
A homozygous missense mutation predicting an Ala to Val change at codon 268 ( A268V ) in the HPD gene was found in the patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> type III.
A heterozygous missense mutation predicting an Ala to Thr change at codon 33 ( A33T) was found in the same HPD gene in the two patients with hawkinsinuria .
These findings support the hypothesis that alterations in the structure and activity of HPD are causally related to two different metabolic disorders , <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> type III and hawkinsinuria .

Frequency analysis and clinical characterization of spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> types 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , and 7 in Korean patients .
By genetic analysis , the CAG repeat expansion has been established in spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( SCA ) types 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , and 7 . Despite the genetic differentiation of SCA , the characterization of the phenotypes of various SCAs has been challenging for better clinical diagnosis .
To analyze the frequencies and the clinical manifestations of SCA1 , SCA2 , SCA3 , SCA6 , and SCA7 in Korean patients .
We performed genetic analysis in 253 unrelated Korean patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive cerebellar ataxia <END> .
We compared the frequencies , inheritance patterns , and various clinical manifestations of patients with genetically confirmed SCA . Among the 52 patients with expanded CAG repeat , the most frequent SCA type was SCA2 , followed by SCA3 , SCA6 , SCA1 , and SCA7 .
Nine patients ( 17% ) had a negative family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , mostly in SCA6 .
There were characteristic clinical features such as hypotonia and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> for SCA1 ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hyporeflexia <END> for SCA2 ; nystagmus , bulging eye , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> for SCA3 ; and macular degeneration for SCA7 .
Interestingly , 4 patients ( 1 with SCA2 , 1 with SCA3 , and 2 with SCA6 ) were misdiagnosed as having multiple-system atrophy because of the absence of family history and the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and urinary incontinence .
This study provides a detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of the genetically defined CAG-repeat SCAs in Korean patients .
Although phenotypes were heterogeneous , some clinical features may be helpful for clinical diagnosis .
However , genetic studies for SCA are needed despite uncertain family history or the presence of atypical clinical features causing misdiagnosis as atypical <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
A homozygous RAB3GAP2 mutation causes Warburg Micro syndrome .
Warburg Micro syndrome and Martsolf syndrome are clinically overlapping <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> conditions characterized by congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and developmental delay .
The neurodevelopmental and ophthalmological phenotype is more severe in Warburg Micro syndrome in which cerebral malformations and severe motor and mental retardation are common .
While biallelic loss-of-function mutations in RAB3GAP1 are present in the majority of patients with Warburg Micro syndrome ; a hypomorphic homozygous splicing mutation of RAB3GAP2 has been reported in a single family with Martsolf syndrome .
Here , we report a novel homozygous RAB3GAP2 small in-frame deletion , c.499_507delTTCTA CACT ( p.Phe167 _ Thr169del ) that causes Warburg Micro syndrome in a girl from a consanguineous Turkish family presenting with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , absent visually evoked potentials , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of the corpus callosum <END> , and severe developmental delay .
No RAB3GAP2 mutations were detected in ten additional unrelated patients with RAB3GAP1-negative Warburg Micro syndrome , consistent with further genetic heterogeneity .
In conclusion , we provide evidence that RAB3GAP2 mutations are not specific to Martsolf syndrome .
Rather , our findings suggest that loss-of-function mutations of RAB3GAP1 as well as functionally severe RAB3GAP2 mutations cause Warburg Micro syndrome while hypomorphic RAB3GAP2 mutations can result in the milder Martsolf phenotype .
Thus , a phenotypic severity gradient may exist in the RAB3GAP-associated disease continuum ( the " Warburg-Martsolf syndrome " ) which is presumably determined by the mutant gene and the nature of the mutation .
Familial adrenal insufficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> , peripheral neuropathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , normal plasma very long chain fatty acids , and normal muscle mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes .
Adrenal insufficiency has been associated with adrenoleukodystrophy and adrenomyeloneuropathy.
In these diseases , plasma very long chain fatty acids are elevated .
Peripheral neuropathy is frequently seen in adults with adrenomyeloneuropathy.
We encountered two first cousins with adrenal insufficiency , who also developed peripheral neuropathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
However , plasma very long chain fatty acids , pipecolic acid , phytanic acid , and cranial computed tomographic scan were normal .
Muscle mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes were also normal .
This syndrome of adrenal insufficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and peripheral neuropathy is different from either adrenomyeloneuropathy or adrenoleukodystrophy.
Heterozygous loss of Six5 in mice is sufficient to cause ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterized by skeletal <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle wasting <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrhythmia <END> , hyperinsulinaemia , mental retardation and ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
The genetic defect in DM is a CTG repeat expansion located in the 3 ' untranslated region of DMPK and 5 ' of a homeodomain-encoding gene , SIX5 ( formerly DMAHP ; refs 2-5 ) .
There are three mechanisms by which CTG expansion can result in DM . First , repeat expansion may alter the processing or transport of the mutant DMPK mRNA and consequently reduce DMPK levels .
Second , CTG expansion may establish a region of heterochromatin 3 ' of the repeat sequence and decrease SIX5 transcription .
Third , toxic effects of the repeat expansion may be intrinsic to the repeated elements at the level of DNA or RNA ( refs 10 ,11 ) .
Previous studies have demonstrated that a dose-dependent loss of Dm15 ( the mouse DMPK homologue ) in mice produces a partial DM phenotype characterized by decreased development of skeletal muscle force and cardiac conduction disorders .
To test the role of Six5 loss in DM , we have analysed a strain of mice in which Six5 was deleted .
Our results demonstrate that the rate and severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> formation is inversely related to Six5 dosage and is temporally progressive .
Six5+ /- and Six5- /- mice show increased steady-state levels of the Na+/K+-ATPase alpha-1 subunit and decreased Dm15 mRNA levels .
Thus , altered ion homeostasis within the lens may contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> formation .
As ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> are a characteristic feature of DM , these results demonstrate that decreased SIX5 transcription is important in the aetiology of DM . Our data support the hypothesis that DM is a contiguous gene syndrome associated with the partial loss of both DMPK and SIX5 .
The prevalence of childhood atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> in a general population .
Atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> has become more common during recent decades , but few studies have looked at its prevalence in the general community .
Our purpose was to ascertain the prevalence of atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> , its age of onset , and its relationship to breast-feeding and ear piercing in a general practice population .
Children ( N = 11 04) , aged 3 to 11 years , were identified from a computerized register in a socially and ethnically mixed English general practice population of 13 ,314 .
Of these , 1077 children ( 97.6 % recruitment ) were interviewed with parents or guardians , and the resultant data were recorded on a survey form .
The lifetime occurrence of atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> was 20% in boys ( 12 % in the past year ) and 19 % in girls ( 11 % in the past year ) .
Prevalence in the past year was 10 % to 14 % in boys aged 3 to 11 years but fell in girls from 15 % at 3 to 5 years to 8 % at 9 to 11 years .
Atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> developed in the first 12 months of life in 60 % of the children who had the condition , and it developed in the first 6 months of life in three quarters of these children .
Ear piercing had been performed in 35 % of girls and 3% of boys and was most prevalent in social classes 3 , 4 , and 5 . More than half the girls aged 9 to 11 years had pierced ears .
Breast-feeding did not affect the prevalence of atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> .
The lifetime prevalence of atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> was 20% in children aged 3 to 11 years .
There was no evidence that ear piercing perpetuated <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> in this age group .
Breast-feeding did not protect against the development of atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> .
Welander hereditary distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , a molecular genetic comparison to hereditary myopathies with inclusion bodies .
Welander distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> ( WDM ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder with late onset predominantly affecting distal extensor muscles of the hands and the feet .
The disorder is considered as the most common of the distal myopathies but is almost only seen in Sweden and some parts of Finland .
The finding of <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> in muscle biopsies from patients with moderate and severe symptoms constitutes one similarity with hereditary inclusion body <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> ( HIBM ) sparing the quadriceps as described by Argov and Yarom [ Argov Z , Yarom R . J Neurol Sci 1984;64 :33-43 ] .
The question has been raised whether some of the different forms of distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> might be allelic .
In previous reports the gene defects for HIBM and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> ( DMRV ) have been mapped to chromosome 9pl-q1 .
The Finnish tibial muscular dystrophy ( TMD ) that displays similar histopathological findings has recently been linked to chromosome 2q .
We have investigated the regions of interest with dispersed microsatellite markers in four well-described pedigrees , and this study now excludes the regions on chromosome 9pl-q1 and 2q from linkage to WDM both by haplotype analysis and linkage analysis with the MLINK program .
WDM , showing morphological similarities with HIBM , is clearly separated from the disorders mapped to chromosomes 9 and 2 on clinical and genetical grounds .
Dominant X linked subcortical laminar heterotopia and <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> syndrome ( XSCLH/LIS) : evidence for the occurrence of mutation in males and mapping of a potential locus in Xq22 .
X linked subcortical laminar heterotopia and <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> syndrome ( XSCLH/ LIS) is an intriguing disorder of cortical development , which causes classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in hemizygous males , and subcortical laminar heterotopia ( SCLH ) associated with milder <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in heterozygous females .
Here we report an exclusion mapping study carried out in three unrelated previously described families in which males are affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> and females with SCLH , using 38 microsatellite markers evenly distributed on the X chromosome .
Most of the X chromosome was excluded and potential intervals of assignment in Xq22.3-q23 or in Xq27 are reported .
Although the number of informative meioses did not allow a decision between these two loci , it is worth noting that the former interval is compatible with the mapping of a breakpoint involved in a de novo X;autosomal balanced translocation 46 , XX ,t( X;2 )(q22;p25 ) previously described in a female with classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
In addition , haplotype inheritance in two families showed a grandpaternal origin of the mutation and suggested in one family the presence of mosaicism in germline cells of normal transmitting males .
Choreoacanthocytosis in a Mexican family .
Choreoacanthocytosis ( CHAC ) ( Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man accession No . 200150 ) is a hereditary neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by movement disorders , cognitive decline , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , behavioral changes , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> and is caused by mutations in the VPS13A gene . To describe the cases of 2 Mexican women with clinical and molecular characteristics compatible with CHAC .
Case reports .
Patients Choreoacanthocytosis was identified in 2 Mexican mestizo sisters with healthy consanguineous parents .
Clinical manifestations began at different ages .
The onset of signs and symptoms of CHAC in the proband was at age 32 years and was characterized by balancing problems followed by <START:PHENOTYPE> chorea <END> , compulsive lip and tongue biting with buccolingual self-mutilation , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> .
The first clinical manifestations in the proband 's sister occurred at age 45 years and included multiple motor and verbal <START:PHENOTYPE> tics <END> , with coprolalia , followed by lip and tongue biting , self-mutilation , and <START:PHENOTYPE> chorea <END> .
The clinical findings in both sisters were remarkable for <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> that developed late , when neurologic changes were already evident .
Mutation screening of the VPS13A gene revealed homozygosity for the frameshift mutation c.3556 _3557dupAC in exon 33 . Currently , the proband 's sister , in whom neurologic defects developed 13 years after onset of CHAC in the proband , is the least affected .
The same mutation of the VPS13A gene can be expressed differently in the same family .
This observation confirms the notion that there is considerable heterogeneity in the clinical manifestation of CHAC .
Cri du chat syndrome : changing phenotype in older patients .
The cri du chat syndrome or 5p deletion syndrome is a well-delineated clinical entity and has an incidence of 1/50 ,000 in newborn infants .
A de novo deletion is present in 85 % of the patients .
Ten to 15 % are familial cases with more than 90 % due to a parental translocation and 5 % due to an inversion of chromosome 5 . Although the size of the deleted segment varies , the critical segment that is deleted in all patients appears to be 5p15 .2 .
The clinical picture is well known in younger patients and includes the typical high-pitched cry , psychomotor retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , growth rate failure , and craniofacial abnormalities including <START:PHENOTYPE> round face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , downward slanting palpebral fissures , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
With advancing age , the clinical picture becomes less striking .
We present seven patients with 5p deletion syndrome , who were between age 16 and 47 years .
Comparing their phenotype at several ages , a change of their phenotype was noted .
Some of the clinical characteristics became more evident such as <START:PHENOTYPE> long face <END> , macrostomia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
All patients were severely or profoundly mentally retarded except one patient who was mildly mentally retarded .
The diagnosis was difficult to make in some of the patients who were first seen at an older age .
In some of them , the craniofacial appearance resembled that seen in Angelman syndrome .
Most patients had periods of destructive behavior , <START:PHENOTYPE> self mutilation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> aggression <END> .
The clinical diagnosis should be confirmed as soon as possible with cytogenetic investigation to provide specific support , prevention , and treatment of complications .
Therefore , it is important to perform follow-up studies in young children to determine their outcome after infant-stimulation programs .
Association between genes on chromosome 4p16 and non-syndromic oral clefts in four populations .
Isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> are among the most common human birth defects .
Several candidate gene studies on MSX1 have shown significant association between markers in MSX1 and risk of oral clefts , and re-sequencing studies have identified multiple mutations in MSX1 in a small minority of cases , which may account for 1-2% of all isolated oral clefts cases .
We explored the 2-Mb region around MSX1 , using a marker map of 393 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 297 <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> , with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , case-parent trios and 84 <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> trios from Maryland , Taiwan , Singapore , and Korea .
Both individual markers and haplotypes of two to five SNPs showed several regions yielding statistical evidence for linkage and disequilibrium .
Two genes ( STK32B and EVC ) yielded consistent evidence from <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> , with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , trios in all four populations .
These two genes plus EVC2 also yielded suggestive evidence for linkage and disequilibrium among <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> trios .
This analysis suggests that several genes , not just MSX1 , in this region may influence risk of oral clefts .
Psychopathology in the Lujan-Fryns syndrome : report of two patients and review .
We report on two new patients , the propositus and his maternal uncle , with Lujan-Fryns syndrome ( LFS ) .
One presented with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and both patient had <START:PHENOTYPE> Marfanoid habitus <END> and similar craniofacial anomalies ( they had a long and <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small mandible <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypernasal voice <END> ) as previously reported by Lujan et al . in 1984 and Fryns and Buttiens in 1987 .
One of our patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> as described by Lujan .
The second patient had an <START:PHENOTYPE> ascending aortic aneurysm <END> like the patient described by Wittine et al . 1999 .
Both patients showed similar behavior and psychiatric disorders .
In addition , we reviewed the literature for the presence of psychopathology in LFS .
After studying the 32 published cases and the 2 described in this article , we found that more than 90 % of the patients present with some type of psychopathology , the most frequent being an autistic-like disorder .
In our opinion , the <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ( complete or partial ) and ascending aorta aneurysm are manifestations of LFS , and thus brain MRI and echocardiogram should be part of the routine evaluation .
Additionally , the high prevalence of psychopathological alterations in these patients suggests the need for psychiatric evaluation at the time of diagnosis .

Initial observations of human dermatosparaxis : Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC.
We describe initial observations of an infant with dermatosparaxis ( another form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , designated as type VIIC) , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> skin fragility <END> and described in several species of domesticated animals .
Electron microscopic examination of the skin shows collagen sheets rather than fibrils , and characteristic distortions resembling hieroglyphs .
In addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> skin fragility <END> , the disorder is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> redundant skin folds <END> and edema , healing with minimal scar formation , large fontanels and wide sagittal and metopic sutures , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> ; after the neonatal period there are <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> , growth failure , short limbs , and normal mineralization of the skeleton except for the cranial vault .
This disorder may also be a cause of premature rupture of placental membranes and <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> .
Congenital gastric teratoma in Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome .
Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome ( WBS ) may be associated with abdominal tumors , including <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> adrenocortical carcinoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatoblastoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadoblastoma <END> , rhabdomyosarcoma , and <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> .
We report on a newborn infant with WBS and a congenital teratoma of the stomach .
This is the sole report of any teratoma being associated with WBS and also the first report of a tumor present at birth and visible prenatally in WBS .
At birth this infant boy had the diagnostic findings of WBS with <START:PHENOTYPE> macroglossia <END> , ear lobule creases and pits , nevus flammeus , and <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , and an abdominal mass .
Abnormalities were detected prenatally when ultrasound examination showed placental <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> , polyhydramnios , <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , and posterior abdominal calcifications .
Resection of the mass and partial gastrectomy were performed at age 10 days ; histologic study showed an immature grade-II teratoma containing a mixture of mature and immature tissues from all germ layers .
Results of cytogenetic studies of blood and teratoma were normal ( 46 , XY ) .
This congenital gastric teratoma in a newborn boy with classical WBS may represent either a tumor or an included twin .
We discuss its implications for the association of WBS with neoplasia and monozygotic ( MZ ) twinning , review various neoplasias associated with WBS , and consider pathogenetic mechanisms .
Nf1 ; Trp53 mutant mice develop <START:PHENOTYPE> glioblastoma <END> with evidence of strain-specific effects .
Astrocytomas are the leading cause of brain cancer in humans .
Because these tumours are highly infiltrative , current treatments that rely on targeting the tumour mass are often ineffective .
A mouse model for <START:PHENOTYPE> astrocytoma <END> would be a powerful tool for dissecting tumour progression and testing therapeutics .
Mouse models of <START:PHENOTYPE> astrocytoma <END> have been designed to express oncogenic proteins in astrocytes , but have had limited success due to low tumour penetrance or limited tumour progression .
We present here a mouse model of astrocytomas involving mutation of two tumour-suppressor genes , Nf1 and Trp53 .
Humans with mutations in NF1 develop neurofibromatosis type I ( NF1 ) and have increased risk of optic gliomas , astrocytomas and glioblastomas .
The TP53 tumour suppressor is often mutated in a subset of astrocytomas that develop at a young age and progress slowly to <START:PHENOTYPE> glioblastoma <END> ( termed secondary glioblastomas , in contrast to primary glioblastomas that develop rapidly de novo ) .
This mouse model shows a range of <START:PHENOTYPE> astrocytoma <END> stages , from low-grade <START:PHENOTYPE> astrocytoma <END> to <START:PHENOTYPE> glioblastoma multiforme <END> , and may accurately model human secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> glioblastoma <END> involving TP53 loss .
This is the first reported mouse model of <START:PHENOTYPE> astrocytoma <END> initiated by loss of tumour suppressors , rather than overexpression of transgenic oncogenes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Gonadal dysgenesis <END> in individuals with apparently normal chromosomal complements : tabulation of cases and compilation of genetic data .
Although usually associated with an abnormal sex chromosomal complement , <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadal dysgenesis <END> is occasionally detected in individuals having apparently normal male ( 46 , XY ) or female ( 46 , XX ) chromosomal complements .
Six individuals with XY or XX <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadal dysgenesis <END> , four proven , two probable , are described .
A review of histologically verified cases of XX and XY <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadal dysgenesis <END> reveals frequent familial aggregation of affected individuals , a situation rarely encountered in the more frequent X-monosomic <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadal dysgenesis <END> .
Multiple affected sibs and frequent X-monosomic <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadal dysgenesis <END> .
Multiple affected sibs and frequent parental consanguinity suggest that XX <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadal dysgenesis <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition , while certain families suggest that XY <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadal Dysgenesis <END> is an X-linked recessive or male-limited autosomal dominant condition .
Recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> tetraamelia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> with multiple malformations in sibs .
A term amelic female infant was born to an apparently nonconsanguineous Arab Moslem couple .
This was followed by the birth of 4 normal children .
Afterwards , in 2 subsequent pregnancies , 2 amelic fetuses were diagnosed by transabdominal ultrasonography in the 18th and 12th week of gestation .
Pregnancies were terminated and on autopsy both amelic fetuses had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lung hypoplasia <END> and aplasia of the peripheral pulmonary vessels .
The first fetus also had apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , whereas the last had <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> and left <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> beside the <START:PHENOTYPE> lung hypoplasia <END> and aberrant pulmonary artery .
This appears to be a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> malformation syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , combined immunodeficiency , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , and hypopigmentation in two brothers .
We describe 2 brothers with a malformation syndrome consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , cutaneous hypopigmentation , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate , and combined immunodeficiency .
The clinical history of both patients was characterized by severe psychomotor retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , recurrent severe respiratory infections , and <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis <END> .
The children died of bronchopneumonia at age 2 and 3 years , respectively .
Immunological investigations showed , in one sib studied , skin anergy to recall antigens , profound depletion of T4 + lymphocytes , and serum IgG2 deficiency .
Necropsy showed <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis <END> , and profound hypoplasia of the thymus and of the peripheral lymphoid tissue .
The distinctive features of these sibs appear to define a previously undescribed hereditary MCA/MR syndrome .
The clinical and pathological findings seem to indicate , as a pathogenetic mechanism , a defect involving the embryonic organization of the central nervous system and of the immune system .
A locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> ( FEB3 ) maps to chromosome 2q23-24.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Febrile seizures <END> are the most common form of childhood seizures , occurring in 2% to 5 % of North American children .
We report a large Utah family with 21 members affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
All had <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized tonic-clonic seizures <END> with onset associated with fever , consistent with the consensus febrile seizure phenotype , and none had <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> beyond 6 years of age .
Eighteen affected individuals had recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> .
Eight individuals developed afebrile seizures between ages 5 and 13 years .
Afebrile seizures consisted of generalized tonic-clonic , generalized tonic , generalized atonic , simple partial , and partial complex seizure types and were associated with abnormal electroencephalographic findings in 5 individuals , all of whom were intellectually normal .
We undertook linkage analysis in this family , defining the disease phenotype as <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> alone .
Linkage analysis in epilepsy candidate gene/loci regions failed to show evidence for linkage to <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> .
However , a genomewide scan and subsequent fine mapping revealed significant evidence for a new febrile seizure locus ( FEB3 ) on chromosome 2q23-24 with linkage to the marker D2S2330 ( LOD score 8.08 at theta = 0.001 ) .
Haplotype analysis defined a critical 10-cM region between markers D2S141 and D2S2345 that contains the FEB3 locus .
Efficacy of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy in women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Options for women at high risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> include surveillance , chemoprevention , and prophylactic mastectomy .
The data on the outcomes for surveillance and prophylactic mastectomy are incomplete .
We conducted a retrospective study of all women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> who underwent bilateral prophylactic mastectomy at the Mayo Clinic between 1960 and 1993 .
The women were divided into two groups - high risk and moderate risk - on the basis of family history .
A control study of the sisters of the high-risk probands and the Gail model were used to predict the number of breast cancers expected in these two groups in the absence of prophylactic mastectomy .
We identified 639 women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> who had undergone bilateral prophylactic mastectomy : 214 at high risk and 425 at moderate risk .
The median length of follow-up was 14 years .
The median age at prophylactic mastectomy was 42 years .
According to the Gall model , 37. 4 breast cancers were expected in the moderate-risk group ; 4 breast cancers occurred ( reduction in risk , 89.5 percent ; P< 0.001 ) .
We compared the numbers of breast cancers among the 214 high-risk probands with the numbers among their 403 sisters who had not undergone prophylactic mastectomy .
Of these sisters , 38.7 percent ( 156 ) had been given a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> ( 115 cases were diagnosed before the respective proband 's prophylactic mastectomy , 38 were diagnosed afterward , and the time of the diagnosis was unknown in 3 cases ) .
By contrast , <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> was diagnosed in 1.4 percent ( 3 of 214 ) of the probands .
Thus , prophylactic mastectomy was associated with a reduction in the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> of at least 90 percent .
In women with a high risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> on the basis of family history , prophylactic mastectomy can significantly reduce the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Axonal neuropathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> is caused by mutations in mitofusin 2 . Charcot-Marie-Tooth ( CMT) neuropathy with visual impairment due to <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> has been designated as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type VI ( HMSN VI ) . Reports of affected families have indicated <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and recessive forms , but the genetic cause of this disease has remained elusive .
Here , we describe six HMSN VI families with a subacute onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and subsequent slow recovery of visual acuity in 60 % of the patients .
Detailed clinical and genetic studies were performed .
In each pedigree , we identified a unique mutation in the gene mitofusin 2 ( MFN2 ) .
In three families , the MFN2 mutation occurred de novo ; in two families the mutation was subsequently transmitted from father to son indicating <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
MFN2 is a mitochondrial membrane protein that was recently reported to cause axonal CMT type 2A.
It is intriguing that MFN2 shows functional overlap with <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> 1 ( OPA1 ) , the protein underlying the most common form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and mitochondrial encoded oxidative phosphorylation components as seen in Leber 's hereditary optic atrophy.
We conclude that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> HMSN VI is caused by mutations in MFN2 , emphasizing the important role of mitochondrial function for both optic atrophies and peripheral neuropathies .
The Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome : the fourth case of a separate entity with <START:PHENOTYPE> prenatal growth retardation <END> , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
We report on a boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> prenatal growth retardation <END> , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
Despite extensive laboratory investigations , no specific cause for the abnormalities could be revealed .
Strikingly similar features have been described in two brothers by Hoyeraal et al . [5 ] in 1970 and in one boy by Hreidarsson et al . [6 ] in 1988 .
The features seem to be part of a separate entity , for which the eponym " Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome " may be used .
An autosomal or <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> mode of inheritance seems likely .
The Roberts syndrome/SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> spectrum--a case report of an adult with review of the literature .
Roberts syndrome ( RBS ) ( OMIM #268300 ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by tetraphocomelia ( symmetrical limb reduction ) , craniofacial anomalies , growth retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , cardiac and renal abnormalities .
The syndrome is caused by mutations in the ESCO2 ( establishment of cohesion 1 homolog 2 ) ( Entrez 609353 ) gene , which is located at 8p21.1 , and encodes a protein essential in establishing sister chromatid cohesion during S phase . SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> ( SC ) ( OMIM #269000) , has less severe symmetric limb reduction , flexion contractures of various joints , minor facial anomalies , growth retardation and occasionally , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
These two syndromes can be considered part of a spectrum , with RBS at the most severe range in which severely affected infants may be <START:PHENOTYPE> stillborn <END> or die in the post-natal period , while individuals with SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> represent the milder end of the spectrum and typically survive to adulthood .
In both presentations , karyotype investigations characteristically reveal premature centromere separation ( PCS) , otherwise known as heterochromatin repulsion or puffing .
There is little literature about the follow-up of adults with the spectrum of RBS/SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> or their recommended management .
We report on an adult presentation of RBS/SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> spectrum disorder with a history of major cardiac malformation in childhood , normal limbs on physical examination , mild facial anomalies , mild learning difficulties , and PCS . Molecular studies of ESCO2 have confirmed the diagnosis .
A literature review , focussing on adult manifestations of this condition and a discussion of follow-up guidelines are presented .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Renal tumors <END> in the Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome .
Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© ( BHD ) syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> genodermatosis characterized by the development of small dome-shaped papules on the face , neck , and upper trunk ( fibrofolliculomas ) .
In addition to these benign hair follicle tumors , BHD confers an increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> renal neoplasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> spontaneous pneumothorax <END> . To date , there has been no systematic pathologic analysis of the <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> associated with this syndrome .
We reviewed 130 solid <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> resected from 30 patients with BHD in 19 different families .
Preoperative computed tomography scans demonstrated a mean of 5.3 tumors per patient ( range 1-28 tumors ) , the largest tumors averaging 5.7 cm in diameter ( + /- 3.4 cm , range 1.2-15 cm ) .
Multiple and bilateral tumors were noted at an early age ( mean 5 0.7 years ) .
The resected tumors consisted predominantly of chromophobe renal cell carcinomas ( 44 of 130 , 34% ) or of hybrid oncocytic neoplasms that had areas reminiscent of chromophobe <START:PHENOTYPE> renal cell carcinoma <END> and oncocytoma ( 65 of 130 , 5 0% ) .
Twelve clear cell ( conventional ) renal carcinomas ( 12 of 130 , 9% ) were diagnosed in nine patients .
These tumors were on average larger ( 4.7 +/- 4.2 cm ) than the chromophobe ( 3. 0 +/- 2.5 cm ) and hybrid tumors ( 2.2 +/- 2.4 cm ) .
Microscopic oncocytosis was found in the renal parenchyma of most patients , including the parenchyma of five patients with evidence of clear cell <START:PHENOTYPE> renal cell carcinoma <END> .
Our findings suggest that microscopic oncocytic lesions may be precursors of hybrid oncocytic tumors , chromophobe renal cell carcinomas , and perhaps clear cell renal cell carcinomas in patients with BHD syndrome .
Recognition by the pathologist of the unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> associated with BHD may assist in the clinical diagnosis of the syndrome .
HLA- C and guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Psoriasis <END> is a heterogeneous disease in its clinical expression .
Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the inflammatory and hyperproliferative components of the typical skin lesions .
Predisposing genetic influences include associations with human leucocyte antigens ( HLA ) of which that with HLA-Cw6 is the strongest .
Guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> is a specific clinical manifestation of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> frequently associated with group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal throat infection .
We set out to determine whether further clinical subdivision of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> is associated with tighter correlation with HLA- C alleles .
We determined the HLA- C locus genotype of 29 caucasian patients with guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> presenting consecutively with guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> associated with a history of a sore throat and/or an antistreptolysin O titre > 200 IU mL-1 .
Polymerase chain reaction typing using sequence-specific primers was used to detect all known HLA- C alleles .
These data were compared with a control population of 604 random caucasian cadaver donors .
All patients (100% ) with guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> carried the Cw*0602 allele compared with 20% of the control population ( odds ratio = infinity ; 95 % confidence limits 25.00-infinity ; Pcorrected < 0.0000002 ) .
This result is consistent with HLA-Cw*0602 playing a part directly in the pathogenesis of guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
Development of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> : review of hypotheses , a novel hypothesis , and implications for research .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Gastroschisis <END> , a ventral body wall defect , is a continuing challenge and concern to researchers , clinicians , and epidemiologists seeking to identify its cause(s ) and pathogenesis .
Concern has been renewed in recent years because , unlike most other birth defects , rates of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> are reportedly increasing in many developed and developing countries .
No tenable explanation or specific causes have been identified for this trend .
Rates of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> are particularly high among pregnancies of very young women .
Such an intriguing association , not observed to this degree with other birth defects , may afford clues to the defect 's cause .
Understanding the causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> may provide insight to the defect 's origin .
In pursuing such causal studies , it would be helpful to understand the embryogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> .
To date , four main embryologic hypotheses have been proposed : (1 ) Failure of mesoderm to form in the body wall ; (2 ) Rupture of the amnion around the umbilical ring with subsequent herniation of bowel ; (3 ) Abnormal involution of the right umbilical vein leading to weakening of the body wall and gut herniation ; and (4 ) Disruption of the right vitelline (yolk sac ) artery with subsequent body wall damage and gut herniation .
Although based on embryological phenomena , these hypotheses do not provide an adequate explanation for how <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> would occur .
Therefore , we propose an alternative hypothesis , based on well described embryonic events .
Specifically , we propose that abnormal folding of the body wall results in a ventral body wall defect through which the gut herniates , leading to the clinical presentation of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> .
This hypothesis potentially explains the origin of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> as well as that of other developmental defects of the ventral wall .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperacusis <END> in Williams syndrome : characteristics and associated neuroaudiologic abnormalities .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperacusis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> phonophobia <END> are common , debilitating symptoms in Williams syndrome ( WS) , yet little is known about their underlying audiologic and neurologic processes .
The mothers of 49 subjects with WS were asked to complete the <START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperacusis <END> Screening Questionnaire . Subjects with reported <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperacusis <END> and sufficient developmental capacity underwent comprehensive audiological and brain auditory evoked response ( BAER ) testing .
Findings were compared with those from pair-matched typically developing control subjects .
Forty-one of the 49 children with WS ( 84% ) had <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperacusis <END> of moderate to severe degree , which began in infancy .
Of these , 21 ( mean age 15 .8 +/- 5.5 years ) were quantitatively tested .
Subjects with WS reported discomfort at sound intensities on average 20 dB lower than control subjects .
Pure-tone audiometry and distortion products otoacoustic emission test revealed a high-frequency cochlear hearing loss .
An absence of ipsilateral acoustic reflex responses to maximum stimulation was significantly more common in the subjects with WS than controls .
On BAER testing , the WS group had a significant prolongation in wave I latency .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperacusis <END> in Williams syndrome ( WS ) is associated with a high-frequency hearing loss resembling the configuration of noise-induced hearing loss .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperacusis <END> and hearing loss in WS may stem from a deficiency in the acoustic reflex resulting from auditory nerve dysfunction .
Additional mechanisms that may mediate <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperacusis <END> in WS and should be evaluated in future studies include recruitment , malformation of the facial canal , and haploinsufficiency of the elastin gene .
Severe pre- and <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> with hypotonia and marked hypotrophy of the distal extremities , dental anomalies , and eczematous skin .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> entity .
We report on three young children , two girls and one boy , with pre- and <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth deficiency <END> , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> with notably <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired speech development <END> , hypotrophy of the distal extremities , small hands and feet , small and <START:PHENOTYPE> widely spaced teeth <END> , eczematous skin , and , in two of them , a <START:PHENOTYPE> partial agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> .
To our knowledge this specific combination of features has not been reported before .
Since the two girls are sisters and the boy is the product of a consanguineous marriage , the inheritance of this new syndrome appears to be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
MEHMO ( Mental retardation , Epileptic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , Hypogenitalism , <START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> ) : a new X-linked mitochondrial disorder .
MEHMO ( Mental retardation , Epileptic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , Hypogenitalism , <START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> ) is an X-linked disorder characterised by mental retardation , epileptic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , hypogenitalism , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .
It was recently assigned to the locus Xp21.1-p22.13 .
We describe a child with MEHMO and lactic acidosis whose muscle biopsy revealed markedly reduced activities of complexes 1 ,3 and 4 of the mitochondrial electron transport chain .
Histological staining showed mitochondrial proliferation and lipid storage .
Electron microscopy revealed abnormal and enlarged mitochondria with concentric cristae and electron dense bodies .
This is the first identification of MEHMO as a mitochondrial disorder and one of the very few X-linked mitochondrial syndromes .
Novel VLDLR microdeletion identified in two Turkish siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> and pontocerebellar atrophy.
Congenital ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> is a heterogeneous group of disorders that presents with motor disability , hypotonia , incoordination , and impaired motor development .
Among these , disequilibrium syndrome describes a constellation of findings including non-progressive cerebellar ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> following an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> pattern of inheritance and can be caused by mutations in the Very Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor ( VLDLR ) .
Interestingly , while the majority of patients with VLDL-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> in the literature use bipedal gait , the previously reported patients of Turkish decent have demonstrated similar neurological sequelae , but rely on quadrupedal gait .
We present a consanguinous Turkish family with two siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> , predominantly frontal <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> and ataxic bipedal gait , who were found to have a novel homozygous deletion in the VLDLR gene identified by using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays for homozygosity mapping and identification of CNVs within these regions .
Discovery of disease causing homozygous deletions in the present Turkish family capable of maintaining bipedal movement exemplifies the phenotypic heterogeneity of VLDLR-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> and ataxia .
Fryns syndrome : report on 8 new cases .
The name Fryns syndrome was given to a new variable multiple congenital anomaly syndrome , almost always lethal , described in 1978 , and now known to be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
Since that date , 20 patients have been reported in the literature .
We describe 8 new cases , 6 of which were diagnosed in a series of 112 ,276 consecutive births ( livebirths and perinatal deaths ) .
The prevalence of this syndrome can be estimated to be around 0.7 per 10,000 births .
These new cases confirm that the most frequent anomalies are diaphragmatic defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> lung hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate ( often bilateral) , cardiac defects ( <START:PHENOTYPE> septal defects <END> and aortic arch anomalies) , renal cysts ( type II , III or IV) , urinary tract malformations , and distal limb hypoplasia .
Most patients also have hypoplastic external genitalia and anomalies of internal genitalia ( bifid or hypoplastic uterus , immature testes ) .
The digestive tract is also often abnormal: <START:PHENOTYPE> duodenal atresia <END> , pyloric hyperplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> malrotation <END> and common mesentery are present in half of the patients .
When the brain was examined , more than half were abnormal ( <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker anomaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of corpus callosum <END> ) .
A few patients demonstrated <START:PHENOTYPE> cloudy cornea <END> .
We examined the eyes of three patients histologically : two of them showed retinal dysplasia with rosettes and gliosis of the retina , thickness of posterior capsula of lens and irregularities of the Bowman membrane .
Four of our cases were diagnosed prenatally between 24 and 27 weeks .
It is to be expected that prenatal diagnosis will be made often and earlier in the future , as the spectrum of anomalies of the Fryns syndrome can easily be evidenced by sonography.
Severe early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , adrenal insufficiency and <START:PHENOTYPE> red hair <END> pigmentation caused by POMC mutations in humans .
Sequential cleavage of the precursor protein pre-pro-opiomelanocortin ( POMC ) generates the melanocortin peptides adrenocorticotrophin ( ACTH ) , melanocyte-stimulating hormones ( MSH ) alpha , beta and gamma as well as the opioid-receptor ligand beta-endorphin .
While a few cases of isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> ACTH deficiency <END> have been reported ( OMIM 201400) , an inherited POMC defect has not been described so far .
Recent studies in animal models elucidated a central role of alpha-MSH in the regulation of food intake by activation of the brain melanocortin-4- receptor ( MC4-R ; refs 3-5 ) and the linkage of human <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> to chromosome 2 in close proximity to the POMC locus , led to the proposal of an association of POMC with human <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .
The dual role of alpha-MSH in regulating food intake and influencing hair pigmentation predicts that the phenotype associated with a defect in POMC function would include <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , alteration in pigmentation and <START:PHENOTYPE> ACTH deficiency <END> .
The observation of these symptoms in two probands prompted us to search for mutations within their POMC genes .
Patient 1 was found to be a compound heterozygote for two mutations in exon 3 ( G7013T , C7133delta ) which interfere with appropriate synthesis of ACTH and alpha-MSH .
Patient 2 was homozygous for a mutation in exon 2 ( C3804A ) which abolishes POMC translation .
These findings represent the first examples of a genetic defect within the POMC gene and define a new monogenic endocrine disorder resulting in early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , adrenal insufficiency and <START:PHENOTYPE> red hair <END> pigmentation .
A new locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> maps to chromosome 16q24.3 . Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder .
Both pure and complicated forms have been described , with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , and X-linked inheritance .
Various loci ( SPG1- SPG6 ) associated with this disorder have been mapped .
Here , we report linkage analysis of a large consanguineous family affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> with age at onset of 25-42 years .
Linkage analysis of this family excluded all previously described <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> loci .
A genomewide linkage analysis showed evidence of linkage to chromosome 16q24.3 , with markers D16S413 ( maximum LOD score 3.37 at recombination fraction [theta] of .00 ) and D16S303 ( maximum LOD score 3.74 at straight theta=.00 ) .
Multipoint analysis localized the disease gene in the most telomeric region , with a LOD score of 4.2 .
These data indicate the presence of a new locus linked to pure recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> , on chromosome 16q24.3 , within a candidate region of 6 cM .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Heterogeneity <END> in diabetes mellitus--update , 1978 .
Evidence for further <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> within juvenile-onset insulin-dependent <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> .
The concept that idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> is a genetically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> group of disorders has been established by twin and HLA studied that have permitted the separation of juvenile-onset and maturity-onset diabetes .
The extent of the <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> within the juvenile-onset and maturity-onset types is still in question .
On the basis of recent immunologic and metabolic studies we believe that further <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> can be demonstrated within the juvenile-onset diabetic group .
We wish to hypothesize that there are at least two distinct forms of juvenile-onset diabetes , one associated with HLA B8 and the other with BW15 .
The B8 type is characterized by autoimmunity , microangiopathy , and a stronger association with the HLA D locus .
The BW15 type is characterized by antibody response to exogenous insulin and a stronger association with the HLA C locus .
Greater understanding of the pathogenesis , natural history , and genetics of <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> will result as the full extent of <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> is elucidated .
Myelodysplasia syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in patients with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> receiving G-CSF therapy .
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) has had a major impact on management of " severe chronic neutropenia, " a collective term referring to congenital , idiopathic , or cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Almost all patients respond to G-CSF with increased neutrophils , reduced infections , and improved survival .
Some responders with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> have developed myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloblastic leukemia ( MDS/AML) , which raises the question of the role of G-CSF in pathogenesis .
The Severe Chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> Neutropenia <END> International Registry ( SCNIR) , Seattle , WA , has data on 696 neutropenic patients , including 352 patients with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , treated with G-CSF from 1987 to present .
Treatment and patient demographic data were analyzed .
The 352 congenital patients were observed for a mean of 6 years ( range , 0.1-11 years ) while being treated .
Of these patients , 31 developed MDS/AML , for a crude rate of malignant transformation of nearly 9% . None of the 344 patients with idiopathic or cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> developed MDS/AML .
Transformation was associated with acquired marrow cytogenetic clonal changes : 18 patients developed a partial or complete loss of chromosome 7 , and 9 patients manifested abnormalities of chromosome 21 ( usually trisomy 21 ) .
For each yearly treatment interval , the annual rate of MDS/AML development was less than 2% . No significant relationships between age at onset of MDS/AML and patient gender , G-CSF dose , or treatment duration were found ( P > .15 ) .
In addition to the 31 patients who developed MDS/AML , the SCNIR also has data on 9 additional neutropenic patients whose bone marrow studies show cytogenetic clonal changes but the patients are without transformation to MDS/AML .
Although our data does not support a cause-and-effect relationship between development of MDS/AML and G-CSF therapy or other patient demographics , we cannot exclude a direct contribution of G-CSF in the pathogenesis of MDS/AML .
This issue is unclear because MDS/AML was not seen in cyclic or idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Improved survival of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> patients receiving G-CSF therapy may allow time for the expression of the leukemic predisposition that characterizes the natural history of these disorders .
However , other factors related to G-CSF may also be operative in the setting of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .

Plantar lipomatosis , unusual facies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> : confirmation of Pierpont syndrome .
In 1998 , Pierpont et al . reported on two unrelated boys with plantar lipomatosis , unusual facial phenotype , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> as a possible new MR/MCA syndrome .
Here we report on a 2-year-old boy with similar manifestations : axial hypotonia in the first few months , prolonged <START:PHENOTYPE> feeding problems <END> , moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , no speech development , deep palmar and plantar grooves , fat pads at the anteromedial aspect of the heels , and a distinct facial phenotype ( <START:PHENOTYPE> high forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high anterior hairline <END> , mild midfacial hypoplasia , remarkably narrow and upward slanted palpebral fissures , broad nasal ridge and tip , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad philtrum <END> , bowed upper lip , " pouting " lower lip , <START:PHENOTYPE> full cheeks <END> , and flat occiput ) .
Brain MRI and MR spectroscopy studies showed relatively small frontal lobes , some widening of the lateral and third ventricles , and increased choline levels in the frontal white matter .
Cytogenetic studies in lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts and whole genome micro-array CGH failed to show abnormalities .
The present patient has a phenotype almost identical to that of the earlier reported children ( Pierpont et al . [ 1998 ] : Am J Med Genet 75 :18-21) , which thereby validates this as a separate MR/MCA syndrome , appropriately designated Pierpont syndrome .
The cause of the entity remains uncertain , the most likely etiologies being X-linked recessive or <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> genes .

CAMOS , a <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , is caused by a mutant zinc-finger protein , ZNF592 .
CAMOS ( <START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebellar Ataxia <END> with Mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> Optic atrophy <END> and Skin abnormalities ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome characterized by a <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> associated with mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and skin abnormalities .
Using homozygosity mapping in a large inbred Lebanese Druze family , we previously reported the mapping of the disease gene at chromosome 15q24-q26 to a 3.6-cM interval between markers D15S206 and D15 S199 .
Screening of candidate genes lying in this region led to the identification of a homozygous p.Gly1046Arg missense mutation in ZNF592 , in all five affected individuals of the family .
ZNF592 encodes a 1267-amino-acid zinc-finger ( ZnF ) protein , and the mutation , located within the eleventh ZnF , is predicted to affect the DNA-binding properties of ZNF592 .
Although the precise role of ZNF592 remains to be determined , our results suggest that ZNF592 is implicated in a complex developmental pathway , and that the mutation is likely to disturb the highly orchestrated regulation of genes during cerebellar development , by either disrupting interactions with target DNA or with a partner protein .
Biochemical characterization of a pedigree with mitochondrially inherited deafness .
A large kindred with a predicted 2-locus inheritance of sensorineural deafness , caused by the combination of a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> and an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mutation , was examined at the biochemical level .
Because of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial inheritance <END> of this disease , we looked for defects in the oxidative phosphorylation Complexes I , III , IV , and V , the 4 enzymes that include all of the 13 mitochondrially encoded polypeptides .
Biosynthetic labelling of lymphoblastoid cells from deaf patients , unaffected siblings , and an unrelated control showed no difference in size , abundance , rate of synthesis , or chloramphenicol-sensitivity of the mitochondrially encoded subunits .
Since overall <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> protein synthesis appears normal , these results suggest that the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutation is unlikely to be in a tRNA or rRNA gene .
No change in enzymatic levels was seen in lymphoblastoid mitochondria of the deaf patients , compared to unaffected sibs and controls , for Complexes I and IV. Both affected and unaffected family members showed an increase in Complex III activity compared to controls , which may reflect the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA shared by maternal relatives , or be due to other genetic differences .
Complex V activity was increased in deaf individuals compared to their unaffected sibs .
Since the family members share the presumptive <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutation , differences between deaf and unaffected individuals likely reflect the nuclear background and suggest that the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mutation may be related to the increase in Complex V activity .
These biochemical studies provide a guide for sequence analysis of the patients ' <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA and for linkage studies in this kindred .
A new type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome associated with tortuous systemic arteries in a large kindred from Qatar .
To describe the clinical spectrum of anomalies of a new type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in 32 patients from a large inter-related extended family in Qatar .
Among the 32 patients ( from 22 families) , there were 6 affected pairs of siblings and 2 families with 3 affected siblings .
The male to female ratio was 2:1 , ages ranging from birth to 18 y ( mean 7. 4 y ) . Anomalies included a variable degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> skin hyperextensibility <END> , hypermobility of small and large joints , and tortuous systemic arteries .
Peculiar facial features included epicanthic folds , flat saggy cheeks , elongated faces and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
The combination of an elongated aortic arch and tortuous brachiocephalic arteries was seen in 30 patients ( 93.8% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> aneurysm <END> of the ascending aorta in 3 patients ( 9.4% ) , bifid pulmonary artery in 27 patients ( 84.4% ) and multiple severe peripheral stenosis of the right and/or left pulmonary artery in 7 patients ( 21.9% ) .
A prominent aortic knuckle was observed on the chest roentgenograms of 30 patients ( 93.8% ) ; <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> in 11 patients ( 34% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> hiatus hernia <END> in 7 patients ( 21.9% ) ; and laryngo-tracheomalacia in 2 patients ( 6.3% ) .
Generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle hypotonia <END> was found in 15 neonates ( 46 .9% ) .
Parental consanguinity involved in all the patients was traced to a common ancestor from a large Bedouin tribe in Qatar .
These patients are at risk for potentially catastrophic arterial rupture .
Linkage to the major loci involved in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other connective tissue disorders , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> Cutis Laxa <END> , Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> Aneurysm <END> , and Osteogenesis imperfecta , was excluded by using specific DNA markers , confirming the uniqueness of this disorder .
The study describes a large cohort of patients from the same closely related family , sharing peculiar dysmorphisim and consistent radiological and echocardiographic features different from known types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome .
As known loci involved in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other connective tissue disorders were excluded by specific DNA markers , this appears to be a new type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or even a new syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> pterygia <END> , shortness and distinct facial appearance .
A new MCA/MR syndrome .
During a systematic survey of the mentally retarded , 3 related females were seen with a similar syndrome of shortness , unusual combination of craniofacial anomalies ( <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> bulging forehead <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> ; posteriorly angulated , <START:PHENOTYPE> lowset ears <END> and microretrognathia) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> genital hypoplasia <END> in all 3 cases , and multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> pterygia <END> in one .
The facial changes were also noted in 2 grandmothers and may indicate <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> of this presently " private " MCA/MR syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertension <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> : long-term sequelae of uninephrectomy in humans .
Renal function and blood pressure were assessed in 52 renal allograft donors 10 years or more following uninephrectomy , and their current function compared to their pre-uninephrectomy function as well as to age - and sex-matched control subjects consisting of inpatient potential renal donors and a normal " outpatient " population .
The results show no significant deterioration in renal function as determined by serum creatinine or creatinine clearance , as a function of years post-uninephrectomy or age at the time of donation .
A higher incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> was found in male donors as compared to their pre-uninephrectomy values and to age - and sex-matched , inpatient and outpatient control subjects .
Female donors had increased <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> when compared to pre-uninephrectomy and to age-matched , inpatient potential donors .
However , the extent of <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> was not significantly different from outpatient age-matched females with two kidneys .
In our population , uninephrectomy is associated with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
Genetic predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Breast cancer <END> risk factors are closely intertwined with the patient 's cultural background , which may contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> aggregations within families .
The difficult questions are : (1 ) does a truly hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> subset exist ; (2 ) which familial aggregations are hereditary ; and (3 ) is the hereditary form distinctive from its sporadic counterpart ?
These queries will be resolved once biomarkers are identified that show high sensitivity and specificity with genotype .
The authors provide a review of this subject and will focus on their recent discovery of increased in vitro hyperdiploidy in cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with or at risk for hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
The authors discuss findings from their study of family histories in 225 consecutively ascertained patients with verified <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> from the Creighton University School of Medicine Oncology Clinic .
Findings consistent with an hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> syndrome were identified in 5 % of the patients .
Given the 112 ,000 new cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in the United States in 1982 , the authors estimate that with a confidence coefficient of 0.95 between 2410 and 8790 of these individuals will manifest hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Specific surveillance/management programs should be geared to high-risk members of these families in which cancer yield will be predictable .
Novel mutations in BCOR in three patients with oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome , but none in Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome .
Oculo-facio-cardio-dental ( OFCD ) syndrome is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> condition with male lethality characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , facial dysmorphic features , congenital heart defects , and dental anomalies .
Mutations in BCOR ( BCL6 co-repressor ) located in Xp11 .4 have been described to cause OFCD syndrome .
Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern comprising microphthalmia/anophthalmia , mental retardation , malformed ears , digital , skeletal , and urogenital anomalies ( synonym : <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> with associated anomalies ( MAA) ) .
One locus for MAA has been mapped to Xq27-q28 .
Nonetheless , linkage and subsequent mutation analysis revealed a single missense mutation ( p.P85L ) in BCOR in a large family with presumed Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome ( MAA2 ) .
We describe novel mutations in BCOR in three patients with OFCD syndrome , two small deletions ( c.2488_2489delAG and c.3286delG ) and a submicroscopic deletion of about 60 kb encompassing at least BCOR exons 2-15 .
No BCOR mutation was detected in eight patients with Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome .
Our data confirm that BCOR is the causative gene for OFCD syndrome ; however , the failure to identify any mutation in patients with Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome together with the oligosymptomatic phenotype in the reported MAA2 patients suggest that BCOR is not the major gene for this syndrome .
New <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> disorder in a large inbred Lebanese family .
A large inbred Lebanese pedigree with congenital spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , speech defect , abnormal osmiophilic pattern of skin vessels , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait has been studied .
None of the children had any evidence of a metabolic disease , and the analysis of respiratory chain complex abnormalities was unremarkable .
Only one child had a history of perinatal difficulties .
Differential diagnosis and the possibility that this disorder is a hitherto unreported one are discussed .

Mosaic mutations of the LIS1 gene cause subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> .
Subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> ( SBH ) is a neuronal migration disorder .
DCX mutations are responsible for almost all familial cases , 80% of <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> female cases , and 25% of <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> male cases of SBH , and are associated with more severe gyral and migration abnormality over the anterior brain regions .
Somatic mosaicism has previously been hypothesized in a patient with posteriorly predominant SBH and a mutation of the LIS1 gene , which is usually mutated in patients with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
The authors identified mosaic mutations of LIS1 in two patients ( Patients 1 and 2 ) with predominantly posterior SBH . After ruling out DCX mutations , the authors performed sequencing of the LIS1 gene in lymphocyte DNA . Because sequence peaks in both patients were suggestive of mosaic mutations , they followed up with denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis on blood and hair root DNA and compared the areas of heteroduplex and homoduplex peaks .
A third patient showing the same mutation as Patient 2 but with no evidence of mosaicism was used for comparing the phenotype of mosaic vs full mutation .
The two patients with posterior SBH harbored a missense ( Arg241Pro ) and a nonsense ( R8X ) mosaic mutation of LIS1 .
The rate of mosaicism in Patient 1 was 18 % in the blood and 21% in the hair roots , whereas in Patient 2 it was 24% and 31 % in the same tissues .
The patient with a full R8X mutation of LIS1 had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> can occur with mosaic mutations of the LIS1 gene .
Mutation analysis of LIS1 , using highly sensitive techniques such as denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography , should be considered for patients with posteriorly predominant subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> .
High incidence of skewed X chromosome inactivation in young patients with familial non-BRCA1 / BRCA2 <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
A higher frequency of skewed X chromosome inactivation has been reported in a consecutive series of young patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> compared with controls of a similar age . To investigate the X inactivation pattern in patients with familial non-BRCA1 / BRCA2 <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> ( n = 272 ) , BRCA1 / BRCA2 germline mutations ( n = 35 ) , and sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> ( n = 292 ) .
X inactivation pattern was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis of the highly polymorphic CAG repeat in the androgen receptor ( AR ) gene .
The X inactivation pattern was classified as skewed when 90 % or more of the cells preferentially expressed one X chromosome .
Young patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> had a significantly higher frequency of skewed X inactivation ( 11 .2% ) than young controls ( 2.7% ) ( p = 0.001 ) .
There was also a strong tendency for middle aged patients with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> to be more skewed than middle aged controls ( 13.6 % v 4.4% ) ( p = 0.02 ) .
No association between skewed X inactivation and <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> was found for the BRCA1 / BRCA2 patients .
Skewed X inactivation may be a risk factor for the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in both sporadic and familial <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and may indicate an effect of X linked genes .
Paradoxical NSD1 mutations in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and 11p15 anomalies in Sotos syndrome .
Sotos syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> syndrome characterized by pre- and postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> advanced bone age <END> , variable degrees of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and typical facial features .
Defects of the NSD1 gene account for >or=60 % of cases of Sotos syndrome , whereas the disease-causing mechanism of other cases remains unknown .
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ( BWS ) is a distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> condition characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> macroglossia <END> , abdominal-wall defects , visceromegaly , embryonic tumors , hemihyperplasia , ear anomalies , renal anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal hypoglycemia <END> .
Deregulation of imprinted growth-regulatory genes within the 11p15 region is the major cause of BWS , whereas the molecular defect underlying a significant proportion of <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> BWS cases remains unknown .
Owing to clinical overlaps between the two syndromes , we investigated whether unexplained cases of Sotos syndrome could be related to 11p15 anomalies and , conversely , whether unexplained BWS cases could be related to NSD1 deletions or mutations .
Two 11p15 anomalies were identified in a series of 20 patients with Sotos syndrome , and two NSD1 mutations were identified in a series of 52 patients with BWS .
These results suggest that the two disorders may have more similarities than previously thought and that NSD1 could be involved in imprinting of the chromosome 11p15 region .
A gene for an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lower motor neuron disease <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> childhood onset <END> maps to 1p36 . To describe the clinical features of a novel variant of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lower motor neuron disease <END> ( LMND ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> childhood onset <END> and to map the disease-causing gene .
The authors performed a clinical study in a large consanguineous African family .
After linkage exclusion to SMN1 and SOD1 loci , they performed a genome-wide linkage analysis to map the underlying genetic defect .
This novel variant of LMND with <START:PHENOTYPE> childhood onset <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance is characterized by a progressive symmetric and generalized involvement of the musculature .
Four of the five affected patients had muscle weakness since age 3 , strongly worsening during childhood and leading to generalized tetraplegia in adulthood .
Genetic analyses using homozygosity mapping strategy assigned this progressive generalized LMND locus to an interval of 3.9 cM ( or 1.5 megabases ) on chromosome 1p36 , between loci D1S508 and D1S2633 ( Z(max ) = 3.79 at theta = 0.00 at locus D1S253 ) .
This region encloses 27 candidate genes .
Genetic mapping of a novel rare phenotype of <START:PHENOTYPE> lower motor neuron disease <END> opens the way toward the identification of a new gene involved in motor neuron degeneration , located in the 1p36 chromosomal region .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and diabetes mellitus in mandibuloacral dysplasia .
Mandibuloacral dysplasia ( MAD ) is a syndrome with onset in midchildhood .
The predominant characteristics of MAD include <START:PHENOTYPE> flexion contractures <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular hypoplasia <END> ; loss of body fat ; atrophic , speckled skin ; and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> osteolysis <END> of the clavicles .
We studied three males with MAD .
Each had <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> of the extremities , with sparing of the face and neck .
All had moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlipidemia <END> .
In response to oral glucose , each had a diabetic response , with peak insulin levels between 2870 and 22,96 0 pmol/L .
Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal was determined in two patients with MAD .
At an insulin infusion rate of 120 mU/m2 per minute , glucose disposal was less than 25% of that measured at similar levels of insulinemia in nondiabetic control subjects , indicating marked <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> in patients with MAD .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> occurred without obesity , excessive levels of counterregulatory hormones , or anti-insulin-receptor antibodies .
We suggest that MAD is a previously undescribed form of lipodystrophic <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus <END> .
The National Niemann-Pick C1 disease database : report of clinical features and health problems .
Niemann-Pick type C1 ( NPC1 ) disease is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized clinically by <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal jaundice <END> , hepatosplenomegaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical gaze palsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , and progressive neurodegeneration .
The present study provides basic clinical and health information from the National Niemann-Pick C1 disease database that was obtained using a clinical questionnaire of 83 questions mailed to families affected by NPC1 disease living in the United States .
The study was conducted over a 1-year period , during which time parents/caregivers and physicians completed the clinical questionnaire .
Sixty-four percent ( 87/136 ) of the questionnaires were returned , with 53 % and 47 % representing male and female NPC1 patients , respectively .
The average age of diagnosis for NPC1 disease was 10.4 years , with one-half of patients being diagnosed before the age of 6 .9 years .
The average age of death for NPC1 disease was 16 .2 years , with one-half of patients dying before the age of 12 .5 years .
A common clinical symptom reported at birth was <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal jaundice <END> (52%) , followed by enlargement of the spleen ( 36% ) and liver ( 31% ) ; ascites ( 19% ) and neonatal hypotonia ( 6% ) were much less frequent .
With respect to developmental difficulties , the most common findings included clumsiness ( 87% ) , learning difficulties ( 87% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( 83% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> (8 0% ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical gaze palsy <END> ( 81% ) .
Together , these findings confirm and extend previous reports investigating the clinical features associated with NPC1 disease . Copyright (c ) 2007 Wiley-Liss , Inc .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Stroke <END> in young patients with hyperhomocysteinemia due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency .
Although hyperhomocyst(e )inemia ( Hyper-Hcy ) may predispose to atherosclerosis and venous thrombosis , the mechanisms of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> associated with Hyper-Hcy are not defined .
Clinical and biochemical phenotypes and genetic features of three unrelated patients with premature <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> and severe Hyper-Hcy due to cystathionine beta-synthase ( CBS ) deficiency are described .
Plasma Hcy and amino acids were measured by fluorescence polarization immune assay and ion exchange chromatography.
Analysis of the CBS and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genes was performed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequence analysis .
Two of the three index cases had no known diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> and initially presented with embolic cerebral and retinal infarction in mid-adulthood .
Mechanisms of cerebrovascular disease were carotid intraluminal thrombosis , arterial dissection , and possible cardiac embolism .
Family screening revealed additional members with clinically silent <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> and severe Hyper-Hcy .
Excluding tall stature in two individuals , all had mild phenotypes , without classic findings of CBS deficiency .
Plasma total and free Hcy , methionine , and urine Hcy were elevated .
Genotyping revealed heterozygous CBS mutations ( I278 T , D444N , G307S ) in affected individuals .
Artery-to-artery embolism and dissection may cause <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> in young adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> .
The results also support a rationale for screening for Hyper-Hcy in young adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> without a phenotype suggestive of classic <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> .
Refinement of the locus for non-syndromic sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> ( DFN2 ) .
Non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is a rare form of genetic <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> in humans accounting for a small proportion of all hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> .
Different clinical forms of non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> have been described , and most of these have been mapped .
Here , we report a Chinese family affected by a congenital profound sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> .
All phenotypes of this family are clinically compatible with non-syndromic sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> ( DFN2 ) .
A maximum two-point Lod score of 2.32 was obtained at marker DXS6797 ( theta = 0.00 ) .
Recombinants define a region of 4.3 cM flanked by markers DXS6799 and GATA172D05 .
This region overlaps the previously reported DFN2 region by 2.0 cM .
Construction of a natural panel of 11p11 .2 deletions and further delineation of the critical region involved in Potocki-Shaffer syndrome .
Potocki-Shaffer syndrome ( PSS ) is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome that results from haploinsufficiency of at least two genes within the short arm of chromosome 11 [del( 11 ) ( p11 .2p12 )] .
The clinical features of PSS can include developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple exostoses <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> , enlarged anterior fontanel , minor craniofacial anomalies , ophthalmologic anomalies , and genital abnormalities in males .
We constructed a natural panel of 11p11 .2-p13 deletions using cell lines from 10 affected individuals , fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) , microsatellite analyses , and array-based comparative genomic hybridization ( array CGH ) .
We then compared the deletion sizes and clinical features between affected individuals .
The full spectrum of PSS manifests when deletions are at least 2.1 Mb in size , spanning from D11S1393 to D11 S1385 / D11 S1319 ( 44.6-46 .7 Mb from the 11p terminus ) and encompassing EXT2 , responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple exostoses <END> , and ALX4 , causing <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> .
Yet one subject with <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> whose deletion does not include ALX4 indicates that ALX4 in this subject may be rendered functionally haploinsufficient by a position effect .
Based on comparative deletion mapping of eight individuals with the full PSS syndrome including <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and two PSS families with no <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , at least one gene related to <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> is likely located between D11S554 and D11 S1385 / D11 S1319 , 45 .6-46 .7 Mb from the 11p terminus .
Penetrance for copy number variants associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
The discovery of 'high-risk ' de novo copy number variants ( CNVs ) associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> offers the opportunity to translate these findings into useful tools for clinical geneticists .
However , this will require estimation of penetrance for these variants , which has not yet been properly considered .
To facilitate this process , we estimated the penetrance of CNVs associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , at 15q13.3 , 1q21.1 , 15q11 .2 , 17p12 , 2p16 .3 , 16p13.1 and 16p11 .2 with a novel Bayesian method applied to pooled data from published case-control studies .
For these CNVs , penetrance for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> was between 2 and 7.4% , which contrasts with the much higher penetrance for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> of the 22q11 .2 deletions found in velo-cardio-facial syndrome .
The highest penetrance was for 15q13.3 deletion ( 6-9% in individual studies ) and the lowest was for 15q11 .2 ( 2% ) .
CNVs confer much higher risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> than common variants , but their penetrance is substantially lower than Mendelian disorders or other syndromic conditions .
Since these CNVs predispose to multiple disorders , including <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual impairment <END> , penetrance estimates will also need to take into account diagnostic specificity , and their overall penetrance for any neuropsychiatric disorder is likely to be much higher .
Thus , although CNVs are still far from being clinically useful or relevant to genetic counselling for specific disorders , their detection may hold an important clinical value in predicting negative developmental outcomes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> .
Current concepts in diagnosis and management .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> , although uncommon , is not rare , and most patients with the disorder present with clinical manifestations similar to those of patients with common <START:PHENOTYPE> peptic ulcer <END> .
Early studies emphasized death due to complications of massive gastric acid hypersecretion .
However , with the availability of potent antisecretory agents to control acid secretion , death is now more frequently associated with the metastatic potential of slowly growing but malignant gastrinomas .
Therefore , physicians should maintain a high degree of suspicion of the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> in assessing patients with either chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> peptic ulcer <END> or unexplained secretory <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> .
An evaluation aimed at early diagnosis of the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> should be instituted in such patients and should begin with a determination of the fasting serum gastrin level .
At least 50 percent of patients with gastrinoma will have nondiagnostic serum gastrin concentrations and will therefore require provocative testing to establish the correct diagnosis .
After the presence of the syndrome is established , patients should be treated with a potent antisecretory agent in doses sufficient to reduce basal acid output to less than 10 mmol in the hour preceding administration of the next dose .
Although some patients may be maintained satisfactorily in this manner for extended periods , an approach aimed at tumor localization and extirpation is recommended in most patients .
Preoperative evaluation should begin with CT scanning with intravenous contrast material .
Selective angiography , and occasionally , portal venous sampling for gastrin , should be performed if the location and extent of tumor remain in question .
If metastatic disease is demonstrated , or if MEN-I is present , surgery aimed at tumor resection , although it is occasionally effective , will probably be unsuccessful .
Because of the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with pancreatoduodenectomy , it should not be performed for unresectable tumor in the head of the pancreas .
In other patients with the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> , exploratory surgery should be performed ; this should include a careful search for , and resection of , all pancreatic and extrapancreatic gastrinomas .
With this approach , it is likely that at least 20 percent of all patients with the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> can be cured .
Understanding gustatory <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> .
What have we learned from Lucja Frey and her predecessors ?
Gustatory <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> results from a disruption of the auriculotemporal nerve pathways .
Damage to the nerve may cause a misdirected re-growth that results in parasympathetic innervation of sympathetic receptors and , therefore , facial <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> and flushing with gustatory stimulation .
Over the past 300 years , the history of gustatory <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> has included observations of typhus-induced parotiditis , war injuries , and occupational accidents .
Despite religious and personal persecution , Lucja Frey ( 1889-1943 ) systematically investigated gustatory <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> .
Following the discovery of a German World War II document regarding Lucja Frey , an international committee was organized to research the history of gustatory <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> and of Dr . Frey 's contributions to the understanding of the syndrome .
Twenty original scientific publications from 1700 to 1950 on gustatory <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> were reviewed .
Frey was the first to describe gustatory <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> as a disorder of both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation .
She proposed novel pathologic and pharmacologic mechanisms to explain the syndrome .
Subsequent discoveries , including the work of AndrÃ©-Thomas in 1927 , have provided a more complete understanding of gustatory <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> and the pathologic mechanism of aberrant neuronal regeneration .
A case of Gitelman 's syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> chondrocalcinosis <END> .
A 45-year-old Japanese woman , treated for Bartter 's syndrome for 14 years , presented with complaints of numbness in her extremities and polyarthralgia .
She was diagnosed to have Gitelman 's syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> chondrocalcinosis <END> , which were effectively treated with spironolactone and magnesium supplementation .
Gitelman 's syndrome is a primary renal tubular disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalciuria <END> with normal calcemia .
The persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> is one of the causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> chondrocalcinosis <END> , and many cases of Bartter 's syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> are associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> chondrocalcinosis <END> attributed to a tubular magnesium defect .
We summarize the reported cases with Bartter 's syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> chondrocalcinosis <END> , referring to the possibility of Gitelman 's syndrome .
Subtle radiographic findings of achondroplasia in patients with Crouzon syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> due to an Ala391Glu substitution in FGFR3 .
A unique type of craniofacial dysostosis , Crouzon syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> ( CAN ) , has been attributed to a specific substitution ( Ala391 Glu ) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ( FGFR3 ) gene .
At birth , individuals with this disorder have craniosynostosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular proptosis <END> , midface hypoplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , and they experience the onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> during childhood .
We report three cases and compare the clinical characteristics of our cases with the previously reported cases of this disorder .
Since the Ala391Glu substitution in FGFR3 is close to the substitutions in the transmembrane domain that result in achondroplasia , we carefully reviewed the skeletal findings in six patients .
We identified subtle radiographic findings of achondroplasia in all six cases including narrow sacrosciatic notches , short vertebral bodies , lack of the normal increase in interpediculate distance from the upper lumbar vertebrae caudally , and broad , short metacarpals and phalanges .
Even before <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> appears , the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> in an individual with features of Crouzon syndrome should suggest the diagnosis of CAN , and subtle skeletal findings can lend further support to this diagnosis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> anonychia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> type B brachydactyly <END> and ectrodactyly .
A family is reported with <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dysplasia <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> absent nails <END> , long and broad finger-like thumbs , camptodactyly and absent fingers .
Radiological studies revealed hypoplasia of metacarpals , metatarsals and distal phalanges .
Two affected individuals have absent metacarpals and phalanges .
The clinical and radiological features may constitute a distinct syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> anonychia <END> with Julia Bell brachydactyly type B .
Another " new " form , the palagonia type of acrofacial dysostosis in a Sicilian family .
We described another previously apparently unreported form of acrofacial dysostosis ( AFD ) from Sicily , residing , coincidentally in the same small village as that with the recently delineated Catania AFD .
In contra-distinction to the latter , the 4 patients with the Palagonia form of AFD are of normal intelligence , and instead of extensive caries have <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> (4) , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> (3) , frizzy hair ( <START:PHENOTYPE> pili torti <END> ) with aplasia cutis verticis (1 ) , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous syndactyly <END> of digits 2-5 (4) , attenuation of the 4th metacarpals ( 3/3) , unilaterally <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> (1 ) , and some <START:PHENOTYPE> vertebral anomalies <END> such as a large atlas (1 ) , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> (1 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> small odontoid process <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida occulta at S1 <END> (1 ) . Casually , this would appear to be an iceberg dominant disorder , with the proposita most severely affected .
This could be an X-linked dominant , but more likely an autosomal dominant trait .
Mechanism for release of alkaline phosphatase caused by glycosylphosphatidylinositol deficiency in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphosphatasia <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperphosphatasia <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome ( HPMR) , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disease characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) levels , is caused by mutations in the coding region of the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis , class V ( PIGV ) gene , the product of which is a mannosyltransferase essential for glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) biosynthesis .
Mutations found in four families caused amino acid substitutions A341E , A341V , Q256 K , and H385P , which drastically decreased expression of the PIGV protein .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperphosphatasia <END> resulted from secretion of ALP , a GPI-anchored protein normally expressed on the cell surface , into serum due to PIGV deficiency .
In contrast , a previously reported PIGM deficiency , in which there is a defect in the transfer of the first mannose , does not result in <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphosphatasia <END> .
To provide insights into the mechanism of ALP secretion in HPMR patients , we took advantage of CHO cell mutants that are defective in various steps of GPI biosynthesis . Secretion of ALP requires GPI transamidase , which in normal cells , cleaves the C-terminal GPI attachment signal peptide and replaces it with GPI .
The GPI-anchored protein was secreted substantially into medium from PIGV- , PIGB- , and PIGF-deficient CHO cells , in which incomplete GPI bearing mannose was accumulated .
In contrast , ALP was degraded in PIGL- , DPM2- , or PIGX-deficient CHO cells , in which incomplete shorter GPIs that lacked mannose were accumulated .
Our results suggest that GPI transamidase recognizes incomplete GPI bearing mannose and cleaves a hydrophobic signal peptide , resulting in secretion of soluble AL P . These results explain the molecular mechanism of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphosphatasia <END> in HPMR .
Fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> : clinical and pathologic study of five new cases .
In 1986 , we reported two anatomoclinical observations of a familial condition that we called " fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> " ( FFI ) .
We now present the pedigree as well as the clinical and neuropathologic findings in five new subjects .
The pedigree includes 288 members from six generations . Men and women are affected in a pattern consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
The age of onset of the disease varies between 37 and 61 years ; the course averages 13 months with a range of 7 to 25 months .
Progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> ( polygraphically proven in two cases ) ; autonomic disturbances including <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperhidrosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthermia <END> , tachycardia , and hypertension ; and motor abnormalities including <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , and pyramidal dysfunction , were present in every case , but with variable severity and time of presentation .
Sleep and autonomic disorders were the earliest signs in two subjects , motor abnormalities were dominant in one , and others had intermediate clinical patterns .
Pathologically , all the cases had severe atrophy of the anterior ventral and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei .
Other thalamic nuclei were less severely and inconsistently affected .
In addition , most of the cases had gliosis of the cerebral cortex , a moderate degree of cerebellar atrophy with " torpedoes, " and severe atrophy of the inferior olivary nuclei .
One case also showed spongy degeneration of the cerebral cortex .
We conclude that all the lesions were primary , and that FFI is a multisystem disease in which the different structures are primarily affected with different severity .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> appears to correlate best with the major thalamic pathology .
The possibility that FFI belongs to the group identified as prion diseases or diseases transmitted by unconventional agents is examined .
Lysinuric protein intolerance .
Lysinuric protein intolerance ( LPI) , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> defect of diamino acid transport , is characterized chemically by renal hyperdiaminoaciduria , especially lysinuria , and by impaired formation of urea with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperammonemia <END> after protein ingestion .
Our 20 patients thrived during breast-feeding , but ingestion of cow 's milk caused <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> .
When able to select their diet , they rejected all protein-rich foods .
They were short staturated and had weak atrophic muscles , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> and often <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> .
Four patients were mentally retarded .
Fifteen patients had leukocyte counts below 4,000/mm3 , and 17 patients had platelet counts below 15 0 ,000/mm3 .
Serum lactate dehydrogenase activity was constantly increased , and transaminase and aldolase activities were often increased .
In the infants ' livers , changes were only revealed by electron microscopy : increased and vesicular smooth endoplasmic reticulum , and abundance of glycogen particles in the hepatocytes .
In the older patients , light microscopy demonstrated clearly limited areas where hepatocytes had large pale cytoplasm and small pyknotic nuclei .
The diamino acids lysine , arginine and ornithine had plasma concentrations only one-third to one-half the normal mean ; the renal clearances were clearly increased .
Oral diamino acid loading tests suggested impaired intestinal absorption .
Urea is built in the liver through transformation of ornithine to arginine , and cleavage of arginine to ornithine and urea .
The addition of ornithine to an intravenous I-alanine loading prevented the <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperammonemia <END> and normalized the urea production .
Therefore , the diet has been supplemented with arginine , and more protein has been added .
This therapy has lead to a remarkable catch-up growth in some patients .
The pathophysiology of LPI is explained .
Because of defective intestinal absorption and incrased renal loss , the diamino acids have a low plasma concentration .
Their transport from plasma to hepatocytes is also impaired , and the liver becomes deficient in ornithine .
This retards the urea cycle , and leads to postprandial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperammonemia <END> and protein aversion .
The presence of the transport defect in the hepatocytes distinguishes LPI from other hyperdibasicaminoacidurias .
Metopic <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> due to mutations in GLI3: A novel association .
We report on the novel association of <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> and polysyndactyly in two unrelated patients due to mutations within the last third ( exon 14 ) and first third ( exon 6 ) of the GLI3 gene , respectively .
GLI3 acts as a downstream mediator of the Sonic hedgehog signal-transduction pathway which is essential for early development ; and plays a role in cell growth , specialization , and patterning of structures such as the brain and limbs .
GLI3 mutations have been identified in patients with Pallister-Hall , Grieg cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome ( GCPS) , postaxial polydactyly type A1 , preaxial polydactyly type IV , and in one patient with acrocallosal syndrome ( ACLS ) .
Furthermore , deletions including the GLI3 gene have been reported in patients with features of GCPS and ACLS . To date , <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> has not been associated with abnormalities of GLI3 and <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> is not a feature of GCPS .
However , Hootnick and Holmes reported on a father with polysyndactyly and son with <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> , polysyndactyly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , considered GCPS thereafter .
Guzzetta et al . subsequently described a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> , polysyndactyly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> postulating a diagnosis of GCPS , later considered ACLS .
In retrospect , these two patients , evaluated prior to mutational analysis , and our patients , with confirmed mutations , likely fall within the GLI3 morphopathy spectrum and may provide a bridge to better understanding those patients with overlapping features of GCPS and ACLS .
Based on this observation , we suggest GLI3 studies in patients presenting with this constellation of findings , specifically metopic <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> with polysyndactyly , in order to provide appropriate medical management and genetic counseling .

Amish <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> : Long-term survival and biochemical characterization .
Amish <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( MCPHA , OMIM #607196 ) is a metabolic disorder that has been previously characterized by severe infantile lethal congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and alpha-ketoglutaric aciduria .
All reported patients have been from the Pennsylvania Amish community and homozygous for a p.Gly177 Ala mutation in SLC25A19 .
We present a further male patient with MCPHA born to distantly consanguineous parents in Ontario , Canada with Amish ancestors .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> was evident at 21 weeks gestation on ultrasound .
At birth , the facial appearance and brain MRI scan were characteristic of MCPHA , with the additional features of <START:PHENOTYPE> partial agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> and a closed spinal dysraphic state .
Urine levels of alpha-ketoglutaric acid were normal at birth and during metabolic crisis , but were markedly elevated during a time of metabolic stability .
A severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> was present during metabolic crises and responded to treatment with a high fat diet .
At age 7 years , the child is healthy but has severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and profound developmental delay .
SLC25A19 has been described as a mitochondria inner membrane transporter for both deoxynucleotides and thiamine pyrophosphate ( TPP ) .
The biochemical phenotype of MCPHA may be attributable to decreased activity of the three mitochondrial enzymes that require TPP as a cofactor : pyruvate dehydrogenase , alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase , and branched chain amino acid dehydrogenase .
We confirm that alpha-ketoglutaric aciduria is not a constant finding in MCPHA and suggest that a persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidemia <END> may be more common .
The diagnosis should be considered in patients with severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , especially in association with lissencephaly , dysgenesis of the corpus callosum , or a spinal dysraphic state .

Isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> foveal hypoplasia <END> .
Although defective development of the fovea has long been known to occur in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> and albinism , only rarely has isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> foveal hypoplasia <END> unassociated with these conditions been reported .
We have identified such <START:PHENOTYPE> foveal hypoplasia <END> in nine patients with varying degrees of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nystagmus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> poor visual acuity <END> , but no evidence of albinism or <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> foveal hypoplasia <END> may be more common as a cause of congenital sensory <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> than has been appreciated in the past .
A novel testis-stimulating factor in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> male precocious puberty <END> .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> male precocious puberty <END> is a gonadotropin-independent form of precocious puberty that occurs only in males .
The cause of the disorder is unknown .
To examine the hypothesis that the plasma of boys with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> male precocious puberty <END> contains a novel stimulator of testicular testosterone production , we developed a bioassay using adult male cynomolgus monkeys .
We collected plasma from 12 boys with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> male precocious puberty <END> , 7 normal prepubertal boys of similar ages and with similar plasma gonadotropin levels , and 1 boy with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and infused it into the testicular artery of adult male cynomolgus monkeys that had been pretreated with gonadotropin-releasing-hormone antagonist to inhibit the endogenous secretion of gonadotropins .
Testicular venous effluent was collected at 15-minute intervals for 3 or 5 hours for the measurement of testosterone .
The mean ( + /- SE ) peak testosterone response , as compared with base line , was significantly greater in the monkeys infused with plasma from the 12 boys with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> male precocious puberty <END> than in the monkeys infused with plasma from the 7 normal prepubertal boys and the boy with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( 385 +/- 51 vs . 184 +/- 25 percent , P less than 0.005 ) in the three-hour studies .
Plasma from 92 percent of the boys with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> male precocious puberty <END> and 12 .5 percent of the normal prepubertal boys stimulated a response greater than 195 percent of base-line values .
In the animals studied for five hours after receiving a second dose of antagonist , the mean peak testosterone response , as compared with base line , was significantly greater in the monkeys infused with plasma from three boys with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> male precocious puberty <END> than in the monkeys infused with plasma from three normal prepubertal boys ( 363 +/- 81 vs . 115 +/- 6 percent , P less than 0.01 ) .
The mean area under the testosterone-response curve was significantly larger in the monkeys infused with plasma from the boys with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> male precocious puberty <END> in the five-hour studies ( 15 4 +/- 34 vs . -58 +/- 10 percent , P less than 0.005 ) , but not in the three-hour studies .
These findings support the presence of a circulating testis-stimulating factor in the plasma of boys with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> male precocious puberty <END> .
The production of such a factor would explain the biologic nature of the disorder .
Progressive encephalopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypsarrhythmia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( PEHO syndrome ) .
We describe 14 patients , from 11 families , who have a progressive encephalopathy with early onset .
The clinical signs of the disease are severe hypotonia , convulsions with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypsarrhythmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> profound mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> , transient or persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> , and optic atrophy.
These findings and the characteristic dysmorphic features allow recognition of these patients , although no basic metabolic defect has been found .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> and atrophy of the brain develop , especially in the cerebellar and brain stem areas .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance is likely .
A hexanucleotide repeat upstream of eotaxin gene promoter is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , serum total IgE and plasma eotaxin levels .
Eotaxin ( CCL11 ) is a small protein produced in the lungs of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , and is a potent chemoattractant for eosinophils .
To elucidate the role of eotaxin in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> by an association study of functional and novel eotaxin polymorphisms in case-control and family-based study designs .
Eotaxin +67G /A , -384A/ G and -426C/ T single-nucleotide polymorphisms and a hexanucleotide ( GAAGGA) (n ) repeat 10 .9 kb upstream of the gene were genotyped in a cohort of age , sex and ethnically matched patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( n = 235 ) and healthy controls ( n = 239) , and also in a study population of 230 families with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> recruited from north/northwest India .
Total serum IgE ( Ts IgE ) and plasma eotaxin levels were measured using ELISA . +67G /A polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> in case-control ( p = 0.009 ) and family-based studies ( p = 0.006 ) .
Its functional role , as it was correlated with plasma eotaxin levels ( p = 0.006 ) , was also demonstrated .
Further , -384C/ T single-nucleotide polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with log(10 ) TsIgE ( p = 0.016 in case-control and p = 0.018 in families ) and eotaxin levels ( p = 0.007 ) .
Most interestingly , for the first time , a highly significant association of the newly studied ( GAAGGA) (n ) hexanucleotide repeat with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( p = 3x10( -6) ) , log(10 )Ts IgE ( p = 0.006 ) and eotaxin levels ( p = 0.004 ) was observed .
G_A_ C_8 was also identified as an important risk haplotype associated with high TsIgE and plasma eotaxin levels .
This study provides further evidence that eotaxin polymorphisms are associated with the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> by regulating eotaxin levels and reinforces towards the scanning of other chemokine genes present at 17q21 locus for their association with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and related phenotypes .
POMT2 intragenic deletions and splicing abnormalities causing congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Alpha-dystroglycanopathies are a group of congenital muscular dystrophies ( CMDs ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> characterized by abnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan .
Although six genetic causes have been identified ( FKTN , POMGNT1 , POMT1 , POMT2 , FKRP , and LARGE ) many alpha-dystroglycanopathy patients remain without a genetic diagnosis after standard exon sequencing .
To date POMT2 mutations have been identified in CMD cases with a wide range of clinical severities from Walker-Warburg syndrome to limb girdle <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> without structural brain or ocular involvement .
We analyzed POMT2 in six CMD patients , who had severe diffuse muscle weakness , generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> and elevated CK levels .
Eye involvement was absent or limited to <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> .
We sequenced the coding regions of POMT2 using genomic DNA and cDNA generated from blood lymphocytes or B lymphoblastoid cell lines .
Quantitative PCR analysis of genomic DNA was used to identify and determine the breakpoints of large deletions .
We report five novel mutations in POMT2 , four of which were outside of coding exons , two large genomic deletions and two intronic single base substitutions that induced aberrant mRNA splicing .
Large scale DNA rearrangements ( such as large deletions ) and cryptic splice mutations , that can be missed on standard sequencing of genomic DNA , may be relatively common in POMT2 .
Additional techniques , such as sequencing of cDNA are needed to identify all mutations .
These results also confirm that POMT2 mutations are an important cause of the less severe alpha-dystroglycanopathy phenotypes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Leukemia <END> and preleukemia in Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> patients .
A review of the literature and report of the International Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> Anemia <END> Registry . Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> ( FA ) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized clinically by a progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> , diverse congenital abnormalities , and increased predisposition to malignancy .
Although a variable phenotype makes accurate diagnosis on the basis of clinical manifestations difficult in some patients , the unique sensitivity of FA cells to the clastogenic effect of DNA cross-linking agents such as diepoxybutane ( DEB ) can be used to facilitate the diagnosis .
We review all cases of FA reported to have <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> , preleukemia , or a bone marrow ( BM ) clonal chromosomal abnormality and include for the first time an analysis of these conditions observed in patients in the International Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> Anemia <END> Registry ( IFAR ) .
The incidence of acute myelogenous <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> ( AML ) in FA patients is more than 15 ,000 times that observed in children in the general population .
Cytogenetic studies of FA-associated leukemias disclose a high frequency of monosomy 7 and duplications involving 1q .
There were no occurrences of t(8;21) , t(15 ;17 ) , or abnormalities of 11q , which are associated with M2 , M3 , and M5 leukemias , respectively , but not with preleukemia .
Development of <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> in FA patients was associated with an exceedingly poor prognosis , with a mean age of death of 15 years .
We suggest that all FA patients may be considered preleukemic and that this disorder presents a model for study of the etiology of AML .
Lamin A and ZMPSTE24 ( FACE-1 ) defects cause nuclear disorganization and identify restrictive dermopathy as a lethal neonatal laminopathy.
Restrictive dermopathy ( RD) , also called <START:PHENOTYPE> tight skin <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> contracture <END> syndrome ( OMIM 275 210 ) , is a rare disorder mainly characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , tight and rigid skin with erosions , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent superficial vasculature <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epidermal hyperkeratosis <END> , facial features ( small mouth , small <START:PHENOTYPE> pinched nose <END> and micrognathia) , sparse/absent eyelashes and eyebrows , mineralization defects of the skull , thin dysplastic clavicles , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> , multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> and an early neonatal lethal course .
Liveborn children usually die within the first week of life .
The overall prevalence of consanguineous cases suggested an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
We explored nine fetuses/newborns children with RD . Two were found to have an heterozygous splicing mutation in the LMNA gene , leading to the complete or partial loss of exon 11 in mRNAs encoding Lamin A and resulting in a truncated Prelamin A protein .
Lamins are major constituents of the nuclear lamina , a filamentous meshwork underlying the inner nuclear envelope .
In the other seven patients , a unique heterozygous insertion leading to the creation of a premature termination codon was identified in the gene ZMPSTE24 , also known as FACE-1 in human .
This gene encodes a metalloproteinase specifically involved in the post-translational processing of Lamin A precursor .
In all patients carrying a ZMPSTE24 mutation , loss of expression of Lamin A as well as abnormal patterns of nuclear sizes and shapes and mislocalization of Lamin-associated proteins was evidenced .
Our results indicate that a common pathogenetic pathway , involving defects of the nuclear lamina and matrix , is involved in all RD cases .
RD is thus one of the most deleterious laminopathies identified so far in humans caused by ( primary or secondary ) A-type Lamin defects and nuclear structural and functional alterations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperphosphatasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , brachytelephalangy , and a distinct facial gestalt : Delineation of a recognizable syndrome .
The association of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphosphatasia <END> has been described in rare instances .
Because of parental consanguinity and sib recurrences <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> has been proposed .
We report three sibs with a syndrome consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , considerably elevated serum levels of alkaline phosphatase , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic terminal phalanges <END> , and distinct facial features .
Clinically and radiologically , shortness of distal phalanges could be demonstrated in all of them .
Their particular facial appearance led us to two earlier reported familial cases with convincing clinical similarities .
We suggest a specific clinical entity within the spectrum of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphosphatasia <END> , which is in particular characterized by a recognizable facial gestalt and brachytelephalangy .

Genetic linkage of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival fibromatosis <END> to chromosome 2p21 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Gingival fibromatosis <END> is characterized by a slowly progressive benign enlargement of the oral gingival tissues .
The condition results in the teeth being partially or totally engulfed by keratinized gingiva , causing aesthetic and functional problems .
Both genetic and pharmacologically induced forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival fibromatosis <END> are known .
The most common genetic form , hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival fibromatosis <END> ( HGF) , is usually transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait , although sporadic cases are common and autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported .
The genetic basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival fibromatosis <END> is unknown .
We identified an extended family ( n=32 ) segregating an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival fibromatosis <END> .
Using a genomewide search strategy , we identified genetic linkage ( Zmax=5.05 , straight theta=.00 ) for the HGF phenotype to polymorphic markers in the genetic region of chromosome 2p21 bounded by the loci D2S1788 and D2S441 .
This is the first report of linkage for isolated HGF , and the findings have implications for identification of the underlying genetic basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival fibromatosis <END> .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> in England and Wales .
Information from 72 patients from 7 families in England and Wales confirms that hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> conditions with limited penetrance .
The degree of penetrance is approximately 80% .
These patients have had recurrent attacks of <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> starting from childhood or young adult life .
The mean age of onset in the 7 families studied was 13.6 years .
There were two peaks , with maximum numbers at 5 years and 17 years .
The second peak was thought to represent genetically susceptible individuals having pain brought on by alcohol rather than representing evidence of genetic heterogeneity .
Five of the 7 families had members with both childhood and adult ages of onset .
Only 4 patients out of 72 had life-threatening disease and in the majority of cases the attacks of pain were of nuisance value only .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> was implicated in only 1 patient 's death and this was not definite .
Patients appear to get better after a period of symptoms usually as they approach middle age , or after a severe attack .
In older patients alcohol , emotional upsets , and fatty food appear to precipitate attacks .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pancreatic insufficiency <END> ( 5 .5% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> ( 12 .5% ) , pseudocysts ( 5 .5% ) , and haemorrhagic <START:PHENOTYPE> pleural effusion <END> are uncommon complications .
Portal vein thrombosis occurred definitely in 2 patients and was suspected in 3 others .
Carcinoma of the pancreas was not found in any of 72 patients studied in detail ; however , 2 members from a family not visited personally had chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> and malabsorption going on to carcinoma .
They may have suffered from a different disease .
Genetic linkage information was too slight for many definite conclusions .
However , there was no suggestion of linkage with any of the markers tested .
Periodic vestibulocerebellar ataxia , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> ataxia with defective smooth pursuit , is genetically distinct from other <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> ataxias .
Periodic vestibulocerebellar ataxia is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterized by defective smooth pursuit , <START:PHENOTYPE> gaze-evoked nystagmus <END> , ataxia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> vertigo <END> .
The age of onset ranges from the third to the sixth decade .
To date , all patients have originated from North Carolina , suggesting a single common founder .
To clarify the classification of periodic vestibulocerebellar ataxia by determining whether it is allelic to other <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxias for which genes have been either localized or identified .
Blood was collected and DNA isolated from 66 subjects ( 19 affected individuals ) in two multigenerational families .
The microsatellite markers used in the analysis either flanked or were tightly linked to the disease gene regions .
Two-point and multipoint linkage analyses were performed to define the limits of exclusion .
Periodic vestibulocerebellar ataxia was excluded from loci linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 ( chromosome 6p ) , type 2 ( chromosome 12q ) type 3/Machado/Joseph disease ( chromosome 14q ) , type 4 ( chromosome 16q ) , and type 5 ( 11cent ) as well as to <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> with myokymia ( chromosome 12p) , <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> with nystagmus ( chromosome 19p ) , acetazolamide-responsive hereditary paroxysmal cerebellar ataxia ( chromosome 19p ) , and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy/Haw River syndrome ( chromosome 12p ) .
Periodic vestibulocerebellar ataxia is genetically distinct from those <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> ataxias for which chromosomal localization has been established .
Further delineation of cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome : clinical features of 38 individuals with proven mutations .
Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome ( CFC ) is a multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome named because of a characteristic facies , cardiac anomalies , and ectodermal abnormalities .
While considerable literature describes the main features , few studies have documented the frequencies of less common features allowing a greater appreciation of the full phenotype .
We have analysed clinical data on 38 individuals with CFC and a confirmed mutation in one of the genes known to cause the condition .
We provide data on well-established features , and those that are less often described .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Polyhydramnios <END> ( 77% ) and prematurity ( 49% ) were common perinatal issues .
71 % of individuals had a cardiac anomaly , the most common being <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary valve stenosis <END> ( 42%) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> ( 39% ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> ( 28% ) .
Hair anomalies were also typical: 92 % had <START:PHENOTYPE> curly hair <END> , 84 % <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> , and 86 % absent or sparse eyebrows .
The most frequent cutaneous features were keratosis pilaris ( 73% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> ( 61% ) and nevi ( 76% ) .
Significant and long lived gastrointestinal dysmotility ( 71% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( 49% ) , optic nerve hypoplasia (30% ) and renal anomalies , chiefly <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> (20% ) , were among the less well known issues reported .
This study reports a broad range of clinical issues in a large cohort of individuals with molecular confirmation of CFC .
Increased sensitivity of the neuronal nicotinic receptor alpha 2 subunit causes familial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with nocturnal wandering and ictal fear .
Sleep has traditionally been recognized as a precipitating factor for some forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , although differential diagnosis between some <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> types and parasomnias may be difficult .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> is characterized by nocturnal <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> with hyperkinetic automatisms and poorly organized stereotyped movements and has been associated with mutations of the alpha 4 and beta 2 subunits of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor .
We performed a clinical and molecular genetic study of a large pedigree segregating sleep-related <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in which <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> are associated with fear sensation , tongue movements , and nocturnal wandering , closely resembling nightmares and sleep walking .
We identified a new genetic locus for familial sleep-related focal <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> on chromosome 8p12 .3-8q12 .3 . By sequencing the positional candidate neuronal cholinergic receptor alpha 2 subunit gene ( CHRNA2 ) , we detected a heterozygous missense mutation , I279N , in the first transmembrane domain that is crucial for receptor function .
Whole-cell recordings of transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressing either the mutant or the wild-type receptor showed that the new CHRNA2 mutation markedly increases the receptor sensitivity to acetylcholine , therefore indicating that the nicotinic alpha 2 subunit alteration is the underlying cause .
CHRNA2 is the third neuronal cholinergic receptor gene to be associated with familial sleep-related epilepsies .
Compared with the CHRNA4 and CHRNB2 mutations reported elsewhere , CHRNA2 mutations cause a more complex and finalized ictal behavior .
Loss-of-function mutations in euchromatin histone methyl transferase 1 ( EHMT1 ) cause the 9q34 subtelomeric deletion syndrome .
A clinically recognizable 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome has recently been established .
Common features seen in these patients are <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , cupid bow or tented upper lip , <START:PHENOTYPE> everted lower lip <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prognathism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macroglossia <END> , conotruncal heart defects , and behavioral problems .
The minimal critical region responsible for this 9q subtelomeric deletion ( 9q- ) syndrome has been estimated to be <1 Mb and comprises the euchromatin histone methyl transferase 1 gene ( EHMT1 ) .
Previous studies suggested that haploinsufficiency for EHMT1 is causative for 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome .
We have performed a comprehensive mutation analysis of the EHMT1 gene in 23 patients with clinical presentations reminiscent of 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome .
This analysis revealed three additional microdeletions that comprise the EHMT1 gene , including one interstitial deletion that reduces the critical region for this syndrome .
Most importantly , we identified two de novo mutations--a nonsense mutation and a frameshift mutation--in the EHMT1 gene in patients with a typical 9q - phenotype .
These results establish that haploinsufficiency of EHMT1 is causative for 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and characteristic facial features : delineation of a new syndrome and identification of a locus at chromosome 2q22-q23.
We have identified six children with a distinctive facial phenotype in association with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MR) , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , four of whom presented with Hirschsprung ( HSCR ) disease in the neonatal period .
HSCR was diagnosed in a further child at the age of 3 years after investigation for severe chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> and another child , identified as sharing the same facial phenotype , had chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> , but did not have HSCR .
One of our patients has an interstitial deletion of chromosome 2 , del(2 )(q21q23 ) .
These children strongly resemble the patient reported by Lurie et al with HSCR and dysmorphic features associated with del(2 )(q22q23 ) .
All patients have been isolated cases , suggesting a contiguous gene syndrome or a dominant single gene disorder involving a locus for HSCR located at 2q22-q23.
Review of published reports suggests that there is significant phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity within the group of patients with HSCR , MR , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
In particular , our patients appear to have a separate disorder from Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome , for which autosomal recessive inheritance has been proposed because of sib recurrence and consanguinity in some families .
Assessment of the interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan-1 ( IMPG1 ) gene localised to 6q13-q15 in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Stargardt-like disease ( ADSTGD) , <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive bifocal chorioretinal atrophy <END> ( PBCRA) , and North Carolina <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> ( MCDR1 ) .
We have recently characterised the genomic organisation of a novel interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan , IMPG1 , and have mapped the gene locus to chromosome 6q13-q15 by fluorescence in situ hybridisation .
As the interphotoreceptor matrix ( IPM ) is thought to play a critical role in retinal adhesion and the maintenance of photoreceptor cells , it is conceivable that a defect in one of the IPM components may cause degenerative lesions in retinal structures and thus may be associated with human retinopathies .
By genetic linkage analysis , several retinal dystrophies including one form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Stargardt-like <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> ( STGD3) , <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive bifocal chorioretinal atrophy <END> ( PBCRA) , and North Carolina <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> ( MCDR1 ) have previously been localised to a region on proximal 6q that overlaps the IMPG1 locus .
We have therefore assessed the entire coding region of IMPG1 by exon amplification and subsequent single stranded conformational analysis in patients from 6q linked multigeneration families diagnosed with PBCRA and MCDR1 , as well as a single patient from an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> STGD pedigree unlinked to either of the two known STGD2 and STGD3 loci on chromosomes 13q and 6q , respectively .
No disease associated mutations were identified .
In addition , using an intragenic polymorphism , IMPG1 was excluded by genetic recombination from both the PBCRA and the MCDR1 loci .
However , as the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Stargardt-like macular dystrophies are genetically heterogeneous , other forms of this disorder , in particular STGD3 previously linked to 6q , may be caused by mutations in IMPG1 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> partial lipodystrophy associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> Rieger anomaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and insulinopenic diabetes .
We describe the clinical findings and natural history of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of partial lipodystrophy found in four affected individuals from three generations in the same family .
The lipodystrophy was present from infancy/early childhood , involved primarily the face and local areas on the buttocks , and was nonprogressive .
Affected individuals also had the <START:PHENOTYPE> Rieger anomaly <END> , midface hypoplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retarded bone age <END> , and hypotrichosis .
An affected woman developed insulinopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> at 39 yr and another had <START:PHENOTYPE> glucose intolerance <END> at 55 yr .
Familial predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> does not map to chromosome band 1p36 .
Familial predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> , a common embryonal cancer of childhood , segregates as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait with high penetrance .
It is therefore likely that <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> susceptibility is due to germ line mutations in a tumor suppressor gene .
Cytogenetic , functional , and molecular studies have implicated chromosome band 1p36 as the most likely region to contain a suppressor gene involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> tumorigenesis .
We now demonstrate that <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> predisposition does not map to any of eight polymorphic markers spanning 1p36 by linkage analysis in three families .
In addition , there is no loss of heterozygosity at any of these markers in tumors from affected members of these kindreds .
Furthermore , there is strong evidence against linkage to two Hirschsprung disease ( a condition that can cosegregate with <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> ) susceptibility genes , RET and EDNRB .
We conclude that the <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> susceptibility gene is distinct from the 1p36 tumor suppressor and the currently identified Hirschsprung disease susceptibility genes .
Spectrum of dolichospondylic dysplasia : two new patients with distinctive findings .
Dolichospondylic dysplasia ( DD ) is a rare skeletal dysplasia primarily characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> tall vertebral bodies <END> and disproportionate <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
Radiographic manifestations include <START:PHENOTYPE> tall vertebral bodies <END> and gracile bones of the hands .
Patients usually have eye and ear findings in addition to borderline mental retardation ; however , <START:PHENOTYPE> tall vertebral bodies <END> and slender tubular bones are also seen in the 3-M syndrome .
Patients with the 3-M syndrome have a characteristic face with a triangular shape , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , a flattened malar region , full eyebrows , a short nose with a bulbous tip , upturned nares , and full lips .
We present two unrelated patients who share a distinct phenotype and have <START:PHENOTYPE> tall vertebral bodies <END> , overtubulation of long bones , and short tubular bones of the hands and feet .
We discuss the overlapping and distinguishing features between DD and the 3-M syndrome .
Patient 1 was a 13-year-old female , and patient 2 was an unrelated adult female .
These patients had normocephaly and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
They shared a common phenotype consisting of mild <START:PHENOTYPE> malar hypoplasia <END> , a narrowed nasal body with a fleshy tip , full lips , and normal intelligence .
In addition , they showed mild hand and foot abnormalities .
These two patients lack many of the typical clinical features of both DD and the 3-M syndrome .
They share a common phenotype and likely represent a distinct disorder .
The spectrum of disorders with <START:PHENOTYPE> tall vertebral bodies <END> as a key feature may include different entities that may be further defined with the characterization of the molecular defect(s ) .

Identification of mutations in the human PATCHED gene in sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> and in patients with the <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell nevus <END> syndrome .
Mutations in PATCHED ( PTC ) , the human homolog of the Drosophila patched gene , have been identified in most exons of the gene in patients with the <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell nevus <END> syndrome and in sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> .
We have screened the 23 PTC exons for mutations using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of DNA from 86 <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell nevus <END> syndrome probands , 26 sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> , and seven <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell nevus <END> syndrome-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> .
This screen identified mutations located in eight exons in 13 of the <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell nevus <END> syndrome patients and in three of the tumors .
The most common mutations were frameshifts resulting in premature chain termination .
These results provide further evidence for the crucial role of PTC as a tumor suppressor in human keratinocytes .
A " new " lethal multiple congenital anomaly syndrome : joint contractures , cerebellar hypoplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> renal hypoplasia <END> , urogenital anomalies , tongue cysts , shortness of limbs , eye abnormalities , defects of the heart , gallbladder agenesis , and ear malformations .
Three cases of a lethal malformation syndrome with severe visceral anomalies were seen in two families and include one pair of sibs .
The predominating external manifestations are mesomelic dwarfism , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , V-shaped upper lip , <START:PHENOTYPE> microglossia <END> , thick alveolar ridges , <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> , webbed neck , highly arched palate , clubfeet , fused fontanelles , inclusion cysts of the tongue , four-finger creases , digital anomalies , apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , widely spaced nipples , and dislocated thighs and forearms .
The internal findings include oligopapillary <START:PHENOTYPE> renal hypoplasia <END> , severe congenital heart defect , cerebellar hypoplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> , hypoplastic larynx , and hypoplastic gallbladder .
Other findings from the two autopsies and one clinical investigation not documented in all three patients include unilobar lungs , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , microphthalmia , polydactyly , islet cell hyperplasia , suprapubic skin crease , urethral anomalies , and a decreased number of turns of the cochlea .
The hypoplasia seen in the several affected organs is similar to the disordered development seen in experimental models of branching epithelial morphogenesis in which mesenchymal-epithelial interaction has been disrupted .
Refining the phenotype of alpha-1a Tubulin ( TU BA1A ) mutation in patients with classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Mutations in the alpha-1a Tubulin ( TU BA1A ) gene have recently been found to cause cortical malformations resemblant of classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> but with a specific combination of features .
To date , TUBA1A mutations have been described in five patients and three foetuses .
Our aims were to establish how common TUBA1A mutations are in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> and to contribute to defining the phenotype associated with TUBA1A mutation .
We performed mutation analysis in the TUBA1A gene in 46 patients with classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
In 44 of the patients , mutations in the LIS1 and/or DCX genes had previously been excluded ; in 2 patients , mutation analysis was only performed in TUBA1A based on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) findings .
We identified three new mutations and one recurrent mutation in five patients with variable patterns of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> on brain MRI .
Four of the five patients had congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and all had dysgenesis of the corpus callosum and cerebellar hypoplasia , and variable cortical malformations , including subtle subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> and absence or hypoplasia of the anterior limb of the internal capsule .
We estimate the frequency of mutation in TUBA1A gene in patients with classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> to be approximately 4% , and although not as common as mutations in the LIS1 or DCX genes , mutation analysis in TUBA1A should be included in the molecular genetic diagnosis of classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , particularly in patients with the combination of features highlighted in this paper .
A common molecular basis for three inherited kidney stone diseases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Kidney stones <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> ) , which affect 12 % of males and 5 % of females in the western world , are familial in 45 % of patients and are most commonly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
Three disorders of hypercalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> ( Dent 's disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> ( XRN) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> hypophosphataemic <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> ( XLRH) ) have been mapped to Xp11 .22 ( refs 5-7 ) .
A microdeletion in one Dent 's disease kindred allowed the identification of a candidate gene , CLCN5 ( refs 8 ,9 ) which encodes a putative renal chloride channel .
Here we report the investigation of 11 kindreds with these renal tubular disorders for CLCN5 abnormalities ; this identified three nonsense , four missense and two donor splice site mutations , together with one intragenic deletion and one microdeletion encompassing the entire gene .
Heterologous expression of wild-type CLCN5 in Xenopus oocytes yielded outwardly rectifying chloride currents , which were either abolished or markedly reduced by the mutations .
The common aetiology for Dent 's disease , XRN and XLRH indicates that CLCN5 may be involved in other renal tubular disorders associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> kidney stones <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> are associated with a mutation in the NLGN4 gene , a member of the neuroligin family .
A large French family including members affected by nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> or pervasive developmental disorder in affected male patients , has been found to have a 2-base-pair deletion in the Neuroligin 4 gene ( NLGN4 ) located at Xp22.33 .
This mutation leads to a premature stop codon in the middle of the sequence of the normal protein and is thought to suppress the transmembrane domain and sequences important for the dimerization of neuroligins that are required for proper cell-cell interaction through binding to beta-neurexins .
As the neuroligins are mostly enriched at excitatory synapses , these results suggest that a defect in synaptogenesis may lead to deficits in cognitive development and communication processes .
The fact that the deletion was present in both autistic and nonautistic mentally retarded males suggests that the NLGN4 gene is not only involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , as previously described , but also in <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , indicating that some types of autistic disorder and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> may have common genetic origins .
Aarskog syndrome : report of a family with review and discussion of nosology .
Five individuals in one family , including dizygotic male twins , a half brother and their mother , had Aarskog syndrome ( AS ) .
Phenotypic variability is wide not only between mother and sons but also between sibs .
Collectively , the affected relatives have the full spectrum of findings seen in AS .
Based on analysis of this family and others from the literature , we derive primary and secondary diagnostic criteria for AS .
Primary criteria include : short stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> maxillary hypoplasia <END> , a crease below the lower lip , mild interdigital webbing with short and broad hands , short fifth finger with clinodactyly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> shawl scrotum <END> .
Secondary criteria include : abnormal auricles with fleshy lobules , posteriorly angulated ears , widow 's peak , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , downward slant of palpebral fissures , joint hyperextensibility , broad feet with bulbous toes , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent umbilicus <END> .
Literature pertaining to the clinical manifestations and genetics of AS is reviewed and nosology of similar syndromes is discussed .
Punctuated evolution of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> gene content : high and variable rates of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> gene loss and transfer to the nucleus during angiosperm evolution .
To study the tempo and pattern of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> gene loss in plants , DNAs from 280 genera of flowering plants were surveyed for the presence or absence of 40 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> protein genes by Southern blot hybridization .
All 14 ribosomal protein genes and both sdh genes have been lost from the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome many times ( 6 to 42 ) during angiosperm evolution , whereas only two losses were detected among the other 24 genes .
The gene losses have a very patchy phylogenetic distribution , with periods of stasis followed by bursts of loss in certain lineages .
Most of the oldest groups of angiosperms are still mired in a prolonged stasis in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> gene content , containing nearly the same set of genes as their algal ancestors more than a billion years ago .
In sharp contrast , other plants have rapidly lost many or all of their 16 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> ribosomal protein and sdh genes , thereby converging on a reduced gene content more like that of an animal or fungus than a typical plant .
In these and many lineages with more modest numbers of losses , the rate of ribosomal protein and sdh gene loss exceeds , sometimes greatly , the rate of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> synonymous substitutions .
Most of these <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> gene losses are probably the consequence of gene transfer to the nucleus ; thus , rates of functional gene transfer also may vary dramatically in angiosperms .
Clinical features and ATTCT repeat expansion in spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 . Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disease characterized by ataxia and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , is caused by a large expansion of an unstable ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat .
To characterize the phenotypic expression of spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 and to examine the genotype-phenotype correlations in 2 large families .
Clinical characterization and genotype-phenotype correlation .
Studies at 2 medical schools with private practice referral .
Twenty-two affected individuals from 2 large Mexican American pedigrees .
Of the 22 individuals , ataxia was the initial symptom in 21 ; <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> disorders developed in 11 , mostly within several years following the onset of ataxia .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> frequency was different in the 2 families : 3 ( 25% ) of 12 had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in family 1 , and 8 (8 0% ) of 10 had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in family 2 ( P =.01 ) .
A brain magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scan showed <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> in all patients examined .
An electroencephalogram demonstrated epileptiform discharges in 4 of 8 patients studied .
Although anticipation was apparent in both families , only family 1 showed a strong inverse correlation between age of onset and repeat number ( r(2 ) = 0.79 , P =.001 ) .
In family 1 , 8 transmissions , of which 7 were paternal , resulted in an average gain of 1940 repeats .
In contrast , despite anticipation , 2 affected male subjects transmitted their expanded alleles to 8 progenies , with an average loss of 755 repeats , in family 2 . <START:PHENOTYPE> Seizure <END> is an integral part of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 phenotype , with documented morbidity and mortality .
Family-dependent factors may alter the frequency of the <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> phenotype and the pattern of intergenerational repeat size changes , making the genotype-phenotype correlation complex .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Callosal agenesis <END> , iris <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> megacolon <END> in a Brazilian boy with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome .
We report on a Brazilian boy with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome ( RTS ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> callosal agenesis <END> , iris <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> megacolon <END> .
To our knowledge , <START:PHENOTYPE> callosal agenesis <END> , iris <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> megacolon <END> are unusual signs within the clinical spectrum of RTS , and the present association is apparently underscribed .
New <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopenia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in Mennonite sisters .
We report on 2 Mennonite sisters with a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , minor facial abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> , and hypotonia .
Their asymptomatic consanguineous parents ( inbreeding coefficient F = 1/64 ) have 6 other offspring , 3 of whom died in infancy of type II osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI) , and 3 of whom are normal .
We analyzed collagens synthesized by cultured fibroblasts from these 2 sisters and their parents and detected no major abnormalities .
Results of chromosomal and metabolic evaluations including amino acid analysis of plasma , urine , and hair were unremarkable .
A literature search and survey of a computerized syndrome identification database did not disclose an identical phenotype .
The sisters bear superficial resemblance to several known syndromes which we excluded on clinical and/or biochemical grounds .
We conclude that they represent a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome , distinct from type II OI and perhaps unique to the Mennonite population or to this particular family .
A new familial syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinopathy <END> , hypogonadism , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , nerve deafness and glucose intolerance .
Three siblings with retinitis pigmentosa , deafness and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> were studied .
Physical abnormalities included <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> and multiple keloids .
The two male siblings had <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> , small testes and mild subvirilization whereas the only indication of hypogonadism in the female sibling was oligomenorrhea .
Testosterone levels in the males , which were in the low to low normal range , were increased by the administration of large doses of chorionic gonadotropin .
The two affected males had elevated plasma luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) levels which were decreased by the administration of testosterone and increased by the administration of clomiphene .
One sibling had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and diabetes mellitus , one had moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , normal glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinism and the third had abnormal glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinism .
This familial syndrome is distinct from either the Laurence-Moon , Bardet-Biedl or AlstrÃ¶m disorders and provides further evidence of genetic heterogeneity in this group of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> traits .
Bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> with ectopic intracranial <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> : trilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
In 11 patients , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> presented at a mean age of 6 months and pineoblastoma at 4 years .
We suggest that the hereditary multicentric <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> arose in vestigeal photoreceptors in the pineal as well as in the hypothetical retinoblasts of the retina .
In certain lower animals , the pineal functions as a photoreceptor organ , resembles the retina histologically , and is described as a " third eye. " Hence , the patients we describe may be considered as having " trilateral retinoblastoma. " Two possible variants of this entity were also noted : (1 ) three children without <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> with rosettes and photoreceptor differentiation characteristic of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , and (2 ) three additional cases involving children who presented with retinoblastoma-like tumors in the suprasellar or parasellar region 2 to 6 months before the discovery of intraocular <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
These observations suggest that the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> gene confers a previously unappreciated susceptibility to a narrow spectrum of neuroblastic tumors , which usually present in the retina but which can also occur ectopically .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> epiphyseal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> .
This report describes two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
The radiographic findings disclosed small , irregularly shaped epiphyses , <START:PHENOTYPE> square iliac bones <END> and flattened acetabulae .
The humeri and femora were short .
The parents were normal .
The syndrome is possibly X-linked , or <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> in origin .
A syndrome of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
In 1982 , Nadol & Burgess reported a new syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and progressive sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion .
Extensive histopathologic studies of the inner ear of the proband revealed severe cochleosaccular degeneration .
No other sporadic or familial cases of such a genetic syndrome have subsequently been described .
We report here a second family in which the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> is observed in eight members , and is inherited according to an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern .
Recessively inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple epiphyseal dysplasia <END> with normal stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> club foot <END> , and double layered patella caused by a DTDST mutation .
We have observed over 25 different mutations in the diastrophic dysplasia sulphate transporter gene ( DTD ST) in association with the recessive disorders achondrogenesis 1B , atelosteogenesis 2 , and diastrophic dysplasia .
The c862t ( R279W ) transition is the most common mutation in non-Finnish patients , but in these disorders it is usually combined with other DTDST mutations .
We had not seen a case of homozygosity for c862t ( R279W ) until we analysed DNA from a 36 year old male with tall-normal stature ( 18 0 cm ) who asked for genetic counselling for suspected <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple epiphyseal dysplasia <END> .
He was treated for <START:PHENOTYPE> club foot <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hip dysplasia <END> at birth . Skeletal changes consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple epiphyseal dysplasia <END> , with the peculiar finding of a double layered patella , were recognised during childhood .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cleft palate <END> , swelling of the ear pinna , and hitch hiker thumb were absent .
He was found to be homozygous , and both healthy parents heterozygous , for the R279W mutation in DTD ST, and his fibroblasts showed a sulphate incorporation defect typical of DTDST disorders .
Counselling was given for a recessive disorder , thereby considerably reducing the probability of affected offspring .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia <END> is more frequently caused by dominant mutations in the COMP ( EDM1 , McKusick 132400 ) and COL9A2 genes ( EDM2 , McKusick 600204 ) .
A few other patients and families with features similar to our proband have been described previously and considered to have <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> MED ( EDM4 , McKusick 226900 ) .
This observation confirms the existence of this entity and assigns it to the phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations at the DTDST locus .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> in the Hutterite population .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebellar hypoplasia <END> is a rare malformation caused by a variety of etiologies .
It usually manifests clinically as non-progressive cerebellar ataxia with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We further characterize a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> in the Hutterite population , referred to as dysequilibrium syndrome ( DES ) .
We reviewed 12 patients ( eight females , four males ; age range 4 to 33 y ) with this syndrome .
Patients were examined and underwent a standard set of investigations to characterize better the clinical features , natural history , and neuroimaging of this syndrome .
DES is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder with distinct clinical features including <START:PHENOTYPE> global developmental delay <END> , late ambulation ( after age 6 y) , <START:PHENOTYPE> truncal ataxia <END> , and a static clinical course .
Neuroimaging is characterized by hypoplasia of the inferior portion of the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis , and mild simplification of cortical gyri .
A case of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and complex I deficiency .
A 34-year-old man affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> exercise intolerance <END> , mild proximal <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> is described .
Muscle biopsy revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> abnormalities and an increase of cytochrome c oxidase histochemical reaction .
Biochemical investigations on isolated muscle mitochondria as well as polarographic studies revealed a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> NADH-CoQ reductase ( complex I ) deficiency .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> dysfunction was confirmed by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy .
Immunological investigation showed a generalized reduction of all complex I polypeptides .
Genetic analysis did not reveal <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA deletions .
The biochemical defect was not present in the patient 's muscle tissue culture .
Metabolic measurements and functional evaluation showed a reduced mechanical efficiency during exercise .
Identification of a novel mutation in the gene encoding the beta-triiodothyronine receptor in a patient with apparent selective pituitary <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> .
We investigated whether the first patient ( L-F3 ) reported as having selective pituitary resistance had a mutation in the hTR beta gene .
We compared the clinical parameters of this case with those of patients with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> .
The patient , L-F3 , was part of a study at the NIH to identify mutations by sequencing the hTR beta gene in kindreds with <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid hormone resistance <END> .
The clinical data of L-F3 as well as patients with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> were compared and analysed retrospectively .
We amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and then sequenced exons 5 to 10 of the hTR beta gene in L-F3 and a normal control .
Upon finding the mutation in L-F3 , we measured the affinity constant of this mutated hTR beta receptor .
Criteria developed previously were used to assess tissue responsiveness to thyroid hormone of L-F3 .
We identified a C to T transition at base 1297 in codon 333 of the hTR beta gene in the first patient ( L-F3 ) reported as having apparent selective pituitary resistance .
This base substitution resulted in more than a four-fold decrease in T3-binding affinity for the hTR beta 1 receptor .
The mutation of L-F3 occurred in the dimerization domain of exon 9 , a region where the majority of mutations of kindreds with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid hormone resistance <END> have been found .
Furthermore , the nucleotide substitution at base 1297 found in the apparent selective pituitary resistant case , L-F3 , was the same as in an unrelated patient ( K-T3 ) with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> .
As a result , we compared the clinical parameters of both patients and found that they had similar patterns of resistance in several tissues .
Besides the bone resistance present in both kindreds , the apparent selective pituitary resistance case also had liver and neuromuscular resistance .
These findings suggest that apparent selective pituitary resistance and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> are not qualitatively different syndromes .
Nevertheless , identification of selective pituitary resistance is a useful clinical distinction since such patients with clinical and biochemical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> appear to benefit from reduction in serum thyroid hormone concentrations .
In contrast , patients with more conventional forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid hormone resistance <END> require no treatment or may benefit from increased concentrations of thyroid hormone .
Biotinidase deficiency : initial clinical features and rapid diagnosis .
Biotinidase deficiency is the primary defect in most individuals with late-onset multiple carboxylase deficiency .
We have reviewed the presenting clinical features of 31 children with the disorder .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> , either alone or with other neurological or cutaneous findings , are the most frequent initial symptom observed .
Other neurological symptoms , such as hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , are seen , in addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> skin rash <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> .
The disorder is also characterized by ketolactic acidosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> organic aciduria <END> .
Biotinidase activity may be diagnosed using a simple , rapid , semiquantitative colorimetric procedure .
Samples of whole blood spotted on the same filter paper used by most states to screen for phenylketonuria and other inborn errors of metabolism may be sent to an appropriate reference laboratory .
None of the common anticonvulsants or sedatives used to treat newborns and children interfere with the test .
Because biotinidase deficiency can be treated readily with biotin , this disorder should be considered in children with infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , especially in the presence of other characteristic neurological or cutaneous features .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypercalciuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> in patients with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> low-molecular-weight proteinuria <END> in Japan : is the disease identical to Dent 's disease in United Kingdom ?
Idiopathic low-molecular-weight ( LMW ) proteinuria is a newly described renal disease in Japan and Italy .
We report on 7 patients who manifested bilateral or unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , as demonstrated by abdominal computed tomography scans .
Renal histology revealed calcinosis of renal tubules in 2 patients .
Computed tomography is a reliable method for the detection of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> in this disorder .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypercalciuria <END> was also seen in 6 patients .
A calcium-loading test performed in 2 patients suggested that <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> was of renal origin .
Although the true pathogenesis is still not known , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> appear to be a common complication in patients with idiopathic LMW proteinuria .
These complications and clinical features suggest that idiopathic LMW proteinuria in Japan is likely to be identical to Dent 's disease in the United Kingdom .
New <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and skeletal abnormalities .
We describe two sibs , one male and one female , presenting a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome of 'coarse face ' , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and skeletal abnormalities .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperparathyroidism <END> : a prerequisite for <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> in multiple endocrine adenomatosis Type 1--report of a further family and a review of th literature .
A family with Multiple Endocrine Adenomatosis Type 1 ( MEA 1 ) is described .
Of the 59 members , 15 were affected .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> was present in six individuals of whom the five available for study had <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> .
The youngest of these patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome <END> was 25 years old . <START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperparathyroidism <END> alone was present in nine individuals of whom the eldest was 30 years old .
Three other members had raised serum gastrin levels but lacked symptoms suggestive of <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> and in these individuals , the serum calcium levels were normal .
A review of the literature confirms the finding that , in MEA 1 , <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> has not been shown to occur in the absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> .
Screening of affected members of such families can therefore be restricted to the measurements of serum calcium levels .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nerve conduction abnormalities <END> in patients with MELAS and the A3243G mutation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> DNA point mutations are especially deleterious to tissues with high energy demand , including the peripheral nervous system .
Neuropathy has been associated with several <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> diseases , including MELAS ( <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ) .
To evaluate nerve conduction in a genotypically and phenotypically homogeneous group of patients with MELAS and the A3243G mutation .
We studied 30 patients with MELAS and the A3243G mutation using neurophysiological techniques , medical history questionnaires , laboratory tests , and a standardized neurological examination .
Twenty-three subjects ( 77% ) had <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal nerve conduction <END> measures .
Symptoms suggestive of neuropathy were present in only half of the patients , but almost all had decreased reflexes or distal sensory findings on examination .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nerve conduction abnormalities <END> were predominantly axonal and sensory and mainly present in the legs .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> nerve conduction abnormalities <END> tended to be older and were more likely male .
Peripheral nerve impairment is common in those with MELAS and the A3243G mutation , and may be subclinical .
Male sex and older age may add to the genetic disposition to develop neuropathy.
The nasopalpebral lipoma-coloboma syndrome : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> dysplasia-malformation syndrome with congenital nasopalpebral <START:PHENOTYPE> lipomas <END> , eyelid colobomas , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , and maxillary hypoplasia .
We describe a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> dysplasia-malformation syndrome from eight affected individuals in three generations of a Venezuelan family .
It is characterized by congenital symmetrical upper lid and nasopalpebral <START:PHENOTYPE> lipomas <END> , bilateral symmetrical upper and lower palpebral colobomas located at the junction of the inner and middle thirds of the lids , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , and maxillary hypoplasia .
Affected individuals have a <START:PHENOTYPE> broad forehead <END> , window 's peak , abnormal pattern of eyebrows and eyelashes , and maldevelopment of the lacrimal punctae .
Interorbital distance is normal , but interpupillary distance is increased due to divergent <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> originating from visual interference from inner canthal masses .
Persistent epiphora , conjunctival hyperemia , and corneal ( and less frequently lens ) opacities are a secondary consequence of the defect of the lacrimal punctae and the inability to close the lids completely .
The syndrome has complete penetrance and a rather narrow range of expressivity .
The primary defect could involve a dysplasia of adipose tissue leading to nasopalpebral and upper lid <START:PHENOTYPE> lipomas <END> during embryogenesis , with the rest of the malformations being secondary to interference of morphogenesis of the mid -upperface developmental field from the lipomatous hamartomas .
Alternatively , a central rather than a peripheral mechanism of malformation might be considered , such as defective migration of neural crest cells .
A novel mutation ( Q40P ) in PAX8 associated with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid hypoplasia <END> : evidence for phenotypic variability in mother and child .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid hypoplasia <END> can be caused by several genetic defects , including mutations in the TSHbeta-subunit , the TSH receptor , the G(s )alpha-subunit , and the transcription factor PAX8 .
Four girls with sporadic congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic thyroid <END> glands were analyzed for mutations in PAX8 and TTF2 ( FKHL15 ) .
Mutations in the coding region of the TSHbeta-subunit gene , the TSH receptor gene , and exons 8 and 9 of G(s )alpha had been excluded previously .
Serum TSH concentrations were 150 mU/liter or more , TG levels were within normal limits , and thyroid autoantibodies were absent .
Technetium scintigraphies did not reveal the presence of thyroid tissue , but ultrasonography documented hypoplastic , normally located glands .
One patient was found to harbor a heterozygous transversion 119A--> C in exon 3 of PAX8 replacing a conserved glutamine by proline in the paired box domain ( Q40P ) .
Analysis of her family members revealed that her mother , who has a thyroid gland of normal size and mild , adult-onset autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> , is also heterozygous for this mutation .
Functional analyses of the PAX8 Q40P mutation showed impaired binding to a PAX8 response element and absent trans-activation of a thyroid peroxidase promoter luciferase reporter gene .
These findings confirm the important role of PAX8 in the development of the thyroid , but they indicate that PAX8 gene mutations may have a variable penetrance or expressivity .
The absence of mutations in the coding sequences of the analyzed genes in the three other patients supports the concept that the pathogenesis of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid hypoplasia <END> is diverse .
Homozygous mutation of desmocollin-2 in arrhythmogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> right ventricular cardiomyopathy <END> with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> woolly hair <END> .
The phenotypic triad of arrhythmogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> right ventricular cardiomyopathy <END> ( ARVC ) associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> woolly hair <END> has been previously associated with homozygous mutations in both plakoglobin and desmoplakin , which are both critical components of the desmosome .
We present here a clinical and genetic study of a consanguineous pedigree in which 2 siblings present with ARVC with left ventricular involvement and associated mild <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> woolly hair <END> .
Clinical evaluation of the 2 patients and their family members was undertaken along with a homozygosity-mapping approach to identify the relevant gene and sequencing analysis to identify the causative mutation .
The homozygosity-mapping approach excluded the involvement of both plakoglobin and desmoplakin in this pedigree .
However , an extended region of homozygosity in both affected cases was revealed at the chromosome 18 desmocollin/desmoglein cluster , genes which encode components of the desmosome .
Sequence analysis of the democollin-2 gene , located within this cluster , revealed a homozygous single-base deletion in exon 12 ( 1841delG ) .
This mutation is predicted to lead to a frame shift and a premature termination codon at position 625 ( S614fsX625 ) .
This is the first reported case of a mutation in desmocollin-2 associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ARVC .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and electrolyte imbalance ( SeSAME syndrome ) caused by mutations in KCNJ10 .
We describe members of 4 kindreds with a previously unrecognized syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and electrolyte imbalance ( <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemia <END> , metabolic alkalosis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> ) .
By analysis of linkage we localize the putative causative gene to a 2.5- Mb segment of chromosome 1q23.2-23.3 . Direct DNA sequencing of KCNJ10 , which encodes an inwardly rectifying K(+ ) channel , identifies previously unidentified missense or nonsense mutations on both alleles in all affected subjects .
These mutations alter highly conserved amino acids and are absent among control chromosomes .
Many of these mutations have been shown to cause loss of function in related K(+ ) channels .
These findings demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations in KCNJ10 cause this syndrome , which we name SeSAME .
KCNJ10 is expressed in glia in the brain and spinal cord , where it is believed to take up K(+ ) released by neuronal repolarization , in cochlea , where it is involved in the generation of endolymph , and on the basolateral membrane in the distal nephron .
We propose that KCNJ10 is required in the kidney for normal salt reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule because of the need for K(+ ) recycling across the basolateral membrane to enable normal activity of the Na(+ )-K(+ )-ATPase ; loss of this function accounts for the observed electrolyte defects .
Mice deficient for KCNJ10 show a related phenotype with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , ataxia , and hearing loss , further supporting KCNJ1 0 's role in this syndrome .
These findings define a unique human syndrome , and establish the essential role of basolateral K(+ ) channels in renal electrolyte homeostasis .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> precocious puberty <END> .
Two brothers had progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> precocious puberty <END> develop due to Leydig 's cell hyperplasia when they were 2 years old .
Both later had moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Family members displayed brisk lower-extremity reflexes and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> in a pedigree that suggested autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expression .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Precocious puberty <END> has been associated with other neurologic syndromes .
Its occurrence in two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> has not , to our knowledge , been previously reported .
Fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> , a prion disease with a mutation at codon 178 of the prion protein gene .
We previously described two members of a family affected by an apparently genetically determined fatal disease characterized clinically by progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysautonomia <END> , and motor signs and characterized pathologically by severe atrophy of the anterior ventral and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei .
Five other family members who died of this disease , which we termed " fatal familial insomnia, " had broader neuropathologic changes suggesting that fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> could be a prion disease .
We used antibodies to prion protein ( PrP ) to perform dot and Western blot analyses , with and without proteinase K , on brain tissue obtained at autopsy from two patients with fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> , three patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , and six control subjects .
The coding region of the PrP gene was amplified and sequenced in the samples from the two patients with fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> .
Restriction-enzyme analysis was carried out with amplified PrP DNA from 33 members of the kindred .
Protease-resistant PrP was found in both patients with fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> , but the size and number of protease-resistant fragments differed from those in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease .
In the family with fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> , all 4 affected members and 11 of the 29 unaffected members had a point mutation in PrP codon 178 that results in the substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid and elimination of the Tth111 I restriction site .
Linkage analysis showed a close relation between the point mutation and the disease ( maximal lod score , 3.4 when theta was zero ) .
Fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> is a prion disease with a mutation in codon 178 of the PrP gene , but the disease phenotype seems to differ from that of previously described kindreds with the same point mutation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , ocular , facial , dental , and limb abnormalities ( Cohen syndrome ) .
Report of three patients .
Three patients with features of the Cohen Syndrome are reported .
Main facial features are <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , prominent upper central incisors , and retrogenia .
There is <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
Truncal <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> appears in mid childhood .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> seems to be severe .
There is marked variability among the as yet reported cases .
The best diagnostic criteria seem to be the typical face and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
As yet 3 affected sibs , offspring of healthy , non consanguineous parents are reported , as well as 8 sporadic cases .
The condition seems inherited as auto-somal recessive .
The variability of this condition is discussed .
Studies of neutrophil production and turnover in grey collie dogs with cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> . 12 grey collie dogs had cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> with the <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> recurring at 11 .8+ /-0.1-day intervals .
The recovery from <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> was accompanied by a single wave of myeloid proliferation , an increase in marrow myeloid-labeling indices , and an increase in serum muramidase levels .
After recovery from <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> during the period when blood neutrophils ( PMN ) were normal or increased , marrow myeloid precursors became scarce .
The decline in marrow precursors and marrow PMN reserves heralded the recurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Neither diisopropyl fluorophosphate ( DF(32 )P ) leukokinetic studies nor the rate of development of <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> suggested shortened PMN survival as a mechanism for the <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
These studies indicate that the cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is due to a regularly recurring failure in PMN production .
A new kindred with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> : implications for correct diagnosis and treatment .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> ( HHRH ) is a new autosomal form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> , recently described .
This disease is characterized , and differs from other forms of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> and/or osteomalacia by increased serum levels of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and complete remission of the disease on phosphate therapy alone .
However , only another probable Israeli kindred , and seemingly a few sporadic cases from Europe , North America and Japan have been reported in the literature .
We describe here a new kindred of Jewish Yemenite origin ( unrelated to other Israeli families ) with typical HHRH .
Two additional members of this family suffer from a milder asymptomatic form of the disease , which presents as absorptive <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> without signs or symptoms of bone disease .
It seems to us that HHRH is underdiagnosed , due to its similarity to other hypophosphatemic syndromes in clinical , radiological and most biochemical parameters .
Therefore , it is recommended that urinary calcium excretion and serum 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations be measured in every patient with hypophosphatemic rickets/and or osteomalacia before the initiation of any therapy .
The correct diagnosis of HHRN is of immense therapeutic implications .
Phosphate therapy alone could cause a complete remission in HHRH , while the addition of active vitamin D metabolites , as is recommended in hypophosphatemic vitamin D resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> , could cause deterioration in the patient 's condition .
Exome sequencing identifies ZNF644 mutations in <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> .
Myopia is the most common ocular disorder worldwide , and <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> in particular is one of the leading causes of blindness .
Genetic factors play a critical role in the development of myopia , especially <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> .
Recently , the exome sequencing approach has been successfully used for the disease gene identification of Mendelian disorders .
Here we show a successful application of exome sequencing to identify a gene for an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder , and we have identified a gene potentially responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> in a monogenic form .
We captured exomes of two affected individuals from a Han Chinese family with <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> and performed sequencing analysis by a second-generation sequencer with a mean coverage of 30Ã— and sufficient depth to call variants at âˆ¼97 % of each targeted exome .
The shared genetic variants of these two affected individuals in the family being studied were filtered against the 1000 Genomes Project and the dbSNP131 database .
A mutation A672G in zinc finger protein 644 isoform 1 ( ZNF644 ) was identified as being related to the phenotype of this family .
After we performed sequencing analysis of the exons in the ZNF644 gene in 300 sporadic cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> , we identified an additional five mutations ( I587V , R68 0G , C699Y , 3 ' UTR +12 C>G , and 3 ' UTR+592 G>A ) in 11 different patients .
All these mutations were absent in 600 normal controls .
The ZNF644 gene was expressed in human retinal and retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) .
Given that ZNF644 is predicted to be a transcription factor that may regulate genes involved in eye development , mutation may cause the axial elongation of eyeball found in <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> patients .
Our results suggest that ZNF644 might be a causal gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> in a monogenic form .
Clinical and biochemical phenotype in 11 patients with mevalonic aciduria .
Mevalonic aciduria is a consequence of the deficiency of mevalonate kinase , the first enzyme after 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenes .
To establish the clinical and biochemical phenotype of mevalonic aciduria , the authors assembled their experience with 11 patients including attempts at therapeutic interventions .
Mevalonic acid in body fluids was determined by stable isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy with selected ion monitoring , ubiquinone-1 0 concentrations by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography.
Varying degrees of severity of clinical illness were observed despite uniform , virtual absence of residual activity of the enzyme .
The most severely affected patients have had profound <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , dysmorphic features , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , hepatosplenomegaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphadenopathy <END> , and anemia , as well as <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> and malabsorption , and have died in infancy .
Less severely affected patients have had <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , hypotonia , myopathy , and ataxia .
All patients have had recurrent crises in which there was fever , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphadenopathy <END> , increase in size of liver and spleen , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthralgia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> morbilliform rash <END> .
Neuroimaging studies revealed selective and progressive atrophy of the cerebellum .
Mevalonic acid concentrations were found to be grossly elevated in body fluids of all patients .
Concentrations of plasma cholesterol were normal or only slightly reduced .
Concentrations of ubiquinone-1 0 in plasma were found to be decreased in most patients .
Abnormalities such as hypoglycemia , metabolic acidosis , or lactic acidemia , the usual concomitants of disorders of organic acid metabolism , were conspicuously absent .
These observations establish the broad range of clinical symptoms and biochemical findings in mevalonic aciduria .
It is concluded that although patients with mevalonic aciduria have a recognizable phenotype of serious clinical manifestations , some patients are likely to remain undiagnosed and may be found in a variety of subspecialty clinics , including neurology , gastroenterology , cardiology , and genetics .
Exclusion of the retinoblastoma gene and chromosome 13q as the site of a primary lesion for human <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Chromosome 13q has been suggested as the site of a gene predisposing to human <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , because loss of heterozygosity of alleles on this chromosome has been observed in some ductal breast tumors and because two <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> lines are altered at the retinoblastoma gene ( RB1 ) at 13q14 . To test this possibility , linkage of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> susceptibility to 14 loci on chromosome 13q loci was assessed in extended families in which <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> is apparently inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
RB1 was excluded as the site of a <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> gene by a lod score of Z = -7.6 0 at close linkage for 13 families .
Multipoint analysis yielded negative lod scores throughout the region between 13q12 and 13q34 ; over most of this distance , Z less than -2.0 .
Therefore , chromosome 13q appears to be excluded as the site of primary lesion for <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in these families .
In addition , comparison of tumor versus normal tissues of nonfamilial <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> patients revealed an alteration at the 5 ' end of RB1 in a mucoid carcinoma but no alterations of RB1 in five informative ductal adenocarcinomas .
Linkage data and comparisons of tumor and normal tissues suggest that changes in the RBI locus either are secondary alterations associated with progression of some tumors or occur by chance .
Tremor-ataxia with central <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomyelination <END> ( TA CH ) <START:PHENOTYPE> leukodystrophy <END> maps to chromosome 10q22.3-10q23.31 .
Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with abnormal central nervous system white matter .
The clinical features invariably include <START:PHENOTYPE> upper motor neuron signs <END> and developmental regression with or without other neurological manifestations .
The objective of this study was to characterize clinically and genetically a new form of childhood-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> leukodystrophy <END> with ataxia and tremor .
We recruited seven French-Canadian cases belonging to five families affected by an unknown form of childhood-onset leukodystrophy.
Genome-wide scans ( GWS ) were performed using the Illumina Hap310 or Hap610 Bead Chip to identify regions of shared homozygosity that were further studied for linkage with STS markers .
All cases presented between the ages of 1 and 5 years with <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> along with other <START:PHENOTYPE> upper motor neuron signs <END> , prominent <START:PHENOTYPE> postural tremor <END> , and cerebellar signs .
Though motor regression is a constant feature , cognitive functions are relatively preserved , even late in the course of the disease .
The higher frequency of founder diseases in the French-Canadian population and the segregation in pedigrees are suggestive of a recessive mode of inheritance .
By homozygosity mapping , we established linkage to a 12 .6-Mb
SNP-haplotyped region on chromosome 10q22.3-10q23.31 ( maximum LOD score : 5.47 ) .
We describe an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> childhood-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> leukodystrophy <END> with ataxia and tremor mapping to a 12 .6 Mb interval on chromosome 10q22.3-10q23.31 .
Identification of the mutated gene will allow precise diagnosis and genetic counseling and shed light on how its perturbed function leads to white matter abnormalities .
A survey of the polycystic ovary syndrome in the Greek island of Lesbos : hormonal and metabolic profile .
Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is characterized by hyperandrogenism , chronic anovulation , and <START:PHENOTYPE> oligomenorrhea <END> ( O/M ) .
PCOS has variable clinical phenotypes , biochemical features , and metabolic abnormalities .
To determine the prevalence of PCOS in the Greek population as well as the metabolic parameters , we performed a cross-sectional study of 192 women of reproductive age ( 17-45 yr) , living on the Greek island of Lesbos .
They were divided into 4 groups according to the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> (defined as a Ferriman-Gallwey score > or = 6 ) and O/M : group N ( n = 108 ) , regular menses and absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> ; group 1 ( n = 56 ) , regular menses and <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> ; group 2 ( n = 10 ) , O/M and absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> ; and group 3 ( n = 18 ) , O/M and <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> .
Body mass index , waist to hip ratio , and mean blood pressure did not differ among the studied groups .
Hormonal profile was assessed by measuring free testosterone ( FT) .
The prevalence of PCOS , defined by the presence of O/M and biochemical hyperandrogenism ( FT > or = 95th percentile of the normal women ) , was estimated to be 6.77 % ( 13 women of 192 ) .
Higher FT levels were observed in group 3 ( O/M and <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> ) compared with groups N ( P < 0.00001 ) and 1 ( P < 0.0001 ) and in groups 1 ( <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> ) and 2 ( O/M ) compared with group N ( P < 0.0001 and P < 0.005 , respectively ) .
Sex hormone-binding globulin levels were lower in women with PCOS and in groups 1 and 3 than those in group N ( P < 0.002 , P < 0.02 , and P < 0.002 , respectively ) independently of the body mass index .
The metabolic profile was investigated by measurements of fasting glucose ( FG) , fasting insulin ( FI) , and estimation of the fasting glucose to insulin ratio ( FG:I ratio ) .
After covariance adjusted for the BMI , FI levels were higher in group 3 and in women with PCOS than in the normal ( P < 0.005 and P < 0.002 , respectively ) and the hirsute ( P < 0.05 and P < 0.02 , respectively ) women , whereas FG levels did not differ among the studied groups .
The FG:I ratio was lower in group 3 , group 1 , and in women with PCOS than in normal women ( P < 0.05 ) .
Finally , a high incidence of family history of diabetes mellitus ( P = 0.001 ) and menstrual disorders ( P = 0.01 ) was observed in women with PCOS , in contrast to the normal and hirsute women .
In conclusion , PCOS appears to be a particularly common endocrine disorder in the Greek population under study ( prevalence , 6.77% ) ; furthermore , it is associated with certain metabolic abnormalities .
These data also suggest that the severity of the fasting hyperinsulinemia is associated with the severity of the clinical phenotype of hyperandrogenism independently of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .
Diaphanospondylodysostosis : six new cases and exclusion of the candidate genes , PAX1 and MEOX1 .
We report on six cases from four families with the newly described skeletal disorder diaphanospondylodysostosis ( DSD ) .
The characteristic radiographic findings included abnormal ossification of vertebral bodies , posterior rib gaps , <START:PHENOTYPE> missing ribs <END> , and a downward tilt of the pubic rami , but normal long bones .
The typical facial features of DSD cases were <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> low set ears <END> . Other distinctive findings included a <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> bell-shaped thorax <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephroblastomatosis <END> .
A history of consanguinity and affected siblings with unaffected parents supports <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Skeletal histology showed incomplete ossification of the ribs , vertebral bodies , and sacrum as well as incomplete formation of intervertebral discs .
The posterior ribs were comprised of bone with intervening cartilage interrupted by dense fibrous tissue and skeletal muscle fascicles .
These findings suggest abnormal development and differentiation of the paraxial mesoderm .
Because of phenotypic similarities of DSD to Pax1 and Meox1 deficient mice , we sequenced genomic DNA from three unrelated DSD cases .
No mutations were identified in the PAX1 and MEOX1 exons or flanking intronic sequences , excluding them as likely causative genes .

POMT2 mutations cause alpha-dystroglycan hypoglycosylation and Walker-Warburg syndrome .
Walker-Warburg syndrome ( WWS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition characterised by congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> , structural brain defects , and eye malformations .
Typical brain abnormalities are <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , lissencephaly , agenesis of the corpus callosum , fusion of the hemispheres , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , and neuronal overmigration , which causes a cobblestone cortex .
Ocular abnormalities include <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> buphthalmos <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Peters anomaly <END> .
WWS patients show defective O-glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan ( alpha-DG) , which plays a key role in bridging the cytoskeleton of muscle and CNS cells with extracellular matrix proteins , important for muscle integrity and neuronal migration .
In 20% of the WWS patients , hypoglycosylation results from mutations in either the protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 ( POMT1 ) , fukutin , or fukutin related protein ( FKRP ) genes .
The other genes for this highly <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> disorder remain to be identified .
To look for mutations in POMT2 as a cause of WWS , as both POMT1 and POMT2 are required to achieve protein O-mannosyltransferase activity .
A candidate gene approach combined with homozygosity mapping .
Homozygosity was found for the POMT2 locus at 14q24.3 in four of 11 consanguineous WWS families .
Homozygous POMT2 mutations were present in two of these families as well as in one patient from another cohort of six WWS families .
Immunohistochemistry in muscle showed severely reduced levels of glycosylated alpha-DG , which is consistent with the postulated role for POMT2 in the O-mannosylation pathway .
A fourth causative gene for WWS was uncovered .
These genes account for approximately one third of the WWS cases .
Several more genes are anticipated , which are likely to play a role in glycosylation of alpha-DG .
C2orf37 mutational spectrum in Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome patients .
Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome ( WSS ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder that encompasses hypogonadism , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and progressive extrapyramidal defects .
The syndrome is caused by mutation of the C2orf37 gene .
Here we studied a cohort of seven new cases from three ethnic backgrounds , presenting with the hallmarks of WSS , in an effort to extend the mutational spectrum of this disorder .
Genetic analysis revealed a novel mutation in each of the four families investigated , of which three were nonsense mutations and the fourth was a splice site ablation .
We also examined a separate collection of 11 cases presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , two constituents of WSS , but found no pathogenic changes .
This study doubles the number of known mutations for this disorder , confirms that truncating mutations in C2orf37 are the only known cause of WSS , and suggests that mutations in this gene do not contribute significantly to cases presenting with isolated elements of WSS such as <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
The lack of correlation between clinically expressivity of WSS and the site of the eight truncating mutations strongly supports that they are equally null , while the intrafamilial variability argues for an important role of modifiers in this disease . Â© 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/ S .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Renal magnesium wasting <END> , incomplete tubular acidosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> in siblings .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Polyuria <END> , hyposthenuria , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> , advanced <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , low citrate excretion and low glomerular filtration rates were observed in two female siblings who were followed over 10 years .
Acid loading revealed incomplete distal tubular acidosis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypomagnesemia <END> was due to <START:PHENOTYPE> renal magnesium wasting <END> .
It is suggested that the defect in tubular transport of magnesium is an important factor in the pathogenesis of this syndrome .
Gorlin- Chaudhry-Moss or Saethre-Chotzen syndrome ?
We report a 2-year-old girl with <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , an ossification defect of the cranial vault , <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low frontal hairline <END> , anti-mongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> of the lateral upper lids and high-arched <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow palate <END> .
There are additional findings fitting the Gorlin- Chaudhry-Moss syndrome , such as hypoplasia of the labia majora , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of the distal phalanges <END> of fingers and toes and <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> , but <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> and dental anomalies are missing , which were described in the four females previously reported with the probably <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Gorlin- Chaudhry-Moss syndrome .
Since the autosomal dominant Saethre-Chotzen syndrome may show similar cranio-facial features , short fingers with non-obligatory cutaneous syndactyly , and ossification defects of the cranial vault , the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome should also be considered in our patient .
Factors prognostic of unprovoked seizures after <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile convulsions <END> .
We evaluated the risk of unprovoked seizures after <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile convulsions <END> and the factors prognostic of them in a cohort of 687 children who had an initial febrile seizure while residing in Rochester , Minnesota .
Overall , children with <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile convulsions <END> had a fivefold excess of unprovoked seizures , and the risk until the age of 25 was 7 percent .
The risk ranged from 2.4 percent among children with simple <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile convulsions <END> to 6 to 8 percent among children with a single complex feature--i.e. , focal or prolonged seizures or repeated episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile convulsions <END> with the same illness .
For children with any two of the complex features , the risk was 17 to 22 percent , and for those with all three features , 49 percent .
The occurrence of subsequent partial unprovoked seizures was strongly associated with all three of the complex features , whereas the occurrence of subsequent unprovoked seizures of generalized onset was associated with the number of <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile convulsions <END> and a family history of unprovoked seizures .
These results are consistent with the view that the increased risk of generalized-onset unprovoked seizures reflects a predisposition to both simple <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile convulsions <END> and generalized-onset unprovoked seizures .
The association between complex <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile convulsions <END> and partial seizures , on the other hand , may reflect either a causal association or the presence of preexisting brain disease that is responsible for both the complex <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> and later partial seizures .
Juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , race , and refraction .
Of 68 patients who presented between the ages of 10 and 35 years with elevated intraocular pressure , 25 were classified as juvenile ocular hypertension and 43 as juvenile primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Blacks constituted a greater proportion of the primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> patients ( 47% ) than of the ocular hypertensives (20% ) and in both groups presented at younger ages than did whites .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myopia <END> was present in 59 % of the ocular hypertensives and 73 % of the primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> patients , of whom 39% had more than 6 diopters of <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> .
All eyes of black patients with more than 3 diopters of <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> had glaucomatous defects compared with 52 % of such eyes of white patients .
Our data suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> is strongly associated with juvenile open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and that young black patients with elevated intraocular pressure , especially when myopic , are more susceptible to glaucomatous damage than are whites .
Screening of infants and mortality due to <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Neuroblastoma <END> , the most common extracranial solid tumor that occurs in early childhood , can be identified in the preclinical stages by the detection of catecholamines in the urine .
However , it is unknown whether routine screening for <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> reduces mortality due to this disease . Through their parents , we offered screening for <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> at three weeks and six months of age to all 476 ,65 4 children born in the province of Quebec , Canada , during a five-year period ( May 1 , 1989 , through April 30 , 1994 ) .
The participation rate was 92 percent .
The rate of death due to <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> was determined and compared with the rates in several unscreened control populations born during the same period .
Among children younger than eight years of age in the Quebec cohort , there were 22 deaths due to <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> ; the cumulative ( + /-SE ) mortality rate due to <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> was 4.78 + /-1 .14 per 100,000 children over a period of nine years .
The standardized incidence ratios for death due to <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> for the Quebec cohort were 1 .11 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.64 to 1 .92 ) as compared with a control group in Ontario , Canada ; 0.90 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.48 to 1.70 ) as compared with a control group in Minnesota ; 1.40 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.81 to 2.41 ) as compared with a control group in Florida ; and 0.96 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.56 to 1.66 ) as compared with a control group in the Greater Delaware Valley .
The standardized mortality ratio for the Quebec cohort as compared with the rest of Canada was 1.39 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.85 to 2.30) ; the odds ratio for the comparison with a cohort born in Quebec before the screening program began was 0.98 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.54 to 1.77 ) . Screening infants for <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> does not appear to reduce mortality due to this disease .
Familial cutaneous malignant melanoma and tumors of the nervous system .
A hereditary cancer syndrome .
Excessive risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous melanoma <END> as a second cancer has been associated with benign or malignant tumors of the nervous system .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cutaneous melanoma <END> and nervous system tumors may independently aggregate in families .
There are , however , no previous reports of increased likelihood of tumors of the nervous system in families of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous melanoma <END> or--of <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous melanoma <END> in families with tumors of the nervous system .
The occurrence of nervous system tumors as second cancers was examined in a series of 904 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous melanoma <END> and/or their family members .
Fifteen families with 17 members with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous melanoma <END> from this series had one or more additional relatives with tumors of the nervous system , including <START:PHENOTYPE> astrocytoma <END> , medulloblastoma , glioblastoma multiforme , ependymoma , glioma , meningioma , and acoustic neurilemmoma .
Another subgroup of 10 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous melanoma <END> had either a meningioma ( n = 9 ) or acoustic neurilemmoma ( n = 1 ) as a second tumor .
The pattern of atypical melanocytic nevi occurring in the majority (20/25 ) of <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous melanoma <END> patients in our series and in additional first degree relatives of 9 of 11 of the affected families , has been previously associated with the Familial Atypical Multiple Mole-Melanoma syndrome .
This unusual familial and personal occurrence of tumors , showing differentiation toward tissues of the neural crest , neuroepithelium , and/or mesenchymal derivation , supports a putative association with a hereditary cancer susceptibility trait .
Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoperistalsis <END> syndrome and aganglionosis in trisomy 18 . Ultrasonography at 23 weeks of gestation documented the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> megacystis <END> with horseshoe kidney , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcolon <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal malrotation <END> , and decreased amniotic fluid volume .
After pregnancy termination , an autopsy was performed .
The external phenotype was diagnostic of the trisomy 18 syndrome confirmed by chromosome examination .
The fetus also had a massively distended bladder with parchment-thin wall , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcolon <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal malrotation <END> but no urethral obstruction or <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> .
No ganglion cells were present in the colon or bladder .
This has not been mentioned in other reported cases and , therefore , suggests pathogenic heterogeneity .
The megacystis-microcolon-intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoperistalsis <END> syndrome ( MMIHS ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition of unknown pathogenesis whose genes map to 15q24.
Thus , its previously undescribed presence in trisomy 18 further suggests etiologic heterogeneity .

Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy.
Clinical manifestations of the 14484 mutation .
To define the clinical features of Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> associated with the 14484 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutation and to compare these features with those associated with three other pathogenetic mutations .
Clinical and historical data were collected from 19 visually symptomatic patients from 17 independent pedigrees with the molecularly confirmed 14484 mutation .
Demographic features , <START:PHENOTYPE> age of onset <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> , nadir of visual acuity , occurrence and timing of visual recovery , family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> , and associated medical and environmental conditions .
Clinical characteristics associated with the 14484 mutation are similar overall to those of the three other primary mutations .
One notable distinguishing feature is the higher incidence of visual recovery among patients with the 14484 mutation .
Thirty-seven percent of our patients experienced visual recovery compared with 5 % with the 11778 mutation ( P < .001 ) , 22% with the 3460 mutation , and 29% with the 15257 mutation .
The average <START:PHENOTYPE> age of onset <END> of visual symptoms for the patients with the 14484 mutation who had visual recovery was younger than for those without recovery ( 19.6 vs 30.6 years ) .
Thirteen of the 19 patients had a history of metabolic disturbance , trauma , or substance abuse .
Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> associated with the 14484 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutation may have a better prognosis for visual recovery .
The phenotypic expression of the 14484 mutation may be influenced by concurrent medical and environmental factors .
Molecular genetic testing in suspected Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> is useful to confirm the diagnosis and to assess visual prognosis .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> bull 's-eye <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> ( MCDR2 ) that maps to the short arm of chromosome 4 . To describe the phenotype of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> and identify the chromosomal locus .
Eleven members of a five-generation , nonconsanguineous British family were examined clinically and also underwent automated perimetry , electrodiagnostic testing , fundus fluorescein angiography , and fundus autofluorescence imaging .
Blood samples were taken for DNA extraction and linkage analysis was performed .
The phenotype is characterized by bull 's-eye <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> first evident in the first or second decade of life .
There is mild visual impairment , <START:PHENOTYPE> central scotomata <END> , and electrophysiological testing indicates that most affected individuals have disease confined to the central retina but older subjects have more widespread rod and cone abnormalities , demonstrated by flash ERG .
Genetic linkage analysis established linkage to chromosome 4 at p15 .2-16 .3 with a maximum lod score of 3.03 at a recombination fraction of 0.00 for marker D4S391 .
The locus for this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> lies between flanking markers D4S3023 and D4S3022 , and overlaps the Stargardt 4 locus .
A new locus was identified for a bull 's-eye <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> on the short arm of chromosome 4 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Severe mental retardation <END> with breathing abnormalities ( Pitt-Hopkins syndrome ) is caused by haploinsufficiency of the neuronal bHLH transcription factor TCF4 .
Pitt-Hopkins syndrome ( PHS ) is a rare syndromic mental disorder , which is mainly characterized by severe motor and mental retardation including absent language development , a characteristic facial gestalt and episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperventilation <END> .
We report on a female patient with PHS showing <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> absent speech <END> , pronounced <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> , ataxia , distinctive facial features , such as a <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse face <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> wide mouth <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperventilation <END> attacks .
In this patient , genomic profiling by array-based comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies detected and confirmed a de novo 0.5 Mb deletion in 18q21.2 containing a single gene , the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor TCF4 . cDNA and genomic analyses in the patient and her parents demonstrated TCF4 haploinsufficiency as the underlying cause of the disease .
Analysis of the embryonal expression pattern of the Danio rerio ortholog , tcf4 , by whole-mount in situ hybridization showed a highly specific expression domain in the pallium of the telencephalon during late somitogenesis , when the patterning of the zebrafish brain is advanced and neural differentiation commences .
Later expression domains were restricted to several regions in the central nervous system , including continued expression in the pallium of the telencephalon , and starting expression in the diencephalon ( thalamus , ventral thalamus and posterior tuberculum) , the midbrain tegmentum , the hindbrain and the branchial arches .
This expression pattern correlates with the clinical phenotype .
Our results show that haploinsufficiency of TCF4 causes PHS and suggest that D . rerio is a valuable model to study the molecular pathogenesis of PHS and the role of TCF4 in brain development .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> dentinogenesis imperfecta <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> wormian bones <END> without fractures : another type of osteogenesis imperfecta ?
A unique connective tissue disorder characterised by the triad of <START:PHENOTYPE> dentinogenesis imperfecta <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , and multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> wormian bones <END> has been identified in 20 members of three generations of a large kindred of mixed ancestry in South Africa .
The skeletons of affected subjects were moderately osteoporotic but , apart from minimal bowing of the femora and some vertebral flattening in late adulthood , this abnormality produced no untoward sequelae .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Bone fragility <END> was present in one young male , while a mother and her daughter had <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> of uncertain relationship with the primary disorder .
Dental discolouration and a liability to caries were the only important complications .
The condition is best regarded as yet another variety of osteogenesis imperfecta .
It is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait with relatively consistent phenotypic expression .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cleft lip <END> and palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , brachycephaly , flat facial profile , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> in three brothers .
A " new " syndrome was identified by McPherson and Clemens [ 1996 : Am J Med Genet 62 :58-60 ] in a brother and sister with <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral cleft lip and palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , flat facial profile , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat occiput <END> , and complex heart defects .
The brother also had a bilobed tongue and the sister had <START:PHENOTYPE> malrotation <END> of the intestine and bifid thumbs .
We describe three brothers with similar anomalies apart from the bilobed tongue , <START:PHENOTYPE> malrotation <END> of the intestine , and bifid thumbs .
McPherson and Clemens [ 1996 : Am J Med Genet 62 :58-60 ] suggested <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Our observation of three affected brothers also raises the possibility of X-linked recessive inheritance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Piebaldism <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> : molecular evidence for an expanded syndrome .
In a South African girl of Xhosa stock with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> and profound congenital sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> we identified a novel missense substitution at a highly conserved residue in the intracellular kinase domain of the KIT proto-oncogene , R796 G .
Though auditory anomalies have been observed in mice with dominant white spotting ( W ) due to KIT mutations , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is not typical in human <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> .
Thus , the occurrence of sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> in this patient extends considerably the phenotypic range of <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> due to KIT gene mutation in humans and tightens the clinical similarity between <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> and the various forms of Waardenburg syndrome .
Pyrophosphorolysis detects B-RAF mutations in primary <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
Mutations in the genes that control cell proliferation in cutaneous melanoma are generally uncommon in <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
Despite the absence of known activating mutations , the RAF-MEK-ERK , or mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) , pathway is usually activated in <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
An assay with increased potential to identify mutations is now available , and this study was therefore conducted to reanalyze <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> cell lines and primary tumors for this mutation .
Eleven <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> cell lines and 45 primary uveal melanomas were analyzed for mutations in exon 15 of the B-RAF gene by using pyrophosphorolysis-activated polymerization ( PAP ) .
Mutations were validated by sequencing of the PAP product .
B-RAF mutations were detected in cell lines OCM-1 and -3 ( V600E ) and in six primary uveal melanomas .
The V600K mutation was detected in one primary <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> , for which the V600E assay turned out to be sensitive as well .
Direct sequencing of the exon 15 PCR product did not reveal the mutations found with the PAP-assay , indicating a low frequency of the mutant allele in primary samples .
Because of the very sensitive PAP technology , B-RAF mutations were found in cell lines and primary uveal melanomas , which suggests that they may occasionally play a role in the activation of the MAPK pathway in <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> and indicates a higher prevalence of B-RAF mutations in <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> than was reported earlier .
However , the relative scarcity of the B-RAF mutation excludes an elemental role for this mutation in <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Trigonocephaly <END> : a new familial syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Trigonocephaly <END> was found in six relatives through three generations of one family .
The propositus was ascertained at birth because of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> .
In addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> , he had minor ear , vertebral , and genital abnormalities .
His father had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and both had minor eye abnormalities .
None of the other four affected individuals had any other malformations .
In this family , <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
The ratio of affected males to affected females was 5 to 1 , and although the paucity of affected females is not statistically significant , we speculate that it may reflect variable expressivity or sex limitation of the trait .
We conclude that the condition in this family represents a unique syndrome in which <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> is not associated with functional brain abnormalities and where <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> is limited to the metopic region .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> myopathy.
Biochemical studies revealing a deficiency of NADH--cytochrome b reductase activity .
This paper presents biochemical data upon a young male with a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> exercise intolerance <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle wasting <END> and exercise-induced lactic acidaemia .
Two similar cases have been previously documented ( Morgan-Hughes et al . 1979 ) .
This report more precisely locates the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> defect .
In vitro <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> studies show markedly decreased respiratory rates with all NAD-linked substrates whilst that with flavin-linked succinate is normal .
Oxidative phosphorylation is normally coupled .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> cytochrome components as determined by low temperature spectroscopy are normal .
NADH-ferricyanide reductase and primary dehydrogenase activities are present at levels far in excess of that required to support normal NAD-linked substrate oxidation rates .
Intramitochondrial NAD levels are similar to those found in other mammalian muscle .
It is proposed therefore that the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> defect is situated between NADH dehydrogenase and the CoQ--Cytochrome b complex ; possibly being a derangement of a non-haem iron sulphur centre .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> craniofacial <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> syndrome .
A Jewish family is reported in which the proband and her father had <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hearing loss <END> and unusual facies consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> facial asymmetry <END> , temporal <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal root <END> and small nasal alae .
In addition , both were born with a short frenulum of the tongue .
We believe these findings represent a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> syndrome with distinct craniofacial features .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis : <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> due to both striatal and nigral dysfunction .
We describe a family with adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis , with apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> , observed in six affected individuals in three generations .
Disease onset was usually in the fifth decade , but was earlier in the youngest generation .
Early symptoms consisted of <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> in face and arms , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , auditory symptoms , cognitive decline , or <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Parkinsonism <END> occurred a few years after disease onset , with stooped posture , shuffling gait , bradykinesia , and mask face .
Four subjects deteriorated to a state of severe handicap , with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , contractures , dysphagia , and dysarthria .
Leg weakness evolved to flaccid paraparesis in two patients .
Diagnosis was confirmed by brain biopsy in one patient and full autopsy in two patients .
Abundant intraneuronal storage of autofluorescent material was found throughout the brain .
Electron microscopy showed granular osmiophilic deposits and scarce fingerprint profiles .
Striking loss of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and reticulata was found .
( 123) I-IBZM Single photon emission computed tomography in two patients showed loss of postsynaptic D2 receptor binding in the striatum .
We conclude that <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> in ANCL is likely to be caused by both presynaptic nigral cell loss and postsynaptic striatal degeneration .

The clinical characteristics of pedigrees of Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> with the 11778 mutation .
In a study of the phenotypic characteristics of pedigrees of Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> positive for the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutation at position 11778 , 28 of 49 pedigrees were represented by singleton cases .
Seven families , including six singleton pedigrees , had maternal family members with a mixture of mutant and normal <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( heteroplasmy ) .
Seventy-two affected individuals from 43 families showed a male predominance of 81 .9% ( 59/72 ) and ages of onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> ranging from 8 to 60 years .
The time interval between affected eyes averaged 1.8 months ; the duration of progression of <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> in each eye averaged 3.7 months .
Visual acuity was 20/200 or worse in 107 of 109 ( 98 .2% ) eyes .
Telangiectatic microangiopathy , disk pseudoedema , or vascular tortuosity , ophthalmoscopic features believed to be classic of Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> , were noted in 30 of 52 patients .
Visual-evoked responses were typically absent or abnormal .
Electrocardiograms , fluorescein angiograms , cerebrospinal fluid analyses , brain computed tomography , and magnetic resonance imaging were usually normal .
There were no consistent neurologic or systemic illnesses associated with these Leber 's pedigrees .
In many cases , the diagnosis would not have been suspected because of the absence of a compatible family history , typical clinical profile , or ophthalmoscopic appearance .
Genetic analysis showed the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutation at position 11778 , which established the diagnosis of Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> and has allowed for a broader view of the clinical features of this disease .
A consanguineous family with <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and specific craniofacial dysmorphism were observed in three children from a large , consanguineous , Moroccan family .
A fourth child showed similar clinical features , with the exception of <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> .
The association of these abnormalities in these children represents the Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome ( OMIM 235730 ) .
Mutation scanning of genes potentially involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> , RET, GDNF , EDN3 , and EDNRB , showed a sequence variant , Ser305Asn , in exon 4 of the EDNRB gene in the index patient of this family .
The Ser305Asn substitution present in two of the four patients and four healthy relatives and absent in one of the remaining two patients illustrates the difficulties in interpreting the presence of mutations in families with <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> .
It is unlikely that the EDNRB variant contributes to the phenotype .
This consanguineous family might be useful for the identification of a Goldberg-Shprintzen locus .
Familial occurrence of the g syndrome .
We report the familial occurrence of the G syndrome of multiple congenital anomalies affecting a mother and her three sons .
All showed the characteristic syndromal facies , a low total ridge count , pronounced <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> in infancy which improved with age but persisted in the boys ( it has disappeared in the mother ) .
One of the boys had a left <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , another had a unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> .
All boys had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> : penile in two ( with descended testes ) and perineal in another ( with <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> ) .
Familial occurrence in this family is compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Linkage analysis of chromosome 1q markers in 136 <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> families .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> Cancer <END> Research Campaign/British Prostate Group U.K . Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> Prostate Cancer <END> Study Collaborators . <START:PHENOTYPE> Prostate cancer <END> shows evidence of familial aggregation , particularly at young ages at diagnosis , but the inherited basis of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> is poorly understood .
Smith et al . recently found evidence of linkage to markers on 1q , at a locus designated " HPC1 , " in 91 families with multiple cases of early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
Using both parametric and nonparametric methods , we attempted to confirm this finding , in 60 affected related pairs and in 76 families with three or more cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> , but we found no significant evidence of linkage .
The estimated proportion of linked families , under a standard <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model , was 4% , with an upper 95 % confidence limit of 31 % .
We conclude that the HPC1 locus is responsible for only a minority of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> cases and that it is likely to be most important in families with at least four cases of the disease .
Genetic heterogeneity and penetrance analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> families .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> Breast Cancer <END> Linkage Consortium .
The contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> was assessed by linkage and mutation analysis in 237 families , each with at least four cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , collected by the <START:PHENOTYPE> Breast Cancer <END> Linkage Consortium .
Families were included without regard to the occurrence of ovarian or other cancers .
Overall , disease was linked to BRCA1 in an estimated 52 % of families , to BRCA2 in 32 % of families , and to neither gene in 16 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 6%-28% ) , suggesting other predisposition genes .
The majority ( 81% ) of the breast-ovarian cancer families were due to BRCA1 , with most others ( 14% ) due to BRCA2 . Conversely , the majority of families with male and female <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> were due to BRCA2 ( 76% ) .
The largest proportion ( 67% ) of families due to other genes was found in families with four or five cases of female <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> only .
These estimates were not substantially affected either by changing the assumed penetrance model for BRCA1 or by including or excluding BRCA1 mutation data .
Among those families with disease due to BRCA1 that were tested by one of the standard screening methods , mutations were detected in the coding sequence or splice sites in an estimated 63 % ( 95 % CI 51 %-77% ) .
The estimated sensitivity was identical for direct sequencing and other techniques .
The penetrance of BRCA2 was estimated by maximizing the LOD score in BRCA2-mutation families , over all possible penetrance functions .
The estimated cumulative risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> reached 28% ( 95 % CI 9%-44% ) by age 50 years and 84 % ( 95 % CI 43%-95% ) by age 70 years .
The corresponding ovarian cancer risks were 0.4% ( 95 % CI 0%-1% ) by age 50 years and 27% ( 95 % CI 0%-47% ) by age 70 years .
The lifetime risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> appears similar to the risk in BRCA1 carriers , but there was some suggestion of a lower risk in BRCA2 carriers <5 0 years of age .
Digestive tract and renal small vessel hyalinosis , idiopathic nonarteriosclerotic <START:PHENOTYPE> intracerebral calcifications <END> , retinal ischemic syndrome , and phenotypic abnormalities .
A new familial syndrome .
A new familial syndrome that affected 3 of 7 siblings is described .
All 3 patients were young women with a very peculiar phenotype , poikilodermia and hair greying , and idiopathic nonarteriosclerotic cerebral calcifications .
Pathological studies demonstrated a marked and progressive hyalinosis involving capillaries and often arterioles and small veins of the digestive tract , kidneys , and calcified areas of the brain .
Using electron microscopy , we found that the hyalin substance in the intestinal capillaries consisted of several concentric layers of basal membrane-like deposits within a finely granular fluffy material .
Huge deposits of this material were present in the subepithelial and mesangial spaces of the kidneys .
Endothelial cells and , in the kidneys , mesangial cells were markedly abnormal , and a true mesangiolysis pattern was present in 2 patients .
The clinical and biologic expression of these vascular changes was variable .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Diarrhea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rectal bleeding <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malabsorption <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> protein-losing enteropathy <END> were the main and lethal clinical problems in the proband .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertension <END> appeared in the early stage of a second pregnancy in 1 sister , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> was found in all 3 affected patients .
Peripheral retinal ischemic syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal scars <END> were found in the ocular fundi of both affected sisters of the proband .
A <START:PHENOTYPE> subarachnoid hemorrhage <END> , due to a right sylvian aneurism , also occurred in both sisters and was lethal in 1 sister .
None of the known causes of distal vessel hyalinosis could be ascertained .
Generalized epilepsy with <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> plus .
A genetic disorder with heterogeneous clinical phenotypes .
The clinical and genetic relationships of <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> and the generalized epilepsies are poorly understood .
We ascertained a family with genealogical information in 2000 individuals where there was an unusual concentration of individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> and generalized epilepsy in one part of the pedigree .
We first clarified complex consanguineous relationships in earlier generations and then systematically studied the epilepsy phenotypes in affected individuals .
In one branch ( core family ) 25 individuals over four generations were affected .
The commonest phenotype , denoted as 'febrile seizures plus ' ( FS+ ) , comprised childhood onset ( median 1 year ) of multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> , but unlike the typical febrile convulsion syndrome , attacks with fever continued beyond 6 years , or afebrile seizures occurred .
Seizures usually ceased by mid childhood ( median 11 years ) . Other phenotypes included FS+ and absences , FS+ and myoclonic seizures , FS+ and <START:PHENOTYPE> atonic seizures <END> , and the most severely affected individual had myoclonic-astatic epilepsy ( MAE ) .
The pattern of inheritance was <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> .
The large variation in generalized epilepsy phenotypes was not explained by acquired factors .
Analysis of this large family and critical review of the literature led to the concept of a genetic epilepsy syndrome termed generalized epilepsy with <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> plus ( GEFS+ ) .
GEFS+ has a spectrum of phenotypes including <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> , FS+ and the less common MAE . Recognition of GEFS+ explains the epilepsy phenotypes of previously poorly understood benign childhood generalized epilepsies .
In individual patients the inherited nature of GEFS+ may be overlooked .
Molecular genetic study of such large families should allow identification of genes relevant to <START:PHENOTYPE> febrile seizures <END> and generalized epilepsies .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
Problems of prenatal diagnosis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> ( ARPKD ) is characterized by different proportions of cystic dilated collecting ducts invariably associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> .
Because of the nearly regular arrangement of nephrons and collecting ducts , disturbances have been postulated to act rather late on embryological grounds .
Prenatal diagnoses seem to confirm this observation , as can be demonstrated in our cases and those reported in the literature .
Increased echogenicity and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal enlargement <END> are the main ultrasonographic signs of ARPKD ; <START:PHENOTYPE> oligohydramnios <END> is characteristic but not always present .
Repeated sonographic measurements of the kidney length seem to be the most useful parameter .
As differential diagnoses , autosomal dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> as well as Meckel syndrome have to be taken into consideration .
The prognosis of cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> oligohydramnios <END> is usually poor .
In genetic counselling , the possibility of prenatal diagnosis in the second trimester of pregnancy should be given with caution .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> : genetic , molecular , and environmental aspects .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> has emerged as one of the most serious public health concerns in the 21st century .
Obese children tend to become obese adults .
The dramatic rise in pediatric <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> closely parallels the rapid increase in the prevalence of adult <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .
As overweight children become adults they face the multitude of health problems associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> at younger ages .
The morbidity and mortality associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> continue to increase .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> is one of the leading causes of preventable death .
Complications of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> include cardiovascular risks , hypertension , dyslipidemia , endothelial dysfunction , type 2 diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance , acanthosis nigricans , hepatic steatosis , premature puberty , hypogonadism and polycystic ovary syndrome , obstructive sleep disorder , orthopedic complications , cholelithiasis and pseudotumor cerebri .
Genetic and molecular and environmental factors play an important role in the assessment and management of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .

Neonatal progeroid ( Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch ) syndrome : report of five new cases and review .
The neonatal progeroid syndrome ( NPS) , or Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch , is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder comprised of generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> lipoatrophy <END> except for fat pads in the suprabuttock areas , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> of the scalp hair , eyebrows , and eyelashes , relative <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> triangular face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> natal teeth <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
We report on 5 new patients who demonstrate phenotypic variability and who represent the single largest series of NPS reported to date .
Two of the patients are from an African-American kindred , an ethnic occurrence not reported previously .
The fact that there are 2 pairs of sibs among the 5 patients further supports that NPS is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition .
This report also includes a review of the previously reported 16 patients and compares them with the 5 new patients .
Abnormalities in endocrine and lipid metabolism were found in 3 of 5 patients .
Skeletal findings in 2 of our patients demonstrated some new findings as well as the typical radiological abnormalities previously noted in NPS .
It is apparent , based on the 21 cases , that mild to moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> is common in NPS .
Long term follow-up of patients with NPS should provide more information relative to their ultimate psychomotor development .
NPS is usually lethal by 7 months ; however , on rare occasions , patients have survived into the teens .
Our 3 surviving patients range in age from 16-23 months .
Variability in the phenotype of NPS is clear ; however , the phenotype remains distinct enough to allow a secure diagnosis .

1q21.1 Microduplication expression in adults .
Rare , recurrent chromosome 1q21.1 duplications have been associated with developmental delay , congenital anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> in children .
Data on adult clinical expression would help to inform genetic counseling .
A systematic review of 22 studies reporting 107 individuals ( 59 children and 48 adults ) with 1q21.1 duplications was conducted .
We compiled the available phenotypic data to attempt to identify the most highly associated clinical features and to determine expression in adults .
We also report on seven adult cases newly identified in the studies of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> at our center .
Five cases were ascertained as controls , 32 as relatives of probands , and 70 as having clinical features : <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorder ( n = 15 ) , congenital heart disease ( n = 12 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ( n = 10 ) , or other , mostly developmental , features ( n = 33 ) .
The 1q21.1 duplication was significantly enriched in the cohorts with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ( P = 0.0155 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> ( P = 0.0040 ) at our center as compared with controls .
There was a paucity of clinical data for adults ; the most common features , other than those used for ascertainment , included <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and abnormalities of possible connective tissue origin ( e.g. , carpal tunnel syndrome ) .
Further data are needed to characterize lifetime expression of 1q21.1 duplications .
These initial results , however , suggest that anticipatory care should include attention to later-onset conditions such as <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> is caused by a p.Val142Leu mutation in PRS-I .
We identified a novel missense mutation , c.424G> C ( p.Val142Leu ) in PRPS1 in a patient with uric acid overproduction without <START:PHENOTYPE> gout <END> but with <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , and recurrent respiratory infections .
The uric acid overproduction accompanying this combination of symptoms suggests that the patient presented with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate ( PRPP ) synthetase superactivity , but <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> have not been associated with superactivity until now .
However , <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> are a prominent feature of patients with Arts syndrome , which is caused by PRPS1 loss-of-function mutations , indicating that the patient reported here has an intermediate phenotype .
Molecular modeling predicts that the p.Val142Leu change affects both allosteric sites that are involved in inhibition of PRPS1 and the ATP-binding site , which suggests that this substitution can result both in a gain-of-function and loss-of-function of PRPP synthetase .
This finding is in line with the normal PRPP synthetase activity in fibroblasts and the absence of activity in erythrocytes of the present patient .
We postulate that the overall effect of the p.Val142Leu change on protein activity is determined by the cell type , being a gain-of-function in proliferating cells and a loss-of-function in postmitotic cells .
Our results show that missense mutations in PRPS1 can cause a continuous spectrum of features ranging from progressive non-syndromic postlingual <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> to uric acid overproduction , <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> depending on the functional sites that are affected .

Vitamin D receptor polymorphism is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
Vitamin D receptor is a trans-acting transcriptional factor that mediates 1alpha,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3 action in the regulation of target gene expression .
Recent studies have shown that clinical response of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> to 1alpha,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3 is correlated with the vitamin D receptor mRNA expression level , which may be influenced by the genotype of the vitamin D receptor .
In this study , we have explored a possible association between <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> and the polymorphism in the gene encoding the vitamin D receptor .
We examined the allelic frequencies of the vitamin D receptor in <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> patients ( n = 104 ) and in healthy controls ( n = 104 ) by analyzing the restriction pattern of the polymerase chain reaction products .
A significant increase in the frequency of the A allele ( absence of the restriction site at intron 8 ) by ApaI restriction fragment length polymorphism was observed in <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> patients compared with that of the control group , and the tendency was more accentuated in early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
Odds ratios ( 95 % confidence interval ) for <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> of AA and Aa genotypes were 5. 0 ( 1.3-19 .1 ) and 2.4 ( 1.3-4.3) , and odds ratios for early onset of AA and Aa genotypes were 6.4 ( 1.6-25.0 ) and 3.1 ( 1.7-5 .9) , respectively .
Allele frequencies for A and a alleles were 0.317 and 0.683 in the <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> group and 0.168 and 0.832 in the control group ( p = 0.001 ) .
A significant association between vitamin D receptor genotypes and the mean age at onset was observed ( p < 0.05 ) .
Our findings suggest that allelic variance in the vitamin D receptor gene itself or other genes in linkage disequilibrium with this gene , could predispose to the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
Findings and long-term surgical results in the <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> of osteogenesis imperfecta .
Osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) is an inherited connective-tissue disorder of variable penetrance .
With OI , the triad of <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclera <END> , osseous fragility , and a conductive <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> is known as the van der Hoeve-de Kleyn syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Blue sclera <END> with a conductive loss may be a clinical subgroup of OI . Clinical findings and long-term surgical results in 62 operations in 43 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclera <END> are given .
Osteogenesis imperfecta differs from <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> in the following ways : (1 ) earlier onset ( in the second and third decades of life) , (2 ) more severe middle ear involvement , and (3 ) a higher incidence of sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> .
One year after stapedectomy , 38 ( 75% ) of 51 operations had complete closure of the air-bone gap.
Of the 24 operations followed up for an average of seven years ( range , two to 18 years ) , 15 patients ( 62% ) had no deterioration in their immediate postoperative hearing gain .
Our study supports the concept that OI is clinically distinct from <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> and establishes surgical intervention for its conductive <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> as a reasonable alternative to amplification .
Homozygosity mapping in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> to a Cohen syndrome region on 8q21.3-8q22.1 : redefining a clinical entity .
A syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , progressive postnatal growth deficiency , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> was observed in two brothers and their cousin from a multiply consanguineous kindred of Lebanese descent .
Hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal dystrophy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> were also identified .
The severity of the condition varied among the closely related patients .
Because of absence of a distinctive facial appearance , the degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , the initially considered clinical diagnosis of Cohen syndrome was withdrawn and a novel genetic entity was assumed .
Homozygosity mapping in this family assigned the gene to a 26.8-cM region on the chromosome band 8q21.3 -22.1 , between the microsatellites at D8S270 and D8S514 .
The maximum two-point LOD score was found for marker at D8S267 ( Zmax=3.237 at Omax=0.00 ) .
Intriguingly enough , the identified gene region overlaps the refined gene region for Cohen syndrome ( COH1 ) [Kolehmainen et al. , 1997 : Euro J Hum Genet 5:206-213 ] .
This fact encourages the hypothesis that the described kindred segregates for a variant of Cohen syndrome and suggests a redefinition of its phenotype .
A familial syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , mental impairment , and dentate gyrus atrophy.
We present a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> with , in some cases , mental retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> emotional instability <END> , but intellectual deterioration in all affected members .
The latter was accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> psychosis <END> in some .
The inheritance is most likely <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> , affecting two generations and consisting of a congenitally blind parent and 6 of 11 of her offspring .
In addition to these features , some affected individuals had <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> and movement disorder , especially <START:PHENOTYPE> choreiform movements <END> .
They all showed small body mass , due possibly to poor nutrition from <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> .
The pathological findings were unique , demonstrating selective atrophy of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus .
There was selective expression in paraffin-embedded sections of alpha B-crystallin ( CRYA2 ) in oligodendroglia in all areas of the nervous system examined .
alpha B-Crystallin is a major optic lens protein but also a heat shock protein and molecular chaperone found in brain and a number of other tissues .
Because of the association of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> and the accumulation in oligodendroglia of alpha B-crystallin , the gene for this protein was sequenced for possible mutation .
No mutation was found indicating other genetic locus .
This family appears to have a newly recognized genetic disorder .
RMRP gene sequence analysis confirms a cartilage -hair hypoplasia variant with only skeletal manifestations and reveals a high density of single-nucleotide polymorphisms .
Mutations in the RMRP gene that codes for an RNA subunit of the MRP RNAse complex are the cause of cartilage -hair hypoplasia ( CHH ; MIM 250250 ) .
We tested the hypothesis that recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal dysplasia <END> without hypotrichosis ( M1M 250460 ) , a disorder presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal dysplasia <END> similar to CHH , but lacking hair anomalies , immunodeficiency and other extra skeletal features , might be allelic to CHH .
We identified four mutation-carrying alleles segregating with the skeletal phenotype in two unrelated boys and their parents .
One allele carried the common Finnish mutation +70 A--> G ; the remaining three carried +195 C--> T, +238C--> T, and dupAAGCTGAGGACG at -2 . Sequencing 120 alleles from a control group revealed an unusually high density of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in and around the RMRP gene : the biological significance of this finding is unclear .
We conclude that recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal dysplasia <END> without hypotrichosis is a variant of CHH , manifesting only as <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal dysplasia <END> .
Precise diagnosis of this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal dysplasia <END> is not without importance because of recessive inheritance with corresponding recurrence risk , as well as because of potential complications such as <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> , susceptibility to infections and the increased likelihood of developing cancer .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and metaphyseal changes associated with cone-shaped epiphyses of the hands should raise the diagnostic possibility of a CHH-related disorder that can then be confirmed by mutation analysis .
Inherited congenital bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> atresia of the external auditory canal <END> , congenital bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical talus <END> and increased interocular distance .
Six out of twenty descendants of a reportedly affected grandfather have congenital bilateral symmetrical and isolated subtotal <START:PHENOTYPE> atresia of the external auditory canal <END> .
Four of the six affected descendants have bilateral foot anomalies--two affected cousins having <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital vertical talus <END> .
All of the three affected boys in the third generation have increased interocular distance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Short fifth fingers <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral single transverse palmar creases <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital exotropia <END> were found infrequently and are considered coincidental features .
Apart from the atresia , oto-rhinolaryngologic examination , mental function , dermatoglyphics , IgA , kidney function and heart function of the affected descendants were all normal .
The karyotype of four affected descendants examined was normal .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> with variable expressivity is suggested .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> spastic ataxia associated with frequent white matter changes maps to 2q33-34 .
Recessive ataxias are a heterogeneous group of diseases .
We identified a group of 23 French-Canadian cases belonging to 17 families affected by an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> spastic ataxia associated with frequent white matter changes .
The fact that 59 % of these families have a genealogical relationship to the Portneuf County of Quebec suggests that this is a new form of ataxia with a regional founder effect .
All cases present with cerebellar ataxia and <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> .
There is great intrafamilial and interfamilial variability , as illustrated by the spectrum of age of diagnosis ( range : 2-59 years , mean : 15 .0 ) and the presence of white matter changes on MRI in 52 .4% of cases .
The more severe cases have <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> from birth , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> and were considered cases of cerebral palsy .
Brain MRI constantly shows <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> , which in some cases may be associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical atrophy <END> , leucoencephalopathy and corpus callosum thinning .
A genome wide scan uncovered linkage of three families to marker D2S2321 localized on chromosome 2q33-34 .
Linkage analysis confirmed that all families are linked to the same region [multipoint log of the odds ( LOD ) score of 5 .95 ] . Haplotype analysis and allele sharing suggest that one common mutation may account for 97 % of carrier chromosomes in Quebec .
The uncovering of the mutated gene may point to a common pathway for pyramidal and cerebellar degeneration as both are often observed in recessive ataxias and complicated paraplegias .
Chromosomal mapping and phenotypic characterization of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> linked to the OTSC4 locus . To perform chromosomal mapping and clinical analysis of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> linked to the fourth locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> ( OTSC4 ) in an Israeli family .
Pedigree study .
A genetics of hearing loss research laboratory , a clinical genetics laboratory , a center for speech and hearing , and an otolaryngology department at a university and medical centers in Israel .
An Israeli family of which 24 members were ascertained and a pedigree was constructed ; 12 members had <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> .
Confirmation of <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> by surgery ( 3 subjects ) and by audiologic evaluation , medical history , and family history ( 9 subjects) , and whole-genome scanning to identify the chromosomal region of the mutant locus .
Chromosomal location of the <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> locus .
Linkage to the 16q21-23.2 interval was identified and confirmed with a logarithm of odds ( LOD ) score of 3.97 at theta = 0 .
The new locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> was designated OTSC4 .
The OTSC4 interval of 9 to 10 megabase includes several genes involved in the immune system and bone homeostasis that may be good candidates for genes <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> .
The elucidation of the OTSC4 gene may disclose the etiology of the disorder , and the functional and structural analysis of the protein may open new options for diagnosis , treatment , and prevention of <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> .
Barth syndrome associated with compound hemizygosity and heterozygosity of the TAZ and LDB3 genes .
Barth syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> disorder caused by the tafazzin ( TAZ ) gene mutations and includes <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( DCM ) with left ventricular non-compaction , <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal myopathy <END> , abnormal mitochondria and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dilated cardiomyopathy <END> with left ventricular non-compaction transmitted as an autosomal dominant condition has also been associated with LIM domain-binding 3 ( LDB3 ) gene defects .
We describe a family in which the 12-year-old proband had left ventricular non-compaction and DCM .
His mother had five miscarriages , two other sons who died in infancy , and a healthy son and daughter .
The proband showed left ventricular non-compaction-DCM , <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal myopathy <END> , recurrent oral aphthous ulcers and cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
The DCM progressively improved with age ; medical therapy was discontinued at 5 years of age .
At present , left ventricular function is normal and <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> are absent .
Magnetic resonance imaging documented left ventricular non-compaction .
However , oral aphthous ulcers and cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> have recurred .
In the proband we identified two novel mutations , one of maternal origin in the TAZ gene ( p.[ Glu202ValfsX15] ) and one of paternal origin in the LDB3 gene ( p.[ Thr35 0Ile] ) .
The mother , brother and father are healthy ; although the latter two show prominent left ventricle trabeculation without dysfunction .
Expression studies of TAZ and LDB3 genes were conducted in family members and controls .
In the proband , brother and father , LDB3 expression was similar to control cases .
TAZ and LDB3 expression progressively declined with age in control both blood and myocardial samples .
However , an endomyocardial biopsy performed in the proband at 6 months of age , showed significantly lower TAZ and LDB3 expression than in age-matched myocardial controls .
We believe that the clinical , genetic and expression data support the hypothesis that tafazzins are essential during fetal and early post-natal life .
A new syndrome : thrombocytopathia , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle fatigue <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> miosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> .
A new multifacetted syndrome inherited as an autosomal , dominant trait is described encompassing not only two hitherto undescribed hereditary defects--thrombocytopathia and asplenia--but also muscle contractile defect , migraine-like headache , <START:PHENOTYPE> miosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> .
None of these defects has so far been assigned to a specific chromosome or linkage group .
Further studies on the various aspects of the syndrome are in progress .
X-linked mental retardation syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , hypogammaglobulinemia , and progressive gait disturbance is regionally mapped between xq21.33 and Xq23.
We identified a family with three males in two generations with <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate mental retardation <END> .
The two oldest were first cousins whose mothers were sisters .
The third affected was a grandson through a daughter of one of the sisters , strongly suggesting X- linked inheritance .
The affected males had <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent glabella <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prognathism <END> , generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> , and bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> single palmar creases <END> .
All developed <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in childhood .
The two oldest have had a slow deterioration in neurological status with poor gait and balance and progressive weakness .
No deterioration in their mental status has been observed .
The oldest had <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> confirmed on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain and prolonged nerve conduction velocity .
Two of the males had hypogammaglobulinemia ( IgA deficient ) .
Two-point linkage analysis using 27 microsatellite markers on the X chromosome resulted in a maximum LOD score of 2.23 at straight theta = 0 for locus DSX101 .
Recombination was observed at locus DSX1170 in Xq21.33 and locus DXS8067 in Xq23.
We conclude that this family represents an X-linked disorder associated with a recognizable phenotype , progressive neurological deterioration , and variable hypogammaglobulinemia .
The gene appears to lie between Xq21.33 and Xq23.

<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
Four families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> are reported .
Although the phenotype is nondistinctive , several patients had receding or small foreheads , <START:PHENOTYPE> upslanted palpebral fissures <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent ears <END> .
The degree of intellectual dysfunction is not as severe as that recorded in autosomal recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
It would appear that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> is more common than previously recorded , and that head circumference measurements of siblings and parents of affected patients should become a part of the initial investigation .
Alopecia areata: a tissue specific <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disease <END> of the hair follicle .
The goal of this review is to introduce the immunologic community to <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia areata <END> as a model system for the study of tissue directed <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disease <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Alopecia areata <END> is marked by autoimmune assault on the hair follicle resulting in hair loss .
It is linked to HLA-DQ3 and evidence suggests it is mediated by T-lymphocytes with a TH1 cytokine profile .
Hair follicles are an immune protected site with deficient MHC expression .
Evidence is presented suggesting that <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia areata <END> results from loss of immune privilege with presentation of autoantigens .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Alopecia areata <END> is one of the most common human autoimmune conditions , with a lifetime risk of approximately 1.7% . Study of <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia areata <END> in humans is facilitated by the accessibility of scalp for biopsy .
It is possible to transfer the condition with lesional human lymphocytes in a human scalp graft/SCID mouse model .
There are also spontaneous animal models which share the features of the human condition .
For these reasons , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia areata <END> is a powerful model for study of the induction and pathogenesis of tissue directed <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disease <END> .
Linear lesions reflecting lyonization in women heterozygous for IFAP syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis with atrichia and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> ) .
A diagnosis of IFAP ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis with atrichia and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> ) syndrome was established in a 1-year-old boy with congenital hairlessness , generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyotic skin <END> changes with follicular hyperkeratoses , and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> .
IFAP syndrome is considered to be an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> trait .
The phenotype present in female carriers has so far not been delineated .
A 2-year-old sister had atrophoderma and <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyotic skin <END> lesions arranged in a linear pattern and a large noncicatrical bald patch on her scalp .
Similarly , the mother had linear lesions of scaling and atrophy as well as circumscribed hairless areas involving the scalp , the axillary region , and the lower legs .
Sweat testing by means of iodine starch-reaction visualized hypohidrotic linear lesions corresponding to the areas of hyperkeratosis and atrophy.
In both mother and daughter the lesions followed the lines of Blaschko , whereas the boy was diffusely affected .
Family history showed that the boy 's maternal uncle who had died at age 1 year was likewise affected with the same disorder .
Moreover , the maternal grandmother had reportedly bald patches on her scalp and very <START:PHENOTYPE> dry skin <END> .
This is the first report to document linear skin lesions visualizing lyonization in women heterozygous for IFAP syndrome .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital stapes ankylosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad thumbs <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperopia <END> : report of a family and refinement of a syndrome .
We report on a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital stapes ankylosis <END> , and with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperopia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad thumbs <END> , and broad first toes .
Neither of the studied relatives had symphalangism , possibly distinguishing this syndrome as an entity separate from the facio-audio-symphalangism and proximal symphalangism syndromes .
An alternative possibility is that this family falls within the spectrum of the facioaudio-symphalangism and proximal symphalangism syndromes .
Visualization of the ossicular chain , and ophthalmologic and radiologic studies are important in the evaluation of families with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> .
A characteristic physiognomy in our patients is present ; this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome was first described by Teunissen and Cremers [ 199 0 : Laryngoscope 10 0:38 0-384 ] .
Evaluation of candidate genes MAP2K4 , MADH4 , ACVR1B , and BRCA2 in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> : deleterious BRCA2 mutations in 17 % .
It is estimated that familial aggregation and genetic susceptibility play a role in as many as 10 % of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas .
To investigate the role of germ-line mutations in the etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> , we have analyzed samples from patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> enrolled in the NFPTR for mutations in four tumor suppressor candidate genes : (a ) MAP2K4 ; (b ) MADH4 ; (c ) ACVR1B ; and (d ) BRCA2 by direct sequencing of constitutional DNA . These genes are mutated in clinically sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> , but germ-line mutations are either not reported or anecdotal in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pancreatic cancer <END> patient samples were selected from kindreds in which three or more family members were affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> , at least two of which were first-degree relatives .
No mutations were identified in mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 ( 0 of 22) , MADH4 ( 0 of 22) , or ACVR1B ( 0 of 29) , making it unlikely that germ-line mutations in these genes account for a significant number of inherited pancreatic cancers .
BRCA2 gene sequencing identified five mutations ( 5 of 29 , 17.2% ) that are believed to be deleterious and one point mutation ( M192T) unreported previously .
Three patients harbored the common 6174delT frameshift mutation , one had the splice site mutation IVS 16-2A > G , and one had the splice site mutation IVS 15 -1G > A . Two of the five BRCA2 mutation carriers reported a family history of breast cancer , and none reported a family history of ovarian cancer .
These findings confirm the <START:PHENOTYPE> increased risk of pancreatic cancer <END> in individuals with BRCA2 mutations and identify germ-line BRCA2 mutations as the most common inherited genetic alteration yet identified in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> .
Infantile variant of Bartter syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder .
The infantile variant of Bartter syndrome ( IBS ) is usually associated with maternal <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> premature birth <END> , postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> polyuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis <END> and a typical appearance .
IBS is thought to be an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
Several congenital tubular defects are associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> ( SND ) .
However , an association between the IBS and SND has not been reported so far .
Here we describe 5 children of an extended consanguineous Bedouin family with IBS and SND .
In 3 of the cases , the typical electrolyte imbalance and facial appearance were detected neonatally .
SND was detected as early as age 1 month , suggesting either coincidental homozygotization of 2 recessive genes or a pleiotropic effect of one <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> gene .
This association suggests that evaluation of SND is warranted in every case of IBS .
A new locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> , OTSC8 , maps to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 9 . <START:PHENOTYPE> Otosclerosis <END> is a common disorder of the otic capsule resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> in 0.3- 0.4% of the Caucasian population .
The aetiology of the disease remains unclear .
In most cases , <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> can be considered as a complex disease .
In some cases , the disease is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait , sometimes with reduced penetrance .
To date , seven <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> loci have been reported , but none of the disease-causing genes has been identified .
In this study , we present the results of a genome-wide linkage analysis in a large Tunisian family segregating <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> .
Linkage analysis localised the responsible gene to chromosome 9p13.1-9q21.11 with a maximal LOD score of 4.13 , and this locus was named OTSC8 .
Using newly generated short tandem repeat polymorphism markers , we mapped this new <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> locus to a 34.16 Mb interval between the markers D9S970 and D9S1799 .
This region comprises the pericentromeric region on both arms of chromosome 9 , a highly complex region containing many duplicated sequences .
Native American myopathy : congenital myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , skeletal anomalies , and susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> malignant hyperthermia <END> .
Native American myopathy ( NAM ) [ OMIM 255995 ] , a putative <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder , was first reported in the Lumbee Indians of North Carolina .
NAM features include congenital weakness and arthrogryposis , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> talipes <END> deformities , and susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> malignant hyperthermia <END> ( MH ) provoked by anesthesia .
This report documents the phenotypic complexity and natural history of this rare congenital disorder in fourteen individuals with NAM .
Findings include a previously unreported 36 % mortality by age 18 . Based on this study , our conservative estimate for prevalence of NAM within the Lumbee population is approximately 2:10,000 ; however , birth incidence remains unknown .

Watson syndrome : is it a subtype of type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> ?
Over 20 years ago , Watson described three families with a condition characterised by pulmonary valvular stenosis , cafÃ© au lait patches , and dull intelligence .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Short stature <END> is an additional feature of this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> condition .
A fourth family with Watson syndrome has since been reported .
We have had the opportunity to review members of three of these four families .
The clinical phenotype of Watson syndrome has been expanded to include <START:PHENOTYPE> relative macrocephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Lisch nodules <END> in the majority of affected subjects , and <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromas <END> in one-third of family members .
Because the additional clinical findings enhance the similarity between Watson syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> 1 , molecular linkage studies have been performed using probes flanking the NF1 gene on chromosome 17 . Probe HHH202 showed the tightest linkage to Watson syndrome with a maximum lod score of 3.59 at phi = 0.0 ( 95 % confidence limits of phi = 0.0-0.15 ) .
This suggests either that Watson syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> 1 are allelic , or that there is a series of contiguous genes for pulmonary stenosis , neurocutaneous anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and mental retardation on 17q .
Obstetric complications and congenital malformation in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Recent years have witnessed increasingly intense research activity concerning early life somatic trauma and dysmorphogenesis which are associated with the later development of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
The two somatic factors that have received the most extensive scientific attention as antecedents of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> are obstetric complications ( OCs ) and the congenital malformations termed 'minor physical anomalies ' ( MPAs ) .
Head circumference ( HC ) at birth has also been studied as a measure of prenatal cerebral development .
A great number of studies indicate clearly that <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> patients have a significantly increased history of OCs , representing many different OCs from pregnancy , labor-delivery and the neonatal period .
The probable common denominator of these OCs is oxygen deprivation .
Especially labor-delivery OCs relate strongly to brain structure abnormality in ill twins from monozygotic pairs discordant for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Schizophrenia <END> patients very consistently have evidenced an increased frequency of MPAs in the global head , eyes , mouth , ears , hands , feet and limbs .
Specific MPAs occur with considerable frequency even among normal comparison subjects , but combination models for specific MPAs efficiently discriminate most patients from comparison subjects .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Schizophrenia <END> patients also have significantly reduced HC at birth , independently of gestational age , suggesting a disturbance in prenatal cerebral development , and most frequently observed in female patients .
Evidence has thus accumulated , increasingly , for the role of various forms of early trauma and dysmorphogenesis in subsequent <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , and efforts continue to determine the manner in which these early trauma influence both the early developing brain and the brain of the adult patient with manifest <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
A new syndrome with growth and mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibulofacial dysostosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
We report on two new Brazilian cases and reviewed two previously reported patients with a characteristic combination of signs including <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibulofacial dysostosis <END> , a clinical suggestion of <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , unusual ears with skin tags , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
Follow-up of these patients revealed growth and mental retardation , and severe language and <START:PHENOTYPE> speech delay <END> .
A review of the literature and database programs did not find any syndromes that matched this constellation of findings .
We believe that this combination of signs represents a new <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibulofacial dysostosis <END> syndrome whose etiology is unknown .
de la Chapelle dysplasia .
Since the description by de la Chapelle and colleagues of two sibs with a unique skeletal dysplasia , two additional cases have occurred , one in the original Finnish family and one <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> patient born to unrelated parents of Belgian descent .
The original Finnish family has later had a fourth child , a normal daughter who was found to be unaffected upon radiographic examination in the 19th week of gestation .
These additional findings are compatible with recessive inheritance .
Physical features common to these four patients include <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small thorax <END> , moderately severe <START:PHENOTYPE> micromelia <END> with small hands , and <START:PHENOTYPE> equinovarus <END> deformity .
In each case , the ulnae and fibulae were reduced to an almost triangular osseous remnant . Other long bones were short and bowed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Neonatal death <END> occurred in all cases and may be attributed to a consistent triad of respiratory tract malformations : <START:PHENOTYPE> laryngeal stenosis <END> , tracheobronchomalacia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> .
Clinical and radiographic features are sufficiently unique to distinguish de la Chapelle dysplasia from other disorders in the spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal lethal <END> osteochondrodysplasias .
Lacunar halos were identified as a distinctive histopathologic feature also observed in achondrogenesis but not in several other skeletal dysplasias .
Risk of renal and colonic neoplasms and <START:PHENOTYPE> spontaneous pneumothorax <END> in the Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome .
The Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome , a genodermatosis characterized by benign tumors of the hair follicle , has been associated with renal and colonic neoplasms and <START:PHENOTYPE> spontaneous pneumothorax <END> , but the risk of developing these disorders is unknown .
We identified risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> spontaneous pneumothorax <END> in 98 patients affected with the Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome , in 13 Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© haplotype carriers , and in 112 unaffected family members .
Development of <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> was strongly associated with the Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome and age .
The odds ratio for renal tumor in BHD-affected family members adjusted for age was 6 .9 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.5-31.6 ) and approximately 9. 0 for the other risk factors considered .
Chromophobe <START:PHENOTYPE> renal carcinoma <END> , an uncommon type of renal cancer , was the predominant type of renal cancer found .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spontaneous pneumothorax <END> was also strongly associated with the Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome and age .
The odds ratio for pneumothorax in BHD-affected individuals , adjusted for age , was 5 0.3 ( 95 % confidence interval , 6.4-392 ) , and about 32 times higher adjusting for the other risk variables .
Colon cancer and colon polyps were not related to the Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome .
The Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome confers an increased risk for the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> spontaneous pneumothorax <END> .
We found no increase in risk for the development of colon polyps or colon carcinomas .
A polymorphism in the CDKN1B gene is associated with increased risk of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
The loss of cell cycle control is believed to be an important mechanism in the promotion of carcinogenesis .
CDKN1B ( p27) belongs to the Cip/Kip family and functions as an important cell cycle gatekeeper .
Several lines of evidence from clinical studies and laboratory experiments demonstrate that CDKN1B is an important tumor suppressor gene in <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> etiology .
In addition , a case-control study has shown that the 326T/ G ( V109G ) polymorphism in CDKN1B is associated with advanced <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
In light of the evidence for linkage between the chromosomal location of the CDKN1B gene ( 12p13 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> susceptibility in several hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> ( HPC ) populations , we hypothesized that sequence variants of CDKN1B play a role in HPC . To test this hypothesis , we first resequenced this gene in 96 HPC probands to identify germ-line mutations and sequence variants .
We then genotyped the identified sequence variants among all family members of 188 HPC families and tested for their cosegregation with <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
In total , 10 sequence variants were identified , including three nonsynonymous changes .
A family-based test , which is free from the effects of population stratification , revealed a significant association between single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) -79 C/ T and <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> ( with a nominal P of 0.0005 ) .
The C allele of -79 C/ T was overtransmitted from parents to their affected offspring .
Evidence for this association was primarily contributed by affected offspring whose age at diagnosis was <65 years .
Together with the previous association study in a sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> population , our new findings additionally suggest that germ-line variants of this gene play a role in <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> susceptibility .
Diagnosis and management of infantile marfan syndrome .
Marfan syndrome is infrequently diagnosed early in infancy .
The experience of the authors with 22 severely affected infants diagnosed as having Marfan syndrome in the first 3 months of life is described and the literature on 32 additional infants with Marfan syndrome is reviewed .
It was found that serious cardiac pathology ( 82 % of the patients described in the article , 94 % of those described in the literature ) may be present at birth , and that congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures <END> ( 64 % of our cases , 47 % of literature cases ) are often an associated finding . Other useful clinical findings included <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dolichocephaly <END> , a characteristic facies , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperextensible joints <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes planus <END> , anterior chest deformity , iridodenesis , megalocornea , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dislocated lenses <END> .
Echocardiography was useful as a noninvasive method for defining the extent of cardiovascular involvement and following its course .
Characteristic cardiac findings in early life included <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> , valvular regurgitation , and aortic root dilation .
Cardiac function ranged from normal to poor , with a tendency to worsen .
Of the 22 cases 3 infants died during the first year of life .
Morbidity and mortality may be high when Marfan syndrome is diagnosed during infancy , and prompt recognition of this phenotype can facilitate management and counseling .
Most such severe cases appear to be due to a sporadic mutation in a single germ cell of one parent .
Many familial cases may have milder manifestations , be more difficult to detect during infancy , and have a better prognosis .
Use of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> antioxidant defenses for rescue of cells with a Leber hereditary optic neuropathy-causing mutation .
To explore a treatment paradigm for Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> ( LHON) , we augmented <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> antioxidant defenses to rescue cells with the G11778A mutation in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA . Cells homoplasmic for the G11778A mutation in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA were infected with an adeno-associated viral vector containing the human <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> superoxide dismutase ( SOD2 ) gene .
Control cells were infected with an adeno-associated viral ( AAV ) vector expressing the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) .
Two days later , the high-glucose culture medium was exchanged for a glucose-free medium containing galactose .
After 1 or 2 days , cellular production of superoxide was assessed using the fluorescent probe dihydroethidium , and we used TUNEL ( terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotin-deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling ) staining to detect apoptotic nuclei .
The effect of SOD2 on LHON cell survival was quantitated after 2 or 3 days .
Comparisons of AAV-SOD2-infected LHON cells relative to control cells infected with AAV-green fluorescent protein showed increased expression of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> SOD that attenuated superoxide-induced fluorescence by 26% ( P = .003 ) and suppressed TU NEL-induced fluorescence by 21% ( P = .048 ) after 2 days of growth in galactose medium , when cell survival increased by 25% ( P=.05 ) .
After 3 days in galactose medium , SOD2 increased LHON survival by 89% ( P = .006 ) relative to controls .
Protection against <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> oxidative stress may be useful for treatment of LHON .
Gene therapy with antioxidant genes may protect patients with LHON against <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> .
Linkage analysis of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> in five extended families maps the DFNA2 gene to a 1.25- Mb region on chromosome 1p . Thus far , 13 genes for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> have been localized to specific chromosomal regions , but none of the genes has been cloned .
Only a single family has been linked to each of these loci , with the exception of DFNA2 .
DFNA2 was originally mapped in two extended families originating from Indonesia and the United States .
In this study we report linkage to DFNA2 in three additional large families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> from Belgium and The Netherlands . These five DFNA2 families show a similar progressive sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , starting in the high frequencies and also affecting the middle and low frequencies later in life .
Combining the information from all linked families , the candidate region that is most likely to contain the DFNA2 gene was reduced to a 1.25- Mb region between markers D1S432 and MYCL1 .
Different haplotypes segregating with the <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> were found in all five families , suggesting that different mutations are present in the same gene .
These results indicate that DFNA2 is most likely an important gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> .
Mutations in JARID1C are associated with X-linked mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> .
Mutations in the JARID1C ( Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1C ) gene were recently associated with X-linked mental retardation ( XLMR ) .
Mutations in this gene are reported to be one of the relatively more common causes of XLMR with a frequency of approximately 3% in males with proven or probable XLMR .
The JARID1C protein functions as a histone 3 lysine 4 ( H3K4 ) demethylase and is involved in the demethylation of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 .
Mutation analysis of the JARID1C gene was conducted in the following cohorts : probands from 23 XLMR families linked to Xp11 .2 , 92 males with mental retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and 172 probands from small XLMR families with no linkage information .
Four novel mutations consisting of two missense mutations , p.A77 T and p.V504M , and two frame shift mutations , p.E468fsX2 and p.R1481fsX9 , were identified in males with mental retardation .
Two of the mutations , p.V504M and p.E468fsX2 , are located in the JmjC domain of the JARID1C gene where no previous mutations have been reported .
Additional studies showed that the missense mutation , p.V504M , was a de novo event on the grandpaternal X chromosome of the family .
Clinical findings of the nine affected males from the four different families included mental retardation (100% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> (55% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> ( 78% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( 33% ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> aggressive behaviour <END> ( 44% ) .
The degree of mental retardation consisted of mild ( 25% ) , moderate ( 12% ) and severe ( 63% ) .
Based on the clinical observations , male patients with mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> should be considered candidates for mutations in the JARID1C gene .
Impaired hearing in X-linked hypophosphataemic ( vitamin-D-resistant ) <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> .
We assessed the hearing of 25 patients with X-linked hypophosphataemic <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> .
Twelve patients had subjective <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> and 2 had had episodic tinnitus , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , and vertigo similar to that in MÃ©niÃ¨re 's disease .
On pure-tone audiometry , 19 patients were shown to have sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , 3 of whom had evidence of an added conductive element .
Tests were done to delineate sensory ( cochlear ) from neural <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
Analysis of the stapedius reflex threshold , percentage speech discrimination score , tone decay , and loudness recruitment showed a disturbance of cochlear function .
The possible mechanisms responsible for this dysfunction are discussed in the light of pathologic characteristics of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> and its extraosseous manifestations .
Sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , a previously unrecognised complication of familial hypophosphataemic <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> , occurs frequently .
Phenotypic characterization of hypomyelination and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> .
To define the clinical and laboratory findings in a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> white matter disorder called hypomyelination and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , recently found to be caused by a deficiency of a membrane protein , hyccin , encoded by the DRCTNNB1A gene located on chromosome 7p21.3-p15 .3 .
We performed neurological examination , neurophysiological , neuroimaging , and neuropathological studies on sural nerve biopsy in 10 hypomyelination and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> patients from 5 unrelated families .
The clinical picture was characterized by bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , developmental delay , and slowly progressive neurological impairment with spasticity , cerebellar ataxia , and mild-to-moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Neurophysiological studies showed a slightly to markedly slowed motor nerve conduction velocity in 9 of 10 patients , and multimodal evoked potentials indicated increased central conduction times .
Neuroimaging studies demonstrated a diffuse supratentorial hypomyelination , with in some patients , additional areas of more prominent signal change in the frontal region .
Sural nerve biopsy showed a slight-to-severe reduction in myelinated fiber density , with several axons surrounded by a thin myelin sheath or devoid of myelin .
Hypomyelination and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> is a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> white matter disorder characterized by the unique association of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> and hypomyelination of the central and peripheral nervous system .
3q29 microdeletion syndrome : clinical and molecular characterization of a new syndrome .
We report the identification of six patients with 3q29 microdeletion syndrome .
The clinical phenotype is variable despite an almost identical deletion size .
The phenotype includes mild-to-moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , with only slightly dysmorphic facial features that are similar in most patients : a long and <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gait ataxia <END> , chest-wall deformity , and long and <START:PHENOTYPE> tapering fingers <END> were noted in at least two of six patients . Additional features--including <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , cleft lip and palate , horseshoe kidney and hypospadias , ligamentous laxity , recurrent middle ear infections , and abnormal pigmentation--were observed , but each feature was only found once , in a single patient .
The microdeletion is approximately 1.5 Mb in length , with molecular boundaries mapping within the same or adjacent bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) clones at either end of the deletion in all patients .
The deletion encompasses 22 genes , including PAK2 and DLG1 , which are autosomal homologues of two known X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> genes , PAK3 and DLG3 .
The presence of two nearly identical low-copy repeat sequences in BAC clones on each side of the deletion breakpoint suggests that nonallelic homologous recombination is the likely mechanism of disease causation in this syndrome .
Mapping a gene ( SRN1 ) to chromosome 1q25-q31 in idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> confirms a distinct entity of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrosis <END> .
Idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> ( INS ) in childhood is characterized by massive <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> and minimal glomerular changes .
Most patients with INS respond to steroid therapy .
INS is generally regarded as a sporadic disease with favorable outcome .
We investigated a distinct subgroup of nephrosis--the familial form of steroid resistant INS ( SRN ) .
These patients always progress to <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal failure <END> within a few years and show absence of recurrence of the disease after renal transplantation .
The occurrence of the disorder in siblings and the high incidence of inbreeding in these families made an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance very likely .
We performed whole genome linkage analysis in nine multiplex families of European or Northern African origin .
Our results allowed us to assign a disease locus ( SRN1 ) to a defined chromosomal region on 1q25-1q31 , thus confirming the existence of a distinct entity of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrosis <END> .
Exclusion of linkage to the entire region in one family proves genetic heterogeneity .
Two translocations of chromosome 15q associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> .
Developmental <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> is characterised by difficulties in learning to read .
As reading is a complex cognitive process , multiple genes are expected to contribute to the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> .
The genetics of <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> has been a target of molecular studies during recent years , but so far no genes have been identified .
However , a locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> on chromosome 15q21 ( DYX1 ) has been established in previous linkage studies .
We have identified two families with balanced translocations involving the 15q21-q22 region .
In one family , the translocation segregates with specific <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> in three family members .
In the other family , the translocation is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> in one family member .
We have performed fluorescence in situ hybridisation ( FISH ) studies to refine the position of the putative <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> locus further .
Our results indicate that both translocation breakpoints on 15q map within an interval of approximately 6-8 Mb between markers D15S143 and D15 S1029 , further supporting the presence of a locus for specific <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> on 15q21 .
Progressive encephalopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypsarrhythmia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( PEHO syndrome ) in two Japanese siblings .
We report on two Japanese siblings ( one female and one male ) with PEHO syndrome ( progressive encephalopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypsarrhythmia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ) .
They showed profound generalized hypotonia early in infancy and developed infantile spasms with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypsarrhythmia <END> within the first year of life .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Abnormal eye movement <END> and visual failure with <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> were also observed early in infancy .
Psychomotor development was arrested and serial neuroradiological studies showed slight progressive brain atrophy , dominantly of the brainstem .
This is the first case report of PEHO syndrome , other than those dealing with the Finnish population .
Evaluation of growth and hormonal status in patients referred to the International Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> Anemia <END> Registry . 1 ) To determine the extent of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> in patients with Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> ( FA) ; 2 ) to determine the extent and nature of endocrinopathy in FA ; 3 ) to assess the impact on height of any endocrinopathies in these patients ; and 4 ) to study the correlation , if any , between height , endocrinopathy , and FA complementation group .
Fifty-four patients with FA , 30 males and 24 females from 47 unrelated families , were prospectively evaluated in a Pediatric Clinical Research Center .
The patients ranged in age from 0.1-31 .9 years , with the mean age at assessment 8.6 years .
Endocrine abnormalities were found in 44 of the 54 FA patients tested ( 81% ) , including <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , growth hormone ( GH ) insufficiency , hypothyroidism , glucose intolerance , hyperinsulinism , and/or overt diabetes mellitus .
Twenty-one of 48 ( 44% ) participants had a subnormal response to GH stimulation ; 19 of 53 ( 36% ) had overt or compensated hypothyroidism , while 8 of 40 participants had reduced thyroid -hormone binding .
Two patients were diabetic at the time of study ; impaired glucose tolerance was found in 8 of 40 patients ( 25% ) , but most surprisingly , hyperinsulinemia was present in 28 of 39 ( 72% ) participants tested .
Significantly , spontaneous overnight GH secretion was abnormal in all patients tested ( n = 13 ) .
In addition , participants demonstrated a tendency toward primary hypothyroidism with serum tetraiodothyronine levels at the lower range of normal , while also having thyrotropin ( thyroid-stimulating hormone ) levels at the high end of normal .
Sixteen patients were assigned to FA complementation group A , ( FA-A) , 12 to FA-C , and 5 to FA-G ; 10 of the 12 participants in FA- C were homozygous for a mutation in the intron-4 donor splice site of the FANCC gene .
Patients in groups FA- A and FA- G were relatively taller than the group as a whole ( but still below the mean for the general population ) , whereas those in FA- C had a significantly reduced height for age .
GH response to stimulation testing was most consistently normal in participants from FA-G , but this did not reach statistical significance .
The tendency toward hypothyroidism was more pronounced in participants belonging to complementation groups FA- C and FA-G , whereas insulin resistance was most evident in patients in FA-G , and least evident in those in FA- C .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Short stature <END> was a very common finding among the patients with a mean height >2 standard deviations below the reference mean ( standard deviation score : -2.35 +/- 0.28 ) .
Patients with subnormal GH response and those with overt or compensated hypothyroidism were shorter than the group with no endocrinopathies .
The heights of those participants with glucose or insulin abnormalities were less severely affected than those of normoglycemic , normoinsulinemic participants , although all were significantly below the normal mean .
The mean height standard deviation score of patients with entirely normal endocrine function was also >2 standard deviations below the normal mean , demonstrating that <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> is an inherent feature of FA . Endocrinopathies are a common feature of FA , primarily manifesting as glucose/insulin abnormalities , GH insufficiency , and hypothyroidism .
Although <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> is a well-recognized feature of FA , 23 patients ( 43% ) were within 2 standard deviations , and 5 of these ( 9% of the total ) were actually above the mean for height for the general population .
Those patients with endocrine dysfunction are more likely to have <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
These data indicate that <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> is an integral feature of FA , but that superimposed endocrinopathies further impact on growth .
The demonstration of abnormal endogenous GH secretion may demonstrate an underlying hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction that results in poor growth .
Mutations in C2orf37 , encoding a nucleolar protein , cause hypogonadism , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal syndrome <END> .
Hypogonadism , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal syndrome <END> ( also referenced as Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> multisystemic disorder .
We have identified a founder mutation consisting of a single base-pair deletion in C2orf37 in eight families of Saudi origin .
Three other loss-of-function mutations were subsequently discovered in patients of different ethnicities .
The gene encodes a nucleolar protein of unknown function , and the cellular phenotype observed in patient lymphoblasts implicates a role for the nucleolus in the pathogenesis of this disease .
Our findings expand the list of human disorders linked to the nucleolus and further highlight the developmental and/or maintenance functions of this organelle .
Family history and the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
A case-control study was performed to estimate the relative risk of developing <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> for men with a positive family history .
Extensive cancer pedigrees were obtained on 691 men with <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> and 640 spouse controls .
Fifteen percent of the cases but only 8 % of the controls had a father or brother affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> ( P less than .001 ) .
Men with a father or brother affected were twice as likely to develop <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> as men with no relatives affected .
In addition , there was a trend of increasing risk with increasing number of affected family members such that men with two or three first degree relatives affected had a five and 11-fold increased risk of developing <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
Recognizing that 9-10 % of U.S . men will develop <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> in their lifetime , men with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> should be advised of their significantly increased <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> risk and should undergo appropriate screening measures for this disease .
Loss-of-function mutation of collybistin is responsible for X-linked mental retardation associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis identified a 737-kb microdeletion of Xq11 .1 , including the cell division cycle 42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF)-9 gene ( ARHGEF9) , encoding collybistin , which has a pivotal role in formation of postsynaptic glycine and Î³-aminobutyric acid receptor clusters , in a male patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
No overlapping deletion with this was identified in the database of genomic copy number variations .
A cohort study of ARHGEF9 nucleotide sequence identified a nonsense mutation in another male patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
This mutation affects one of the three transcript variants of ARHGEF9 , which was confirmed to be expressed in the brain by reverse transcription-PCR .
Although this nonsense mutation was shared with the patient 's mother , it was not observed in 100 normal individuals .
Both male patients suffered epileptic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> after 1 year of age .
Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed mild frontal atrophy in the first patient and right frontal polymicrogyria in the second patient .
Three previously reported mutations of ARHGEF9 consisted of a missense mutation in a male patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperekplexia <END> and two chromosomal disruptions in two female patients .
The common phenotypic effects of all ARHGEF9 mutations were mental retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Therefore , ARHGEF9 is likely to be responsible for syndromic X-linked mental retardation associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ocular hypotelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> submucosal cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome .
A syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypotelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> submucosal cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> in males was found in ten relatives over five generations of a family .
Other anomalies are <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , upslant of palpebral fissures , and a tendency to cutaneous syndactyly of 3rd and 4th fingers as well as 2nd and 3rd toes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant inheritance <END> is likely .
Diaphragmatic hernia-exomphalos-hypertelorism syndrome : a new case and further evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
We describe a male patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> wide anterior fontanel <END> and metopic suture , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down slanting palpebral fissures <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , and bilateral absence of the diaphragm with herniation of abdominal organs causing pulmonary hypoplasia and death .
Autopsy also showed <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal malrotation <END> .
All findings in this case are consistent with those described as a newly recognized syndrome by Donnai and Barrow [ 1993 ] .
Since the parents are first cousins , this case provides further evidence for the previously postulated <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> pattern .
Follow-up on the patients and families reported by Donnai and Barrow [ 1993 ] also supports <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Thrombocytopenia <END> with absent radius ( TAR ) .
Forty examples ( 27 from the literature and 13 new cases ) of a syndrome of hypomegakaryocytic <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> with bilateral absence of the radius have been analyzed .
This syndrome is designated in this paper as " <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> with absent radius ( TAR ) " .
The onset of hematologic complications usually occurs at birth or during early infancy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Thrombocytopenia <END> may be episodic and sometimes is accompanied by leukemoid reactions and <START:PHENOTYPE> eosinophilia <END> .
Bone marrow examination reveals decreased and/or abnormal megakaryocytes , with normal myeloid and erythroid precursors .
Congenital skeletal deformities include <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral absence of radius <END> , shortening and deformity of the ulnae , and occasionally absence of all the long bones in the arm .
The fingers and thumbs are always present . Other skeletal anomalies are frequent .
Cardiac anomalies , particularly the <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> and atrial <START:PHENOTYPE> septal defects <END> , may be present . Other non-skeletal congenital abnormalities are rare .
The prognosis is good if the patient survives to one year of age .
The syndrome has been compared to Fanconi 's <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> , thalidomide embryopathy , limb-cardiovascular syndrome , and a syndrome of multiple congenital malformations , from which it can be distinguished .
Heterogeneity of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> ( spino)cerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with or without spastic diplegia .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> with spastic diplegia was seen in seven males of a Turkish family , obviously transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> trait .
The first clinical sign in infancy was <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and pyramidal signs were noted at age 2-3 years .
Patients were never able to walk .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dysarthria <END> , orthopedic impairment , and mild mental retardation appeared later as the disorder progressed .
Death occurred in the 3rd or 4th decade from infectious diseases .
The syndrome resembles X-linked spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and X-linked spastic paraplegia in some aspects but is different if compared with previously published reports .
Laboratory and neurophysiological studies showed no abnormalities .
Various aspects of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> are discussed : genetic heterogeneity is apparent from observations reported .
Oncogenic point mutations in the human <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> gene : their application to genetic counseling .
Mutations of the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> gene , most of which cannot be detected by conventional Southern blotting , are known to cause both the nonhereditary and hereditary forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> and have been implicated in the development of other cancers .
Nonhereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> is caused by a <START:PHENOTYPE> somatic mutation <END> .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> is caused by a germ-cell mutation , most often a new one , and thus there is usually no family history of the disease .
Unlike patients with the nonhereditary disease , those with the hereditary form are at risk for additional retinoblastomas , and their progeny are at risk for the tumors .
We used a sensitive technique of primer-directed enzymatic amplification , followed by DNA sequence analysis , to identify mutations as small as a single nucleotide change in tumors from seven patients with simplex <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( with no family history of the disease ) .
In four patients the mutation involved only the tumor cells , and in three it involved normal somatic cells as well as tumor cells but was not found in either parent ; thus , these mutations appeared to be new , germ-cell mutations .
In addition , we found point mutations in cells from a bladder carcinoma , a small-cell carcinoma of the lung , and another <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
We conclude that the technique that we have described can distinguish hereditary from nonhereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> and that it is useful in risk estimation and genetic counseling .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> associated with neurodegeneration and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> .
The lipodystrophies are characterized by loss of body fat and metabolic disturbances , but the CNS is seldom affected .
An investigation of a family with partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> and neurologic abnormalities included lipid analysis , dual-energy x-ray absorbtiometry ( DEXA ) for adiposity , <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , karyotype and other genetic analyses , peroxisomal function , glycosylation pattern of transferrin and thyroglobulin , and muscle biopsy .
The propositus , a 28-year-old woman with congenital partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> and cataracts , presented with a spastic-ataxic gait and lower extremity paresthesiae at age 18 . Laboratory investigation revealed a type V hyperlipidemia pattern , <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , and high alpha-tocopherol levels .
A similar syndrome in other family members suggested an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern of inheritance .
The progressive neurologic degenerative condition associated with this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> , partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> may be misdiagnosed as MS or spinocerebellar degeneration .
Search for a few relevant candidate genes was unrevealing .
A genome-wide search to determine the molecular etiology can be undertaken if other similar cases are identified .
Two brothers with Burn-McKeown syndrome .
We report on two brothers with normal intelligence , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> , and a characteristic pattern of facial dysmorphic features consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lower lid coloboma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent nasal bridge <END> , small mouth with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin lips <END> , and protruding ears .
These features show striking similarity to patients with Burn-McKeown syndrome [ Burn et al. , 1992 Clin .
Dysmorphol 1 : 137-144 ] and confirm the existence of this rare condition .
These brothers show some additional features that were not previously reported in patients with this syndrome including median <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> with oronasal fistula , <START:PHENOTYPE> preauricular tag <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomimic face <END> , and hypoplastic unilateral kidney , thus indicating that the clinical spectrum of this entity is broader .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nonketotic hyperglycinemia <END> : treatment with diazepam--a competitor for glycine receptors .
Two female infants with <START:PHENOTYPE> nonketotic hyperglycinemia <END> ( NKH ) were treated with diazepam for the control of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
The first infant had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , lethargy , and respiratory distress in the first 24 hours of life .
The diagnosis of NKH was made at 3 weeks of age and she was then placed on a regimen of strychnine and a low-protein diet .
Strychnine therapy was discontinued after three months of treatment because there was no improvement in the <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> control or in the patient 's condition .
At 5 months of age the patient was referred to our clinic for further work-up .
The second infant had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , hypotonia , and respiratory distress shortly after birth .
She was treated with phenobarbital and diphenylhydantoin , which had no effect on her <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
The baby was referred to our clinic at 8 months of age and diagnostic studies revealed NKH .
All previous medications were stopped and both infants were placed on diazepam , a competitor for glycine receptors in the CNS .
Choline and folic acid were added for one-carbon unit transfer and sodium benzoate to bind excessive glycine .
Both infants responded to this treatment with cessation of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ; they became more responsive and alert , and their EEGs showed remarkable improvement despite the persistence of elevated glycine levels in plasma , CSF , and urine .
Diazepam as a competitor for the receptors of glycine may prove helpful in controlling the intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> associated with NKH .
Monosomy 1p36 deletion syndrome .
Monosomy 1p36 results from a heterozygous deletion of the most distal chromosomal band on the short arm of chromosome 1 . Occurring in approximately 1 in 5 ,000 live births , monosomy 1p36 is the most common terminal deletion observed in humans .
Monosomy 1p36 is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , hearing impairment , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , growth impairment , hypotonia , and heart defects .
The syndrome is also characterized by several distinct dysmorphic features , including <START:PHENOTYPE> large anterior fontanels <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deep-set eyes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nose <END> and nasal bridge , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pointed chin <END> .
Several genes have been proposed as causative for individual features of the phenotype .
In addition , based upon molecular characterization of subjects with monosomy 1p36 , several mechanisms for the generation and stabilization of terminal deletions have been proposed .

Evidence for a <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> susceptibility locus on the X chromosome .
Over 200,000 new <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> cases are diagnosed in the United States each year , accounting for more than 35 % of all cancer cases affecting men , and resulting in 40,000 deaths annually .
Attempts to characterize genes predisposing to <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> have been hampered by a high phenocopy rate , the late age of onset of the disease and , in the absence of distinguishing clinical features , the inability to stratify patients into subgroups relative to suspected genetic locus heterogeneity .
We previously performed a genome-wide search for hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> ( HPC ) genes , finding evidence of a <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> susceptibility locus on chromosome 1 ( termed HPC1 ; ref . 2 ) . Here we present evidence for the location of a second <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> susceptibility gene , which by heterogeneity estimates accounts for approximately 16 % of HPC cases .
This HPC locus resides on the X chromosome ( Xq27-28) , a finding consistent with results of previous population-based studies suggesting an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> mode of HPC inheritance .
Linkage to Xq27-28 was observed in a combined study population of 360 <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> families collected at four independent sites in North America , Finland and Sweden .
A maximum two-point lod score of 4.6 0 was observed at DXS1113 , theta= 0.26 , in the combined data set .
Parametric multipoint and non-parametric analyses provided results consistent with the two-point analysis .
Significant evidence for genetic locus heterogeneity was observed , with similar estimates of the proportion of linked families in each separate family collection .
Genetic mapping of the locus represents an important initial step in the identification of an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> gene implicated in the aetiology of HPC .
Optimized allotopic expression of the human <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> ND4 prevents blindness in a rat model of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> dysfunction .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> diseases due to mutations in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA can no longer be ignored in most medical areas .
With prevalence certainly higher than one in 6000 , they probably represent the most common form of metabolic disorders .
Despite progress in identification of their molecular mechanisms , little has been done with regard to therapy .
We have recently optimized the allotopic expression for the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genes ATP6 , ND1 , and ND4 and obtained a complete and long-lasting rescue of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> dysfunction in the human fibroblasts in which these genes were mutated .
However , biosafety and benefit to <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> function must be validated in animal models prior to clinical applications . To create an animal model of Leber Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> Optic Neuropathy <END> ( LHON) , we introduced the human ND4 gene harboring the G11778A mutation , responsible of 60 % of LHON cases , to rat eyes by in vivo electroporation .
The treatment induced the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs ) , which were 40% less abundant in treated eyes than in control eyes .
This deleterious effect was also confirmed in primary cell culture , in which both RGC survival and neurite outgrowth were compromised .
Importantly , RGC loss was clearly associated with a decline in visual performance .
A subsequent electroporation with wild-type ND4 prevented both RGC loss and the impairment of visual function .
Hence , these data provide the proof-of-principle that optimized allotopic expression can be an effective treatment for LHON , and they open the way to clinical studies on other devastating <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disorders .
Cancer incidence in persons with Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> . Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> ( FA ) is an autosomal recessive condition associated with congenital abnormalities , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> , and a predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> and solid tumors .
We studied a retrospective cohort of North American patients with FA .
We calculated relative risks of cancer compared to the general population and cause-specific hazards of the first major adverse outcomes of FA : bone marrow transplantation ( BMT) for marrow complications , acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> ( AML) , solid tumors , or death from bone marrow failure .
We also estimated the cumulative incidence of each adverse event in the presence of the competing risks .
Among 145 patients with FA , 9 developed <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> and 14 developed a total of 18 solid tumors .
The ratio of observed to expected cancers ( O/E ratio ) was 50 for all cancers , 48 for all solid tumors , and 785 for <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> ; these increased risks were statistically significant .
The highest solid tumor O/E ratios were 4317 for vulvar cancer , 2362 for esophageal cancer , and 706 for head and neck cancer .
Cause-specific hazards of both death and AML peaked at 1% /y in teenage years ; the hazard of BMT peaked at 4% /y at age 7 . In contrast , the hazard of a solid tumor approached 8%/y by age 40 years .
The cumulative incidence to age 48 was 10 % for <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> , 11 % for death from marrow failure , 29% for a solid tumor , and 43 % for BMT.
The risk of a solid tumor may become even higher as death from aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> is reduced and as patients survive longer after BMT.
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> : advances in genetic research .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> Spastic Paraplegia <END> Working group .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( HSP ) is a diverse group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive lower-extremity spasticity and <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> .
Insight into the genetic basis of these disorders is expanding rapidly .
Uncomplicated <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , and X-linked HSP are genetically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> : different genes cause clinically indistinguishable disorders .
A locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> HSP is on chromosome 8q . Loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> HSP have been identified on chromosomes 2p , 14q , and 15 q .
One locus ( Xq22 ) has been identified for X-linked , uncomplicated HSP and shown to be due to a proteolipoprotein gene mutation in one family .
The existence of HSP families for whom these loci are excluded indicates the existence of additional , as yet unidentified HSP loci .
There is marked clinical similarity among HSP families linked to each of these loci , suggesting that gene products from HSP loci may participate in a common biochemical cascade , which , if disturbed , results in axonal degeneration that is maximal at the ends of the longest CNS axons .
Identifying the single gene defects that cause HSPs distal axonopathy may provide insight into factors responsible for development and maintenance of axonal integrity .
We review clinical , genetic , and pathologic features of HSP and present differential diagnosis and diagnostic criteria of this important group of disorders .
We discuss polymorphic microsatellite markers useful for genetic linkage analysis and genetic counseling in HSP .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Diabetes mellitus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> : a study of Wolfram syndrome in the Lebanese population .
Wolfram syndrome ( WFS ) is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disorder also known as DIDMOAD ( <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and deafness ) .
WFS seems to be a heterogeneous disease that has not yet been fully characterized in terms of clinical features and pathophysiological mechanisms because the number of patients in most series was small .
In this study we describe 31 Lebanese WFS patients belonging to 17 families ; this , to our knowledge , is the largest number of patients reported in one series so far .
Criteria for diagnosis of WFS were the presence of insulin-dependent <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> unexplained by any other disease .
Central <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> was found in 87 % of the patients , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> confirmed by audiograms was present in 64.5 % . Other less frequent features included neurological and psychiatric abnormalities , urodynamic abnormalities , limited joint motility , cardiovascular and gastrointestinal autonomic neuropathy , hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in males , and diabetic microvascular disease .
New features , not reported in previous descriptions , such as heart malformations and anterior pituitary dysfunction , were recognized in some of the patients and participated in the morbidity and mortality of the disease .
Genetic analysis revealed WFS1 gene mutations in three families ( 23.5% ) , whereas no abnormalities were detected in mitochondrial DNA .
In conclusion , WFS is a devastating disease for the patients and their families .
More information about WFS will lead to a better understanding of this disease and hopefully to improvement in means of its prevention and treatment .
Variant of TYR and autoimmunity susceptibility loci in generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> .
Generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> is an autoimmune disease characterized by melanocyte loss , which results in patchy depigmentation of skin and hair , and is associated with an elevated risk of other autoimmune diseases .
To identify generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> susceptibility loci , we conducted a genomewide association study .
We genotyped 579 ,146 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 1514 patients with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> who were of European-derived white ( CEU ) ancestry and compared the genotypes with publicly available control genotypes from 2813 CEU persons .
We then tested 50 SNPs in two replication sets , one comprising 677 independent CEU patients and 1106 CEU controls and the other comprising 183 CEU simplex trios with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> and 332 CEU multiplex families .
We detected significant associations between generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> and SNPs at several loci previously associated with other autoimmune diseases .
These included genes encoding major-histocompatibility-complex class I molecules ( P=9.05x10( -23) ) and class II molecules ( P=4.50x10( -34) ) , PTPN22 ( P=1.31x10( -7) ) , LPP ( P=1. 01x10( -11) ) , IL2RA ( P=2.78 x10( -9) ) , UBASH3A ( P=1.26x10( -9) ) , and C1QTNF6 ( P=2.21x10( -16) ) .
We also detected associations between generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> and SNPs in two additional immune-related loci , RERE ( P=7. 07x10( -15 ) ) and GZMB ( P=3.44x10( -8) ) , and in a locus containing TYR ( P=1.60x10( -18) ) , encoding tyrosinase .
We observed associations between generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> and markers implicating multiple genes , some associated with other autoimmune diseases and one ( TYR ) that may mediate target-cell specificity and indicate a mutually exclusive relationship between susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> and susceptibility to melanoma .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Pontocerebellar hypoplasia <END> type III ( CLAM ) : extended phenotype and novel molecular findings .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pontocerebellar hypoplasia <END> ( PCH ) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by abnormally small cerebellum and brainstem .
Recently a rare , novel form of PCH has been reported called cerebellar atrophy with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( CLAM ) .
Here we report a second family of CLAM with additional phenotypic features and novel molecular findings .
Th ree-year old index patient had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
Her cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed hypoplasia of the cerebellum , brainstem and cerebrum associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of the corpus callosum <END> .
Brainstem auditory evoked potentials revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> and visual evoked potentials confirmed the optic atrophy.
She also had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> with two posterior epileptic foci on electroencephalogram .
Molecular analysis revealed a homozygous haplotype between the markers D7S802 and D7S630 within the originally linked region , narrowing the critical region from 20 Mb to 7 Mb .
Two highly relevant candidate genes , CROT and SLC25A40 located in this region were sequenced , but no causative mutations identified .
Our case provides additional clinical characteristics on the previously described features of this new entity , and reducing the critical region will now allow systematic positional cloning efforts to identify the causative gene .
A syndrome characterized by contractures and pterygia of upper body associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and distinctive face in an Arabic family .
A large Moslem Arabic family from the North of Israel is presented in which nine individuals are affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> ( 5th centile and below ) , variable pterygium of neck or short neck with limited range of motion , pterygium of elbows , short palms , and brachydactyly . Other abnormalities of the fingers include <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> , camptodactyly , and/or hypermobility of the small joints .
The face typically appeared long and myopathic .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ptosis <END> was present with <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , facial movements were reduced and the midface was flat .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Umbilical hernia <END> was present together with hypoplasia of the skin in the periumbilical area .
The lower body region was unaffected in this family .
The family is characterized by multiple consanguineous marriages , and the pedigree is consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
The phenotype seems to be distinct from other multiple pterygium syndromes because the lower limbs are spared , and the <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> with hypoplastic skin has not been described previously .
Gerstmann-StrÃ¤ussler-Scheinker disease . I . Extending the clinical spectrum .
We present the clinical findings in affected members of a large kindred with Gerstmann-StrÃ¤ussler-Scheinker disease . Sixty-four patients exhibited progressive ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , and parkinsonian features .
Inheritance appears to be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> .
Impaired smooth-pursuit eye movements , defective short-term memory , clumsiness of the hands , and ataxia of gait develop in the late 30s to early 60s .
Eye movement abnormalities are characteristic of cerebellar dysfunction .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dementia <END> progresses gradually over several years .
Later , <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> bradykinesia <END> appear and , at this stage , there is often <START:PHENOTYPE> psychosis <END> or severe <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> with rapid <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> .
Death occurs in 6 months to 2 years after onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> .
Magnetic resonance imaging in 2 affected individuals showed cerebellar atrophy.
There is decreased T2 signal in the basal ganglia , consistent with iron deposition .
Progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> : dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy ( DRPLA ) in childhood .
A 22-year-old female with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ( PME ) considered to be due to hereditary dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy ( DRPLA ) was reported .
Some of her family members showed progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> , with variation of onset from childhood to adult life , which suggested that they had been suffering from DRPLA .
CT scan and MRI studies , including some on family members , revealed cerebral and cerebellar atrophy accompanied by dilatation of the fourth ventricle , compatible with the findings in DRPLA reported previously .
We emphasize that a detailed family history may be essential in dealing with a PME patient and that DRPLA should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the PME syndrome with onset in childhood , in Japan .
The Andermann syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and progressive sensorimotor neuronopathy.
Andermann et al . described in 1972 an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> inherited syndrome which associates <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deficiency <END> , and a peripheral motor deficit .
We had the opportunity to study in detail 15 patients affected by this syndrome .
As in the cases previously reported , the families of these children all originated from Charlevoix County and the Saguenay-Lac St-Jean area in the Province of Quebec .
Clinically , these patients have a characteristic facies and moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> associated with a progressive motor neuropathy leading to loss of ambulation by adolescence and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
In 13 of these 15 patients , neuroradiological investigation has shown either total or partial <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> .
In every patient in whom these tests were done , sensory nerve action potentials were absent and motor nerve conduction velocities reduced .
We also found neurogenic abnormalities both on EMG and neuromuscular biopsies .
These abnormalities are similar to those described in Friedreich 's ataxia and in hereditary motor and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory neuropathy <END> type II , although in our patients the motor deficit is much more severe than in these diseases .
The pathogenesis of the peripheral nervous system involvement is still unknown since there have so far been no autopsy studies of this syndrome .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> ; clinico-pathological correlations .
The findings are reported in 38 patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
In 10 of the 24 families investigated , a familial incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> was revealed only by routine urinalysis in first-degree relatives .
Where there was either neurosensory deafness of heavy <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> in the patient or family , or a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic renal failure <END> in the family , the patient generally ran a progressive clinical course .
Light microscopy ( LM ) of renal biopsy specimens revealed little abnormality in young children , but segmental glomerular sclerosis was frequently observed in older patients .
The most characteristic change , observed on electron microscopy ( EM ) in 27 out of 31 renal biopsies was complex replication of the lamina densa of the capillary basement membrane , to form a " basket weave " pattern .
Families with and without deafness ( groups 1 and 2 ) were both considered to fall within the spectrum of Alport 's syndrome , although the presence of deafness adversely affected the prognosis .
In contrast , patients from families showing neither deafness , heavy <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> nor <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic renal failure <END> ( group 3 ) ran a non-progressive course .
Their biopsies showed little or no glomerular changes other than attenuation of the lamina densa on EM .
In Alport 's syndrome , deafness , heavy <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , segmental sclerosis and foam cells were not often present before the age of 10 years , whereas the " basket weave " alteration of the lamina densa was found in all three children biopsied under 5 years of age .
We therefore emphasize the importance of EM in the differential diagnosis from benign familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Band-like <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcification <END> with simplified gyration and <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> : a distinct " pseudo-TO RCH " phenotype .
The combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcification <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> is usually seen in the context of intrauterine infection , most frequently due to cytomegalovirus .
Rare familial occurrences have been reported .
We describe five patients-two male-female sibling pairs , one pair born to consanguineous parents , and an unrelated female-with a distinct pattern of band-like <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcification <END> associated with simplified gyration and <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> .
Clinical features include severe post-natal <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and profound developmental arrest .
Testing for infectious agents was negative .
We consider that these children have the same recognizable " pseudo-TO RCH " phenotype inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .

The del(2 )(q32.2q33 ) deletion syndrome defined by clinical and molecular characterization of four patients .
We report four patients with an interstitial deletion of chromosome 2q32-->2q33 .
They presented similar clinical findings including pre- and postnatal growth retardation , distinct facial dysmorphism , thin and <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> and fair built , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , cleft or <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> , relative macroglossia , dacrocystitis , persisting feeding difficulties , <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> broad based gait <END> .
All were severely mentally retarded .
Three patients had a specific behavioral phenotype with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> and motor restlessness , chaotic behavior , happy-personality but with periods of <START:PHENOTYPE> aggression <END> and anxiety , sleeping problems and self-mutilation .
( head-banging ) .
Array CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) allowed us to delineate the deletion size and showed that the four patients share a 8 .1 Mb minimal deleted region .
Reviewing additional nine case reports of patients with similar deletions showed striking phenotypic similarities which enabled the delineation of the 2q32.2q33 syndrome .
Deletion of 2q32 has been also associated with the wrinkly skin syndrome ( WWS ) and isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
Although the patients presented here shared many aspects of WWS , they did not had the wrinkly skin .
All patients had a cleft or <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> , most likely as a result of hemizygosity for SATB2 .
A potential commonly deleted interval of the three patients with behavioral problems , excluding the deletion in the patient without behavioral problems , is at most 0.5 Mb in size harboring only two genes .
Infantile X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> : a new clinicopathologic entity ?
We describe an X-linked disorder of the CNS , characterized by onset , in infancy , of hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , esotropias , and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and by a progressive course leading to death in childhood .
Pathologically , neuron loss and <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> of the dentate nucleus and inferior olive are conspicuous ; involvement of the cerebellar cortex is less prominent .
In the proband , the red nucleus , dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus , and central auditory pathways were severely affected .
The mother of the proband , now 33 , has self-limited episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> for which no other cause is apparent .
The unique heredity , pathology , and clinical picture distinguish this entity from previously described inherited or metabolic ataxias .
Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome associated with renal dysplasia and embryonal tumor : localization of the gene to Xqcen-q21 .
We report 6 affected males in a 5-generation family with x-linked Simpson-Golabi-Behmel ( SGB ) syndrome .
All had pre- and postnatal overgrowth with 2 adult males attaining heights over 195 cm . Other features included " coarse " face with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal root <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , full lips with a midline groove of the lower lip , grooved tongue with tongue tie , prominent mandible , congenital heart defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> supernumerary nipples <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> , large dysplastic kidneys , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , skeletal abnormalities and postaxial hexadactyly .
All affected individuals were of normal intelligence .
One boy died at age 19 months of a <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> .
The putative origin of the gene in this family was the maternal great grandmother of the propositus .
Eight carrier females , who showed varying manifestations of the gene , have been identified .
Anthropometric analysis has identified preliminary characteristic craniofacial dimensions in this syndrome .
Molecular studies have shown a maximal lod score of 2.81 with no recombinants observed for the SGB-DXYS68 pairing , mapping the disorder to Xqcen-Xq21.3 .
Juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome .
A 10-year-old retarded child was seen by an ophthalmologist because of <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> .
Examination of the optic nerve heads revealed cupping consistant with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and initiated a referral .
The appearance of this girl , with flat-broad based thumbs and toes , small head , <START:PHENOTYPE> low set ears <END> , high arched brows , antimongoloid slant to the eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> , associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> suggested the Rubinstein-Tabyi Syndrome .
Gonioscopy revealed a high iris insertion , while tonometry indicated mildly elevated pressures in the right eye .
Examination of the optic nerve heads showed large glaucomatous type cups , more so on the right with compromise of the temporal rim .
Trabeculectomy was effective in controlling the intraocular pressure in the right eye .
The association of juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> with the Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome requires that ophthalmic referral to assess <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> be an essential part of the evaluation .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hiatal hernia <END> in a large five generation family confirming true <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hiatal hernia <END> has only rarely been documented .
To describe the pattern of inheritance of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hiatal hernia <END> within an affected family .
Thirty eight members of a family pedigree across five generations .
All family members were interviewed and investigated by barium meal for evidence of a <START:PHENOTYPE> hiatal hernia <END> .
Twenty three of 38 family members had radiological evidence of a <START:PHENOTYPE> hiatal hernia <END> .
No individual with a <START:PHENOTYPE> hiatal hernia <END> was born to unaffected parents .
In one case direct male to male transmission was shown .
Familial inheritance of <START:PHENOTYPE> hiatal hernia <END> does occur .
Evidence of direct male to male transmission points to an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode of inheritance .
Structure and function of the N-cadherin/catenin complex in <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
To identify in human <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> and normal retinal tissue the type of cadherin , its relationship with cytoplasmic catenins , and its participation in invasion .
The cadherin/catenin complex was characterized in surgical <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> specimens from five patients and human retinas from four donor eyes by immunocytochemistry , flow cytometry , and coimmunoprecipitation with antibodies against N-cadherin , alpha-catenin , and beta-catenin , followed by Western blot analysis or autoradiography.
Y79 and WERI-Rb-1 <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> cell lines serve the evaluation of the cadherin/catenin complex in aggregation and collagen type I invasion in vitro .
The association of the cadherin/catenin complex with the cytoskeleton was examined by an antibody-capping assay .
In <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> and normal retina N-cadherin associated with alpha-catenin and beta-catenin but not E- or P-cadherin .
The N-cadherin/catenin complex formed a regular , linear , and continuous honeycomb pattern in normal retina that was irregular , clustered , and interrupted in <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
The N-cadherin/catenin complex was found also in the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> cell lines WERI-Rb and Y79 , in which it also showed an irregular pattern .
Both cell lines were invasive in collagen type I , and invasion was inhibited by the GC-4 antibody , which functionally neutralizes N-cadherin .
Less GC-4 antibody was needed to inhibit invasion of Y79 cells , which expressed N-cadherin at a lower level , than to inhibit invasion of WERI-Rb-1 cells .
In both cell lines , antibody capping of the N-cadherin/catenin complex indicated that its linkage with the cytoskeleton were weak or absent .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinoblastoma <END> cells , in contrast with normal retina , express an N-cadherin/catenin complex that is irregularly distributed and weakly linked to the cytoskeleton .
In <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , this complex acts as an invasion promoter .
[An OPA3 gene mutation is responsible for the disease associating <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal signs <END> ] .
In 1961 , Garcin et al . described a family with several members affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , and neurological symptoms .
The authors believed this condition to be distinct from other diseases known at that time , e.g . the Behr syndrome , Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome and Friedreich 's ataxia .
This family was followed over a period of 40 years and genes known to be responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> were sequenced .
The G277A mutation of OPA3 gene was responsible for this familial disease .
A new clinical entity is identified : <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , due to a heterozygous mutation of the OPA3 gene , a nuclear gene encoding a mitochondrial protein .
Linkage analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> in Manitoba Mennonite and British Columbia Native kindreds .
A locus ( CPX ) responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> was previously mapped to the proximal long arm of the X chromosome through DNA marker linkage studies in two large kindred : an Icelandic family and a British Columbia ( B.C. ) Native family .
In this study , additional linkage analyses have been performed in the B.C . family and in a newly identified Manitoba Mennonite family with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> .
The Manitoba CPX locus maps to the same region as Icelandic and B.C . CPX . Two-point disease-to-marker linkage analyses in the Manitoba family indicate a maximum lod score ( Zmax ) between CPX and DXS349 ( Zmax = 3.33 at theta = 0.0 ) .
In multipoint linkage analysis , combined data from the B.C . and Manitoba families suggest that the most likely location for CPX is at DXS447 in Xq21.1 ( multipoint Z = 13.5 ) .
The support interval for CPX at DXS447 extends approximately from PGK1 to DXYS1 and includes a newly isolated polymorphic locus DXS11 09 .
The Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome .
The Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome ( GCPS ) is a pleiotropic , multiple congenital anomaly syndrome .
It is rare , but precise estimates of incidence are difficult to determine , as ascertainment is erratic ( estimated range 1-9/1,000,000 ) .
The primary findings include <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , and polysyndactyly .
The polydactyly is most commonly preaxial of the feet and postaxial in the hands , with variable cutaneous syndactyly , but the limb findings vary significantly . Other low frequency findings include central nervous system ( CNS ) anomalies , hernias , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> .
GCPS is caused by loss of function mutations in the GLI3 transcription factor gene and is inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern .
The disorder is allelic to the Pallister-Hall syndrome and one form of the acrocallosal syndrome .
Clinical diagnosis is challenging because the findings of GCPS are relatively non-specific , and no specific and sensitive clinical have been delineated .
For this reason , we have proposed a combined clinical-molecular definition for the syndrome .
A presumptive diagnosis of GCPS can be made if the patient has the classic triad of preaxial polydactyly with cutaneous syndactyly of at least one limb , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> .
Patients with a phenotype consistent with GCPS ( but which may not manifest all three attributes listed above ) and a GLI3 mutation may be diagnosed definitively with GCPS .
In addition , persons with a GCPS-consistent phenotype who are related to a definitively diagnosed family member in a pattern consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> may be diagnosed definitively as well .
Antenatal molecular diagnosis is technically straightforward to perform .
Differential diagnoses include preaxial polydactyly type 4 , the GCPS contiguous gene syndrome , acrocallosal syndrome , Gorlin syndrome , Carpenter syndrome , and Teebi syndrome .
Treatment of the disorder is symptomatic , with plastic or orthopedic surgery indicated for significant limb malformations .
The prognosis for typically affected patients is excellent .
There may be a slight increase in the incidence of developmental delay or <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> .
Patients with large deletions that include GLI3 may have a worse prognosis .

An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> of bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> frontoparietal polymicrogyria <END> maps to chromosome 16q12 .2-21 .
Polymicrogyria is a cerebral cortical malformation that is grossly characterized by excessive cortical folding and microscopically characterized by abnormal cortical layering .
Although polymicrogyria appears to have one or more genetic causes , no polymicrogyria loci have been identified .
Here we describe the clinical and radiographic features of a new genetic form of polymicrogyria and localize the responsible gene .
We studied two consanguineous Palestinian pedigrees with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> of bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> frontoparietal polymicrogyria <END> ( BFPP) , using linkage analysis .
Five affected children had moderate-to-severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> esotropia <END> , and four of the five affected children developed <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Brain magnetic-resonance imaging revealed polymicrogyria that was most prominent in the frontal and parietal lobes but involved other cortical areas as well .
A genomewide linkage screen revealed a single locus that was identical by descent in affected children in both families and showed a single disease-associated haplotype , suggesting a common founder mutation .
The locus for BFPP maps to chromosome 16q12 .2-21 , with a minimal interval of 17 cM . For D16S514 , the maximal pooled two-point LOD score was 3.98 , and the maximal multipoint LOD score was 4.57 .
This study provides the first genetic evidence that BFPP is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder and serves as a starting point for the identification of the responsible gene .
Congenital scalp defects and <START:PHENOTYPE> vitreoretinal degeneration <END> : redefining the Knobloch syndrome .
An apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> vitreoretinal degeneration <END> ( VRD ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> , and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalocele <END> was described in 1971 by Knobloch and Layer [ J Pediatr Ophthalmol 8 :181-184 ] .
Clinical confirmation of the presence of encephaloceles was lacking , and no neuropathologic studies were reported .
We have evaluated a similarly affected family with 2 sibs with <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> , VRD , and occipital scalp defects .
Histologic examination of the scalp defects showed heterotopic neuronal tissue in both instances .
The older girl has had a unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> .
Her other eye and both eyes of the younger sib have so far been treated successfully with prophylactic retinal cryotherapy .
Both children have normal to above normal intelligence .
The family reported by Knobloch and Layer [ 1971 ] and the sibship herein described appear to represent a distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
Analysis of the associated defects suggests an underlying defect in early cephalic neuroectodermal morphogenesis .
Data from these families imply that congenital occipital scalp defects rather than true encephaloceles may , as is true in some cases of Meckel syndrome , accompany Knobloch syndrome .
The presence of a congenital midline scalp defect should alert the clinician to possible underlying central nervous system and/or ocular pathology and should lead to consideration of further diagnostic evaluations and prophylactic measures .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Choroideremia <END> is linked to the restriction fragment length polymorphism DXYS1 at XQ13-21 . <START:PHENOTYPE> Choroideremia <END> ( McK30310 ) , an X-linked hereditary retinal dystrophy , causes night-blindness , progressive peripheral visual field loss , and , ultimately , central blindness in affected males .
The location of <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> on the X chromosome is unknown .
We have used restriction fragment length polymorphisms from the X chromosome to determine the regional localization of <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> by linkage analysis in families with this disease .
One such polymorphic locus , DXYS1 , located on the long arm ( Xq ) within bands q13-q21 , shows no recombination with <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> at lod = 5.78 .
Therefore , with 90 % probability , <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> maps within 9 centiMorgans ( cM ) of DXYS1 .
Another polymorphic locus , DXS11 , located within Xq24-q26 , also shows no recombination with <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> , although at a smaller lod score of 1.54 (90 % probability limit theta less than 30 cM ) .
This linkage with DXS11 , a marker that is distal to DXYS1 , suggests that the locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> is also distal to DXYS1 and lies between these two markers in the region Xq13-q24.
These results provide regional mapping for the disease that may be useful for prenatal diagnosis and , perhaps ultimately , for isolating the gene locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> .
In vivo and in vitro characterization of neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> resulting from a de novo , heterozygous mutation in the Ca2+-sensing receptor gene : normal maternal calcium homeostasis as a cause of secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> in familial benign hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
We characterized the in vivo , cellular and molecular pathophysiology of a case of neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> ( NHPT) resulting from a de novo , heterozygous missense mutation in the gene for the extracellular Ca2+ ( Ca2+(o) )-sensing receptor ( CaR ) .
The female neonate presented with moderately severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> , markedly undermineralized bones , and multiple metaphyseal fractures .
Subtotal parathyroidectomy was performed at 6 wk ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> recurred rapidly but the bone disease improved gradually with reversion to an asymptomatic state resembling familial benign hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> ( FBHH ) .
Dispersed parathyroid cells from the resected tissue showed a set-point ( the level of Ca2+(o ) half maximally inhibiting PTH secretion ) substantially higher than for normal human parathyroid cells ( approximately 1.8 vs . approximately 1. 0 mM , respectively ) ; a similar increase in set-point was observed in vivo .
The proband 's CaR gene showed a missense mutation ( R185Q ) at codon 185 , while her normocalcemic parents were homozygous for wild type ( WT) CaR sequence .
Transient expression of the mutant R185Q CaR in human embryonic kidney ( HEK293 ) cells revealed a substantially attenuated Ca2+(o )-evoked accumulation of total inositol phosphates ( IP) , while cotransfection of normal and mutant receptors showed an EC50 ( the level of Ca2+(o ) eliciting a half-maximal increase in IPs ) 37% higher than for WT CaR alone ( 6.3+ /-0.4 vs . 4.6+ /-0.3 mM Ca2+(o) , respectively ) .
Thus this de novo , heterozygous CaR mutation may exert a dominant negative action on the normal CaR , producing NHPT and more severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> than typically seen with FBHH .
Moreover , normal maternal calcium homeostasis promoted additional secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> in the fetus , contributing to the severity of the NHPT in this case with FBHH .
Heritable essential tremor-idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> normal pressure hydrocephalus <END> ( ETI NPH ) .
In this report , we identified a large five-generation distinctive kindred with essential <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> ( ET) presenting during the teen years and the consequent appearance of idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> normal pressure hydrocephalus <END> ( iNPH ) when elderly ( >65 years ) , in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion .
Through clinical and genetic analysis , we defined this kindred as a new essential tremor-idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> normal pressure hydrocephalus <END> ( ETI NPH ) disorder .
One of the most common neurological disorders , ET comprises uncontrollable <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , most commonly the upper limbs .
Molecular genetic studies in hereditary ET have been initiated , but only with negative results so far . iNPH is an adult-onset hydrocephalus characterized by ventricular enlargement in the absence of significant elevations of intracranial pressure .
iNPH patients usually have a triad of clinical symptoms : gait impairment , incontinence , and dementia , which is among the most common medical problems in the older population .
The genetic etiology of iNPH is totally unknown .
We hypothesize that ET is the consequence of the abnormal function of a specific neuronal gene , and that the same gene causes <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> at an early age eventually leading to the development of iNPH later in life .
An understanding of the genetic components of this disorder may offer us significant insights into the molecular pathogenesis of ET, iNPH , and other related neurological conditions .
In our genetic analysis of this family , array-based comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH ) was carried out , and we could not identify any possible copy number changes of the genomic fragment along the whole-genome in ETINPH patient .
Candidate gene linkage analysis was also performed , and we excluded this disorder from several established loci associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> .
We conclude that the pedigree reported here is a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> genetic disorder ETI NPH .
The characterization of the gene that causes ETINPH will certainly enhance our understanding of motor diseases in general .
New <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome with short stature and facio-auriculo-thoracic malformations .
Two sibs , a boy and a girl , from a Lebanese consanguineous family presented with short stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , small , dysplastic , <START:PHENOTYPE> low set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , and pectum excavatum and carinatum .
In addition , the boy had a <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> , a cardiac malformation , and at the X-rays an absence of fusion of the posterior hemi-arches of C7 and a fusion between L5 and S1 with a sagittal-cleft vertebral body of L5 , while his sister had a cleft lip/palate and at the X-rays an <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal odontoid peg <END> and a malformation of the articular facets between C1 and C2 , and bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical ribs <END> . Other laboratory and radiological investigations were normal .
Sequencing of PTPN11 exons 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 12 , and 13 did not reveal any variations .
Two other sibs presented almost the same dysmorphic features ; one girl died at age 6( 1/4 ) years after an acute episode of renal insufficiency , and one boy died at 40 days of age .
Differential diagnosis is discussed and the possibility of the report of a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome with variable expressivity is raised .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Sensory ataxic neuropathy <END> as the presenting feature of a novel mitochondrial disease .
Four unrelated patients presented with a severe <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory ataxic neuropathy <END> in association with <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
Electrophysiologic and pathologic studies showed severe axonal loss disproportionately affecting sensory nerves .
Molecular genetic analysis revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions <END> in muscle and peripheral nerve .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Sensory ataxic neuropathy <END> may be the predominant and presenting manifestation of a mitochondrial disorder , and a mitochondrial etiology should be included in its differential diagnosis .
The triad of <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory ataxic neuropathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , and ophthalmoparesis ( SANDO ) may represent a novel mitochondrial disease associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions <END> .
Localization of a susceptibility locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> on chromosome 5 . <START:PHENOTYPE> Schizophrenia <END> is a common disorder with a life time prevalence of approximately 1 per cent .
The illness often develops in young adults , who were previously normal , and is characterized by a constellation of symptoms including <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> delusions <END> ( psychotic symptoms ) and symptoms such as severely inappropriate emotional responses , a disorder of thinking and concentration , erratic behaviour as well as <START:PHENOTYPE> social and occupational deterioration <END> .
A considerable proportion of the variance in the liability to develop <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> may be genetic , but segregation analysis , to establish a mode of transmission , has not produced a consistent result .
One of these studies was carried out in Iceland and made use of the large family size and extensive geneaological information present in that country .
Here we demonstrate genetic linkage of two DNA polymorphisms on the long arm of human chromosome 5 to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> in seven British and Icelandic families with multiple affected members .
The results indicate the existence of a gene locus with a dominant schizophrenia-susceptibility allele .
Inheritance of the allele in the families studied suggests that it may also predispose to psychiatric conditions such as <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> spectrum disorders and a variety of other disorders .
This report provides the first strong evidence for the involvement of a single gene in the causation of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Sibship with 17- ketosteroid reductase ( 17- KSR ) deficiency and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> .
Lack of linkage of histocompatibility leucocyte antigen and 17- KSR loci .
A family with nine children , three with <START:PHENOTYPE> male pseudohermaphroditism <END> due to testicular deficiency of 17- ketosteroid reductase activity ( 17- KSR ) and four with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> is presented .
The three subjects with 17- KSR deficiency were raised as females until puberty , at which time they assumed a male gender role .
Only one developed <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> .
Laparotomy on one of the three patients revealed normal epididymi and vas deferens with absence of Mullerian structures .
Testicular biopsy in all three showed Leydig cell hyperplasia , hyalinization of the tubular basement membrane , normal Sertoli cells and maturational arrest at the spermatogonial stage .
The endocrine profile in peripheral blood revealed markedly increased plasma androstenedione concentrations but normal testosterone , dihydrotestosterone , progesterone , 17-hydroxyprogesterone , and dehydroepiandrosterone .
The levels of estradiol and estrone and of LH and FSH were elevated .
Genital skin fibroblasts from the three patients exhibited normal dihydrotestosterone-binding activity and 5 alpha-reductase activity .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> affected one of the three siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> male pseudohermaphroditism <END> .
All four hypothyroid patients had thyroid enlargement and significant titers of circulating antithyroglobulin but not antithyroid microsomal antibodies .
Neither the locus for the 17- KSR enzyme nor that for congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> were linked to the histocompatibility leucocyte antigen complex in this sibship .
Transmission of the trait for both congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> and 17- KSR deficiency appeared to be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome .
The clinical spectrum in a series of 50 patients .
International Hyper-IgD Study Group .
We studied 50 patients ( 28 male and 22 female ) with the hyper-IgD and periodic fever syndrome .
Most patients originated from Europe , namely The Netherlands ( 28 cases ; 56% ) , France (1 0 cases , 20% ) , and Italy ( 3 cases , 6% ) , but 1 patient was from Japan .
A hereditary component is suggested by 18 patients coming from 8 families .
The syndrome is typified by a very early age at onset ( median , 0.5 years ) and life-long persistence of periodic fever .
Characteristically , attacks occur every 4-8 weeks and continue for 3-7 days , but the individual variation is large .
Attacks feature high spiking fever , preceded by chills in 76 % of patients .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lymphadenopathy <END> is commonly present ( 94 % of patients ) .
During attacks , 72 % of patients complained of abdominal pains , 56 % of <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , 82 % of <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , and 52 % of <START:PHENOTYPE> headache <END> .
Joint involvement is common in the hyper-IgD syndrome with poly-arthralgia in 80% and a non-destructive <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , mainly of the large joints ( knee and ankle) , in 68 % of patients .
Eighty-two percent of patients reported skin lesions with some attacks ; these demonstrated <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> histologically .
Serositis has been seen in only 3 patients ( 6% ) , while <START:PHENOTYPE> amyloidosis <END> has not been recorded in any of the patients with this syndrome .
Immunizations precipitated attacks in 54 % of patients .
All patients had a persistently elevated serum IgD level ( > 100 U/mL ) , and in 82 % of cases the serum IgA was likewise elevated .
During attacks there is an acute-phase response adjudged by <START:PHENOTYPE> leukocytosis <END> , neutrophilia , and increased ESR .
The etiology remains to be elucidated , and treatment is supportive .
The hyper-IgD syndrome is distinct from other periodic fever syndromes like systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , adult-onset Still disease , and familial Mediterranean fever .
Spectrum of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( HSAS ) , MASA syndrome , and complicated <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( SPG1 ) : Clinical review with six additional families .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( HSAS ) ( MIM *307000) , MASA syndrome ( MIM *303350 ) , and complicated <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( SPG1 ) ( MIM *312900 ) are closely related .
Soon after delineation , SPG1 was incorporated into the spectrum of MASA syndrome .
HSAS and MASA syndrome show great clinical overlap ; DNA linkage analysis places the loci at Xq28 .
In an increasing number of families with MASA syndrome or HSAS , mutations in L1CAM , a gene located at Xq28 , have been reported .
In order to further delineate the clinical spectrum , we studied 6 families with male patients presenting with MASA syndrome , HSAS , or a mixed phenotype .
We summarized data from previous reports and compared them with our data .
Clinical variability appears to be great , even within families .
Problems in genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis , the possible overlap with X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> corpus callosum agenesis <END> and FG syndrome , and the different forms of X-linked complicated <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> are discussed .
Since <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> are found in 90 % of the patients , the condition may be present in males with nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We propose to abandon the designation MASA syndrome and use the term HSAS/MASA spectrum , incorporating SPG1 .
Adams-Oliver syndrome : further evidence of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> variant .
Adams-Oliver syndrome is characterized by aplasia cutis congenita and variable degrees of terminal transverse limb defects . Other associated anomalies were described in the syndrome .
Most described cases follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance .
Sporadic and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> cases , however , were reported .
In this study , we report on three Egyptian patients with Adams-Oliver syndrome from three different families .
The parents were normal and consanguineous in all three families .
There was history of similarly affected sibs for two cases .
These findings denote <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
The reported cases had typical skull and limb anomalies with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis marmorata <END> telangiectatica congenita .
We observed additional rare manifestations in the form of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , eye anomalies and atrophic skin lesions .
MRI of the brain in one of the studied cases revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> retrocerebellar cyst <END> and mild asymmetrical cerebellar hypoplasia , which to our knowledge , were not previously reported in Adams-Oliver syndrome .
The results of this study provide further evidence of clinical and genetic heterogeneity and support the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> variant of Adams-Oliver syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Palmoplantar keratoderma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dystrophy <END> , and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy : an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant inheritance <END> of a syndrome comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dystrophy <END> , and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy ( HMSN ) was observed in three generations of one family .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nail dystrophy <END> affected the toe and fingernails ; it was present at birth or developed during early childhood .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Palmoplantar keratoderma <END> became apparent in later childhood .
Each subject with <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dystrophy <END> and keratoderma also had clinical or electrophysiological evidence of axonal neuropathy.
Non-specific <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> semidominant <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> by mutations in a Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor .
Non-specific <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MRX ) is a very common disorder which affects approximately 1 in 600 males .
Despite this high frequency , little is known about the molecular defects underlying this disorder , mainly because of the clinical and genetic heterogeneity which is evident from linkage studies .
Recently , a collaborative study using the candidate gene approach demonstrated the presence of mutations in GDIalpha , a Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor encoded by a gene localized in Xq28 , associated with non-specific <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
GDIalpha is mainly a brain-specific protein that plays a critical role in the recycling of Rab GTPases involved in membrane vesicular transport .
The study presented here was designed to assess the prevalence of mutations in the GDIalpha in mentally retarded patients and to discuss the clinical phenotypes observed in affected individuals .
Mutation screening of the whole coding region of the GDIalpha gene , using a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing , was carried out in 164 patients found negative for expansions across the FRAXA GCC repeat .
In addition to the nonsense mutation recently reported in MRX48 , we have identified a novel missense mutation in exon 11 of the GDIalpha gene in one familial form of non-specific <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
In this family ( family R) , all affected males show moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and the <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> semidominant inheritance is strongly suggested by the severe phenotypes in males with respect to mildly affected females or unaffected obligatory carriers .
This study showed that the prevalence of GDIalpha mutations in non-specific <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> could be estimated to be 0.5-1% , and molecular diagnosis and genetic counselling in some cases of non-specific mental handicap can now be provided .
Allan-Herndon syndrome .
I . Clinical studies .
A large family with X-linked mental retardation , originally reported in 1944 by Allan , Herndon , and Dudley , has been reinvestigated .
Twenty-nine males have been affected in seven generations .
Clinical features include <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , athetoid movements , muscle hypoplasia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> clonus <END> , and Babinski reflexes .
The facies appear elongated with normal head circumference , <START:PHENOTYPE> bitemporal narrowing <END> , and large , simple ears .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Contractures <END> develop at both small and large joint .
Statural growth is normal and macroorchidism does not occur .
Longevity is not impaired .
High-resolution chromosomes , serum creatine kinase , and amino acids are normal .
This condition , termed the Allan-Herndon syndrome , appears distinct from other X-linked disorders having mental retardation , muscle hypoplasia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> .
Genotypically defined lissencephalies show distinct pathologies .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lissencephaly <END> is traditionally divided into 2 distinct pathologic forms : classic ( type I ) and cobblestone ( type II ) . To date , mutations in 4 genes , LIS1 , DCX , RELN , and ARX , have been associated with distinct type I <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> syndromes .
Each of these genes has been shown to play a role in normal cell migration , consistent with the presumed pathogenesis of type I <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Based on these data , we hypothesized that all forms of radiographically defined type I <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> independent of genotype would be pathologically similar .
To test this hypothesis , we examined brains from 16 patients , including 15 lissencephalic patients and one patient with subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> .
Of these 16 patients , 6 had LIS1 deletions , 2 had DCX mutations , and 2 had ARX mutations .
In addition , 6 patients had no defined genetic defect , although the patient with subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> exhibited the same pattern of malformation expected with an XLIS mutation .
In all cases , the cortex was thickened ; however , the topographic distribution of the cortical pathology varied , ranging from frontal- to occipital-biased pathology to diffuse involvement of the neocortex .
Although brains with LIS1 deletions exhibited the classic 4-layer lissencephalic architecture , patients with DCX and ARX mutations each had unique cytoarchitectural findings distinct from LIS1 .
Furthermore , 2 of the 5 patients with no known genetic defect showed a fourth type of histopathology characterized by a 2-layered cortex .
Interestingly , the 2 brains with the fourth type of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> showed profound brainstem and cerebellar abnormalities .
In summary , we identified at least 4 distinct histopathologic subtypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> that stratify with the underlying genetic defect .
Based on these data , a new classification for <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> is proposed that incorporates both pathologic and genetic findings .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Macrosomia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , +/- <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and early infant death : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
An Arab girl with <START:PHENOTYPE> macrosomia <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and early infant death is reported .
Four other sibs were similarly affected ; three of them had <START:PHENOTYPE> median cleft palate <END> .
All five sibs showed <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory infections in early life <END> and died either unexpectedly or because of a documented overwhelming infection .
Parental consanguinity and affected sibs of both sexes strongly suggest <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> in this apparently new syndrome .
The syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism : a genetic study of 18 new families and a review .
Among 18 NIH probands with <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( AHH) , seven had affected relatives and three had consanguineous parents .
Both sexes were equally affected and parents were phenotypically normal .
Parental age was not increased .
Cleft lip and palate occurred in both eugonadal and hypogonadal persons , a previously reported association that may represent variable expression of AHH . Diabetes mellitus , usually insulin-dependent , was frequent in probands and their families .
Other common traits included obesity , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> .
All probands were chromosomally normal .
The frequency of some dermatoglyphic traits of probands differed from normal , but no trait was unique to AHH . Segregation analysis of our proband sibships was consistent with a hypothesis of autosomal-recessive inheritance with variable expression .
However , <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> was apparent when previous reports of familial AHH were surveyed .
An X-linked or male sex-limited autosomal-dominant form with unilateral renal agenesis , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and hypotelorism has been observed .
The infrequent reports of direct male-to-male transmission limit characterization of an autosomal-dominant form of AHH .
Our phenotypic analysis suggests that the traits of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , renal anomalies , hypotelorism , diabetes , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> may help to distinguish various forms of AHH , whereas <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , clefts , and obesity appear in several types of families .
At present , genetic counseling is dependent upon establishing inheritance pattern after examination for the known associated anomalies .
Mapping of the familial infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> ( congenital myasthenic syndrome type Ia) gene to chromosome 17p with evidence of genetic homogeneity .
Familial infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder , recently classified as congenital myasthenic syndrome type Ia. Onset of symptoms is at birth to early childhood with significant <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenic weakness <END> and possible <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory distress <END> , followed later in life by symptoms of mild to moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> .
Thirty-six patients of 12 families , seven of them consanguineous , were used to map the familial infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gene .
A combination of linkage search through the genome , DNA pooling and homozygosity mapping were employed resulting in the localisation of this disease locus to the telomeric region of chromosome 17p .
A maximum lod score of 9.28 at theta = 0.034 was obtained between the disease locus and marker locus D17S1537 .
Haplotype analysis showed all families to be consistent with linkage to this region thus providing evidence for genetic homogeneity of familial infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> .
Multipoint linkage analysis mapped the disease gene in the approximately 4. 0 cM interval between marker loci D17S1537 and D17S1298 with a maximum multipoint lod score of 12.07 .
Haplotype analysis and homozygosity by descent in affected individuals of the consanguineous families revealed results in agreement with the confinement of the familial infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> region within the interval between marker loci D17S1537 and D17S1298 .
CMT2C with <START:PHENOTYPE> vocal cord paresis <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and mutations in the TRPV4 gene .
Recently , mutations in the transient receptor potential cation channel , subfamily V , member 4 gene ( TR PV4 ) have been reported in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 2C ( CMT2C) with <START:PHENOTYPE> vocal cord paresis <END> . Other mutations in this same gene have been described in separate families with various skeletal dysplasias .
Further clarification is needed of the different phenotypes associated with this gene .
We performed clinical evaluation , electrophysiology , and genetic analysis of the TRPV4 gene in 2 families with CMT2 C.
Two multigenerational families had a motor greater than sensory axonal neuropathy associated with variable <START:PHENOTYPE> vocal cord paresis <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> vocal cord paresis <END> varied from absent to severe , requiring permanent tracheotomy in 2 subjects .
One family with mild neuropathy also manifested pronounced <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , more than 2 SD below the average height for white Americans .
There was one instance of dolichocephaly .
A novel S542Y mutation in the TRPV4 gene was identified in this family .
The other family had a more severe , progressive , motor neuropathy with sensory loss , but less remarkable <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and an R315W mutation in TR PV4 .
Third cranial nerve involvement and sleep apnea occurred in one subject in each family .
CMT2C with axonal neuropathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> vocal cord paresis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> is a unique syndrome associated with mutations in the TRPV4 gene .
Mutations in TRPV4 can cause abnormalities in bone , peripheral nerve , or both and may result in highly variable orthopedic and neurologic phenotypes .
Familial symptom domains in monozygotic siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> is characterized by a triad of symptom domains ( impaired social interaction , communication deficits , and repetitive behaviors ) that vary significantly in their clinical presentation across the population .
Within families with more than one affected member , however , discrepant findings exist with regard to symptom variability .
Reduced intrafamily variance is of particular importance because it supports an underlying model of genetic heterogeneity in the transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , and the identification of familial clinical subtypes can be used to select more homogeneous samples for linkage analysis in the future .
This study examines whether there are specific features of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> that show decreased variance within 16 families with monozygotic siblings concordant for <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Evidence for familiality was defined as significantly decreased variance of symptom levels within monozygotic siblingships as compared to between siblingships .
Using regression analysis , we demonstrated significant aggregation of symptoms within monozygotic siblingships for two of the three main symptom domains in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> : impairments in communication and social interaction showed significant familiality .
Within the repetitive behavior domain , only the categories of circumscribed interests and preoccupation with part-objects showed reduced variance within siblingships .
In addition , with the exception of a negative association between the social and behavior domains , partial correlation coefficients did not reveal significant associations between the levels of different symptom domains within families , suggesting that the levels of clinical features seen in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> may be a result of mainly independent genetic traits .
Because of presumed genetic heterogeneity and the wide clinical variation seen in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and other pervasive developmental disorders , selecting probands according to specific features known to show reduced variance within families may provide more homogeneous samples for genetic analysis and strengthen the power to detect the specific genes involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .

A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> non-progressive congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> associated with mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and skin abnormalities ( CAMOS ) maps to chromosome 15q24-q26 in a large consanguineous Lebanese Druze Family .
Congenital cerebellar ataxias are a heterogeneous group of non-progressive disorders characterized by hypotonia and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> followed by the appearance of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and often associated with dysarthria , mental retardation , and atrophy of the cerebellum .
We report the mapping of a disease gene in a large inbred Lebanese Druze family , with five cases of a new form of non-progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , and structural skin abnormalities , to a 3.6-cM interval on chromosome 15q24-15q26 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephronophthisis <END> .
Twenty-one patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> are described with a follow-up of one to 16 years ( mean 9.3 years ) .
In 10 patients , there was a familial incidence .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> appears the likely mode of inheritance with a 20 per cent incidence noted ( seven of 35 ) following correction for the bias of ascertainment by removing the probands .
Seven patients had an associated and characteristic retinal degeneration from infancy .
Associated neurologic problems , including mental retardation , seizures and cerebellar ataxis , were also seen in some patients .
Previously described skeletal abnormalities and hepatic fibrosis were not seen in any of our patients .
All presented at an advanced stage of <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic renal failure <END> , usually associated with a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> polydipsia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polyuria <END> from infancy .
Renal cysts were noted in only one of the nine patients in whom tissue was obtained by needle biopsy .
In seven patients in whom tissue was available at nephrectomy or autopsy , cysts were noted in six although only in two were they localized to the medulla .
Eighteen patients have undergone dialysis , and 12 patients have received a renal transplant with no evidence of recurrence of the original disease .
Sixteen patients are still alive .
Many synonyms for <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> have appeared , with medullary cystic disease being the most common .
Our experience suggests that <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> is a common cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic renal failure <END> and has commonly associated nonrenal abnormalities .
Mosaic variegated aneuploidy with multiple congenital abnormalities : homozygosity for total <START:PHENOTYPE> premature chromatid separation <END> trait .
Separation of chromatids of all mitotic chromosomes , here called total <START:PHENOTYPE> premature chromatid separation <END> ( total PCS) , was observed in 67 to 87.5 % of repeated cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes from two unrelated infants .
Also noted was a variety of mosaic aneuploidies , especially trisomies , double trisomies , and monosomies , to be called mosaic variegated aneuploidy .
The infants both showed severe pre- and <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> , profound developmental retardation , uncontrollable seizures , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , hypoplasia of the brain , <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker anomaly <END> , abnormal facial appearance , and bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> .
Patient 1 , a girl , in addition had a <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , multiple renal cysts , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> of the left kidney .
Whereas patient 2 , a boy , had <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous external genitalia <END> .
They both died within 2 years of age .
In the two families of the infants , their parents and three other members showed 2.5 to 47 % lymphocytes with total PCS but without mosaic variegated aneuploidy or phenotypic abnormalities .
Another 10 relatives studied showed 0 to 1 % cells with total PCS and so were judged negative for the total PCS trait .
It was deduced that the total PCS trait in the two families was transmitted in an autosomal-dominant fashion , and the two affected infants were homozygous for the trait .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcornea <END> with myopic chorioretinal atrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly-rotated ears <END> : a distinct clinical syndrome .
To characterize a novel and distinct hereditary clinical syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , myopic chorioretinal atrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly-rotated ears <END> .
Retrospective series of patients referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist (2005-2010 ) and recognized to have <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> ( horizontal corneal diameter <=1 0.5 mm as measured by the IOLmaster [ Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany] ) and myopic chorioretinal atrophy.
Five boys ( 4-1 0 years old ) from four consanguineous and/or endogamous Saudi Arabian families were identified .
Best-corrected visual acuity in the three children older than four years and was 20/6 0 or better ; the two four-year-olds showed central , steady , and maintained fixation in either eye .
Horizontal corneal diameters ranged from 9.8 to 10.5 mm but anterior chambers were not shallow ( 2.66-3.01 mm ) .
In the three unrelated probands , myopic chorioretinal atrophy was severe and associated with a cycloplegic spherical equivalent at least -6.00 diopters ( -6.00 to -13.75 ) and an axial length of at least 25.63 mm ( 25.63-26.84 ) .
In the two affected children who were siblings , myopic chorioretinal findings were milder and associated with less myopia ( - 0.5 0 to -2.5 0 diopters ) and shorter axial lengths ( 22.42-23.69 mm ) .
All five affected children had <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly-rotated ears <END> , which were not present in unaffected relatives .
In one family , the child 's father was also affected ( with both ocular and facial features ) .
The recurrence of these ocular and facial features in four different inbred families suggests that taken together they represent a distinct clinical syndrome caused by recessive mutations in a gene involved in ocular and facial development .
Concomitant loss of dynorphin , NARP , and orexin in <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Narcolepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> is associated with a loss of orexin/hypocretin .
It is speculated that an autoimmune process kills the orexin-producing neurons , but these cells may survive yet fail to produce orexin .
To examine whether other markers of the orexin neurons are lost in <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> .
We used immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to examine the expression of orexin , neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin ( NARP) , and prodynorphin in hypothalami from five control and two narcoleptic individuals .
In the control hypothalami , at least 80% of the orexin-producing neurons also contained prodynorphin mRNA and NARP .
In the patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> , the number of cells producing these markers was reduced to about 5 to 10 % of normal .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Narcolepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> is likely caused by a loss of the orexin-producing neurons .
In addition , loss of dynorphin and neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin may contribute to the symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> .
Arrhythmogenic marker for the sudden unexplained death syndrome in Thai men . Between 1981 and 1988 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a very high incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden death <END> among young male Southeast Asians who died unexpectedly during sleep .
The pattern of death has long been prevalent in Southeast Asia .
We carried out a study to identify the clinical markers for patients at high risk of developing sudden unexplained death syndrome ( SUDS ) and long-term outcomes .
We studied 27 Thai men ( mean age , 39.7+ /-11 years ) referred because they had <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrest <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> , usually occurring at night while asleep ( n=17 ) , or were suspected to have had symptoms similar to the clinical presentation of SUDS ( n=10 ) .
We performed cardiac testing , including EPS and cardiac catheterization .
The patients were then followed at approximately 3-month intervals ; our primary end points were death , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrest <END> .
A distinct ECG abnormality divided our patients who had no structural heart disease ( except 3 patients with mild left ventricular hypertrophy ) into two groups : group 1 ( n=16 ) patients had right bundle-branch block and ST-segment elevation in V1 through V3 , and group 2 ( n=11 ) had a normal ECG . Group 1 patients had well-defined electrophysiological abnormalities : group 1 had an abnormally prolonged His-Purkinje conduction time ( HV interval , 63 + /-11 versus 49+ /-6 ms ; P=.007 ) .
Group 1 had a higher incidence of inducible <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> ( 93 % for group 1 versus 11 % for group 2 ; P=.0002 ) and a positive signal-averaged ECG (92 % for group 1 versus 11 % for group 2 ; P=.002) , which was associated with a higher incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> or death ( P=.047 ) .
The life-table analysis showed that the group 1 patients had a much greater risk of dying suddenly ( P=.05 ) .
Right bundle-branch block and precordial injury pattern in V1 through V3 is common in SUDS patients and represents an arrhythmogenic marker that identifies patients who face an inordinate risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden death <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Genetic heterogeneity <END> among kindreds with Alport syndrome .
Twenty-three kindreds were ascertained through patients at renal clinics at University of Utah Associated Hospitals .
Urinalysis indicated glomerulonephritis in 231 of 997 examined kindred members ; medical records documented kidney disease consistent with glomerulonephritis in 88 unexamined kindred members .
Renal biopsies of 35 persons in a subset of 14 kindreds showed ultrastructural changes and absence of immune phenomena consistent with the diagnosis of Alport syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> End-stage renal disease <END> ( ESRD ) had occurred in 72 ( 49% ) of 148 known affected males and in 13 ( 8% ) of 171 known affected females .
No father-son affected pairs occurred in any of the kindreds ; 84 % of daughters of affected fathers were affected , and 49 % of sons and 48 % of daughters of affected mothers were affected .
One of three phenotypes ( juvenile Alport syndrome with deafness , adult Alport syndrome with deafness , or adult Alport syndrome without deafness or other defects ) occurred in each of the 23 kindreds .
We applied likelihood analysis to test for <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> underlying the phenotypic <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> .
In the first application ( the admixture test) , we tested for the occurrence of two forms of the disease without specifying which kindred had which form ; we found insufficient evidence of admixture .
In the second application ( the predivided-sample test) , we tested for <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> expressed as phenotypic <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> .
Kindreds were successively divided into two subgroups , with admission to the first subgroup dependent upon : (1 ) having greater than or equal to 2 males with ESRD , (2 ) occurrence of deafness in most nephrologically affected male family members , and (3 ) intrakindred mean age of ESRD in males later than age 31 . Weak evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> was found for category (1 ) ; stronger evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> was found for category (3 ) .
Penetrance of <START:PHENOTYPE> microscopic hematuria <END> in female heterozygotes was estimated as 82 % overall , 85 % for adult Alport syndrome , and 28% for juvenile Alport syndrome .
Homozygosity mapping of Portuguese and Japanese forms of ataxia-oculomotor apraxia to 9p13 , and evidence for genetic heterogeneity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> ( AOA ) is characterized by early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , ocular apraxia , early <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> , late peripheral neuropathy , slow progression , severe motor handicap , and absence of both telangiectasias and immunodeficiency .
We studied 13 Portuguese families with AOA and found that the two largest families show linkage to 9p , with LOD scores of 4.13 and 3.82 , respectively , at a recombination fraction of 0 . These and three smaller families , all from northern Portugal , showed homozygosity and haplotype sharing over a 2-cM region on 9p13 , demonstrating the existence of both a founding event and linkage to this locus , AOA1 , in the five families .
Three other families were excluded from this locus , demonstrating nonallelic heterogeneity in AOA .
Early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> ( EOCA-HA) , so far described only in Japan , is characterized by marked <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> , peripheral neuropathy , mental retardation , and , occasionally , <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> .
Two unrelated Japanese families with EOCA-HA were analyzed and appeared to show linkage to the AOA1 locus .
Subsequently , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> was found in all five Portuguese patients with AOA1 with a long disease duration , suggesting that AOA1 and EOCA-HA correspond to the same entity that accounts for a significant proportion of all recessive ataxias .
The narrow localization of AOA1 should prompt the identification of the defective gene .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> with craniofacial abnormalities : a new subtype of type II?
We report on 5 relatives in 3 generations with an apparent new type of <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> .
These individuals have manifestations of type I <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> , but in addition , have craniofacial anomalies that include facial asymmetry , hypertelorism , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , high nasal bridge , malar hypoplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , highly arched palate , notched chin , and posteriorly angulated ears .
Their intelligence is normal .
Although these manifestations preclude us from placing this family in the type I ( isolated ) <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> category , we also are unable to place them in any of the recognized subtypes of type II <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> .
Thus , we think this family may have a previously undescribed form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant type <END> II <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures <END> , edema , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> : a fatal syndrome in Hutterite and Mennonite kindreds .
We present clinical findings in infants from three kindreds ( two Hutterite and one Mennonite ) with an apparently unique , fatal disorder .
The major manifestations consist of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures <END> , and tense skin which is easily eroded .
The skin is tightly drawn over the face , giving an abnormal appearance consisting of a narrow , <START:PHENOTYPE> pinched nose <END> , small mouth , limited jaw mobility , and ectropion ( in one ) .
One infant had first-degree <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> .
Apart from this , there were no organ malformations and the infants did not have hydrops .
Histologically , the skin showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> .
It is postulated that this is a tissue dysplasia and that all of the clinical effects are secondary .
The disorder appears to be an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
The two Hutterite families are from different endogamous subdivisions .
They are related as fourth cousins once-removed and fifth cousins in multiple ways through the six nearest common ancestors of all four parents .
There are 25 founders ( 11 couples and three individuals ) who are common ancestors .
We computed the probability of joint descent of the four alleles in each pair of parents and in a sample of Alberta Hutterite couples , assuming that each of the common founders in turn was the original carrier .
For an allele from one particular founder couple , there is a relatively greater probability of identity by descent for each pair of parents than on the average for other couples of the same endogamous subdivision .
The importance of autosomal genes in Kallmann syndrome : genotype-phenotype correlations and neuroendocrine characteristics .
Kallmann syndrome ( KS ) consists of congenital , isolated , idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( IHH ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> .
The gene responsible for the <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked form <END> of KS , KAL , encodes a protein , anosmin , that plays a key role in the migration of GnRH neurons and olfactory nerves to the hypothalamus .
In addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> pedigrees , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and recessive kindreds with KS have been reported .
The relative importance of these autosomal vs . <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> genes in producing KS , and the frequency of KAL mutations , are currently unknown because these are rare disorders and large series are unusual .
We examined 101 individuals with IHH ( + /- <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> ) and their families to determine their modes of inheritance , incidence of mutations in the coding sequence of KAL , genotype-phenotype correlations , and [in a subset ( n = 38 ) ] their neuroendocrine phenotype .
Of the 101 patients , 59 had true KS ( IHH + anosmia/hyposmia) ; whereas , in the remaining 42 , no <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> was evident in the patients or their families .
Of the 59 KS patients , 21 were familial , whereas 38 were sporadic cases .
Mutations in the coding sequence of KAL were identified in only 3 of 21 familial cases ( 14% ) and 4 of 38 ( 11% ) of the sporadic cases .
Of the <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> cases confirmed by mutational analysis , only 1 of 3 pedigrees appeared <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> by inspection whereas the other 2 contained only affected brothers .
Female members of known KAL mutation families ( n = 3 ) exhibited no reproductive phenotype and were not anosmic , whereas families with anosmic women ( n = 3 ) were not found to carry mutations in KAL .
Mutations were uniformly absent in nonanosmic IHH probands ( n = 42 ) , as well as in families with both anosmic and nonanosmic members ( n = 2 ) . Overall , 4 novel mutations were identified ( C172 R , R191x , R457x , and delC@L600 ) .
With respect to neuroendocrine phenotype , KS men with documented KAL mutations ( n = 8 ) had completely apulsatile LH secretion , whereas those with autosomal modes of inheritance demonstrated a more variable spectrum with evidence of enfeebled ( but present ) GnRH-induced LH pulses .
Our conclusions are : 1 ) Confirmed mutations in the coding sequence of the KAL gene occur in the minority of KS cases , i.e . only 14 % of familial and 11 % of sporadic cases ; 2 ) The majority of familial ( and presumably sporadic ) cases of KS are caused by defects in at least two autosomal genes that are currently unknown ; 3 ) Obligate female carriers in families with KAL mutations have no discernible phenotype ; 4 ) KAL mutations are uniformly absent in patients with either normosmic IHH or in families with both anosmic and nonanosmic individuals ; and 5 ) Patients with KAL mutations have apulsatile LH secretion consistent with a complete absence of GnRH migration of GnRH cells into the hypothalamus , whereas evidence of present ( but enfeebled ) GnRH-induced LH pulses may be present in autosomal KS cases .
Taken together , these findings suggest that autosomal genes account for the majority of familial cases of KS , and that unique neuroendocrine phenotypes consistent with some GnRH neuronal migration may exist in these patients .
The natural history , including orofacial features of three patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , dermatosparaxis type ( EDS type VIIC ) .
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ( EDS ) dermatosparaxis type ( type VIIC) and the related disease of cattle dermatosparaxis , are recessively inherited connective tissue disorders , caused by a deficient activity of procollagen I N-proteinase , the enzyme that excises the N-terminal propeptide in procollagen type I , type II , and type III.
Although well documented in cattle , to date only seven human cases have been recorded , most of them aged under 2 years .
We document the natural history of three patients with EDS dermatosparaxis type , two of whom have been reported before the age of 2 years , and one new patient .
The phenotype of the patients , and especially the facial resemblance , is striking , making this a clinically recognizable condition .
The most consistent anomalies during the first years of life are premature rupture of the membranes , extreme <START:PHENOTYPE> skin fragility <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> easy bruising <END> , large fontanels , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , puffy eyelids , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short fingers <END> .
Joint hypermobility becomes more important with age .
The children are at risk for rupture of internal organs due to soft tissue fragility , as is illustrated by different internal events in two of the three patients described here .
Orofacial features include <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal open bite <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> with varying degrees of hyperkeratosis .
The deciduous dentition shows abnormal morphology of the molars , obliteration of the tooth pulp , and severe enamel attrition .
The permanent dentition shows agenesis and microdontia of several teeth .
Tooth discoloration , dysplastic roots , and tooth pulp obliteration are present in a restricted number of permanent teeth .

Spastin mutations are frequent in sporadic spastic paraparesis and their spectrum is different from that observed in familial cases .
SPG4 encodes spastin , a member of the AAA protein family , and is the major gene responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> .
It accounts for 10-40% of families with pure ( or eventually complicated ) hereditary spastic paraparesis ( HSP ) .
To assess the frequency of SPG4 mutation in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> but without family histories .
146 mostly European probands with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> were studied (103 with pure <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> and 43 with additional features ) .
Major neurological causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> paraplegia <END> were excluded .
None had a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> paraplegia <END> .
DNA was screened by DHPLC for mutations in the 17 coding exons of the SPG4 gene .
Sequence variants were characterised by direct sequencing .
A panel of 600 control chromosomes was used to rule out polymorphisms .
The overall rate of mutations was 12 % ; 19 different mutations were identified in 18 patients , 13 of which were novel .
In one family , where both parents were examined and found to be normal , the mutation was transmitted by the asymptomatic mother , indicating reduced penetrance .
The parents of other patients were not available for analysis but were reported to be normal .
There was no evidence for de novo mutations .
The mutations found in these apparently isolated patients were mostly of the missense type and tended to be associated with a less severe phenotype than previously described in patients with inherited mutations .
The unexpected presence of SPG4 gene mutations in patients with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> suggests that gene testing should be done in individuals with pure or complicated <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> without family histories .
Unique <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome with fingertip arches and contractures linked to Xq21.31 .
We studied 10 members of a 4 generation Missouri kindred with a dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome with increasing severity in males .
The 21 year-old propositus presented with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , asymmetric face , <START:PHENOTYPE> exotropia <END> , hypogonadism , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> , rocker bottom feet , and 10 low digital arches .
Two brothers and a male cousin had similar features .
The mother , sister , niece , maternal aunt , female cousin , and grandmother were examined and each had 8 to 10 low digital arches .
Five of the women had <START:PHENOTYPE> exotropia <END> and one had pes cavus feet .
Chromosome analysis for fragile X in multiple relatives was normal .
To determine the likelihood that this was an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> syndrome .
DNA from relatives was hybridized to probes which detect 13 different loci spanning the X-chromosome .
A peak LOD score of 2.78 at theta equal to 0.0 was calculated for the syndrome locus and DXYS1 ( pDP34 ) .
The more distal Xq loci showed increasing recombination with the syndrome locus .
These results are consistent with location for this syndrome near Xq21.31 , the chromosomal locus for DXYSI .
Raine dysplasia : a Brazilian case with a mild radiological involvement .
We report a preterm male infant , the first child of a young consanguineous couple , whose physical examination revealed craniofacial disproportion with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> wide fontanelles <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> exophthalmos <END> , low nasal root and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nose <END> , long philtrum , small mouth , high arched and narrow palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , dysplastic , low-set and rounded ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> and , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> .
Postmortem findings included <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic lungs <END> .
Radiological examinations showed mild and localized increased of bone density in the cranial vault and skull base and facial bones and undermodelled in the long bones .
The above findings are characteristics of Raine dysplasia but the case reported here presents a mild bone involvement with only a localized bone sclerosis and absence of prenatal fractures .
We discuss the possibility that this case represents an allelic mutation of the Raine gene .
The consanguinity of the parents reinforces the hypothesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> for this entity .
Phenotypic spectrum of patients with PLA2G6 mutation and PARK14-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> . PLA2G6 is the causative gene for infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy , neurodegeneration associated with brain iron accumulation , and Karak syndrome .
Based on previous reports , patients with PLA2G6 mutations could show axonal dystrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , dementia , and cerebellar signs .
Recently , PLA2G6 was also reported as the causative gene for early-onset PARK14-linked dystonia-parkinsonism .
To clarify the role of PLA2G6 mutation in <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , we conducted mutation analysis in 29 selected patients with very early-onset ( â‰¤ 30 , mean 21.2 Â± 8.4 years , Â± SD ) <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> . These patients had other clinical features ( e.g. , mental retardation/dementia [14/29] , psychosis [15 /29] , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> [11/29] , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> [11/29] ) .
Two novel compound heterozygous PLA2G6 mutations were detected ( patient A : p.F72 L/p.R635Q ; patients B1 and B2 : p.Q452 X/p.R635Q ) .
All 3 patients had early-onset l-dopa-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> with dementia and frontotemporal lobar atrophy.
Disease progression was relatively rapid .
SPECT in patient B1 showed frontotemporal lobar hypoperfusion .
MRI in patient A showed iron accumulation in the substantia nigra and striatum .
Although the clinical presentation of PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration was reported to be homogeneous , our findings suggest patients with PLA2G6 mutation could show heterogeneous phenotype such as dystonia-parkinsonism , dementia , frontotemporal atrophy/hypoperfusion , with or without brain iron accumulation .
Based on the clinical heterogeneity , the functional roles of PLA2G6 and the roles of PLA2G6 variants including single heterozygous mutations should be further elucidated in patients with atypical <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , dementia , or Parkinson disease . PLA2G6 mutations should be considered in patients with early-onset l-dopa-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and dementia with frontotemporal lobar atrophy.
Familial benign <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> ( hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> ) .
Clinical and pathogenetic studies in 21 families .
Familial benign <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> ( hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> ) was diagnosed in 125 members of 21 families .
The syndrome was generally characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> of symptomless , nonprogressive <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> with normal serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone concentrations , parathyroid glands that had normal gross and histologic features , relatively low urinary excretion of calcium , and failure to achieve normocalcemia after subtotal parathyroidectomy .
Affected persons had normal longevity and no discernible increase in other medical problems except gallstones .
The parathyroid glands were not seen using high-resolution ultrasonography.
Plasma calcitonin and calcitriol levels were normal or low . Skeletal mass was normal as assessed by photon absorptiometry of the radius and lumbar spine , and fractures were not more frequent .
Familial benign <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> or hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> is a distinctive heritable syndrome that should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
De Barsy syndrome--an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , progeroid syndrome .
We report two families with seven siblings with de Barsy syndrome .
Characteristic features include severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , hypermobility with <START:PHENOTYPE> athetoid movements <END> , grimacing , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> , laxity of small joints and brisk deep tendon reflexes , progeroid aspect with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , atrophy of skin with hyperpigmentation , isolated depigmentations , reduction of subcutaneous fatty tissue , translucent vein pattern , short stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> in the young child , <START:PHENOTYPE> large prominent ears <END> with dysplastic helices and corneal clouding or <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
The syndrome probably has <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> associated with facial malformations in Iraqi and Iranian Jews .
A new genetic syndrome .
Fourteen Jewish patients from 10 families of either Iraqi or Iranian origin with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> had associated facial malformations which included an elongated face , <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular prognathism <END> with class III <START:PHENOTYPE> malocclusion <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> .
Other common features were muscle weakness restricted predominantly to <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , weakness of facial and masticatory muscles , and fatigable speech ; mild and <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive course <END> ; response to cholinesterase inhibitors ; absence of antibodies to acetylcholine receptor ; decremental response on repetitive stimulation at 3 Hz but no repetitive compound muscle action potential in response to a single nerve stimulus .
This newly recognized form of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> with distinctive ethnic clustering and associated facial malformations is transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder .
The facial abnormalities may be secondary to the neuromuscular defect or may be primary and unrelated .
Further studies are needed to elucidate the defect in neuromuscular transmission responsible for the pathogenesis of this syndrome .
Sisters with <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> .
The pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> in humans is unknown .
The conditions have been regarded as duplication of sidedness or abnormalities of embryonic curvature .
The resemblance of the abnormalities in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mutation ( iv ) in mice to those in humans with <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> suggest the possibility of a genetic basis for asplenia/polysplenia in humans .
We have studied a family in which two sisters had <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> , one sib pregnancy resulted in abortion , and two sibs and the parents are living and well with no evidence of the condition .
Documentation of such families will be of value in determining the variations in expression of the condition and possible relationship between <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> .
Genetic heterogeneity in inherited spastic paraplegia associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
We have recently mapped a new rare form of spastic paraplegia complicated by bilateral cataracts , gastroesophageal reflux with persistent vomiting , and amyotrophy to chromosome 10q23.3-q24.2 .
This locus , named SPG9 , is located in an interval spanning about 12 cM of genomic DNA , between markers D10S536 and D10S603 , where different neurological disorders have been mapped .
In particular , a gene for partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> has been assigned to a 3 cM interval between markers D10S185 and D10S577 , which is completely included in the SPG9 critical region .
A few families affected with spastic paraplegia and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> have been reported ; in the present study , we tested a pedigree with concurrence of spastic paraplegia , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait , using markers located in the SPG9 interval .
Haplotype reconstruction excluded the linkage to 10q23.3-q24.2 .
In addition , the seven different loci so far reported to be associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pure forms of spastic paraplegia have been tested and excluded by linkage analysis and haplotype reconstruction , including SPG4 on chromosome 2p22-p21 , where a familial form of spastic paraplegia associated with dementia and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> has been mapped .
These data confirm genetic heterogeneity in familial spastic paraplegia with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and suggest a specific locus for the family here analyzed .

Susceptibility loci for atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> on chromosomes 3 , 13 , 15 , 17 and 18 in a Swedish population .
Atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> is a hereditary , pruritic , inflammatory and chronic skin disease that typically presents in early childhood and may continue or recur later .
The etiology of atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> is unknown , but several lines of evidence indicate that it is a multifactorial disorder caused by the combined influence of genetic and environmental factors , even though the relative contributions of genes and environment are not known .
To identify important loci that contribute to the development of atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> , we conducted a genome-wide linkage analysis with 367 microsatellite markers , using a non-parametric affected relative-pair method in 109 pedigrees .
Three qualitative phenotypes and one semi-quantitative phenotype were studied .
For the phenotype atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> , linkage to chromosome region 3p24-22 was found .
For another phenotype , atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> combined with raised allergen-specific IgE levels , a suggestive linkage was found to chromosome region 18q21 .
For the semi-quantitative phenotype severity score of atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> , suggestive linkage was found to chromosome regions 3q14 , 13q14 , 15q14-15 and 17q21 .
Identifying chromosome regions linked to susceptibility genes for atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> provides a platform from which the search for atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> genes can proceed .
A Greek-American kindred with autosomal dominant , levodopa-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and anticipation .
Interest is increasing concerning the role of genetic factors in the etiology of Parkinson 's disease .
We report the analysis of a Greek-American kindred with levodopa-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
Of the 98 individuals present in six generations of this pedigree , 16 individuals in three successive generations have developed <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
Affected members were examined both in Greece and in the United States .
The clinical presentation consisted of asymmetric <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> resting tremor <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bradykinesia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> postural instability <END> , and symptoms were responsive to levodopa .
The disease appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner .
The inheritance pattern and the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> in successive generations on two continents challenges environmental factors as the primary cause in the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> in this kindred .
Anticipation is present in this pedigree .
The affected members in the third generation developed symptoms at ages 50 to 71 , in the fourth at ages 40 to 55 , and in the fifth at age 31 years .
This is another example of a neurodegenerative disease with autosomal dominant inheritance and anticipation .
A molecular genetic analysis of this pedigree is in progress .
A familial visceral <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> with external <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> transmission .
A new visceral <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> family was identified .
The disease in this family is transmitted by an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> gene .
Only 3 patients were identified from approximately 1500 family members .
All 3 patients are the products of intermarriage .
The patients had gastric atony , dilatation of the entire small bowel , and multiple diverticula throughout .
Pathology of the jejunum showed fibrosis and degeneration , mainly of the longitudinal muscle layer , indistinguishable from that of previously reported families .
Two of the patients also had <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> and external <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> .
Jejunal manometric studies were performed on the proband 's asymptomatic mother and five siblings .
All had normal esophageal manometric studies and upper gastrointestinal x-rays .
The mother and three siblings had abnormal jejunal manometric studies characterized by the absence of phase 1 in some of the migrating motor complexes and increased motility indices in phase 2 .
We conclude that familial visceral <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> can be transmitted by an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> gene , and that jejunal manometry is a sensitive technique to identify asymptomatic heterozygotes .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> marfanoid habitus <END> .
Here we report on two pairs of mildly to moderately mentally retarded brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> marfanoid habitus <END> and similar craniofacial changes .
They had a long and <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small mandible <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypernasal voice <END> , as previously reported by Lujan et al ( Am J Med Genet 17 : 311-322 , 1984 ) in four mentally retarded males of a large kindred .
The present data suggest the existence of a specific type of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> marfanoid habitus <END> .
Absence of PAX6 gene mutations in Gillespie syndrome ( partial <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ) .
The PAX6 gene is expressed at high levels in the developing eye and cerebellum and is mutated in patients with autosomal dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
We have tested the role of PAX6 mutations in three families with Gillespie syndrome , a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition consisting of partial <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of affected individuals revealed no alteration of PAX6 sequences .
In two families , the disease trait segregates independently from chromosome 11p markers flanking PAX6 .
We conclude that Gillespie syndrome is genetically distinct from autosomal dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
Familial benign recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> vertigo <END> .
Benign recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> vertigo <END> ( BRV ) has been previously linked to migraine but there have been no prior studies of families with BRV .
We studied the families of 24 patients who presented to our clinic with BRV and who reported a family history of similar attacks of <START:PHENOTYPE> vertigo <END> .
All probands underwent diagnostic evaluation to exclude identifiable causes of recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> vertigo <END> and they completed a standardized medical questionnaire pertaining to episodic <START:PHENOTYPE> vertigo <END> and the features of migraine .
This questionnaire was also sent to all relatives of the probands who agreed to participate .
Of 220 relatives who returned questionnaires , 37% reported BRV and 5 0 % met the diagnostic criteria for migraine .
By contrast , only one of 43 ( 2% ) unrelated spouses reported BRV and 10 of 43 ( 23% ) met the diagnostic criteria for migraine .
More than two-thirds of relatives with BRV met the diagnostic criteria for migraine and the majority reported that they had a typical migraine headache with at least some of their episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> vertigo <END> .
Both BRV and migraine showed a female preponderance ( more than 2 to 1 ) . Familial BRV seems to be a migraine syndrome , probably inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion with decreased penetrance in men .
In the search for the causative gene , <START:PHENOTYPE> vertigo <END> may be a more useful marker than migraine because recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> vertigo <END> is relatively rare in the general population whereas migraine is very common .
Kartagener 's syndrome and the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> immotile cilia <END> .
Kartagener 's syndrome ( KS ) is a hereditary disease with typical symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> , and chronic infections of the nasal mucosa .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> cannot be doubted on account of repeated observations of affected sibs and parental cansanguinity .
The bronchopulmonary symptoms in sibs , however , cannot be explained by this mode of inheritance .
Recent clinical findings and electron microscope investigations suggest that KS is a special form of manifestation within the <START:PHENOTYPE> immotile cilia <END> syndrome .
This disease combines the typical bronchial and nasal symptoms of KS with sterility in the male due to immotile sperm tails and , as a facultative symptom , <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> .
Thus , sibs with <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> but without <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> are also classified under this syndrome .
The symptoms mentioned are caused by an abnormal morphology of bronchial cilia and sperm tails , which can be demonstrated by electron microscopy .
The dynein arms normally attached to the nine microtubular doublets and providing a normal ciliary movement are lacking .
It is assumed that during early embryonic life ciliary beats in the growing embryo determine the type of laterality .
When ciliary movements are absent laterality may develop fortuitously , thus effecting a <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> in about half the affected cases .
The numerical evaluation of pedigrees from the literature supports this assumption .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Situs inversus totalis <END> and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglossia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypoglossia <END> is a rare congenital malformation , occurring either as an isolated malformation or in association with other deformities , particularly limb defects .
We describe a female infant with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglossia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> .
The main complications were airway compromise and feeding difficulties requiring tracheostomy and gastrostomy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Situs inversus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglossia <END> have been reported together on six previous occasions , with all cases being <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> .
Situs inversus-hypoglossia falls into a spectrum of aetiologically non-specific developmental field defects that includes the Aglossia-adactylia spectrum and the Agnathia-holoprosencephaly spectrum .
Situs inversus-hypoglossia may represent a mild form of Agnathia-holoprosencephaly .
A novel syndrome involving primary skeletal growth and retardation in siblings .
An identical pattern of malformations was found in two brothers both having <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
Additionally , they had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> , and convergent <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> .
There was shortening of either the radius or the tibia and shortening of the first metacarpals .
Persistently dorsally flexed fingers and toes were noted , all of which are unusually long .
Both boys had a <START:PHENOTYPE> high-pitched voice <END> and were unable to communicate verbally at the age of 4.5 years .
They both developed <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
One brother has <START:PHENOTYPE> anal atresia <END> ; the other had a <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary artery atresia <END> , VSD , ASD , and an over-riding aorta .
This apparently new syndrome is possibly an autosomal , or a X-linked recessive trait .
Clinical and <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> nemaline myopathy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> nemaline ( rod ) myopathy is clinically and genetically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> .
A clinically distinct , typical form , with <START:PHENOTYPE> onset in infancy <END> and a non-progressive or slowly progressive course , has been assigned to a region on chromosome 2q22 harbouring the nebulin gene Mutations have now been found in this gene , confirming its causative role .
The gene for slow tropomyosin TPM3 on chromosome 1q21 , previously found to cause a dominantly inherited form , has recently been found to be homozygously mutated in one severe consanguineous case .
Here we wished to determine the degree of genetic homogeneity or <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> nemaline myopathy by linkage analysis of 45 families from 10 countries .
Forty-one of the families showed linkage results compatible with linkage to markers in the nebulin region , the highest combined lod scores at zero recombination being 14 .13 for the marker D2S2236 .
We found no indication of <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> for the typical form of nemaline myopathy.
In four families with more severe forms of nemaline myopathy , however , linkage to both the nebulin and the TPM3 locus was excluded .
Our results indicate that at least three genetic loci exist for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> nemaline myopathy.
Studies of additional families are needed to localise the as yet unknown causative genes , and to fully elucidate genotype-phenotype correlations .
Cytochrome P450 CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism and lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> susceptibility .
We conducted a case-control study of 207 lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> patients and 283 controls to estimate the association of the MspI polymorphism in the cytochrome P450 CYP1A1 gene with lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
The analysis of the CYP1A1 gene polymorphism was performed by RFLP analysis of PCR-amplified DNA .
The association of the CYP1A1 polymorphism with lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> was assessed by logistic regression using the generalized additive modeling technique to adjust for race , education , smoking status , pack years , time since quitting smoking , asbestos exposures , and family <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> history .
The frequencies of the MspI homozygote and heterozygote variant genotypes of CYP1A1 were 1 % and 17% , respectively , in both lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> patients and controls .
A significant association was found between the combined heterozygous and homozygous MspI variant of the CYP1A1 gene and lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> ; the estimated odds ratio was 2.08 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1 .15-3.73 ) .
The association remained significant when we excluded the homozygous MspI variant individuals , the non-Caucasians , or the long-time tobacco quitters , and it was not modified by gender or cumulative cigarette consumption .
In a specific histological cell type analysis , a positive association was found for each subtype of lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> , with no appreciable difference between cell types .
In summary , our study demonstrated that the MspI variant CYP1A1 genotype is significantly associated with an increased risk of lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> among Caucasians with the odds ratio approximately , equivalent to 2 after controlling for important confounding factors .
These results are similar to those obtained from reanalysis of published data on the combined CYP1A1 genotypes in a Japanese population ( combined odds ratio , 1 .95 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 .17- 3.28 ) .
Moreover , the elevated risk is noted in heterozygotes , i.e. , individuals who carry only one copy of the variant gene .
Retinol-binding protein 4 and <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> in lean , obese , and diabetic subjects .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Insulin resistance <END> has a causal role in type 2 diabetes .
Serum levels of retinol-binding protein 4 ( RBP4) , a protein secreted by adipocytes , are increased in insulin-resistant states .
Experiments in mice suggest that elevated RBP4 levels cause <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> .
We sought to determine whether serum RBP4 levels correlate with <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and change after an intervention that improves insulin sensitivity .
We also determined whether elevated serum RBP4 levels are associated with reduced expression of glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) in adipocytes , an early pathological feature of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> .
We measured serum RBP4 , <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , and components of the metabolic syndrome in three groups of subjects .
Measurements were repeated after exercise training in one group .
GLUT4 protein was measured in isolated adipocytes .
Serum RBP4 levels correlated with the magnitude of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> in subjects with obesity , impaired glucose tolerance , or type 2 diabetes and in nonobese , nondiabetic subjects with a strong family history of type 2 diabetes .
Elevated serum RBP4 was associated with components of the metabolic syndrome , including increased body-mass index , waist-to-hip ratio , serum triglyceride levels , and systolic blood pressure and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels .
Exercise training was associated with a reduction in serum RBP4 levels only in subjects in whom <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> improved .
Adipocyte GLUT4 protein and serum RBP4 levels were inversely correlated .
RBP4 is an adipocyte-secreted molecule that is elevated in the serum before the development of frank diabetes and appears to identify <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and associated cardiovascular risk factors in subjects with varied clinical presentations .
These findings provide a rationale for antidiabetic therapies aimed at lowering serum RBP4 levels .

Linkage analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> maturity-onset diabetes of the young <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> ) : genetic heterogeneity and nonpenetrance .
We have analyzed the inheritance of <START:PHENOTYPE> maturity-onset diabetes of the young <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> ) on chromosome 20 in a large multigeneration family , the R.-W . family , and in two other <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> families .
Of the four branches of the R.-W . pedigree which have been studied , two have documented early onset of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM) , while there is no evidence of early onset in the other two branches .
The early-onset branches have apparently inherited the same D20S16 allele from the affected parent , while another D20S16 allele was inherited in the two branches without evidence of early onset .
A test for homogeneity , the M-test , using the results of two-point linkage analysis with D20S16 indicates heterogeneity between early- and late-onset branches of the R.-W . family ( P less than or equal to .014 ) .
In addition , analysis strongly suggests that <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> as expressed in the EDI and WIS families is unlinked to loci on chromosome 20 ( P less than or equal to .018 -.004 ) .
Comparable results are seen when the data are analyzed by the HOMOG program .
Three polymorphic loci-D20S16 , D20S17 , and ADA--show no recombination with the <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> locus when two-point linkage analysis is used in the early-onset branches of the family .
The multipoint lod score in the early-onset branches of the R.-W . family is 10 .16 , with the most likely location being between D20S4 and D20S17 .
Multipoint linkage analysis using the CHROMPICS option of the program CRI-MAP has been used to follow inheritance of the <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> disease locus .
This analysis has identified two cases of possible nonpenetrance in the early-onset branches of the family ( odds of at least 15 6 :1 ) , as determined by the appearance of apparent isolated double crossovers at the <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> locus in these unaffected individuals .
Parastremmatic <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> .
A girl aged ten , of Cape Coloured stock , with typical features of parastremmatic <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> has been investigated .
The clinical manifestations included disproportionate <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> , limb deformity , a short stiff neck , and marked thoracic <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphosis <END> .
The radiographic changes were dramatic , the skeleton having a " flocky " appearance due to patches of radiolucency in an irregular lattice of sclerosis .
The metaphyses and epiphyses of the long bones were grossly expanded , and the vertebrae were flattened and distorted .
The clinical and radiographic features of five other previously reported individuals with parastremmatic <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> were very similar to those of our patient .
The differential diagnosis of this condition includes metatrophic <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> , diatrophic <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> and the spondylo-epiphysial dysplasias .
However , the unique " flocky " radiographic appearance of the bones permits diagnostic precision .
There is some evidence to indicate that parastremmatic <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> might be transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> , although this is by no means certain .
The fact that our patient had seven normal siblings and unaffected parents would be compatible woth autosomal recessive inheritance .
Microcephaly-lymphedema-chorioretinal dysplasia : a unique genetic syndrome with variable expression and possible characteristic facial appearance .
We report on a follow-up examination of a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> .
The finding of <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal dysplasia <END> with variable visual deficit in multiple relatives , which was not previously discovered , supports the concept of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinopathy <END> as being a single <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> genetic entity with variable expression .
We recommend that fundoscopic examination be performed in all patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Chronic pain <END> in Machado-Joseph disease : a frequent and disabling symptom .
Machado-Joseph disease ( MJD ) is one of the most common forms of neurodegenerative <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> characterized by remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity .
Although patients frequently report pain , systematic evaluation of this clinical feature is lacking .
To compare the frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic pain <END> among patients with genetically confirmed MJD , an age - and sex-matched healthy control group , and a disease control group of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) .
We included 70 patients with MJD , 20 patients with ALS , and 70 control subjects from 2 clinical centers .
All individuals underwent assessment with a standardized pain questionnaire .
In addition , we used a visual analog scale to quantify pain intensity .
Thirty-three patients with MJD ( 47% ) , 3 patients with ALS ( 15% ) , and 6 controls ( 9% ) reported <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic pain <END> .
Lower back pain preceded <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> in 6 patients with MJD .
Twenty-nine patients with MJD had daily pain , which was continuous in 23.
The mean visual analog scale score was 6.1 in patients with MJD .
Pain was musculoskeletal in 26 patients with MJD , dystonic in 2 , neuropathic in 2 , and mixed in 3 . Typically , pain was lumbar ( n = 17 ) or in the lower limbs ( n = 15 ) .
We did not find significant differences regarding duration of disease , sex , or severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> among patients with MJD with and without <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic pain <END> .
Expanded ( CAG )(n ) tandem repeats were longer in patients with MJD who experienced <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic pain <END> ( 67 .3 vs 65 .2 ; P = .04 ) .
In our series , pain was significantly more frequent in patients with MJD than in controls .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Chronic pain <END> was a frequent and often disabling complaint among patients with MJD .
The lower back was the most frequently reported location of pain in patients with MJD .
The epidemiology and clinical aspects of the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> in Minnesota .
The frequency of the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> , characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> microangiopathic hemolytic anemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , and renal failure , is increasing .
Although Escherichia coli serotype O15 7 : H7 has been implicated as a causative agent , more information is needed about the basic epidemiology and clinical aspects of this syndrome .
We conducted a retrospective population-based study of <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> in Minnesota residents less than 18 years of age from 1979 through 1988 to assess trends in disease occurrence , describe the clinical illness , and identify predictors of disease severity and outcome .
We also conducted a case-control study of patients with onsets of illness from 1986 through 1988 to examine risk factors .
One hundred seventeen patients were identified .
The mean annual incidence increased from 0.5 case per 100,000 child-years among children less than 18 in 1979 ( 6 cases ) to 2.0 cases per 100,000 in 1988 ( 26 cases ) ( P = 0.000004 ) .
E . coli O15 7 : H7 was isolated from 13 of 28 patients ( 46 percent ) who had stool specimens submitted for testing .
For those who presented with typical <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> , an elevated polymorphonuclear-leukocyte count on hospital admission , a shorter duration of prodrome , and the presence of bloody <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> were predictive of severe disease .
In the case-control study , the patients were more likely to attend large daycare centers ( more than 50 children ) than were the controls ( odds ratio , 10.2 ; P = 0.03) , suggesting that day-care attendance may be a risk factor .
On the basis of the population-attributable risk , however , this factor could account for no more than 16 percent of the cases .
This study provides evidence for an increase in the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> , which is probably related to an increased incidence of E . coli O15 7 : H7 infections .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> has become an important pediatric and public health problem .
Gene for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( <START:PHENOTYPE> maturity-onset diabetes of the young <END> subtype ) is linked to DNA polymorphism on human chromosome 20q . <START:PHENOTYPE> Maturity-onset diabetes of the young <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> ) is a form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus characterized by an early age of onset , usually before 25 years of age , and an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode of inheritance .
The largest and best-studied <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> pedigree is the RW family .
The majority of the diabetic subjects in this pedigree has a reduced and delayed insulin-secretory response to glucose , and it has been proposed that this abnormal response is the manifestation of the basic genetic defect that leads to diabetes .
Using DNA from members of the RW family , we tested more than 75 DNA markers for linkage with <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> .
A DNA polymorphism in the adenosine deaminase gene ( ADA ) on the long arm of chromosome 20 was found to cosegregate with <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> .
The maximum logarithm of odds ( lod score ) for linkage between <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> and ADA was 5.25 at a recombination fraction of 0.00 . These results indicate that the odds are greater than 178 ,000:1 that the gene responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> in this family is tightly linked to the ADA gene on chromosome 20q .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> olivopontocerebellar atrophy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> macular degeneration <END> : a separate entity among the olivopontocerebellar atrophies .
A family with hereditary , neuropathologically confirmed <START:PHENOTYPE> olivopontocerebellar atrophy <END> ( OPCA ) associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> macular degeneration <END> is described .
The mode of inheritance was <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> .
The first symptom was insidious , <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive visual loss <END> caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> macular degeneration <END> .
Another early sign was <START:PHENOTYPE> slow saccades <END> .
Some years after the visual symptoms , gradually progressing cerebellar dysfunction and pyramidal signs developed .
Computed tomography of the brain indicated cerebellar and pontine atrophy.
Finally the patients were blind , due to a severe chorioretinal atrophy , and disabled because af motor dysfunction .
The present study , together with a review of other reported families with OPCA associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> macular degeneration <END> , suggests that this disorder is a specific and clinically recognizable subtype of OPCA .
New <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> multiple congenital abnormalities/mental retardation syndrome with craniofacial dysmorphism <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> , iris colobomas and connective tissue dysplasia .
We report three sibs , one boy and two girls , with a similar MCA/MR syndrome , where parents were first cousins .
They had macrodolichocephaly , an elongated face , apparently low-set simple ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , bilateral " key-hole ' colobomata of the iris , retina and choroid , a beaked nose , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> and dental anomalies .
Brain CT scan showed <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated ventricles <END> and an <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> .
Skeletal anomalies included brachydactyly of the hands and feet , <START:PHENOTYPE> genua vara <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> flat feet <END> .
Two sibs had left ventricular enlargement , and <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic dilatation <END> and regurgitation .
Review of the literature from the London Dysmorphology Data Base ( LDDB ) and OMIM suggests that this family represents a new syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Adult onset <END> familial <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> : report of a family including monozygotic twins .
We report the first family with <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> in which monozygotic twins and multiple family members are affected .
In this family , the disease exhibits an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> pattern , and all affected members have only <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> .
Five members have definite <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> , and five others have possible <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> .
Although identical genotypically , the twins demonstrate some phenotypic variation .
Despite long follow-up , no family members have shown progression from focal to generalized dystonia .
This family may prove valuable in identifying a gene locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> and hence determine whether a single gene locus exists for hereditable focal dystonia and generalized dystonia .
Evidence for a distinct region causing a <START:PHENOTYPE> cat-like cry <END> in patients with 5p deletions .
The cri-du-chat syndrome is a contiguous gene syndrome that results from a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5 ( 5p ) . Patients present with a <START:PHENOTYPE> cat-like cry <END> at birth , which is usually considered diagnostic of this syndrome .
Additional features of the syndrome include failure to thrive , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthal folds <END> , hypotonia , and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We report on four families in which patients with 5p deletions have only the characteristic <START:PHENOTYPE> cat-like cry <END> , with normal to mildly delayed development .
The precise locations of the deletions in each family were determined by FISH using lambda phage and cosmid clones .
All of the deletion breakpoints map distal to a chromosomal region that is implicated with the facial features and severe mental and developmental delay in the cri-du-chat syndrome .
DNA clones mapping in the chromosomal region associated with the <START:PHENOTYPE> cat-like cry <END> feature will be useful diagnostic tools .
They will allow for the distinction between 5p deletions that will result in the severe delay observed in most cri-du-chat syndrome patients and those deletions that result in the isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> cat-like cry <END> feature , which is associated with a better prognosis .
Common breast cancer-predisposition alleles are associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers .
Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer high risks of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
However , evidence suggests that these risks are modified by other genetic or environmental factors that cluster in families .
A recent genome-wide association study has shown that common alleles at single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in FGFR2 ( rs2981582 ) , TNRC9 ( rs3803662 ) , and MAP3K1 ( rs889312 ) are associated with increased <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> risks in the general population .
To investigate whether these loci are also associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers , we genotyped these SNPs in a sample of 10 ,358 mutation carriers from 23 studies .
The minor alleles of SNP rs2981582 and rs889312 were each associated with increased <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers ( per-allele hazard ratio [ HR ] = 1.32 , 95 % CI : 1.20-1.45 , p(trend ) = 1.7 x 10( -8 ) and HR = 1 .12 , 95 % CI : 1.02-1.24 , p(trend ) = 0.02 ) but not in BRCA1 carriers .
rs3803662 was associated with increased <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> risk in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers ( per-allele HR = 1 .13 , 95 % CI : 1.06-1.20 , p(trend ) = 5 x 10( -5 ) in BRCA1 and BRCA2 combined ) .
These loci appear to interact multiplicatively on <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers .
The differences in the effects of the FGFR2 and MAP3K1 SNPs between BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers point to differences in the biology of BRCA1 and BRCA2 <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> tumors and confirm the distinct nature of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in BRCA1 mutation carriers .
The ' CREST ' syndrome .
Comparison with systemic sclerosis ( <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> ) .
The CREST syndrome refers to a disorder comprising the manifestations of <START:PHENOTYPE> calcinosis <END> , Raynaud 's phenomenon , esophageal dysfunction , <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerodactyly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> telangiectasia <END> .
Thirteen CREST patients ( two with CRST) were compared with 26 patients with systemic sclerosis but without the full manifestations of the CRST syndrome .
No significant difference was found between the groups in the age of onset of Raynaud 's phenomenon , degree of multiphasic digital color changes , ulcerations of fingers , <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerodactyly <END> , or in the frequency of abnormal esophageal peristalsis or dysphagia .
Laboratory results were similar , including the frequency of an elevated ESR . However , the CREST patients had a significantly lower frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> arthralgia <END> (54% ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> ( 15% ) than did those with <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> ( 88 % and 65 % , respectively ) .
All but one of the CREST patients were women , which was a greater proportion than found among <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> cases ( 69% ) , and all were white ( P less than .05 ) .
Most patients with the CREST syndrome had rather severe acrosclerosis .
At last evaluation , four patients were chronically ill and three had died .
The CREST and CRST syndromes are closely related disorders that seem to be part of the spectrum of systemic sclerosis .
Clinical and molecular genetic features of <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia .
Most patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> have defects in the gene for bone morphogenetic protein receptor II ( BMPR2) , a member of the transforming growth factor beta ( TG F-beta ) superfamily of receptors .
Because patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia may have lung disease that is indistinguishable from <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> , we investigated the genetic basis of lung disease in these patients .
We evaluated members of five kindreds plus one individual patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and identified 10 cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> .
In the two largest families , we used microsatellite markers to test for linkage to genes encoding TG F-beta-receptor proteins , including endoglin and activin-receptor-like kinase 1 ( ALK1 ) , and BMPR2 .
In subjects with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> , we also scanned ALK1 and BMPR2 for mutations .
We identified suggestive linkage of <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia on chromosome 12q13 , a region that includes ALK1 .
We identified amino acid changes in activin-receptor-like kinase 1 that were inherited in subjects who had a disorder with clinical and histologic features indistinguishable from those of <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> .
Immunohistochemical analysis in four subjects and one control showed pulmonary vascular endothelial expression of activin-receptor-like kinase 1 in normal and diseased pulmonary arteries .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pulmonary hypertension <END> in association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia can involve mutations in ALK1 .
These mutations are associated with diverse effects , including the vascular dilatation characteristic of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and the occlusion of small pulmonary arteries that is typical of <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> .
Clinical analysis of 17 patients in 12 Japanese families with autosomal-recessive type juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
We present the clinical features of 17 patients from 12 Japanese families with familial juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> suggesting autosomal-recessive inheritance ( AR-JP ) .
Because the marriages of the parents in all but one family were consanguineous and all patients were only first generation , an autosomal-recessive trait was strongly suspected .
Analysis of the clinical features showed female predominance , mean age at onset 27. 8 years , and slow progression .
The symptoms of the parkinsonian triad ( <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> bradykinesia <END> ) were mild , but gait freezing , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> , foot <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , and retropulsion were relatively prominent .
A characteristic finding was amelioration of parkinsonian symptoms after sleep in all patients .
Response to levodopa was satisfactory , but dopa-induced choreic limb dyskinesia and wearing-off phenomenon occurred frequently .
Juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> is a syndrome that encompasses several clinical entities .
The similarity of clinical findings in these patients , and the differences from other types of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , indicates that AR-JP is distinct clinical entity .
Intracranial aneurysms in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
Intracranial aneurysms are a feature of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> , but their prevalence is uncertain .
We studied 92 subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> who had no symptoms or signs of any neurologic disorder .
To determine the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms , we performed high-resolution computed tomography ( CT) in 60 subjects , four-vessel cerebral angiography in 21 , and both procedures in 11 .
Four of the 88 subjects in whom the radiologic studies were successfully completed had intracranial aneurysms ( 4 percent ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.1 to 9 percent ) , as compared with the prevalence of 1 percent reported for an angiographic study of the general population .
Three of the four subjects had multiple aneurysms .
Seven subjects for whom the results of CT studies were suspicious underwent cerebral angiography : two had aneurysms , and five had normal vascular structures that accounted for the suspicious results of tomography.
Four subjects who had normal CT imaging studies also had normal angiographic examinations .
Eight of the 32 subjects who underwent angiography ( 25 percent ) had transient complications , as compared with 22 of 220 control subjects (1 0 percent ) who did not have <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> ( P less than 0.05 ) .
We could not identify any risk factor in these subjects that was related to the occurrence of aneurysm .
Asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms appear to be more frequent in people with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> than in the general population , although our 95 percent confidence interval includes the possibility of no difference .
Because cerebral angiography is associated with increased morbidity in people with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> , we recommend high-resolution CT as a screening test .
Bilateral retinopathy , aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> , and central nervous system abnormalities : a new syndrome ?
A male infant was found to have bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> exudative retinopathy <END> at 6 months of age .
A month later severe aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> was diagnosed , eventually leading to the infant 's death .
Additional features of this seemingly new syndrome were <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , fine <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> , fine reticulate skin pigmentation , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> because of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , cerebral calcifications , extensor <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertonia <END> , and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis <END> in two siblings and concomitant <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> in one .
Two sisters with <START:PHENOTYPE> acute tubulointerstitial nephritis <END> ( ATIN) are reported .
The elder sister had concomitant <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> which recurred twice .
The younger sister became ill five years after the onset in the elder .
Both patients had identical HLA haplotypes and also suffered from mild chronic sialoadenitis .
A renal biopsy specimen of the elder sister showed not only marked interstitial infiltration of immunoglobulin-containing mononuclear cells but also immunecomplex-related <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> .
The younger sister had immune complexes in the serum .
These findings suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> may be secondary phenomena of ATIN with participation of <START:PHENOTYPE> circulating immune complexes <END> .
Once the uveal involvement has occurred , <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> may undergo relapses without any renal manifestations .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> , and renal tubular acidosis responding to dietary sodium restriction .
A 13-year-old girl with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> ( 240/14 0 mm Hg ) , short stature , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> ( 8 .6 mEq/liter ) , and renal tubular acidosis was studied .
Renal parenchymal and renovascular diseases as well as endocrinologic causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> were ruled out by appropriate studies .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> was associated with sodium retention , increased plasma volume , suppressed plasma renin activity , and decreased urinary excretion of aldosterone .
Impaired renal excretion of potassium was demonstrated by sodium sulfate infusion when the patient was fed a high-sodium diet but a significant kaliuresis occurred when the test was performed on a low-sodium diet suggesting that renal sodium retention may play a role in the defect in potassium excretion .
The renal tubular acidosis was associated with normal distal acidification but a low bicarbonate threshold ( 19 mmoles/liter ) and marked suppression of urinary ammonium excretion .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , hyporeninemia , and hypoaldosteronism as well as the <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> and acid-base abnormalities were completely reversed by dietary sodium restriction or the administration of thiazides or furosemide .
It is concluded that an unusual avidity for sodium chloride reabsorption by the renal tubules leading to extracellular volume expansion and renin-aldosterone suppression plays a significant pathogenic role in this syndrome and may explain the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and biochemical abnormalities discussed .
PRKCA : a positional candidate gene for body mass index and <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> incidence and prevalence are higher in obese individuals .
A potential mechanistic basis for this relationship is pleiotropy .
We hypothesized that significant linkage and candidate-gene association would be found for body mass index ( BMI ) in a population ascertained on <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> affection status .
Linkage analysis for BMI was performed on 657 subjects in eight Costa Rican families enrolled in a study of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Family-based association studies were conducted for BMI with SNPs within a positional candidate gene , PRKCA .
SNPs within PRKCA were also tested for association with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Association studies were conducted in 415 Costa Rican parent-child trios and 493 trios participating in the Childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> Management Program ( CAMP ) .
Although only modest evidence of linkage for BMI was obtained for the whole cohort , significant linkage was noted for BMI in females on chromosome 17q ( peak LOD = 3.39 ) .
Four SNPs in a candidate gene in this region ( PRKCA ) had unadjusted association p values < 0.05 for BMI in both cohorts , with the joint p value for two SNPs remaining significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons ( rs228883 and rs1005651 , joint p values = 9.5 x 10(- )(5 ) and 5.6 x 10(- )(5) ) .
Similarly , eight SNPs had unadjusted association p values < 0.05 for <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> in both populations , with one SNP remaining significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons ( rs11 079657 , joint p value = 2.6 x 10(- )(5) ) .
PRKCA is a pleiotropic locus that is associated with both BMI and <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and that has been identified via linkage analysis of BMI in a population ascertained on <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Cohen syndrome : further delineation and inheritance .
Four sibs , 2 males and 2 females , were found to have the Cohen syndrome .
All had moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , hypotonia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow hands <END> and feet with elongated fingers and toes ; 3 were short of stature ( 2.0-3.5 SD below the mean ) with weight between 10th and 50th centile and truncal <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .
Most of the facial characteristics of the syndrome were present : exotropia , prominent ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> .
Each manifestation varied in severity from one sib to the other .
The younger girl also had rheumatoid arthritis .
Mild delay of puberty was described in 3 of the sibs .
However , one of them has delivered a male infant with normal appearance whose psychomotor development has been normal ( as of 9 months ) .
No endocrine problems were documented in the sibship .
All patients had normal chromosomes .
The data on this sibship support the hypothesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> of the Cohen syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> should be stressed as frequent manifestations of the syndrome .
The variable expressivity , even among sibs , may be responsible for the paucity of reports on the mildest forms of the Cohen syndrome .
A mutation in the tRNA( Leu ) ( UUR ) gene associated with the MELAS subgroup of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathies .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathies are usually divided into three distinct clinical subgroups : (1 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> ( MELAS ) ; (2 ) myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibres ( MERRF) ; and (3 ) chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia ( CPEO ) including Kearns-Say re syndrome . Large deletions of human <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA and a transition mutation at the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> transfer RNALys gene give rise to CPEO including Kearns-Say re syndrome and MERRF , respectively .
Here we report an A-to-G transition mutation at nucleotide pair 3,243 in the dihydrouridine loop of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> tRNA( Leu ) ( UUR ) that is specific to patients with MELAS .
Because this mutation creates an ApaI restriction site , we could perform a simple molecular diagnostic test for the disease .
The mutation was present in 26 out of 31 independent MELAS patients and 1 out of 29 CPEO patients , but absent in the 5 MERRF and 50 controls tested .
Southern blot analysis confirmed that the mutant DNA always coexists with the wild-type DNA ( heteroplasmy ) .
Pitt-Hopkins syndrome in two patients and further definition of the phenotype .
Pitt-Hopkins syndrome is a rare dysmorphic <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome marked by daytime spells of overbreathing interrupted by <START:PHENOTYPE> apnoea <END> .
The dysmorphism consists of a large beaked nose , <START:PHENOTYPE> cup-shaped ears <END> with broad helices , a <START:PHENOTYPE> wide mouth <END> , Cupid 's bow upper lip , wide and shallow palate and broad or clubbed fingertips .
The four patients described so far have been sporadic and represented both sexes .
In addition , a pair of sibs with atypical features has been reported as possible Pitt-Hopkins syndrome cases .
We describe two unrelated Pitt-Hopkins syndrome patients in order to further define the phenotype .
In addition to severe developmental retardation , hypotonia , postnatal growth retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , abnormal breathing and characteristic dysmorphic features , both had <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and intestinal problems with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> in one and Hirschsprung disease in the other .
Other abnormalities were hypopigmented skin macules in one and high-grade <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> in the other .
Both had unusual frontal slow-and-sharp-wave discharges on electroencephalography.
Magnetic resonance imaging in both showed a similar <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic corpus callosum <END> with missing rostrum and posterior part of the splenium and bulbous caudate nuclei bulging towards the frontal horns .
Chromosomal analysis and subtelomere fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies were normal .
No mutations were found in the MECP2 or ZFHX1B genes .
Extensive metabolic and mitochondrial screens were normal .
The electroencephalography and brain magnetic resonance imaging findings appear to be further diagnostic signs in Pitt-Hopkins syndrome , which is also one of the syndromes associated with Hirschsprung disease .
Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> : clinical and molecular genetic findings .
Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> ( LHON ) is a maternally inherited disease characterized by acute or subacute painless central <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> usually in young adults , predominantly in males .
Except for <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , LHON patients are usually otherwise healthy.
Occasionally , LHON is associated with neurological , cardiac , and skeletal changes .
The clinical course of LHON has several stages .
Peripapillary microangiopathy is present from the beginning .
Microangiopathy disappears as the disease progresses towards the end stages .
Simultaneously , the retinal nerve fiber layer fades from view , first papillomacular nerve fiber bundles , and months later , the whole nerve fiber layer becomes atrophic .
At the end stage the <START:PHENOTYPE> centrocecal scotoma <END> is large and absolute .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Loss of vision <END> is usually permanent , but spontaneous recovery can occur .
Despite a few attempts , no effective treatment to prevent or halt LHON has been found .
Several <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( mtDNA ) mutations are associated with LHON , but the pathogenic processes leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> optic nerve atrophy <END> are largely unknown .
About 15 % of the families are heteroplasmic , i.e. , both mutant and wild type mtDNA coexist within an individual .
The level of heteroplasmy between different tissues can vary markedly .
mtDNA mutations are not sufficient to cause <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> in LHON , since not all individuals harboring a pathogenic LHON mutation express the disease .
There are additional genetic and/or environmental precipitating factors , but thus far they are unknown .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> glut-1 deficiency syndrome and familial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Glut-1 deficiency syndrome was first described in 1991 as a sporadic clinical condition , later shown to be the result of haploinsufficiency .
We now report a family with Glut-1 deficiency syndrome affecting 5 members over 3 generations .
The syndrome behaves as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> condition .
Affected family members manifested mild to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycorrhachia <END> , and decreased erythrocyte 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizure <END> frequency and severity were aggravated by fasting , and responded to a carbohydrate load .
Glut-1 immunoreactivity in erythrocyte membranes was normal .
A heterozygous R126H missense mutation was identified in the 3 patients available for testing , 2 brothers ( Generation 3 ) and their mother ( Generation 2 ) .
The sister and her father were clinically and genotypically normal .
In vitro mutagenesis studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes demonstrated significant decreases in the transport of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose and dehydroascorbic acid .
Xenopus oocyte membranes expressed high amounts of the R126H mutant Glut-1 .
Kinetic analysis indicated that replacement of arginine-126 by histidine in the mutant Glut-1 resulted in a lower Vmax .
These studies demonstrate the pathogenicity of the R126H missense mutation and transmission of Glut-1 deficiency syndrome as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
Mutations in ZDHHC9 , which encodes a palmitoyltransferase of NRAS and HRAS , cause <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> associated with a <START:PHENOTYPE> Marfanoid habitus <END> .
We have identified one frameshift mutation , one splice-site mutation , and two missense mutations in highly conserved residues in ZDHHC9 at Xq26.1 in 4 of 250 families with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) .
In three of the families , the <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> phenotype is associated with a <START:PHENOTYPE> Marfanoid habitus <END> , although none of the affected individuals meets the Ghent criteria for Marfan syndrome .
ZDHHC9 is a palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the posttranslational modification of NRAS and HRAS .
The degree of palmitoylation determines the temporal and spatial location of these proteins in the plasma membrane and Golgi complex .
The finding of mutations in ZDHHC9 suggests that alterations in the concentrations and cellular distribution of target proteins are sufficient to cause disease .
This is the first XLMR gene to be reported that encodes a posttranslational modification enzyme , palmitoyltransferase .
Furthermore , now that the first palmitoyltransferase that causes <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> has been identified , defects in other palmitoylation transferases become good candidates for causing other <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndromes .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> fructose intolerance <END> in early childhood : a major diagnostic challenge .
Survey of 20 symptomatic cases .
Twenty infants and young children with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> fructose intolerance <END> ( HFI ) were admitted to hospital .
None was diagnosed at admission .
Referals were for <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> of unknown aetiology ( 16X ) , pyloric stenosis or hiatus hernia ( 5X ) , toxic condition ( 3X) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> of unknown origin ( 5X ) .
Feeding difficulties (20X) , <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> ( 18X) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> ( 16X ) were leading symptoms .
The most frequent clinical findings were <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> ( 18X) , pallor ( 14X ) , haemorrhages ( 13X ) .
Ascites , oliguria , tachypnoea , fever , splenomegaly and rickets were less frequent .
Laboratory findings were indicative of disturbed hepatic and renal tubular function and also of disturbed intermediary metabolism ( hypokaliaemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> ) .
However , hypoglycaemia was found in only 4 out of 15 patients tested .
Differential diagnosis after hospital admission centered on metabolic disorders such as glycogenoses , galactosaemia , tyrosinosis , or Wilson 's disease . Hepatitis , toxic hepatosis , liver tumour , intrauterine infection and sepsis were also considered .
Eleven children had first ingested fructose within the first 6 weeks of life .
The diagnosis was usually established only many weeks or months after first fructose intake and appearance of symptoms .
This documents how difficult the diagnosis of this disease can be both in practice and in hospital .
The course was severe in 11 children and lethal in 4 .
In only 5 patients was the course mild .
The 16 survivors are doing well under fructose-exclusion diet .
Irreversible visual impairment after intraocular haemorrhage occurred once .
In each case HFI could have been suspected immediately , had a detailed nutritional history been taken .
Practising paediatricians should know the composition of commonly used infant formulae .
They should never prescribe sugared condensed milk for intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> prior to excluding HFI . Solution for intravenous infusion containing fructose and sorbitol are life-threatening for undiagnosed HFI patients .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperphosphatasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , neurologic deficit , and characteristic facial features : Five new patients with Mabry syndrome .
Persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphosphatasia <END> associated with developmental delay and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> was described in a single family by Mabry et al . 1970 ( OMIM 239300) , but the nosology of this condition has remained uncertain ever since .
We report on five new patients ( two siblings , one offspring of consanguineous parents , and two sporadic patients ) that help delineate this distinctive disorder and provide evidence in favor of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Common to all five new patients is facial dysmorphism , namely <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> tented mouth <END> .
All patients have some degree of brachytelephalangy but the phalangeal shortening varies in position and degree .
In all , there is a persistent elevation of alkaline phosphatase activity without any evidence for active bone or liver disease .
The degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphosphatasia <END> varies considerably ( approximately 1.3-20 times the upper age-adjusted reference limit ) between patients , but is relatively constant over time .
In the first family described by Mabry et al . 1970 , at least one member was found to have intracellular inclusions on biopsy of some but not all tissues .
This was confirmed in three of our patients , but the inclusions are not always observed and the intracellular storage material has not been identified .

A novel X-linked gene , DDP , shows mutations in families with deafness ( DFN-1 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , mental deficiency and blindness .
In 1960 , progressive sensorineural deafness ( McKusick 304 ,700 , DFN-1 ) was shown to be X-linked based on a description of a large Norwegian pedigree .
More recently , it was shown that this original DFN-1 family represented a new type of recessive neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by postlingual progressive sensorineural deafness as the first presenting symptom in early childhood , followed by progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deterioration <END> , paranoia and <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical blindness <END> .
This new disorder , termed Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome ( referred to here as DFN-1/ MTS ) was mapped to the Xq21.3-Xq22 region2 .
Using positional information from a patient with a 21-kb deletion in chromosome Xq22 and sensorineural deafness along with <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , we characterized a novel transcript lying within the deletion as a candidate for this complex syndrome .
We now report small deletions in this candidate gene in the original DFN-1/ MTS family , and in a family with deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> and mental deficiency but not blindness .
This gene , named DDP (deafness / <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> peptide) , shows high levels of expression in fetal and adult brain .
The DDP protein demonstrates striking similarity to a predicted Schizosaccharomyces pombe protein of no known function .
Thus , is it likely that the DDP gene encodes an evolutionarily conserved novel polypeptide necessary for normal human neurological development .
An atypical case of Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> in elderly sibs .
We describe a 56-year-old woman suspected of Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> on the basis of the following clinical findings : <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital deafness <END> , and the clinical findings in her deceased brother .
Hematologic or other signs of malignancy were absent .
The diagnosis was confirmed by demonstrating hypersensitivity of her lymphocytes to mitomycin C ( MMC ) .
Cell fusion experiments indicated that the patient belongs to complementation group A . The patient 's brother died at the age of 50 of heart and renal failure , and <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> .
He had clinical findings similar to those of his sister , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> horseshoe kidney <END> .
From 31 years on he had <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> and leucopenia .
Both patients had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus .
A chromosomal breakage test carried out elsewhere before his death failed to demonstrate MMC hypersensitivity of his lymphocytes , which led to the investigation of his sister .
To our knowledge these two cases are the oldest Fanconi <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> patients reported thus far .
Localization of a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital stationary night blindness <END> locus : close linkage to the RP3 type retinitis pigmentosa gene region .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital stationary night blindness <END> ( CSNBX ) is a non-progressive retinal disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased visual acuity <END> and loss of night vision .
CSNBX is clinically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> with respect to the involvement of retinal rods and/or cones in the disease .
In this study , we localize a new locus for CSNBX to Xp21.1 , thus providing evidence that CSNBX is also genetically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> .
A clear correlation between different genotypes and phenotypes cannot be found yet .
The new CSNBX gene described here is closely linked to the <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> retinitis pigmentosa type 3 gene region , which supports the hypothesis that there may be a functional relationship between <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital stationary night blindness <END> and retinitis pigmentosa .
Type II <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> osteopetrosis ( Albers-SchÃ¶nberg disease ) : clinical and radiological manifestations in 42 patients .
Type II <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> osteopetrosis ( ADO II , Albers-Schonberg disease ) is a genetic condition characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized osteosclerosis <END> predominating in some skeletal sites such as the spine and pelvis .
ADO II is rare , and most available clinical descriptions are based on small numbers of patients .
We report the clinical and radiological manifestations in 42 ADO II patients .
To our knowledge , this is the largest series reported so far .
Our inclusion criterion was presence on radiographs of the spine of vertebral endplate thickening , producing the classic sandwich vertebra appearance .
We found various patterns of sandwich vertebra , of which we provide a description to assist physicians in diagnosing ADO II.
The classic bone-within-bone appearance was present in most but not all skeletal sites .
The radiological penetrance of the disease was high (90% ) and increased after 20 years of age .
As many as 81 % of our patients experienced clinical manifestations .
Fractures were common ( 78 % of patients ) and healed slowly .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hip osteoarthritis <END> developed in 27% of patients and required arthroplasty in 9 of the 16 affected hips .
Nonmandibular <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomyelitis <END> occurred in 4 cases ( 11% ) .
Twenty-four percent of patients had thoracic or lumbar scoliosis .
Orthopedic surgery was performed in 52 .8 % of patients , of whom half had at least three surgical procedures for internal fracture fixation , arthroplasty , limb deformity correction , or treatment of surgical complications .
There was a high rate of surgical complications including nonunion , infection , prosthesis loosening , and intraoperative fractures .
Nearly two-thirds of patients ( 64% ) had stomatologic manifestations , including <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular osteomyelitis <END> in 4 patients ( 11% ) .
Cranial nerve involvement responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> facial palsy <END> was present in 14 patients but was clearly attributable to ADO II in only 6 cases ( 16% ) .
This large series sheds new light on several aspects of ADO II , most notably the possibility of severe clinical complications .
Although other forms of osteopetrosis are considerably more severe , the name " benign osteopetrosis " previously used for ADO II is probably a misnomer .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Episodic ataxia <END> type 1 and 2 ( familial periodic ataxia/vertigo ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Episodic ataxia <END> ( EA ) is a rare , disabling condition of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> , but it is not a distinct clinical entity .
Synonyms are familial periodic ataxia or hereditary paroxysmal cerebellar ataxia .
Family members have a similar clinical syndrome ; however , the syndrome varies considerably from family to family .
At least two groups of disorders have been separated clinically : (1 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> type 1 ( EA-1 ) , which manifests without <START:PHENOTYPE> vertigo <END> and is associated with 'interictal ' <START:PHENOTYPE> myokymia <END> , and (2 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> type 2 ( EA-2) , which often manifests with <START:PHENOTYPE> vertigo <END> and is associated with 'interictal ' nystagmus .
EA-1 and EA-2 have been identified as channelopathies .
EA-1 is due to different heterozygous missense point mutations in a voltage-gated (delayed rectifier ) potassium channel gene ( KCNA1 / Kv1 .1 ) on chromosome 12p13 , whereas EA-2 is caused by mutations of the cerebral P/Q-type calcium channel alpha 1 subunit gene CACNL1A4 localized on chromosome 19p , which is highly expressed in the cerebellum .
The diagnosis of EA-1 and EA-2 is important , since they can be easily treated and are often mislabeled .
As effective as acetazolamide is in preventing attacks , prospective studies still have to prove whether it can prevent <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive ataxia <END> in EA-2 or even improve chronic cerebellar deficits .
Antley-Bixler syndrome in sisters : a term newborn and a prenatally diagnosed fetus .
Sisters with the Antley-Bixler syndrome are reported herein .
The first infant died at 14 days of respiratory failure and the following findings characteristic of the syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> of coronal and lambdoid sutures , <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> proptosis <END> and choanal stenosis/atresia , humero-radial synostosis , medial bowing of ulnae , <START:PHENOTYPE> long slender fingers <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , narrow iliac wings , anterior bowing of femora , cardiac and renal malformations .
Unlike two previously published cases , she did not have connatal fractures , but she had <START:PHENOTYPE> vaginal atresia <END> .
Ultrasound examination in a subsequent pregnancy showed immobility at the elbows of the fetus , humero-radial synostosis , medial bowing of ulnae , and long hands and fingers .
The fetus also had mild bowing of femora .
The pregnancy was terminated in the 21st week and the findings were confirmed by clinical and radiologic examinations .
Additional autopsy findings included cardiac and renal malformations .
The Antley-Bixler syndrome is a recognizable malformation syndrome with a probable <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance , which can be diagnosed in the fetus by midtrimester ultrasound examination .
The novel R75Q mutation in the GJB2 gene causes <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> in a Turkish family .
Dominant mutations in the GJB2 gene encoding connexin 26 ( Cx26 ) can cause non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> alone or in association with <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> ( PPK ) .
We have identified the novel G224A ( R75Q ) mutation in the GJB2 gene in a four-generation family from Turkey with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> and PPK .
The age of onset and progression of <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> were found to be variable among affected family members , but all of them had more severe impairment at higher hearing frequencies .
Interestingly , the novel R75Q mutation affects the same amino acid residue as described recently in a small family ( R75W ) with profound prelingual <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> and PPK . However , the R75W mutation was also observed in a control individual without PPK and unknown hearing status .
Therefore , the nature of the R75W mutation remains ambiguous .
Our molecular findings provide further evidence for the importance of the conserved R75 in Cx26 for the physiological function of the inner ear and the epidermal cells of the skin .
The HCR gene on 6p21 is unlikely to be a <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> susceptibility gene .
The PSORS1 locus in the human major histocompatibility complex on 6p21 has been consistently associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> in populations of diverse ethnicity .
The HLA- C allele Cw*0602 , located therein , has been found in up to 67 % of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> patients but is no longer considered a candidate gene in itself .
The alpha-helix coiled-coil rod homolog gene ( HCR , previously Pg8 ) is located 110 kb from the HLA- C gene , positioned between the CDSN and SC1 genes , within a region thought to harbor a <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> gene ( PSORS1 ) .
We investigated the HCR gene for disease association by direct sequencing of nine polymerase chain reaction products amplified from a series of Swedish <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> patients and controls .
We found that HCR is a very polymorphic gene with 25 polymorphisms in the open reading frame alone , of which 10 demonstrated disease association ; however , the relationship between HCR polymorphisms and HLA-Cw*0602 indicates that HCR cannot truly be considered a likely candidate gene .
We investigated Cw*0602 association while stratifying for HCR single nucleotide polymorphisms .
We also investigated HCR single nucleotide polymorphism association with the disease while stratifying for the presence of Cw*0602 .
We found that whichever single nucleotide polymorphism that was stratified for , there was still a strongly significant Cw*0602 association with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> ; however , when we stratified for Cw*0602 presence , only one silent polymorphism showed significant association .
In a recent similar study this polymorphism was actually found to be decreased in <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> individuals .
Thus we conclude that HCR polymorphisms display association with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> due to linkage disequilibrium with Cw*0602 and is , therefore , unlikely to be directly involved in the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
Stratum corneum lipids in disorders of cornification .
Steroid sulfatase and cholesterol sulfate in normal desquamation and the pathogenesis of recessive X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> .
The pathological scaling in recessive x-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> is associated with accumulation of abnormal quantities of cholesterol sulfate in stratum corneum ( J . Clin . Invest . 68 :1404-1410 , 1981 ) .
To determine whether or not cholesterol sulfate accumulates in recessive x-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> as a direct result of the missing enzyme , steroid sulfatase , we quantitated both steroid sulfatase and its substrate , we quantitated both steroid sulfatase and its substrate , cholesterol sulfate , in different epidermal strata , as well as within stratum corneum subcellular fractions obtained from normal human and neonatal mouse epidermis and from patients with recessive x-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> .
In normal human and mouse epidermis , steroid sulfatase activity peaked in the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum , and negligible activity was detectable in lower epidermal layers .
In contrast , in recessive x-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> epidermis , enzyme levels were virtually undetectable at all levels .
In normal human stratum corneum , up to 10 times more steroid sulfatase activity was present in purified peripheral membrane preparations than in the whole tissue .
Whereas in normal human epidermis cholesterol sulfate levels were lowest in the basal/spinous layer , and highest in the stratum granulosum , in recessive x-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> the levels were only slightly higher in the lower epidermis , but continued to climb in the stratum corneum .
In both normal and in recessive x-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> stratum corneum , cholesterol sulfate appeared primarily within membrane domains , paralleling the pattern of steroid sulfatase localization .
Finally , the role of excess cholesterol sulfate in the pathogenesis of recessive x-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> was directly tested by topical applications of this substance , which produced visible scaling in hairless mice in parallel to an increased cholesterol sulfate content of the stratum corneum .
These results demonstrate an intimate relationship between steroid sulfatase and cholesterol sulfate in normal epidermis : both are concentrated in the outer epidermis ( stratum corneum and stratum granulosum) , and both are localized to membrane domains .
Presumably , as a result of this distribution pattern , continued enzymatic degradation of substrate occurs in normal epidermis , thereby preventing excessive accumulation of cholesterol sulfate .
In contrast , in recessive x-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , degradation of cholesterol sulfate does not occur and cholesterol sulfate accumulates specifically in the stratum corneum , where it produces visible scale .
Genetic heterogeneity of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> rigid spine <END> syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Rigid spine <END> syndrome is a neuromuscular disorder characterised by early rigidity of the spine due to axial muscle <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures <END> , generally associated with muscle weakness , limb-joint <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures <END> , and often respiratory failure .
This phenotype may be associated with several muscular diseases .
In cases of merosin-positive congenital muscular dystrophies ( CMD ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> rigid spine <END> syndrome , we have recently identified a new locus ( RSMD1 ) on chromosome 1p35-36 .
In the present study , we report the clinical , morphological and genetic analysis of other patients affected by a CMD with <START:PHENOTYPE> rigid spine <END> syndrome from nine consanguineous families .
Homozygosity mapping showed that the disease was linked to RSMD1 in one of the nine families .
The other families were excluded from RSMD1 , and the patients presented highly variable phenotypes suggesting the involvement of more than one gene defect in <START:PHENOTYPE> rigid spine <END> syndrome .
Nevertheless , a subgroup of patients who never walked , and had very early rigidity of the spine and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , may be considered for further genetic analysis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> ND3 as the novel causative gene for Leber hereditary optic <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
Leber hereditary optic <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> ( LDYT) is a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disorder associated with variable combinations of vision loss and progressive generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
LDYT is a unique oxidative phosphorylation disorder caused by mutations in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> ND6 or ND4 gene .
In this paper , we describe a Chinese family with 18 LDYT patients .
The comprehensive nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome using resequencing microarray revealed a mutation ( mtND3*10197 A ( m .10197G >A) ) substituting a threonine for a highly conserved alanine at codon 47 of MTND3 on the background of haplogroup D4b . Quantitative analysis of the heteroplasmy of the mutation revealed a homoplasmy in the leukocytes of all the affected individuals on the maternal side .
This is the first description of the ND3 mutation causing LDYT.
The mtND3*10197 A ( m .10197G >A ) mutation has recently been described in French and Korean patients with Leigh syndrome .
These findings suggest that the clinical presentations associated with the mtND3*10197 A ( m .10197G >A ) mutation ( ND3 ) are much wider , encompassing those of LDYT and Leigh syndrome .
Refinement of the SPG15 candidate interval and phenotypic heterogeneity in three large Arab families .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( HSP ) type 15 is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ( AR ) form of complicated HSP mainly characterized by slowly progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , intellectual deterioration , maculopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> distal amyotrophy <END> , and mild cerebellar signs that has been associated with the Kjellin syndrome .
The locus for this form of HSP , designated SPG15 , was mapped to an interval of 19 cM on chromosome 14q22-q24 in two Irish families .
We performed a clinical-genetic study of this form of HSP on 147 individuals ( 64 of whom were affected ) from 20 families with AR-HSP .
A genome-wide scan was performed in three large consanguineous families of Arab origin after exclusion of linkage to several known loci for AR-HSP ( SPG5 , SPG7 , SPG21 , SPG24 , SPG28 , and SPG30 ) .
The 17 other AR-HSP families were tested for linkage to the SPG15 locus .
Only the three large consanguineous families showed evidence of linkage to the SPG15 locus ( 2.4 > Z ( max ) > 4.3 ) .
Recombinations in these families reduced the candidate region from approximately 16 to approximately 5 Mbases . Among the approximately 50 genes assigned to this locus , two were good candidates by their functions ( GPHN and SLC8A3 ) , but their coding exons and untranslated regions ( UTRs ) were excluded by direct sequencing .
Patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> associated with cognitive impairment , mild cerebellar signs , and <START:PHENOTYPE> axonal neuropathy <END> , as well as a <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> in one family .
The ages at onset ranged from 10 to 19 years .
Our study highlights the phenotypic heterogeneity of SPG15 in which <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> or cognitive deterioration , but not all other signs of Kjellin syndrome , are associated with HSP and significantly reduces the SPG15 locus .
Oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis in a large kindred with a new transthyretin variant Tyr69His .
To describe the clinical , radiologic , and pathologic findings of a kindred with oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis and a newly associated transthyretin mutation .
Transthyretin ( TTR ) amyloidosis can present in the form of oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis .
Clinical features include <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> , subarachnoid hemorrhage , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , myelopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , radiculopathy , and ocular amyloidosis .
Eight TTR mutations associated with oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis have been described .
Fourteen individuals from a kindred with oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis were examined clinically and radiologically .
Analysis of the TTR gene was performed .
Neuropathologic examination was obtained on the index patient .
Affected individuals had vitreous amyloid , radiculopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> , encephalopathy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Severely affected individuals died by the end of the fifth decade .
Leptomeningeal enhancement on contrast MRI and <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated CSF protein <END> were the defining features on investigations .
Sequencing of exon 3 in the TTR gene found a base pair substitution at codon 69 .
This resulted in heterozygosity for normal tyrosine and variant histidine ( ATTR Tyr69His ) in affected family members .
Domino liver transplantation was attempted as treatment for one family member .
The ATTR Tyr69His mutation is associated with oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis .
Expression of the genotype is variable .
This has implications for treatment of affected individuals and counseling of family members .
Efficacy of liver transplantation in patients with oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis remains unknown .
The authors advocate the investigation of liver transplantation in patients with severe symptoms due to oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> osteopetrosis : clinical severity and natural history of 94 subjects with a chloride channel 7 gene mutation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> osteopetrosis ( ADO ) is a sclerosing bone disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the chloride channel 7 ( ClCN7 ) gene .
The clinical manifestations of this disease have not been well characterized since the discovery of the genetic basis of ADO .
The primary objectives were to improve our understanding of ADO clinical characteristics and to study the natural history of the disease in the largest series of patients reported to date .
This study was primarily a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of individuals with a ClCN7 mutation that was conducted over a 4-yr period at a tertiary referral center and through family reunions .
Longitudinal data on a subset of subjects were also studied .
We studied 311 subjects from 11 ADO families , including 62 individuals with ADO ( patients with the classic clinical phenotype based on radiographs and/or biochemistry ) , 32 unaffected gene carriers ( subjects with the gene mutation but no radiographic and/or biochemical phenotype) , and 217 controls who did not harbor a ClCN7 gene mutation .
Clinical data were collected through patient interviews and examinations , medical records , and/or self-reported responses on a questionnaire that was completed by all subjects .
The prevalence of fracture , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomyelitis <END> , visual loss , and <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> was determined .
Differences in clinical manifestations were analyzed according to affected vs . carrier status , age , and underlying genotype .
Ninety-two percent of ADO subjects had at least one sequela of the disease .
Gene carriers did not have an increased risk of disease manifestations , although they were found to have significant increases in bone mineral density ( P < 0.05 ) .
Compared with controls , subjects with ADO had a significantly increased prevalence of fracture ( 84 vs . 36% ; P < 0.0001 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomyelitis <END> ( 16 vs . 0.9% ; P < 0.0001 ) .
Severe fractures (defined as > or =1 0 fractures of any type and/or greater than one hip/femur fracture ) were identified only in ADO subjects , and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomyelitis <END> typically occurred in the maxilla or mandible in older adults .
Visual loss , which typically had its onset in childhood , and <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> occurred in 19 and 3% of ADO subjects , respectively .
Adults were more likely to manifest an ADO clinical characteristic , but no definitive genotype-phenotype relationship could be concluded .
Longitudinal data suggest that the ADO clinical phenotype worsens over time .
ADO caused by mutations in the CLCN7 gene is a frequently symptomatic disease manifested by a high rate of fracture , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomyelitis <END> , visual loss , and occasional <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> .
The sequelae of ADO , which can be identified as early as infancy , appear to worsen over time .
Fracture is the most prevalent consequence of ADO , although other more severe manifestations of disease can occur and should not be confused with recessive forms of osteopetrosis , particularly when identified in early childhood .
Variable expression in ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip and palate syndrome .
The ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip and palate ( Hay-Wells ) syndrome is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of congenital ectodermal dysplasia .
It is characterized by coarse , wiry , sparse hair ; <START:PHENOTYPE> dystrophic nails <END> ; slight <START:PHENOTYPE> hypohidrosis <END> ; scalp infections ; <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hypodontia <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> maxillary hypoplasia <END> ; and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate .
To date , 12 patients have been reported ; however , the diagnosis has been questioned in 3 of these patients .
We report 2 additional patients , one of whom has nasal speech but not <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , in contrast to all other reported patients .
This entity must be distinguished from numerous other forms of ectodermal dysplasia , especially those forms that can be associated with oral clefts and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloblepharon <END> .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia <END> : a retrospective clinical analysis of 20 patients .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia <END> ( CAMT) is a rare bone marrow failure syndrome characterised by isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> because of ineffective megakaryocytopoiesis at birth .
In the last 10 years , we collected data from 20 patients diagnosed with CAMT based on a severe <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> since birth and absent or markedly decreased numbers of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow .
Fanconi 's <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> absent radii syndrome were ruled out for all patients .
We retrospectively compared the clinical courses , laboratory findings and treatment outcome .
Development of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> was observed in 14 of the patients , only one patient presented with an isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> over a period of over 14 years .
One boy died from bleeding complications .
We defined two groups of patients according to the course of platelet counts during the first year of life , which also differed in the course of development of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> .
Physical anomalies in addition to haematopoiesis were found in a number of patients : two children presented with cardiac defects , six with growth abnormalities , and four with retardation of psychomotor development .
Fifteen patients were treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation , four of whom died of transplantation-related events .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> .
A family of ten members in three generations who were affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> ( extra rows of eyelashes ) was observed .
This combination of symptoms can be presumed to represent a rare but well-defined hereditary syndrome transmitted by an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> gene .
Some years ago the published pedigrees of congenital hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> were reviewed and analysed genetically by Esterly ( 1965 ) .
Recently papers have been published on the association of lymphostasis with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> ( Falls and Kertesz , 1964 ; Robinow et al. , 197 0 ; Jester , 1977 ) .
We report here a family with ten members in three generations affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> .
Genotype-phenotype correlations in Axenfeld-Rieger malformation and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> patients with FOXC1 and PITX2 mutations .
To improve the understanding of Axenfeld-Rieger Malformation ( ARM)-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and to determine the best <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> treatment for patients with ARM who have known genetic defects in FOXC1 or PITX2 .
Clinical data were collected from patients with diagnosed ARM , in whom we had previously identified disease-causing mutations in either the FOXC1 or PITX2 genes , by examination of patient records and use of clinical questionnaires .
One hundred twenty-six patients with ARM , representing 20 different probands , with FOXC1 and PITX2 alterations were included in the study .
ARM-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is a bilateral anterior segment dysgenesis disease that affects males and females equally .
Seventy-five percent of the patients with ARM who participated in this study had <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> that had developed in adolescence or early adulthood .
Of note , the patients with nonocular findings were more likely to have PITX2 defects than FOXC1 defects .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Glaucoma <END> in only 18 % of patients with either PITX2 or FOXC1 genetic defects responded to medical or surgical treatment ( used solely or in combination ) .
Patients with FOXC1 mutations have the mildest prognosis for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> development , whereas patients with PITX2 defects and patients with FOXC1 duplication have a more severe prognosis for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> development than do patients with FOXC1 mutations .
In the present study , current medical therapies do not successfully lower intraocular pressure or prevent progression of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in patients with ARM who have FOXC1 or PITX2 alterations .
This clinical study also provides useful diagnostic criteria to identify the gene responsible for ARM .
Fine-mapping the putative chromosome 17q21-22 <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> susceptibility gene to a 10 cM region based on linkage analysis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Prostate cancer <END> linkage studies have suggested the existence of a <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> susceptibility gene on chromosome 17q21-22 .
We now report the results of an extended linkage analysis including 95 new multiplex <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> families and 9 additional microsatellite markers resulting in a maximum LOD score of 2 .99 at approximately 81-82 cM for all 453 pedigrees .
Results from these 95 new pedigrees provide additional support for a chromosome 17q21-22 <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> susceptibility gene .
Inclusion of the 9 additional markers significantly reduced the size of the candidate region , as defined using a 1- LOD support interval , especially when focusing analyses on subsets of pedigrees with four or more confirmed affecteds or average age of diagnosis less than or equal to 65 years .
A novel subset analysis of only those families ( n = 147 ) that had four or more <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> cases and an average age of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> diagnosis < or = 65 years results in a maximum LOD score of 5.49 at 78 cM with a 1- LOD support interval of 10 cM .
This large set of pedigrees with four more <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> cases characterized by early-onset disease will serve as a useful resource for identifying the putative 17q21-22 <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> susceptibility gene .
Multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> facial angiofibromas <END> and collagenomas in patients with multiple endocrine <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> type 1 . To evaluate patients with multiple endocrine <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> type 1 ( MEN 1 ) for cutaneous manifestations .
Survey during a 3-year period .
The National Institutes of Health , a tertiary referral research hospital in Bethesda Md . A consecutive sample of 32 individuals with previously diagnosed MEN1 who were not preselected for the presence of skin lesions were examined for cutaneous abnormalities .
None of the patients or family members were diagnosed as having tuberous sclerosis .
Lesions were identified by clinical appearance , photographed , and confirmed histologically .
To determine the frequency of skin lesions in patients with MEN1 .
Multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> facial angiofibromas <END> were observed in 28 ( 88% ) of the patients with MEN1 , with 16 patients (5 0% ) having 5 or more .
Angiofibromas were clinically and histologically identical to those in individuals with tuberous sclerosis .
Collagenomas were observed in 23 patients ( 72% ) .
Also observed were cafe au lait macules in 12 patients ( 38% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> lipomas <END> in 11 patients ( 34% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> confetti-like hypopigmented macules <END> in 2 patients ( 6% ) , and multiple gingival papules in 2 patients ( 6% ) .
Multiple angiofibromas , collagenomas , <START:PHENOTYPE> lipomas <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> confetti-like hypopigmented macules <END> and multiple gingival papules are cutaneous manifestations of MEN1 and should be looked for in both family members of patients with MEN1 and individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> of other MEN1-associated tumors .
Multiple angiofibromas can no longer be considered pathognomonic for tuberous sclerosis .
The observation of angiofibromas in individuals without tuberous sclerosis necessitates further biochemical testing for MEN1 .
Familial progressive supranuclear palsy .
Description of a pedigree and review of the literature .
We describe a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) involving five generations which was confirmed in one patient .
The proband presented with progressive slowness at age 53 years , followed by ocular palsy , loss of balance , <START:PHENOTYPE> axial dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , and died at age 59 years .
Neuropathological examination revealed moderate numbers of <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibrillary tangles <END> without prominent senile plaques in the cortex , and <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> and moderate to severe accumulation of tangles in the basal ganglia and brainstem .
Other affected relatives , including the proband 's sister , father , paternal uncle , and other members of earlier generations presented with non-characteristic akinetic syndromes , which progressed towards more typical PSP only after several years of disease .
A review of the literature revealed six other families with neurodegenerative disorders associated with pathological findings compatible with PSP in at least one member .
The clinical symptoms varied greatly between individuals in these families .
The pattern of inheritance seems compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission , although other patterns of transmission could not be excluded .
We conclude that there is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of PSP and that the number of hereditary cases may be greater than previously thought .
The rarity of familial cases of PSP could be attributed to diagnostic problems , including lack of recognition of atypical cases and death of the gene carriers before the age of appearance of the clinical symptoms .
Large families with hereditary PSP could provide an adequate point of departure for investigation of the gene defect responsible for this disease .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Leukonychia <END> partialis .
A phase of <START:PHENOTYPE> leukonychia <END> totalis .
Accumulated evidence indicates that <START:PHENOTYPE> leukonychia <END> striata and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukonychia <END> totalis are distinct entities transmitted by automonal dominant gene .
Much less secure is the status of <START:PHENOTYPE> leukonychia <END> partialis in which the nail is white proximally and pink near its free edge .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Leukonychia <END> totalis and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukonychia <END> partialis have occurred in different members of the same family and on different digits of an individual simultaneously , and either has presented as the clinical manifestation in an individual at different times .
The two conditions are probably expressions of the same genetic defect .
Historically , the term <START:PHENOTYPE> leukonychia <END> totalis has priority over <START:PHENOTYPE> leukonychia <END> partialis and the former form should be used , with the latter considered a variation of it .
Genesis and genetics of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
1 .
The increase in frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> reported during the last decades [ FRANCOIS , 1968 ] is probably not due to an increase of the mutation rate but to a lowered mortality rate and also to improvement in methods of investigation and diagnosis .
(2 ) In 95 % of all affected families <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> occurs just once , the familial occurrence being +/- 5 % . (3 ) The hereditary retinoblastomas ( whether <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> or familial ) represent about 40% of all cases .
(4 ) A new dominant mutation is judged to be responsible for 100% of the bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases and for 10-20% of the unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases .
(5 ) Genetic susceptibility to cancer can be chromosomal , mendelian dominant , mendelian recessive , or polygenic .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinoblastoma <END> belongs to the first as well as to the second category .
The fact that the chromosomal aberration of the D deletion syndrome antedates the appearance of the tumour suggests that chromosomal change may be the primary cause of the tumour formation .
(6 ) Although several problems remain an unsolved question , attention must be given to KNUDSON ' S working hypothesis [ KNUDSON et al. , 1973 ] , according to which all childhood tumours fit at least a two-mutational aetiology , involving a two-step process .
It remains an open question whether both events occur at different genetic loci or at alleles of the same locus .
(7 ) The main difficulty in genetic counseling is the lack of means for identifying which <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> cases are due to new germinal mutations .
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome caused by TWIST 1 gene mutations : functional differentiation from Muenke coronal synostosis syndrome .
The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome ( SCS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> syndrome with uni- or bilateral coronal synostosis and mild limb deformities .
It is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the TWIST 1 gene .
In an attempt to delineate functional features separating SCS from Muenke 's syndrome , we screened patients presenting with coronal suture synostosis for mutations in the TWIST 1 gene , and for the Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3 .
Within a total of 124 independent pedigrees , 39 ( 71 patients ) were identified to carry 25 different mutations of TWIST 1 including 14 novel mutations , to which six whole gene deletions were added .
The 71 patients were compared with 42 subjects from 24 pedigrees carrying the Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3 and 65 subjects from 61 pedigrees without a detectable mutation .
Classical SCS associated with a TWIST 1 mutation could be separated phenotypically from the Muenke phenotype on the basis of the following features : <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set frontal hairline <END> , gross <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> of eyelids , subnormal ear length , dilated <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> , interdigital webbing , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hallux valgus <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> broad great toe <END> with bifid distal phalanx .
Functional differences were even more important : <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial hypertension <END> as a consequence of early progressive multisutural fusion was a significant problem in SCS only , while mental delay and sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> were associated with the Muenke 's syndrome .
Contrary to previous reports , SCS patients with complete loss of one TWIST allele showed normal mental development .
Familial occurrence of the IMAGe association : additional clinical variants and a proposed mode of inheritance .
The IMAGe ( <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> adrenal hypoplasia <END> congenita , genital anomalies ) association ( online inheritance in man 300290 ) is a recently reported disorder comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> ( IUGR) , <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> adrenal hypoplasia <END> , and genital anomalies .
Four children ( three males , one female ) from a large pedigree ( five generations ) were studied .
Additional members ( n = 10 ) , who died during the neonatal period , were born with IUGR and/or hyperpigmentation and are presumed to have been affected , too .
All patients in this series were diagnosed during the newborn period .
Minimal clinical features and laboratory findings differ with previously reported patients , suggesting variants in their clinical expression .
Adrenal insufficiency was variable within patients .
All had severe IUGR and marked <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth failure <END> .
Sequence analysis of DNA using an automated cycle from two patients revealed no mutation in the dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome , gene 1 . Analysis of the pedigree showed that the disease is inherited via the maternal line , even in the dead children with suspicion of the disease .
Hence , the pattern of inheritance in this family of this unusual disorder might be explained in terms of the genomic imprinting hypothesis with expression through maternal transmission involving an autosomal gene .
This transmission may have considerable implications for genetic counseling .
Furthermore , pediatric endocrinologists must be aware of the possible occurrence of this life-threatening condition in the offspring of nonaffected women when related to a family member with the association of IUGR , <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> adrenal hypoplasia <END> congenita , genital anomalies .
NPHS3 : new clues for understanding idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Hereditary forms of childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> ( H-CHNS ) have long been counted as rare variants of steroid-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> ( SRNS ) .
This concept must be specified by two new findings : First , a study on <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> manifesting in the first year of life documents that H-CHNS are actually the predominant cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> in infants .
Second , the recent identification of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> type 3 ( NPHS3 ) caused by mutations in the phospholipase PLCE1 gene has , for the first time , shown steroid responsiveness in H-CHNS .
NPHS3 is a severe form of isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> with rapid progression to terminal renal failure .
NPHS3 is caused by a developmental rather than structural podocyte dysfunction and is a major cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse mesangial sclerosis <END> .
Therapy response in NPHS3 is documented and could open insights into direct genomic and nongenomic effects of glucocorticoids on podocytes .
The findings on NPHS3 support the idea that both clinical course and histology in H-CHNS are subject to genotypic variability and that mutational analysis is the most reliable diagnostic tool .
Future studies are needed to determine the clinical implications of NPHS3 .
Identification of further variants of H-CHNS can be anticipated and may include steroid-responsive hereditary diseases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and epilepsy ( ADCME ) with complex partial and generalized seizures : A newly recognized epilepsy syndrome with linkage to chromosome 2p11 .1-q12 .2 .
We describe a pedigree in which eight individuals presented with a non-progressive disorder with onset between the ages of 12 and 50 years .
It was characterized by predominantly distal , semi-continuous rhythmic <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> ( all patients) , <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized tonic-clonic seizures <END> ( all patients ) and complex partial seizures ( three patients ) .
Most individuals had rarely suffered seizures and had a normal cognitive level , but three individuals with intractable seizures had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The pattern of inheritance was <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> with high penetrance .
We defined this disorder as <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and epilepsy ( ADCME ) .
All patients had frontotemporal as well as generalized interictal EEG abnormalities .
A neurophysiological study of the <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> suggested a cortical origin .
Back-averaging of the data generated a series of waves with a frequency that mirrored the frequency of EMG bursts .
Frequency analysis identified significant peaks with coherence between EMG and EEG , which were recorded over the contralateral rolandic area in five patients .
The frequency of coherence was 8-25 Hz and phase spectra confirmed that EEG activity preceded EMG activity by 8-15 ms .
In two individuals there was also significant coherence between the ipsilateral EEG and EMG , consistent with the transcallosal spread of myoclonic activity .
The C-reflex at rest was enhanced and somatosensory and visual evoked potentials were of high amplitude .
The resting motor threshold intensity to transcranial magnetic stimulation was significantly reduced ( 38 % ; SD +/- 7 ; P = 0.01 ) and the post-motor evoked potential silent period (101 ms ; SEM +/- 10 ) was significantly shortened compared with the controls ( 137 ms ; SEM +/- 18 ) .
These clinical and neuro- physiological characteristics suggest diffuse cortical hyperexcitability and high propensity for intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric cortical spread , as well as rhythmic myoclonic activity .
Genome-wide linkage analysis identified a critical region spanning 12 .4 cM between markers D2S2161 and D2S1897 in 2p11 .1-q12 .2 , with a maximum two-point LOD score of 3.46 at Theta 0.0 for marker D2S2175 .
Multipoint LOD score values , reaching 3.74 around D2S2175 , localize the ADCME gene to the centromeric region of chromosome 2 .
The exclusion of the locus for familial adult myoclonic epilepsy on chromosome 8q23.3-q24 from linkage to our family and the new localization of the responsible gene to chromosome 2cen , together with the different phenotype , define a new epilepsy syndrome .
We hypothesize that the responsible gene causes cortical hyperexcitability that is widespread but particularly involves the frontotemporal circuits .
Eye movements in chorea-acanthocytosis .
To describe the eye movement abnormalities in patients with chorea-acanthocytosis ( ChAc) , a form of neuroacanthocytosis .
This <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , neurodegenerative disorder with aberrant erythrocyte morphology ( <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> ) is caused by mutations in the VPS13A gene .
In contrast to Huntington 's disease ( for which ChAc has occasionally been mistaken ) , ocular involvement in ChAc has not been systematically studied .
Three patients aged 26 , 30 , and 44 years with ChAc and six normal volunteers aged 31 to 48 years were included .
Patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> chorea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , cognitive abnormalities , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> .
All had heterozygous VPS13A mutations and degeneration of the basal ganglia on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) typical of ChAc .
Patients had an extensive clinical and laboratory work-up .
Neuro-ophthalmic examinations and eye movement recordings made with the magnetic search coil technique assessed patients ' fixation characteristics , horizontal and vertical saccades , pursuit , and antisaccades .
These were compared to the data of control subjects .
Patients exhibited more than 30 square-wave jerks ( small saccadic intrusions ) per minute , versus 0 to 8 in the control subjects , as well as fractionated ( multistep ) and hypometric horizontal and vertical saccades .
Decreased saccadic peak-velocity and reduced saccadic range were more pronounced for vertical saccades .
Pursuit testing performed in two patients showed low gain .
Results of antisaccade testing done in one patient were abnormal .
The findings suggest brain stem involvement as an additional site of neurodegeneration outside the basal ganglia in ChAc .
Patients with this progressive , intractable disease have pronounced ocular motor abnormalities .
Eye movement recordings could assist in diagnosing ChAc , monitoring its progression and possible treatment evaluation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> , regression , and the broader <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> phenotype .
The broader <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> phenotype ( BAP ) is a subclinical set of personality and other features that is thought to index familiality and/or genetic liability to <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Eighteen parents of autistic probands with a history of language regression and 70 parents of autistic probands without regression were assessed for features of the BAP and compared with published rates in parents of nonautistic subjects .
Parents of probands with regressive and nonregressive <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> demonstrated similar rates of the BAP ( 27.8 % vs . 32 .9% ; P = 0.33 ) .
The rate of the BAP was significantly higher in both groups of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> parents than in parents of nonautistic subjects ( P < or = 0.01 ) .
Thus , this measure of genetic liability is increased equally in families with both forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> when compared with controls .
Environmental events are therefore unlikely to be the sole cause of regressive <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> in our sample .
Environmental events , however , may act in an additive or " second-hit " fashion in individuals with a genetic vulnerability to <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .

Usher syndrome 1D and nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> DFNB12 are caused by allelic mutations of the novel cadherin-like gene CDH23.
Genes causing nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> ( DFNB12 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> vestibular dysfunction <END> ( USH1D ) were previously mapped to overlapping regions of chromosome 10q21-q22 .
Seven highly consanguineous families segregating nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> were analyzed to refine the DFNB12 locus .
In a single family , a critical region was defined between D10S1694 and D10S1737 , approximately 0.55 cM apart .
Eighteen candidate genes in the region were sequenced .
Mutations in a novel cadherin-like gene , CDH23 , were found both in families with DFNB12 and in families with USH1D .
Six missense mutations were found in five families with DFNB12 , and two nonsense and two frameshift mutations were found in four families with USH1D .
A northern blot analysis of CDH23 showed a 9.5-kb transcript expressed primarily in the retina .
CDH23 is also expressed in the cochlea , as is demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction amplification from cochlear cDNA .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Immotile cilia <END> syndrome : a new cause of neonatal respiratory distress .
Kartagener 's syndrome is a condition that consists of <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sinusitis <END> .
Some patients have respiratory symptoms that date from early infancy , and electron microscopical examination has shown that adults with this condition lack dynein arms in ciliary microtubules .
It has been suggested that an inherited defect in ciliary ultrastructure , the <START:PHENOTYPE> immotile cilia <END> , is the basis for the syndrome .
We report 6 patients who presented within the first 24 hours of life with tachypnoea , retraction , rales , and dextrocardia .
Five of them had <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> .
They all responded to physiotherapy after antibiotics had failed to improve their condition .
Electron microscopical examination of the cilia in 2 of the infants confirmed deficiency of dynein arms .
All 6 infants had recurrent respiratory infections .
Four went on to develop recurrent otitis media , 2 had <START:PHENOTYPE> sinusitis <END> , and 1 now has <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> immotile cilia <END> syndrome should be added to the list of causes of respiratory distress in newborn infants .
The condition is worth diagnosing because of the good response to physiotherapy , and because of the likelihood of recurrent respiratory problems .
Familial isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> associated with a translocation involving chromosomes 11 and 22 [t(11 ;22)( p13;q12 .2)] .
Isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> segregated as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait in a family with 11 affected members spanning five generations .
Four of the eight individuals studied had <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
Cytogenetic studies revealed an apparently balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 [t(11 ;22)( p13;q12 .2)] , while four unaffected relatives had normal karyotypes .
There is no evidence of Wilms tumor or genitourinary abnormalities in any members of the family .
Restriction enzyme analysis of the human catalase gene revealed no abnormalities in the individuals with the translocation .
A summary of phenotypic abnormalities in 61 cases associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> is presented , as well as a comparison of breakpoints in 44 cases of 11p deletion .
These data indicate that single breaks at 11p13 are associated with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , while deletion of 11p13 results in <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> combined with Wilms tumor , genitourinary abnormalities , and/or mental retardation .
ATP13A2 missense mutations in juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and young onset Parkinson disease . To assess the prevalence , nature , and associated phenotypes of ATP13A2 gene mutations among patients with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> ( onset <21 years ) or young onset ( between 21 and 40 years ) Parkinson disease ( YOPD ) .
We studied 46 patients , mostly from Italy or Brazil , including 11 with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and 35 with YOPD .
Thirty-three cases were sporadic and 13 had positive family history compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Forty-two had only parkinsonian signs , while four ( all juvenile-onset ) had multisystemic involvement .
The whole ATP13A2 coding region ( 29 exons ) and exon-intron boundaries were sequenced from genomic DNA .
A novel homozygous missense mutation ( Gly504Arg ) was identified in one sporadic case from Brazil with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
This patient had symptoms onset at age 12 , levodopa-responsive severe akinetic-rigid <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , levodopa-induced motor fluctuations and dyskinesias , severe visual <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> , and supranuclear vertical gaze paresis , but no pyramidal deficit nor <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Brain CT scan showed moderate diffuse atrophy.
Furthermore , two Italian cases with YOPD without atypical features carried a novel missense mutation ( Thr12 Met , Gly533Arg ) in single heterozygous state .
We confirm that ATP13A2 homozygous mutations are associated with human <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , and expand the associated genotypic and clinical spectrum , by describing a homozygous missense mutation in this gene in a patient with a phenotype milder than that initially associated with ATP13A2 mutations ( Kufor-Rakeb syndrome ) .
Our data also suggest that ATP13A2 single heterozygous mutations might be etiologically relevant for patients with YOPD and further studies of this gene in Parkinson disease are warranted .
Familial lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep apnea <END> .
Three of six siblings presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep apnea <END> between 18 and 26 months of age .
Twin females and a male had normal growth and development without antecedent neurologic or apparent metabolic disorder .
The females presented at 25 and 27 months respectively with <START:PHENOTYPE> irregular respiration <END> and episodes of apnea .
Twin A succumbed to an apneic episode while sleeping .
Central <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep apnea <END> was diagnosed in twin B at the Stanford Sleep Clinic .
She died following an apneic episode three months after evaluation .
The male presented at 18 months with fatal <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep apnea <END> .
A fourth child was evaluated for <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep apnea <END> at 7 weeks of age with several hospitalizations before her death at 31 months .
She and remaining family members were extensively studied for inherited neurologic disorders including subacute necrotizing encephalomyopathy ( SANE , Leigh disease ) .
This family with lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep apnea <END> presents an association with SANE with minimal neurologic signs and symptoms and neuropathologic involvement .
Lesions were confined to the respiratory centers of the lower brain stem , making <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep apnea <END> explicable .
This child and family members tested positive or borderline for inhibitor substance thiamine triphosphate ( TTP ) .
All testing for TTP inhibitor substance was performed in Professor Jack R . Cooper 's laboratory , Department of Pharmacology , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , Conn . These cases present an interesting and instructive lesson emphasizing the need for extensive evaluation of children with unsuspected <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep apnea <END> with early demise .
A new type of <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal chondrodysplasia <END> maps to Xq25-q27.
The authors report a three-generation family with four male patients presenting with a novel type of X-chromosomal <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> associated with skeletal abnormalities .
The index patient and his brother reached their early motor milestones in due time and had normal language development .
Between the ages of 2 and 3 years , first signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> were noticed .
Furthermore , the patients developed <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , ataxia , optic atrophy , and spastic tetraparesis .
Both boys had broad wrists and knees without significant contractures .
A maternal uncle and a granduncle had the same disease .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Leukoencephalopathy <END> ( MRI , MRS ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal chondrodysplasia <END> ( X-ray , MRI ) were diagnosed .
MRS showed a reduction of choline-containing compounds in the white matter .
An autopsy on one of the patients , who died at age 37 years , revealed an orthochromatic type of leukoencephalopathy.
In bone and cartilage tissue , unspecific signs of a mild chondrodysplasia were found .
At the PLP gene locus an obligate recombination was observed , which excludes the Pelizaeus-Merzbacher locus on Xq21-22 .
However , affected males share a fragment of the long arm of chromosome X . The authors report a new type of <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal chondrodysplasia <END> located on Xq25-q27.
Clinical spectrum associated with recurrent genomic rearrangements in chromosome 17q12 .
Deletions in chromosome 17q12 encompassing the HNF1 beta gene cause cystic renal disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> maturity onset diabetes of the young <END> , and have been recently described as the first recurrent genomic deletion leading to diabetes .
Earlier reports of patients with this microdeletion syndrome have suggested an absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> , differentiating it from most other contiguous gene deletion syndromes .
The reciprocal duplication of 17q12 is rare and has been hypothesized to be associated with an increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We conducted a detailed clinical and molecular characterization of four patients with a deletion and five patients with a reciprocal duplication of this region .
Our patients with deletion of 17q12 presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> , cystic renal disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and structural abnormalities of the brain .
Patients with reciprocal duplications manifest with <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> and behavioral abnormalities , but not with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Our findings expand the phenotypic spectrum associated with rearrangements of 17q12 and show that <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> is a part of the phenotype of individuals with deletions of 17q12 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Tracheoesophageal fistula <END> , gastrointestinal abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> prenatal growth deficiency <END> .
We studied 2 sibs , born to consanguineous parents , who presented with an MCA pattern which includes low birthweight , <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheoesophageal fistula <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> duodenal atresia <END> , extrahepatic biliary atresia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic pancreas <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> .
This constellation of congenital anomalies appears to be a previously unreported <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
A computerized search of the data files of the Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations ( ECEMC ) identified 3 other unrelated infants with intestinal atresias , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , and low birth weight .
These cases may represent a milder expression of the same syndrome .
Mutations in PTPRQ are a cause of autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> DFNB84 and associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> vestibular dysfunction <END> .
We identified overlapping homozygous regions within the DFNB84 locus in a nonconsanguineous Dutch family and a consanguineous Moroccan family with sensorineural autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> ( arNSHI ) .
The critical region of 3.17 Mb harbored the PTPRQ gene and mouse models with homozygous mutations in the orthologous gene display severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> .
We show that the human PTPRQ gene was not completely annotated and that additional , alternatively spliced exons are present at the 5 ' end of the gene .
Different PTPRQ isoforms are encoded with a varying number of fibronectin type 3 ( FN3 ) domains , a transmembrane domain , and a phosphatase domain .
Sequence analysis of the PTPRQ gene in members of the families revealed a nonsense mutation in the Dutch family and a missense mutation in the Moroccan family .
The missense mutation is located in one of the FN3 domains .
The nonsense mutation results in a truncated protein with only a small number of FN3 domains and no transmembrane or phosphatase domain .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hearing loss <END> in the patients with PTPRQ mutations is likely to be congenital and moderate to profound and most severe in the family with the nonsense mutation .
Progression of the <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> was observed in both families .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> is accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> vestibular dysfunction <END> in all affected individuals .
Although we show that PTPRQ is expressed in many tissues , no symptoms other than <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> were observed in the patients .

Preferential mutation of paternally derived RB gene as the initial event in <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> .
Successive loss of function of both alleles of the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> susceptibility gene ( RB ) on human chromosome 13 seems to be critical in the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> .
In cases where the tumour is familial and susceptibility is inherited , a mutation in one of the alleles is carried in the germline .
We have recently shown that cytogenetically visible germline mutations are usually in the paternally derived gene .
Such a bias would not be expected for <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> ( non-familial ) tumours , where both mutations occur in somatic tissue , but there has been some indication of a bias towards initial <START:PHENOTYPE> somatic mutation <END> in the paternally derived gene on chromosome 11 in <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> Wilms tumour .
We have now examined 13 <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> osteosarcomas and find evidence which indicates that in 12 cases the initial mutation was in the paternal gene , suggesting the involvement of germinal imprinting in producing the differential susceptibility of the two genes to mutation .
Ophthalmic findings in Angelman syndrome .
To provide detailed information about opthalmological findings in a group of patients with Angelman syndrome ( AS ) .
Consecutive patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of AS were submitted to ophthalmic and orthoptic examinations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Strabismus <END> , visual acuity , cycloplegic refraction , and iris and fundus pigmentation were evaluated .
Parents were also examined to compare the extent of fundus pigmentation .
A total of 34 patients were identified , representing 3 genetic classes : deletion , uniparental disomy , and mutation .
Ametropia >1 D was present in 97 % of cases : <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> in 9% , hyperopia in 76 % , and astigmatism in 94 % .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myopia <END> and anisometropia were found only in the genetic deletion group .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Strabismus <END> , most frequently <START:PHENOTYPE> exotropia <END> , was found in 24 patients ( 75% ) .
Ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> was observed in 18 subjects ( 53% ) , with choroidal involvement in 3 cases and isolated iris involvement in 4 . <START:PHENOTYPE> Hypopigmentation <END> was observed in all of the 3 genetic classes .
Ophthalmic alterations in AS were observed more frequently than has been previously reported , except for ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> , which was observed less frequently .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Ichthyosis <END> has been classified on a genetic basis .
Four varieties--ichthyosiform <START:PHENOTYPE> erythroderma <END> , lamellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , Refsum 's syndrome and the SjÃ¶gren-Larsson syndrome--are inherited as <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> traits .
One type is inherited as a sex-linked recessive trait while another variety of <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> ( with or without atopy) , bullous ichthyosiform <START:PHENOTYPE> erythroderma <END> , and very rarely <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> hystrix are due to <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> genes .
Prenatal diagnosis of Opitz ( BBB ) syndrome in the second trimester by ultrasound detection of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> .
Prenatal diagnosis in a kindred with the Opitz ( BBB ) syndrome is presented .
The inheritance is consistent with either autosomal dominant inheritance with sex limited expression or X-linked inheritance .
The abnormalities in the kindred consist of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , ambiguous genitalia , urocolic fistula , <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , mental retardation , diaphragmatic hernia , and malrotation with volvulus .
A male fetus at 19 weeks was found by ultrasound to have <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> with a small phallus consistent with the syndrome .
The diagnosis was confirmed by pathologic examination after pregnancy termination .
This is the first report of prenatal diagnosis of Opitz syndrome by ultrasonographic demonstration of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> in the second trimester .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Polycystic kidney disease <END> re-evaluated : a population-based study .
A genetic register of all known cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> occurring in South and Mid-Wales has been established .
In a population of 2.1 million , 209 families with affected members were identified , 303 of whom are currently alive , 70 on renal replacement therapy .
An additional 551 cases would be predicted amongst family members at 50 per cent and 25 per cent risk , giving an apparent prevalence of 1:2459 in the general population .
Five possible new mutations were seen where adults with phenotypic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> had both parents alive , age greater than 55 years with no cysts visible on ultrasound .
The take-on rate for renal replacement therapy increased during 197 0-79 but has apparently reached a plateau of 4.8 cases per million population per year over the last 8 years , despite a rapidly increasing acceptance of uraemic patients as a whole ( 72 /10(6 ) /year in 1988-89 ) .
Considerably more patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> aged over 50 years were started on treatment in 198 0-89 than in 197 0-79 , but the survival overall improved with time .
All cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> reaching end-stage renal disease are now being treated , but the apparent clinical prevalence of this condition in our region is less than half the supposed gene frequency , suggesting that undiagnosed cases have a benign prognosis .
The spectrum of " complicated <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> , MASA syndrome and X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> " .
Contribution of DNA linkage analysis in genetic counseling of individual families .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> and the X-linked MASA syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Adducted thumbs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Shuffling gait <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Aphasia <END> ) both have a variable clinical spectrum with great overlap.
Data from DNA linkage analysis placed the locus for both conditions at Xq28 . On clinical and molecular grounds it has been hypothesized that both MASA syndrome and X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> are caused by a mutation in the same gene at Xq28 . There is no significant clinical marker in the obligate female carriers and prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound is not reliable ; DNA analysis can offer an improved genetic counseling for the families and more reliable prenatal diagnosis .
In the gene encoding for Ll , a neural cell adhesion molecule and located at Xq28 , several different mutations have been reported in X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> families and in a MASA family .
We report data on DNA linkage analysis in 6 families with X-linked hydrocephalus/MASA syndrome .
These data illustrate the importance of DNA linkage analysis in the individual family ; they also show , however , the problem of studying small families .
Genetic heterogeneity cannot be excluded .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> , hypercalcemia , and von Hippel-Lindau disease .
A ten year study of a large family .
Long-term epidemiological and laboratory studies were carried out in a kindred with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease . Thirteen members were affected by the syndrome and the trait appears to be transmitted in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion .
Of 13 patients , 7 had <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> alone .
Of the remaining six patients , one had <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> combined with von Hippel-Lindau disease , four had <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> with retinal disease only , and a single patient had a retinal lesion without <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> .
In four patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> antedated the development of retinal lesions .
Ten members also had mild hypercalcemia without accompanying elevations of PTH in the 4 patients in whom this was determined .
In all , hypercalcemia was corrected with removal of tumors , and no patient had a return of hypercalcemia in the absence of recurrent increases in urinary catecholamines .
The clinical presentations in 12 patients varied markedly , as did their urinary excretion rates of norepinephrine , epinephrine and their metabolites .
However , an analysis of the data revealed significant correlations not previously described between the urinary excretion of free catecholamines ( norepinephrine plus epinephrine) , blood pressure , the free catecholamine content of the tumor and the age of the patient .
Urinary excretion of free norepinephrine plus epinephrine appear to be decreased with advancing age ( p less than 0.001 ) .
Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures and the age of the patient were inversely correlated ( p less than 0.01 ) .
A significant inverse relationship between the tumor content of free catecholamines and the age of the patients was , although to a lesser degree , also present ( p less than 0.05 ) .
As a whole , the size of the tumors and their norepinephrine content were not correlated .
We present a concept that , in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> , the metabolism of catecholamines is altered by the process of aging , and that this change modifies the clinical presentations of the disease .
A new syndrome with craniofacial and skeletal dysmorphisms and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
We report a 16-year-old boy with multiple craniofacial and skeletal dysmorphic features including brachycephaly , acrocephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , wide palpebral fissures , broad nose , anteverted nares , broad columella , long and <START:PHENOTYPE> smooth philtrum <END> , thin upper lip , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> , carp-like mouth , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , low-set and <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly angulated ears <END> with small and abnormal pinnae , a <START:PHENOTYPE> low posterior hairline <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , hypoplastic and widely-spaced nipples , multiple severe pterygia , an umbilical hernia , metatarsus varus , low implantation of the halluces , and delayed motor and language development .
An MRI of the head showed bilateral frontal <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> but no sign of heterotopia .
The unique features of our patient suggest that he represents a new syndrome .
Further characterization of the new microdeletion syndrome of 16p11 .2-p12 .2 .
Using aCGH , we have identified a pericentromeric deletion , spanning about 8.2 Mb , within 16p11 .2-p12 .2 in a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> ( DD ) and dysmorphic features .
This deletion arose de novo and is flanked by segmental duplications .
The proposita was the only child of healthy nonconsanguineous parents , born after an uneventful pregnancy , at 40 weeks gestation , by normal delivery .
She was referred to us at age 3 10/12 years for evaluation of DD and absent speech .
On examination , there were a <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> ; low-set , <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated ears <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> ; hypotonic face ; right <START:PHENOTYPE> single palmar crease <END> ; long , thin fingers ; and a sacral dimple .
Her height was at the 50th centile , weight at the 25th , and OFC at the 30th .
Results of DNA FraX , HRB chromosomes , metabolic work-up , audiologic evaluation , brain MRI , electroencephalogram , and heart/abdomen ultrasonography were normal .
When last seen , aged 8 years , she had a moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> ( ID) and poor speech .
She was hyperactive with short attention span and difficulty in concentration , but , based on formal testing , did not have <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Our patient shows common clinical features to the four individuals described by Ballif et al . [Ballif et al . (2007 ) ; Nat Genet 39:1071 -1073 ] , and further characterizes the new microdeletion syndrome of 16p11 .2-p12 .2 .
aCGH suggests that the deletions of all cases share the same distal breakpoint .
Of note , the proximal breakpoint of our proposita overlaps the distal breakpoint of the autistic patients studied by Kumar et al . [ Kumar et al . (2008 ) ; Hum Mol Genet 17 :628-638 ] and Weiss et al . [ Weiss et al . (2008 ) ; N Eng J Med 358 :667-675 ] , confirming that the 16p region carrying susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> is more centromeric .
Our observation further defines two different , contiguous 16p genomic regions , responsible for a distinct MCA/ID syndrome , and for <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , respectively .

Skin <START:PHENOTYPE> mastocytosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> : a new syndrome .
A 5 1/2-year-old Sephardic Jewish girl , born of consanguineous parents , is described .
She has <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> , skin <START:PHENOTYPE> mastocytosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> .
Since this constellation of findings has not been reported previously , we think that these findings represent a new congenital malformation , most probably of genetic etiology .
Clericuzio type <START:PHENOTYPE> poikiloderma <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is distinct from Rothmund-Thomson syndrome .
Two siblings from a consanguineous family presented with a <START:PHENOTYPE> poikiloderma <END> of limbs and face , plantar keratoderma , and toenail pachyonychia .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Neutropenia <END> and neutrophil dysfunction with impairment of the respiratory burst and bacterial killing resulted in frequent respiratory tract infections .
A bronchocentric granulomatous pneumonia was a fatal complication .
The clinical presentation is consistent with Clericuzio type <START:PHENOTYPE> poikiloderma <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Literature review identified several additional probable patients .
Genetic linkage analysis excluded the locus of the RECQL4 gene , mutations in which have been described in some patients with the Rothmund-Thomson <START:PHENOTYPE> poikiloderma <END> syndrome .
This report confirms the clinical and genetic identity of the Clericuzio type of <START:PHENOTYPE> poikiloderma <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> syndrome .
Genetics , phenotype , and natural history of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cyclic hematopoiesis .
Cyclic hematopoiesis , ( CH , or cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> ) is a rare disease manifested by transient severe <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> that recurs approximately every 21 days .
The hematologic profile of families with the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> ( ADCH ) has not been well characterized , and it is unknown if the phenotype is distinct from the more common sporadic congenital or acquired forms of CH .
We studied nine ADCH families whose children displayed typical CH blood patterns .
Pedigrees confirmed dominant inheritance without evidence of heterogeneity or decreased penetrance ; three pedigrees suggested new mutations .
Families were Caucasian with exception of one with a Cherokee Native American founder : A wide spectrum of symptom severity , ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening illness , was observed within families .
The phenotype changed with age .
Children displayed typical neutrophil cycles with symptoms of mucosal ulceration , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphadenopathy <END> , and infections .
Adults often had fewer and milder chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> without distinct cycles .
While CH is commonly described as " benign " , four children in three of the nine families died of Clostridium or E . coli colitis , documenting the need for urgent evaluation of <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> .
Misdiagnosis with other neutropenias was common but can be avoided by serial blood counts in index cases .
Genetic counseling requires specific histories and complete blood counts in relatives at risk to assess status regardless of symptoms , especially to determine individuals with new mutations .
We propose diagnostic criteria for ADCH in affected children and adults .
Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment resulted in dramatic improvement of <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> and morbidity .
The differential diagnosis from other forms of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is reviewed .
Fatal CNS dysgenesis with severe microencephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and paucity of myelin , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait ?
Siblings are reported with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral palsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ; in addition they had progressive or intermittent jaundice and <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> ; they died at 3 and 4 years respectively .
Neuropathological studies in one showed a small brain with an almost complete lack of myelin in cerebral white matter , brain stem , cerebellum and anterolateral parts of the spinal cord .
The condition most likely represents a dysgenesis of myelin (dysmyelination ) , possibly due to an inability of oligodendrocytes to form myelin and/or metabolic defects in the process of myelination .
This <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> condition is probably inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait and may represent a special type of a primary CNS developmental defect .
Neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> , hepatic fibrosis , polycystic kidneys , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital glaucoma <END> : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome ?
We report on two sibs ( of 4 ) with a syndrome of minor facial anomalies , proportionate IUGR , neonatal non-autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> ( NDM) , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> ( CH) , <START:PHENOTYPE> cholestasis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital glaucoma <END> , and polycystic kidneys .
Liver disease progressed to hepatic fibrosis .
The renal disease was characterized by large kidneys and multiple small cysts with deficient corticomedullary junction differentiation and normal kidney function .
The phenotype observed in the two sibs was identical .
Although a combination of liver , kidney , and pancreatic involvement has been described in Ivemark syndrome ( hepato-renal-pancreatic syndrome ) , the coexistence of NDM , CH , and glaucoma in both sibs suggests the possibility that this combination of manifestations describes a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
Mutation analysis for several candidate genes is warranted .

Posterior column ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> in a Japanese family with a novel mutation in FLVCR1 .
Posterior column ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> ( PCARP ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> neurodegenerative disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory ataxia <END> .
Previous studies of PCARP in two families showed a linkage to 1q31-q32 .
However , detailed investigations on the clinical presentations as well as molecular genetics of PCARP have been limited .
Here , we describe a Japanese consanguineous family with PCARP .
Two affected siblings suffered from childhood-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory ataxia <END> .
They also showed mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , which has not been described in patients with PCARP .
Parametric linkage analysis using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays supported a linkage to the same locus .
Target capture and high-throughput sequencing technologies revealed a novel homozygous c.1477 G > C ( G493R ) mutation in FLVCR1 , which cosegregated with the disease .
A recent study has identified three independent mutations in FLVCR1 in the original and other families .
Our results further confirmed that PCARP is caused by mutations in FLVCR1 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , and optic atrophy.
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome ?
Twenty-one families were selected from the published reports in which the propositus had the triad of juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , and optic atrophy.
The data were consistent with the hypothesis of an autosomal gene which , in the homozygote , causes juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and one or more of <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and nerve deafness .
Heterozygotes appear to have an increased probability of developing juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> .
PIK3R1 mutations cause syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> with lipoatrophy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Short stature <END> , hyperextensibility of joints and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> , ocular depression , <START:PHENOTYPE> Rieger anomaly <END> , and teething delay ( SHORT) syndrome is a developmental disorder with an unknown genetic cause and hallmarks that include <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and lack of subcutaneous fat .
We ascertained two unrelated individuals with SHORT syndrome , hypothesized that the observed phenotype was most likely due to de novo mutations in the same gene , and performed whole-exome sequencing in the two probands and their unaffected parents .
We then confirmed our initial observations in four other subjects with SHORT syndrome from three families , as well as 14 unrelated subjects presenting with syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and/or generalized lipoatrophy associated with dysmorphic features and growth retardation .
Overall , we identified in nine affected individuals from eight families de novo or inherited PIK3R1 mutations , including a mutational hotspot ( c.1945 C > T [p.Arg649Trp] ) present in four families .
PIK3R1 encodes the p85Î± , p55Î± , and p50Î± regulatory subunits of class IA phosphatidylinositol 3 kinases ( PI3Ks ) , which are known to play a key role in insulin signaling .
Functional data from fibroblasts derived from individuals with PIK3R1 mutations showed severe <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> for both proximal and distal PI3K-dependent signaling .
Our findings extend the genetic causes of severe insulin-resistance syndromes and provide important information with respect to the function of PIK3R1 in normal development and its role in human diseases , including growth delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> Rieger anomaly <END> and other ocular affections , <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , diabetes , paucity of fat , and ovarian cysts .

Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> associated with 13 ;14 chromosomal rearrangement .
Two prepubertal sisters of American Indian origin developed <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> at 8 and 12 years of age .
This familial occurrence , tumor onset prior to puberty , unusual tumor location in one who also had short stature , and ethnic background all suggest an inborn predisposition to bone cancer rather than a chance occurrence .
Rearrangements involving chromosomes #13 and #14 were found in both the surviving proband and mother .
Comparison of the arm ratio and prometaphase G-banding patterns of the rearranged chromosomes suggests either deletion of band 14q11 .2 or pericentric inversion ( with breakpoints at 13q12 and 14q11 .2 ) in the proband 's rearranged chromosome , but not in her mother 's .
Her mother , who had no malignancy , had a typical Robertsonian translocation [t(13 ;14 ) ( p11 ;q11 ) ] .
Three previously reported children with chromosomal abnormalities developed <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> at unusually young ages , younger even than in reported sibships with <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> .
The most frequently detected cytogenetic abnormalities in sarcoma tumor cells involve chromosomes #13 and #14 .
In addition , some cases of bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> and familial unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , which are known to be at increased risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> , are associated with tiny deletions on chromosome #13 . Thus , there may be a causal relationship between constitutional loss or rearrangement of genetic material at these breakpoints on chromosomes #13 or #14 and development of <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> in this family that is similar to that seen in patients with small constitutional chromosomal deletions who develop Wilms ' tumor and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Genetic identity of Marinesco-SjÃ¶gren/myoglobinuria and CCFDN syndromes .
To describe three Gypsy families with Marinesco-SjÃ¶gren syndrome ( MSS) , demyelinating <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> , and recurrent episodes of myoglobinuria in five of the six affected subjects .
Because these families originated from the same genetically isolated founder population as did patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> facial dysmorphism <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> ( CCFDN ) syndrome , and because the two syndromes have clinical manifestations in common , we hypothesized that the two related , albeit distinct , syndromes may represent clinical variants of a single genetic disorder .
Clinical studies were conducted and linkage and haplotype analyses were performed for the three families .
A total of 16 individuals , including the 6 with MSS and 10 unaffected relatives , were genotyped for six polymorphic microsatellite markers from the CCFDN region on 18qter .
Linkage analysis of markers in the 18qter region , where we previously had located the CCFDN gene , produced a lod score of 3.55 , demonstrating colocalization of the gene responsible for MSS with demyelinating <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> and myoglobinuria with the CCFDN gene .
Moreover , the patients with MSS shared the conserved marker haplotype found in CCFDN chromosomes .
These data suggest that Marinesco-SjÃ¶gren syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral neuropathy <END> and myoglobinuria , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> facial dysmorphism <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> syndrome are genetically identical and are caused by a single founder mutation .
Intractable infant <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> associated with phenotypic abnormalities and immunodeficiency .
We report on eight children with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> beginning in the first 6 months of life ( < 1 month in six cases) , who had a number of features in common .
All were <START:PHENOTYPE> small for gestational age <END> and had an abnormal phenotype , including facial dysmorphism , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and woolly , easily removable hair with trichorhexis nodosa .
Two were products of consanguineous marriages .
Severe secretory <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> persisted despite bowel rest ( n = 7 ) . Jejunal biopsy specimens showed total or subtotal <START:PHENOTYPE> villous atrophy <END> with crypt necrosis , and inconstant T- cell activation in some cases ( n = 3 ) . Colon biopsy specimens showed moderate nonspecific colitis .
All the patients had defective antibody responses despite normal serum immunoglobulin levels , and defective antigen-specific skin tests despite positive proliferative responses in vitro .
Three had monoclonal hyper-immunoglobulinemia A .
The course was marked by diffuse erythroderma in two cases and mental retardation in three .
Treatment included bowel rest , intravenous administration of immune globulins , administration of corticosteroids ( n = 6 ) and cyclosporine ( n = 2) , and bone marrow transplantation ( n = 1 ) . Five patients died between the ages of 2 and 5 years ( of sepsis or <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> ) , two are being fed enterally , and one continues to receive total parenteral nutrition .
The cause of the combined <START:PHENOTYPE> low birth weight <END> , dysmorphism , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , trichorrhexis , and immunodeficiency is unclear .
These features may constitute a specific syndrome within the group of intractable diarrheas of infancy .
The OTF3 gene polymorphism confers susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> independent of the association of HLA-Cw*0602 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Psoriasis <END> has been strongly associated to HLA-Cw6 , but it remains unclear whether Cw6 itself or a closely linked gene is associated with the disease .
The aim of this study was to clarify whether the HLA- C itself determines disease susceptibility or whether it acts only as a marker for the susceptibility allele .
We examined a sample of 95 type I <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> patients and 104 Spanish matched controls to investigate whether HLA-Cw*0602 or other closely related class I loci , such as HLA- B and MICA ( which are centromeric to HLA-C) , or corneodesmosin gene and octamer transcription factor-3 genes ( which are telomeric to HLA-C) , might play a part in disease development .
DNA samples were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction/sequence-specific primers ( HLA-C) , polymerase chain reaction/sequence-specific primers ( HLA-B) , radioactive polymerase chain reaction ( MICA-TM polymorphism in the transmembrane region ) , and polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism ( protein S and octamer transcription factor-3 ) .
Our results show a significant increase of Cw*0602 in <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> patients ( odds ratio = 3.64 ; pc < 0.0006 ) .
A significant association between the beta allele of octamer transcription factor-3 ( HindIII) and <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> was also detected ( odds ratio = 3.76 ; pc < 0.0003 ) .
The allele octamer transcription factor-3B ( etiologic fraction = 0.62 ) was found to be more strongly associated to <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> vulgaris than Cw*0602 ( etiologic fraction = 0.35 ) and the increase of octamer transcription factor-3 B allele is independent of the linkage disequilibrium with Cw*0602 as this was also found in Cw*0602 negative patients ( odds ratio = 3.63 ; pc < 0.015 , etiologic fraction = 0.55 ) .
We did not detect an association between the corneodesmosin gene and <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
This fact suggests that the <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> susceptibility gene is located within a critical region of 147 kb , telomeric to HLA- C and centromeric to the corneodesmosin gene , and the association of Cw6 to <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> may be secondary to linkage disequilibrium .
Germline NF1 mutational spectra and loss-of-heterozygosity analyses in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> and neurofibromatosis type 1 . Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) is a pheochromocytoma-associated syndrome .
Because of the low prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> in NF1 , we ascertained subjects by <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> that also had NF1 in the hope of describing the germline NF1 mutational spectra of NF1- related <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> .
An international registry for NF1-pheochromocytomas was established .
Mutation scanning was performed using denaturing HPLC for intragenic variation and quantitative PCR for large deletions .
Loss-of-heterozygosity analysis using markers in and around NF1 was performed .
There were 37 eligible subjects ( ages 14-70 yr ) .
Of 21 patients with corresponding tumor available , 67 % showed somatic loss of the nonmutated allele at the NF1 locus vs . 0 of 12 sporadic tumors ( P = 0.0002 ) .
Overall , 86 % of the 37 patients had exonic or splice site mutations , 14 % large deletions or duplications ; 79 % of the mutations are novel .
The cysteine-serine rich domain ( CSR ) was affected in 35 % but the RAS GTPase activating protein domain ( RGD ) in only 13% .
There did not appear to be an association between any clinical features , particularly <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> presentation and severity , and NF1 mutation genotype .
The germline NF1 mutational spectra comprise intragenic mutations and deletions in individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> and NF1 . NF1 mutations tended to cluster in the CSR over the RAS-GAP domain , suggesting that CSR plays a more prominent role in individuals with NF1-pheochromocytoma than in NF1 individuals without this tumor .
Loss-of-heterozygosity of NF1 markers in NF1- related <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> was significantly more frequent than in sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> , providing further molecular evidence that <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> is a true component of NF1 .
Mevalonate kinase deficiency : enlarging the clinical and biochemical spectrum .
Mevalonic aciduria as a result of mevalonate kinase deficiency is an inborn error of cholesterol biosynthesis characterized by dysmorphology , <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive cerebellar ataxia <END> , and recurrent febrile crises , usually manifesting in early infancy , accompanied by hepatosplenomegaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphadenopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthralgia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> skin rash <END> .
The febrile crises are similar to those observed in hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome ( HIDS ) .
Pathogenic mutations in the mevalonate kinase gene in both disorders have demonstrated a common genetic basis .
Our aim was to describe the clinical picture of adolescent patients with mevalonate kinase deficiency and to expand the clinical and biochemical spectrum of mevalonate kinase deficiency , particularly with regard to HIDS .
We report the clinical history and biochemical findings of 3 patients with mevalonic aciduria .
In 2 siblings with mevalonic aciduria , a 15 -year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy , the phenotype shifted with age .
Ataxia has become the predominant clinical manifestation , whereas the febrile attacks occur less frequently but as yet have not disappeared .
Both of them show marked elevations of immunoglobulin D ( IgD ) . Psychomotor development is retarded but not regressive .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Short stature <END> developed in both patients .
Additional findings include the development of retinal dystrophy and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> in both of them .
The third patient is a 6-year-old boy who presented at the age of 5 years with cerebellar ataxia and retinal dystrophy.
He is different from all known patients with mevalonic aciduria because of the mild neurologic involvement and because he has never developed febrile crises .
In addition , levels of IgD were repeatedly normal .
The clinical and biochemical spectrum of patients with mevalonic aciduria is heterogeneous .
Manifestations of the disease seem to be age dependent , as evident from this first report of adolescent patients .
In patients who survive infancy , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , ataxia caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> , and ocular involvement with retinal dystrophy become predominant findings .
Recurrent febrile crises seem to diminish with increasing age and may not even be an obligatory finding .
Elevation of IgD is most likely a secondary phenomenon that seems to be linked to recurrent febrile crises .
PAX4 mutations in Thais with <START:PHENOTYPE> maturity onset diabetes of the young <END> .
Six <START:PHENOTYPE> maturity onset diabetes of the young <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> ) genes have been discovered to date but account for a small proportion of <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> among Asians , suggesting the existence of other <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> genes in this racial group .
The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not genetic variants in PAX4 , a crucial transcription factor in beta-cell development , contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> in Thais .
We screened PAX4 coding sequences in 46 <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> probands without mutation in known <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> genes and in 74 nondiabetic controls using PCR-single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis followed by direct sequencing .
Genotyping of variants identified was done by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis .
Eight sequence differences were identified .
Two novel variations ( R164 W and IVS7-1G>A ) were found in two different probands .
Neither was found in the 74 nondiabetic controls and additional 270 healthy subjects of Thai origin .
R164W segregated with diabetes in the family of the proband and in vitro studies showed that it impairs the repressor activity of PAX4 on the insulin and glucagon promoters .
The remaining six variants were previously described and observed in both groups .
One of them , R192H , was three times more frequent in <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> probands than in 342 nondiabetic controls ( minor allele frequency = 0.196 vs . 0.064 ; P < 0.00001 ) .
The same variant was associated with a younger age at diagnosis among 254 Thai subjects with adult-onset type 2 diabetes ( 44.6 +/- 15 vs . 49.7 +/- 11 yr ; P = 0.048 ) .
We have identified two possible pathogenic mutations of PAX4 , R164W , and IVS7-1G>A .
For one of these , we have shown evidence of segregation with diabetes and a functional impact on PAX4 activity .
Single-nucleotide polymorphism R192H might influence the age at onset of diabetes .
Dermo-distortive <START:PHENOTYPE> urticaria <END> : an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> dermatologic disorder .
A new hereditary physical <START:PHENOTYPE> urticaria <END> , dermo-distortive <START:PHENOTYPE> urticaria <END> ( DDU) , is described in a Christian Lebanese family .
DDU is characterized by the appearance of pruritic , erythematosus , edematous , cutaneous swelling confined to the stimulated area in response to stimuli that vibrate or stretch the skin in a repetitive manner .
The lesions appear within several minutes after stimulation and disappear within an hour .
Extensive stimulation causes not only local <START:PHENOTYPE> urticaria <END> but also a systemic response of faintness , headache , and <START:PHENOTYPE> facial erythema <END> .
Other than these annoying reactions , no other morbidity is associated with this disorder .
While this disorder is certainly uncommon and its manifestations are more annoying than life threatening , it may be an important example of a heritable defect of inflammation control mechanisms .
Although the mediator for the <START:PHENOTYPE> urticaria <END> and systemic response was not isolated , a likely candidate is histamine .
Computer analysis of the phenotype of 219 relatives in 6 generations shows that DDU is transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait with high penetrance .
DDU is clinically distinct from hereditary angioneurotic edema , pressure <START:PHENOTYPE> urticaria <END> , and dermographia .
It is similar to vibratory angioedema ( VA) , but sufficient evidence to prove that DDU and VA are identical is not available .
ARHGDIA: a novel gene implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> arises from a defect in the glomerular filtration barrier that permits the unrestricted passage of protein across the barrier , resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminaemia <END> , and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> .
While most cases are due to mutations in one of five genes , in up to 15 % of cases , a genetic cause is not identified .
We investigated two sisters with a presumed recessive form of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Whole exome sequencing identified five genes with diallelic mutations that were shared by the sisters , and Sanger sequencing revealed that ARHGDIA that encodes Rho GDP ( guanosine diphosphate ) dissociation inhibitor Î± ( RhoGDIÎ± , OMIM 601925 ) was the most likely candidate .
Mice with targeted inactivation of ARHGDIA are known to develop severe <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> , therefore this gene was pursued in functional studies .
The sisters harbour a homozygous in-frame deletion that is predicted to remove a highly conserved aspartic acid residue within the interface where the protein , RhoGDIÎ± , interacts with the Rho family of small GTPases ( c.553_555del( p.Asp185del) ) .
Rho-GTPases are critical regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and when bound to RhoGDIÎ± , they are sequestered in an inactive , cytosolic pool .
In the mouse kidney , RhoGDIÎ± was highly expressed in podocytes , a critical cell within the glomerular filtration barrier .
When transfected in HEK293T cells , the mutant RhoGDIÎ± was unable to bind to the Rho-GTPases , RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 , unlike the wild-type construct .
When RhoGDIÎ± was knocked down in podocytes , RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 were hyperactivated and podocyte motility was impaired .
The proband 's fibroblasts demonstrated mislocalisation of RhoGDIÎ± to the nucleus , hyperactivation of the three Rho-GTPases , and impaired cell motility , suggesting that the in-frame deletion leads to a loss of function .
Mutations in ARHGDIA need to be considered in the aetiology of heritable forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in ocular hypertension with and without pseudoexfoliation .
To compare <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> conversion rates in patients with ocular hypertension ( OH ) with and without pseudoexfoliation .
Cohort study , based on 32 ,918 screening participants .
Ninety-eight patients with OH and pseudoexfoliation and 98 matched controls .
Perimetric <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> conversion .
A population-based <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> screening of elderly citizens of MalmÃ¶ , Sweden , was conducted between 1992 and 1997 to recruit participants for the Early Manifest <START:PHENOTYPE> Glaucoma <END> Trial . Screening participants with intraocular pressure ( IOP ) between 24 and 32 mmHg and pseudoexfoliation were compared to controls among other screening participants without pseudoexfoliation but matched for baseline IOP , age , and gender , and the 2 groups were invited to a reexamination .
Computerized visual field tests were performed to identify persons with manifest <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Visual acuity , refraction , IOP , and central corneal thickness were also measured .
After a mean of 8.7 years ( range : 6.3-11 .4) , 54 of 98 patients (55 .1% ) with pseudoexfoliation at the baseline examination and 27 of 98 patients ( 27.6% ) without pseudoexfoliation had developed <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
The risk ratio was 2.0 ( P< 0.0001 ) .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> conversion rate was twice as high in patients with OH and pseudoexfoliation as in control patients matched for IOP , age , and gender .
Thus , pseudoexfoliation was a strong independent risk factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in patients with OH .
Familial cortical myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> as a unique form of cortical reflex myoclonus .
Previously it was reported that some patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> had the same electrophysiological findings as those seen in patients with cortical reflex myoclonus , and consequently the <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> was named " cortical tremor. "
In the present study , we examined six patients from three families with cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> of relatively late onset .
The inheritance pattern of cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> was compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
Those patients had relatively rhythmic involuntary movements ( <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> ) in the distal upper and lower limbs , especially during posture and/or fine movements .
There was no cerebellar ataxia or dementia , and fits of loss of consciousness occurred only infrequently .
Electrophysiologically , they had generalized spikes on electroencephalogram ( EEG) , giant cortical components of somatosensory evoked potential , an enhanced long-loop reflex ( C-reflex) , and cortical spikes preceding the rhythmic jerk demonstrable by the jerk-locked back averaging method , thus fulfilling the criteria of cortical reflex myoclonus .
Furthermore , they had slow negative EEG shift starting 1-2 s prior to voluntary movements , suggesting that , as opposed to the conventional form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy ( PME) , the cerebellar efferent input to the motor cortices was normal .
These clinical and electrophysiological pictures are distinct from those of familial essential <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , familial essential myoclonus , or the conventional form of PME , and the term " familial cortical myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> " will represent the clinical and electrophysiological features of this unique entity most appropriately .
The natural history of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency .
An international questionnaire survey has been conducted to define better the natural history of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency and permit evaluation of treatment .
Data were compiled for 629 patients .
Among patients not discovered by newborn screening , B6- responsive individuals on the average have significantly better mental capabilities ( mean IQ , 79 ) than do B6-non responsive individuals ( mean IQ , 57 ) . Time-to-event curves are presented for the other major clinical abnormalities produced by this disease . Each occurred at significantly lower rates in untreated B6- responsive than in untreated B6-non responsive patients , as shown by the following examples : (1 ) dislocation of optic lenses ( at age 10 , chances of dislocation : 55 % and 82% , respectively ) ; (2 ) initial clinically detected <START:PHENOTYPE> thromboembolic events <END> ( at age 15 , chances of having had such an event : 12 % and 27% , respectively ) ; (3 ) radiologic detection of spinal <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> ( at age 15 , chances of such <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> having been detected : 36 % and 64% , respectively ) ; and (4 ) mortality ( at age 30 , chances of not surviving : 4% and 23% , respectively ) .
Methionine restriction initiated neonatally prevented <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , retarded the rate of <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> , and may have reduced the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Pyridoxine treatment of late-detected B6- responsive patients retarded the rate of occurrence of initial <START:PHENOTYPE> thromboembolic events <END> .
Following 586 surgical procedures , 25 postoperative thromboembolic complications occurred , six of which were fatal .
Reproductive histories were reported predominantly for B6- responsive patients .
Living offspring of either men or women patients had few abnormalities .
The evidence is inconclusive whether untreated maternal cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency leads to excessive fetal loss .
Only 13% of patients detected in screening programs of newborns and classified as to B6- responsiveness were B6- responsive , compared to 47 % among late-detected patients .
Current screening programs that identify neonatal hypermethioninemia may be preferentially failing to detect B6- responsive patients .
Measles , mumps , and rubella vaccination and bowel problems or developmental regression in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> : population study .
Objectives : To investigate whether measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) vaccination is associated with bowel problems and developmental regression in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , looking for evidence of a " new variant " form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Design : Population study with case note review linked to independently recorded vaccine data .
Setting : Five health districts in north east London .
Participants : 278 children with core <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and 195 with atypical <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , mainly identified from computerised disability registers and born between 1979 and 1998 .
Main outcome measures : Recorded bowel problems lasting at least three months , age of reported regression of the child 's development where it was a feature , and relation of these to MMR vaccination .
Results : The proportion of children with developmental regression ( 25% overall ) or bowel symptoms ( 17% ) did not change significantly ( P value for trend 0.5 0 and 0.47 , respectively ) during the 20 years from 1979 , a period which included the introduction of MMR vaccination in October 1988 .
No significant difference was found in rates of bowel problems or regression in children who received the MMR vaccine before their parents became concerned about their development ( where MMR might have caused or triggered the <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> with regression or bowel problem) , compared with those who received it only after such concern and those who had not received the MMR vaccine .
A possible association between non-specific bowel problems and regression in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> was seen but this was unrelated to MMR vaccination .
Conclusions : These findings provide no support for an MMR associated " new variant " form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> with developmental regression and bowel problems , and further evidence against involvement of MMR vaccine in the initiation of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> amelogenesis imperfecta <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , impaired renal concentration , and possible abnormality of calcium metabolism .
We describe a brother and sister with <START:PHENOTYPE> amelogenesis imperfecta <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired renal concentrating ability <END> .
This is the second sibship reported , further substantiating <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> of this condition .
There is lack of enamel , lifelong nocturnal <START:PHENOTYPE> enuresis <END> , progressive punctate <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , and decreased calcium and phosphate excretion over 24 hours and after an acute load .
Increased serum osteocalcin and decreased urine delta-carboxyglutamic acid suggest involvement of vitamin K-dependent calcium binding proteins , although this may represent a secondary finding .
No other evidence of abnormal calcium metabolism was found .
Renal function is stable in the early teens , but the previously reported patients went on to <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> .
Behavioral disorder , dementia , ataxia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> in a large family with TATA box-binding protein mutation .
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxia caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the TATA box-binding protein gene .
Ataxia is typically the first sign whereas behavioral symptoms occur later .
To characterize the unusual phenotypic expression of a large spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 kindred .
Clinical , neuropathological , and molecular genetic characterization of a 4-generation family with 16 affected patients .
Behavioral symptoms and frontal impairment dominated the early stages preceding ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonic movements <END> .
Neuropathological examination showed cortical , subcortical , and cerebellar atrophy.
Purkinje cell loss and <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> , pseudohypertrophic degeneration of the inferior olive , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> in the caudate nucleus , and in the medial thalamic nuclei were salient features together with neuronal intranuclear inclusions stained with anti-TATA box-binding protein and antipolyglutamine antibodies .
The disease was caused by a stable 52 CAG repeat expansion of the TATA box-binding protein gene , although there was apparent variability in the age of onset .
The characteristics of this family broaden the clinical picture of spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 : initial presenile dementia with behavioral symptoms should be added to ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonic movements <END> , which are more commonly encountered .
The near universal presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorders in children with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome .
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome ( SLOS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition caused by a defect in cholesterol synthesis .
Affected children often have malformations and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Autistic behaviors also are evident .
The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) in children with SLOS .
Fourteen children , 3-16 years old , were evaluated using three different methods to document autistic symptoms : (a ) parent interview , (b ) direct observation , and (c ) a behavior checklist .
Blood sterols were also measured at regular intervals .
Each subject was determined to have Autistic Disorder , Pervasive Developmental Disorder , not otherwise specified ( PDD NOS) , or no diagnosis on the <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum , based on DSM-IV criteria .
Correlations among variables were calculated , and blood sterol levels were compared between diagnostic groups .
Approximately three-fourths of the children with SLOS ( 71 -86 % depending on the evaluation method ) had an ASD , about 5 0 % diagnosed with Autistic Disorder and the rest with PDD NOS .
The children 's baseline cholesterol , 7-dehydrocholesterol ( 7- DHC) , and 8-dehydrocholesterol ( 8-DHC ) levels , and cholesterol levels following supplementation did not correlate with the presence or severity of autistic symptoms .
These results suggest that most children with SLOS have some variant of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
SLOS appears to have the most consistent relationship with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> of any single gene disorder .
Therefore , a link between cholesterol metabolism and <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> is suggested .
With further study , these findings , together with knowledge of the genetic and biochemical defects in SLOS , will likely provide valuable insights into the causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> in general .

Familial clustering of <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus totalis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> syndromes .
We report on a family in which a male infant had the <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> syndrome , a younger brother had the <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> syndrome , and their father had <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus totalis <END> .
The occurrence of the <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and the <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> syndromes in a sibship of the present family and in two other previously reported sibships indicates that the two syndromes are causally and pathogenetically related to each other .
If it is assumed that the father had an incomplete form of the <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> complex , then the condition in this family either is an autosomal dominant trait or is multifactorially determined .
Mapping the gene causing <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> to Xp11 .22 by linkage studies .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> kidney stones <END> and renal tubular dysfunction in childhood progressing to renal failure in adulthood .
The primary defect causing this renal tubular disorder is unknown and determining the chromosomal location of the mutant gene would represent an important step toward defining the biochemical basis .
We have performed linkage studies in 102 members (1 0 affected males , 47 unaffected males , 15 obligate heterozygote females , and 30 unaffected females ) from five generations of one family .
As genetic markers we used 10 cloned human X chromosome fragments identifying restriction fragment length polymorphisms and seven pairs of oligonucleotide primers identifying microsatellite polymorphisms .
Linkage with the locus DXS255 was established with a peak LOD score = 5 .91 at 3.6 % recombination , thereby localizing the <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> gene to the pericentromeric region of the short arm of the X chromosome ( Xp11 .22 ) .
Multilocus analysis indicated that the mutant gene was distal to DXS255 but proximal to the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus on Xp. Thus , the gene that causes <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> maps to the pericentromeric region of the short arm of the X chromosome ( Xp11 .22) , and further characterization of this gene will help to elucidate the factors controlling renal tubular function and mineral homeostasis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Juvenile cataract <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
A study from the Aland Islands , Finland . Juvenile ( including congenital and infantile ) cataract occurs commonly as part of a more generalized or systematic condition , or as a component of a syndrome .
Isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile cataract <END> is a relatively rare disorder and the mode of inheritance is often autosomal dominant .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> transmission of isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile cataract <END> is rare .
The present paper is a report of 15 cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile cataract <END> on the Aland Islands ( Finland ) with about 23,000 inhabitants .
Twelve belong to 7 sibships of two different pedigrees and 3 cases are sporadic , of which we have found no genealogical connections in the last 6-1 0 generations to the two cataracta pedigrees .
One of the sporadic cases presented an operated cleft palate and a chromosomal anomaly .
In another sporadic case the mother probably had been infected with rubella during early gestation .
In the third sporadic case the cataract was combined with partial aniridia , but he has several genealogical connections to one of the cataract pedigrees .
Consanguinity between the parents was detected in 5 of the 7 sibships , in some even on various ancestral levels .
Apart from the cataracts , all patients were healthy , with normal intellect , behavior , hearing , growth and development .
They were neurologically intact and there were no ocular lesions apart from cataract .
In the Alandic familial cases the cataracts appear to be an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
A family branch originating from southwestern Sweden and south Norway showed transmission of the cataract in three successive generations .
The possibility of quasi-dominant inheritance is discussed against the background that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile cataract <END> may not be so rare as the small number of recorded cases would suggest .( ABSTR ACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
A variant of adenomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> with characteristic histology and possible hereditary thyroglobulin abnormality .
A variant type of adenomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> was identified in 24 of 2160 patients with adenomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> who underwent thyroidectomy .
The characteristics of the thyroid gland in these 24 patients included large <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> , small follicles , scant colloid , and columnar follicular cells containing yellow-green granules on hematoxylin-eosin staining .
The thyroid gland was slightly orange-red , and electron microscopic examination showed abundant lysosomes with colloid droplets .
When comparing the features of this group with those of 24 patients with common adenomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> , the incidence of familial predisposition to thyroid diseases in the former group was higher .
The age at the time of detection of <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> was lower , i.e . 17 +/- 15 vs . 44 +/- 17 yr ( P < 0.001 , variant type vs . common type) , the serum total T4 concentrations were lower ( 84 +/- 21 vs . 103 +/- 18 nmol/L ; P < 0.01 ) , and the serum TSH concentrations were higher ( 2.4 +/- 2.1 vs . 1. 0 +/- 0.9 mU/L ; P < 0.01 ) .
Thyroid radioiodine uptake was remarkably increased ( 49 +/- 22 vs . 16 +/- 9% ; P < 0.001 ) , and lower levels of serum thyroglobulin were noted ( 33 +/- 51 vs . 484 +/- 603 micrograms/L ; P < 0.01 ) .
The thyroglobulin content was low in the thyroid gland studied .
The data suggest that the etiology of this variant type of <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> is a hereditary abnormality in thyroglobulin synthesis , and this type of <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> may be distinguished from common adenomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> by the characteristic morphology of the thyroid gland in addition to clinical findings .
Features of a syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
We studied 12 patients from six unrelated families with a syndrome that has an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> pattern of inheritance and can be diagnosed from clinical , histologic , and biochemical characteristics .
The four major symptoms are <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> of voluntary muscles , and exercise-related lactic acidosis .
The patients had bilateral and total cataract in the first weeks of life , underwent cataract surgery , and developed <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> .
Corrected visual acuity was lower than 20/40 in aphakic eyes .
Patients were mentally normal , and at school age they visited a school for blind and visually impaired children .
The majority of the patients developed axial <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> with myopic fundus changes ; aphakic refraction usually was lower than 10.0 diopters after the first decade .
The cardiac <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> was progressive and the cause of premature death .
Three of the 12 patients died in the neonatal period and six patients died in early adulthood .
Deep sequencing reveals 50 novel genes for recessive cognitive disorders .
Common diseases are often complex because they are genetically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> , with many different genetic defects giving rise to clinically indistinguishable phenotypes .
This has been amply documented for early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , one of the most complex disorders known and a very important health care problem worldwide .
More than 90 different gene defects have been identified for X-chromosome-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> alone , but research into the more frequent autosomal forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> is still in its infancy .
To expedite the molecular elucidation of autosomal-recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , we have now performed homozygosity mapping , exon enrichment and next-generation sequencing in 136 consanguineous families with autosomal-recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> from Iran and elsewhere .
This study , the largest published so far , has revealed additional mutations in 23 genes previously implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> or related neurological disorders , as well as single , probably disease-causing variants in 50 novel candidate genes .
Proteins encoded by several of these genes interact directly with products of known <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> genes , and many are involved in fundamental cellular processes such as transcription and translation , cell-cycle control , energy metabolism and fatty-acid synthesis , which seem to be pivotal for normal brain development and function .
Mutations in BCKD-kinase lead to a potentially treatable form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> spectrum disorders are a genetically heterogeneous constellation of syndromes characterized by impairments in reciprocal social interaction .
Available somatic treatments have limited efficacy .
We have identified inactivating mutations in the gene BCKDK ( Branched Chain Ketoacid Dehydrogenase Kinase ) in consanguineous families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> .
The encoded protein is responsible for phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of the E1Î± subunit of branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase ( BCKDH ) .
Patients with homozygous BCKDK mutations display reductions in BCKDK messenger RNA and protein , E1Î± phosphorylation , and plasma branched-chain amino acids .
Bckdk knockout mice show abnormal brain amino acid profiles and neurobehavioral deficits that respond to dietary supplementation .
Thus , <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> caused by BCKDK mutations represents a potentially treatable syndrome .
Caloric restriction in AlstrÃ¶m syndrome prevents <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> .
AlstrÃ¶m syndrome ( AS ; OMIM 203800 ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> cone-rod dystrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural hearing impairment <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and most case had both childhood-onset obesity and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> .
Currently , the pathogenesis of this disease is not clear .
Here we report on an 18-month-old boy with AlstrÃ¶m syndrome .
He had obesity but with normal insulin and glucose levels .
Molecular analysis of the ALMS1 gene revealed a 19 base pair homozygous deletion 11116 _11134del in exon 16 .
His body mass index decreased from 25. 0 to 20.7 after calorie restriction for 9 months , and his insulin and glucose levels remained normal .
Finding in this case suggests that <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> is a secondary event in AlstrÃ¶m syndrome , and early-commenced treatment prevents <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> .
Two novel CCDC88C mutations confirm the role of DAPLE in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> .
Human congenital non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> is a vastly heterogeneous condition .
A subgroup of cases are not secondary to a specific cause ( eg , a neural tube defect ) , and within this subgroup , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> has been described .
One homozygous mutation in the DAPLE ( Dvl-associating protein with a high frequency of leucine residues ) protein-encoding gene CCDC88C ( coiled-coil domain containing 88C ) has recently been reported in a single family .
The role of this gene has not been validated in another family , and no other <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> gene has been reported .
We used homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing in two families with primary , non-syndromic congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> from two different ethnic backgrounds .
In each family , we identified a novel homozygous mutation of CCDC88 C .
One mutation produced a premature stop codon at position 312 of the protein , while the second mutation induced a frameshift in the last exon , producing a stop codon that truncated the extreme C-terminus of DAPLE , including the 2026-2028 Gly-Cys-Val motif known to bind the post synaptic density protein ( PSD95 ) , Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor ( Dlg1 ) , and zonula occludens-1 protein ( zo-1 ) ( PDZ ) domain of Dishevelled .
Our data validate CCDC88C as causing <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , primary non-syndromic congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , suggesting this gene may be an important cause of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , and underscore the important role of the C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif in the DAPLE protein .
Novel deletions of 14q11 .2 associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> and similar minor anomalies in three children .
We identified de novo submicroscopic chromosome 14q11 .2 deletions in two children with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> .
Vancouver patient 5566 has a approximately 200 kb deletion and Vancouver patient 8326 has a approximately 1.6 Mb deletion .
The Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans using Ensembl Resources ( DECIPHER ) revealed a third patient with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> , DECIPHER patient 126 , who has a approximately 1 .1 Mb deletion of 14q11 .2 .
The deletion of patient 5566 overlaps that of patient 126 and both of these deletions lie entirely within that of patient 8326 .
All three children have similar dysmorphic features , including widely-spaced eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , prominent Cupid 's bow of the upper lip , full lower lip and similar auricular anomalies .
The minimal common deletion region on chromosome 14q11 .2 is only approximately 35 kb ( from 20.897 to 20.932 , University of California at Santa Cruz ( UCSC ) Genome Browser ; build hg18 , March 2006 ) and includes only two genes , SUPT16H and CHD8 , which are good candidate genes for the phenotypes .
The non-recurrent breakpoints of these patients , the presence of normal copy number variants in the region and the local genomic structure support the notion that this region has reduced stability .
Acrocallosal syndrome in a girl born to consanguineous parents .
The present report describes on a 1-year-old girl with <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bulging forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> , antimongoloid palpebral slant , convergent <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , atrophy of optic papillae , <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , protruding lips , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , bifid uvula , broad trunk , apparently widely spaced nipples , diastasis recti , small <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tapering fingers <END> , fifth-finger clinodactyly , postaxial polydactyly of the left hand , and bilateral hallux duplication .
Partial agenesis of the corpus callosum and central diffuse cortical cerebral atrophy was documented on computed tomography.
Chromosomes were normal .
Parents were related as half first cousins .
Their previous pregnancy had ended in a miscarriage .
We suggest that this patient has an acrocallosal syndrome inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
This supports other recent reports that have considered this entity to differ from Greig cephalopolysyndactyly .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Craniosynostosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , trigeminal anaesthesia and parietal <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> with pons-vermis fusion anomaly ( atresia of the fourth ventricle ) .
Report of two cases .
A probably new syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , trigeminal anaesthesia , and parietal <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> area associated with pons-vermis fusion anomaly ( atresia of the fourth ventricle) , in two unrelated Mexican girls , is described .
The cerebellar anomaly was proven by CT scan only and it correlated with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
Other abnormalities seen in both patients were midfacial hypoplasia , bilateral corneal opacities , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , mental retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
This disorder could be a new neurocutaneous syndrome .
Two types of autoimmune Addison 's disease associated with different polyglandular autoimmune ( PGA ) syndromes .
A review of 295 patients with autoimmune Addison 's disease which occurred as part of a polyglandular autoimmune syndrome is presented .
Information of 41 cases was obtained from our clinics and from the examination of medical records , while 254 cases were culled from the literature .
We report that autoimmune Addison 's disease in association with other autoimmune diseases occurs in at least two distinct types .
Addison 's disease occurring in Type I polyglandular <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disease <END> ( PGA ) is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis <END> and/or acquired <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> .
The age of onset is predominately in childhood or in the early adult years .
Type I PGA syndrome is also frequently associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic active hepatitis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malabsorption <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile onset <END> pernicious <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> and primary hypogonadism .
Insulin requiring diabetes and/or autoimmune thyroid disease are infrequent .
In contrast , Addison 's disease in Type II PGA is associated with insulin requiring diabetes and/or autoimmune thyroid disease(s ) .
Although the age of onset of Addison 's disease in Type II PGA syndrome is not confined to any age group or any specific sex , it occurs predominately in the middle years of life in females .
The associated autoimmune diseases found in Type I disease , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic active hepatitis <END> , etc . ( see table II) are rare in Type II PGA disease except for a low frequency of gonadal failure .
We provide evidence to support the concept that the Addison 's diseases in Type I and II PGA syndromes have different genetic bases , as related to HLA haplotypes , and possibly have different underlying pathogeneses .
Disease course of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> due to RPGR gene mutations .
To measure the rates of visual acuity , visual field , and ERG loss in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> due to RPGR mutations and to determine whether these rates differ from those of patients with dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> due to RHO mutations .
Snellen visual acuities , Goldmann visual field areas ( V4e white test light) , and 30 Hz ( cone ) full-field ERG amplitudes were recorded for an average of 9.8 years in 113 patients with RPGR mutations .
After censoring data to eliminate ceiling and floor effects , we used longitudinal regression to estimate mean rates of change and to compare these rates with those of a previously studied cohort of 134 patients with dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> due to RHO mutations , who were followed for an average of 8 .9 years .
Survival analysis was used to compare the age distribution of legal blindness in these two groups .
To explain group differences in visual acuity , optical coherence tomograms were recorded in some patients to visualize central retinal structure .
Mean annual exponential rates of decline for the patients with RPGR mutations were 4. 0% for visual acuity , 4.7% for visual field area , and 7.1 % for ERG amplitude .
Each of these rates was significantly different from zero ( P < 0.001 ) .
The rates of visual acuity and visual field loss were significantly faster than the corresponding rates in the RHO patients ( 1.6% , P < 0.001 and 2 .9% , P = 0.002 , respectively) , whereas the rate of ERG amplitude loss was comparable to that in the RHO patients ( 7.7% , P = 0.39 ) .
The median age of legal blindness was 32 years younger in the RPGR patients than in the RHO patients , due primarily to loss of visual acuity rather than to loss of visual field .
Loss of acuity in RPGR patients appeared to be associated with foveal thinning .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> due to RPGR mutations lose visual acuity and visual field more rapidly than do patients with dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> due to RHO mutations .
The inheritance of the exstrophy-epispadias complex .
The inheritance pattern of the exstrophy-epispadias complex was investigated by a combined literature review and a survey of the personal experience of pediatric urologists in North and South America , and Europe .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Bladder exstrophy <END> recurred in only 9 of approximately 2,50 0 families ( 1 in 275 ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> bladder exstrophy <END> or complete <START:PHENOTYPE> epispadias <END> .
The recurrence of the exstrophy-epispadias complex in offspring of parents with <START:PHENOTYPE> bladder exstrophy <END> or complete <START:PHENOTYPE> epispadias <END> has never been described previously .
We identified 215 offspring produced by parents with <START:PHENOTYPE> bladder exstrophy <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> epispadias <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> bladder exstrophy <END> was inherited in 3 of the offspring ( 1 in 70 live births ) .
The recurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> bladder exstrophy <END> in offspring of parents with the exstrophy-epispadias complex is greater than previously assumed .
Familial Mediterranean fever ( recurrent hereditary polyserositis ) in Arabs--a study of 175 patients and review of the literature .
Recurrent hereditary polyserositis ( RHP ) or familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) is a chronic inherited illness of obscure aetiology .
The disease is characterised by paroxysmal attacks of fever , <START:PHENOTYPE> peritonitis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pleuritis <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , and predominantly affects Sephardic Jews , Arabs , Turks and Armenians .
In this study , we report our 11-year experience of 175 Arab patients with this disease .
As with other ethnic groups , the most common manifestation ( 93.7 per cent ) was <START:PHENOTYPE> peritonitis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Arthritis <END> ( 33.7 per cent ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> pleurisy <END> (32 per cent ) were next in frequency .
Adult patients in this series unlike those in other ethnic groups , rarely presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> .
Similarly rare were amyloidosis , rashes , <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> or lymphadenopathy.
The aetiology of this disease is not clear but we suspect that abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism may be a factor in the pathogenesis .
MORM syndrome ( mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> truncal obesity <END> , retinal dystrophy and <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> ) , a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder , links to 9q34 .
A consanguineous pedigree is described where 14 individuals are affected with a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder , which causes static <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> truncal obesity <END> , a congenital nonprogressive retinal dystrophy and <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> in males .
We have tentatively named this condition MORM syndrome .
It shows similarities to Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Cohen syndrome , but can be distinguished by clinical features ; the age of onset and nonprogressive nature of the <START:PHENOTYPE> visual impairment <END> , the lack of characteristic facies , skin or gingival infection , microcephaly , 'mottled retina ' , polydactyly and <START:PHENOTYPE> small penis <END> without testicular anomalies .
Furthermore , linkage to the known Bardet-Biedl ( BBS1-8 ) and Cohen syndrome loci was excluded .
Autozygosity mapping identified a single homozygous subtelomeric region shared by all affecteds on chromosome 9q34.3 , with a maximum LOD score of 5.64 .
We believe this to be the first example of the identification of a subtelomeric recessive locus by autozygosity mapping .
Twin mothers , pregnancy <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and pre-eclampsia .
To estimate the maternal genetic contribution to the hypertensive diseases of pregnancy .
A cohort study of female twins with information on hypertensive diseases of pregnancy obtained by questionnaire screening , and verification of diagnosis from hospital or general practitioner records .
A volunteer twin registry in the UK with recruitment through the media without reference to pregnancies or disease status .
Adult female , same-sex twin pairs who completed a pregnancy history questionnaire and consented to record inspection .
Self-reported and hospital-validated diagnosis of non-proteinuric pregnancy <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and of pregnancy <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> ( pre-eclampsia ) .
Self-reported pre-eclampsia had a heritability of 0.221 and non-proteinuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> of 0 . 198 .
However , none of the pairs who were self-reported as concordant for pre-eclampsia were confirmed from hospital records .
Using hospital records , the heritability of pre-eclampsia was 0 and 0.375 for non-proteinuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
Using a model treating pre-eclampsia as a separate disease from non-proteinuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , and assuming that the next pair identified was both monozygotic and concordant for pre-eclampsia , the estimated heritability of pre-eclampsia remained 0 ( 95 % CI 0-0.49 ) .
Using a threshold model in which non-proteinuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> is treated as a mild form of pre-eclampsia , heritability is estimated at 0.247 ( 95 % CI 0.23- 0.454 ) .
Neither non-proteinuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> nor pre-eclampsia are inherited in simple Mendelian fashion .
The genetic contribution to multi-factorial inheritance is smaller than hitherto believed .
A new disease-related mutation for <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ( MELAS ) syndrome affects the ND4 subunit of the respiratory complex I .
The molecular lesions in two patients exhibiting classical clinical manifestations of MELAS ( <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ) syndrome have been investigated .
A recently reported disease-related A----G base substitution at nt 3243 of the mtDNA , in the DHU loop of tRNA( Leu) , was detected by restriction-enzyme analysis of the relevant PCR-amplified segment of the mtDNA of one patient but was not observed , by either restriction-enzyme analysis or nucleotide sequencing , in the other .
To define the molecular lesion in the patient who does not have the A----G base substitution at nt 3243 , the total <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome of the patient has been sequenced .
An A----G base substitution at nt 11 084 , leading to a Thr-to-Ala amino acid replacement in the ND4 subunit of the respiratory complex I , is suggested to be a disease-related mutation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Demyelination <END> of the brain is associated with methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency .
Individuals deficient in hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase ( MAT ) activity ( MAT I/III deficiency ) have been demonstrated to contain mutations in the gene ( MATA1 ) that encodes the major hepatic forms , MAT I and III. MAT I/III deficiency is characterized by isolated persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypermethioninemia <END> and , in some cases , unusual breath odor .
Most individuals with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> hypermethioninemia <END> have been free of major clinical difficulties .
Therefore a definitive diagnosis of MAT I/III deficiency , which requires hepatic biopsy , is not routinely made .
However , two individuals with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> hypermethioninemia <END> have developed abnormal neurological problems , including brain <START:PHENOTYPE> demyelination <END> , suggesting that MAT I/III deficiency can be deleterious .
In the present study we have examined the MATA1 gene of eight hypermethioninemic individuals , including the two with <START:PHENOTYPE> demyelination <END> of the brain .
Mutations that abolish or reduce the MAT activity were detected in the MATA1 gene of all eight individuals .
Both patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> demyelination <END> are homozygous for mutations that alter the reading frame of the encoded protein such that the predicted MATalpha1 subunits are truncated and enzymatically inactive .
The product of MAT , S-adenosylmethionine ( AdoMet) , is the major methyl donor for a large number of biologically important compounds including the two major myelin phospholipids , phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin .
Both are synthesized primarily in the liver .
Our findings demonstrate that isolated persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypermethioninemia <END> is a marker of MAT I/III deficiency , and that complete lack of MAT I/III activity can lead to neurological abnormalities .
Therefore , a DNA-based diagnosis should be performed for individuals with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> hypermethioninemia <END> to assess if therapy aimed at the prevention of neurological manifestations is warranted .
Classic <START:PHENOTYPE> bladder exstrophy <END> in a nonhuman primate : a comparative analysis .
To describe the pelvic floor musculature and bony pelvic anatomy in a case of naturally occurring classic <START:PHENOTYPE> bladder exstrophy <END> in a rhesus monkey , the first reported case in the animal population since 1832 , and compare the results to <START:PHENOTYPE> exstrophy <END> seen in human newborns .
A 7-day-old male rhesus monkey with classic <START:PHENOTYPE> bladder exstrophy <END> was examined by a pediatric urologist and primate veterinarian before being killed .
A multidetector row computed tomography study with three-dimensional reconstruction was obtained , and a comparison computed tomography study of a 17-day-old male human with <START:PHENOTYPE> exstrophy <END> was also reconstructed three dimensionally .
The bony pelvis and pelvic floor muscular anatomy of both subjects were then examined and compared .
On gross examination , a similar appearance of classic <START:PHENOTYPE> bladder exstrophy <END> in the rhesus monkey and human newborn were noted , including an open exposed bladder , associated penile <START:PHENOTYPE> epispadias <END> , and widely separated pubic bones .
The evaluation of the three-dimensional models showed a similar orientation of the bony pelvis in both the rhesus and the human newborn .
The iliac wings were significantly rotated outward , and the sacroiliac joint was 10 degrees wider than that seen in normal children .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> exstrophy <END> pelvic floor in both the rhesus and the newborn was markedly flattened , with approximately 33% of the muscle located anterior to the rectum to support the pelvic structures ( normal children have 5 0 % of their levator ani anterior to the rectum ) .
By using advancements in imaging modalities , this study illustrated that naturally occurring classic <START:PHENOTYPE> bladder exstrophy <END> in the human newborn and rhesus monkey were identical in both external appearance and internal anatomy .
Dandy-Walker(like ) malformation , atrio-ventricular septal defect and a similar pattern of minor anomalies in 2 sisters : a new syndrome ?
We report on sisters with similar craniofacial anomalies , a brain malformation in the area of the posterior fossa , and a congenital heart defect .
The craniofacial findings include <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , a prominent forehead and occiput , foramina parietalia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , narrow palate , and apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> .
Patient 1 had a <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> with communicating <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , aplasia of the posterior portion of the cerebellar vermis , and high insertion of the confluent sinus , while in patient 2 , a Dandy-Walker variant was found with aplasia of the cerebellar vermis and hypoplasia of the hemispheres , large cisterna magna , high insertion of the confluent sinus , but no <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> .
Both sibs were moderately mentally retarded .
The older sister had a complete atrio-ventricular canal and died after unsuccessful heart operation at 3 1/2 years .
The younger had a successful operation on a cleft mitral valve and septum primum defect .
Chromosomes were normal .
The occurrence of a distinct and similar pattern of congenital anomalies in sisters born to healthy parents points toward a " new " syndrome caused by the homozygous state of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> gene .
Genome-wide linkage reveals a locus for human essential ( primary ) <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> on chromosome 12p. Essential ( primary ) <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> is an important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .
Blood pressure is largely heritable ; however , the genetic factors contributing to essential <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> are mostly unknown .
We examined a large Chinese kindred ( n=387 ) and selected a subset of 94 individuals for genotyping .
An additional 32 Chinese nuclear families with essential <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> were also recruited .
Genome-wide parametric linkage analysis identified a new locus for primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> on chromosome 12p ( parametric LOD score 3.44 ) .
This locus overlaps with the assigned locus that causes severe autosomal-dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly , the only form of monogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> known to date that resembles primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
We suggest that this genomic region , spanning 18 annotated genes , will be of great relevance in elucidating new mechanisms for primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> and ocular coloboma : new syndrome or an extension of the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum ?
The oculo-auriculo-vertebral ( OAV ) spectrum is an etiologically heterogeneous condition classically consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> , hemifacial microsomia , <START:PHENOTYPE> epibulbar dermoids <END> , and vertebral anomalies .
Other eye findings described in OAV include <START:PHENOTYPE> upper eyelid colobomas <END> , ptosis , and varying degrees of <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> or even <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> .
Iris and/or retinal colobomas have rarely been reported .
We describe two familial cases of apparent OAV with ocular colobomas .
We postulate that iris and/or retinal colobomas associated with OAV may represent a subgroup within the OAV spectrum with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> , as in the families described herein .
Since <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> can result from aberrant migration of neural crest cells into the first and second branchial arches during early embryonic development , and concomitant deficient neural crest migration into the developing eye can lead to ocular coloboma and or iris heterochromia , it may be that the altered gene or genes in our familial cases are involved with regulation of neural crest development .

Idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> : familial prevalence and HLA distribution . To compare HLA distribution in familial and non-familial <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , because a serum marker that could identify families at risk of developing <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> should be of use in screening for the disease .
100 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.
200 first degree relatives from 56 of the proband families were screened for <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> by echocardiography.
The HLA profile of the patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , as well as of the familial and non-familial subgroups , was compared with that of 9000 normal controls .
The familial prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> in this patient group was "definite " in 14 of 56 ( 25% ) and " possible " in 25 of 56 ( 45% ) .
The HLA-DR4 frequency in the 100 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> was similar to that in the 9000 controls ( 39% v 32% ) .
However , the DR4 subtype was significantly more common in the 25 probands with a familial tendency to <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> than in the 31 probands with non-familial <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( 68 % v 32% ; P < 0.05 ) .
The present finding supports an HLA linked predisposition to familial dilated cardiomyopathy.
The HLA type DR4 was significantly more common in familial than in non-familial cases .
The DR4 halotype was associated with two thirds of the families at risk for dilated cardiomyopathy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Factor XII deficiency <END> : a thrombophilic risk factor for retinal vein occlusion .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Factor XII deficiency <END> is among the coagulation disorders that have been implicated in major thromboembolic events .
However , little is known about an association of this coagulation disorder and retinal vessel occlusion .
In the current study , we investigated the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> factor XII deficiency <END> in patients with retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) with reference to age and cardiovascular risk factors .
Cross-sectional study .
A cohort of 150 consecutive patients with central or branch retinal vein occlusion and 135 subjects matched for age and gender were prospectively screened for <START:PHENOTYPE> factor XII deficiency <END> .
Both cohorts were divided into two subgroups ( < = 45 or >45 years ) , depending on the patients ' age at the time of the RVO or a previous thromboembolic event .
Overall , <START:PHENOTYPE> factor XII deficiency <END> was found to be present in 14 ( 9.3% ) of 150 patients and in 1 ( 0.7% ) of 135 controls ( P =.0009 ) .
Patient age < = 45 years at the time of the RVO or a previous thromboembolic event was associated with a high prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> factor XII deficiency <END> ( 18% ) .
By contrast , only 5 ( 5% ) of 100 patients >45 years ( P =.016 ) and none of the young controls ( P =.0001 ) tested positive for <START:PHENOTYPE> factor XII deficiency <END> .
The prevalence among patients >45 years was similar to that found in age-matched controls ( 2% ; P =.66 ) .
Our results indicate that <START:PHENOTYPE> factor XII deficiency <END> is highly prevalent in RVO patients < = 45 years of age .
By contrast , the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> factor XII deficiency <END> in RVO patients older than 45 years appears to be similar to that seen in healthy individuals .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , widow 's peak , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly angulated ears <END> , and joint problems : exclusion of the Aarskog ( FGD1 ) gene as a candidate gene .
A syndrome encompassing postnatal onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , widow 's peak , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly angulated ears <END> , and limitation of forearm supination is reported in a boy and his mother .
The boy has not yet experienced dislocation of patella or other joint anomaly except for limitation of supination of the forearms .
On the other hand , the mother has a milder limitation of supination only on the left arm and is devoid of <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> .
Their condition is reminiscent of that described in the family reported by Kapur et al . [ 1989 : Am . J . Med . Genet . 33 : 357-363.] , which showed an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> mode of inheritance .
DNA study on our family using an intragenic polymorphism of the Aarskog syndrome ( FGD1 ) gene and four other adjacent markers convincingly excludes the possibility that their condition could be caused by a mutation of the FGD1 gene .
Our family and the family reported by Kapur et al . may suggest segregation of a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> condition .

Identification of mutations in the gene encoding lamins A/ C in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> limb girdle <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> with atrioventricular conduction disturbances ( LGMD1B ) .
LGMD1B is an autosomal dominantly inherited , <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> limb girdle <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> , with age-related atrioventricular cardiac conduction disturbances and the absence of early <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures <END> .
The disease has been linked to chromosome 1q11-q21 .
Within this locus another <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> , the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of Emery-Dreifuss <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> ( AD-EDMD ) has recently been mapped and the corresponding gene identified .
AD-ADMD is characterized by early <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures of elbows <END> and Achilles tendons and a humero-peroneal distribution of weakness combined with a cardiomyopathy with conduction defects .
The disease gene of AD-EDMD is LMNA which encodes lamins A/C , two proteins of the nuclear envelope .
In order to identify whether or not LGMD1B and AD-EDMD are allelic disorders , we carried out a search for mutations in the LMNA gene in patients with LGMD1B .
For this , PCR/SSCP/sequencing screening was carried out for the 12 exons of LMNA on DNA samples of individuals from three LGMD1B families that were linked to chromo-some 1q11-q21 .
Mutations were identified in all three LGMD1B families : a missense mutation , a deletion of a codon and a splice donor site mutation , respectively .
The three mutations were identified in all affected members of the corresponding families and were absent in 100 unrelated control subjects .
The present identification of mutations in the LMNA gene in LGMD1B demonstrates that LGMD1B and AD-EDMD are allelic disorders .
Further analysis of phenotype-genotype relationship will help to clarify the variability of the phenotype observed in these two muscular dystrophies .
Assignment of two mitochondrially synthesized polypeptides to human <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA and their use in the study of intracellular <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> interaction .
Two mitochondrially synthesized marker polypeptides , MV-1 and MV-2 , were found in human HeLa and HT1080 cells .
These were assigned to the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA in HeLa-HT1 08 0 cybrids and hybrids by demonstrating their linkage to cytoplasmic genetic markers .
These markers include <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA restriction site polymorphisms and resistance to chloramphenicol , an inhibitor of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> protein synthesis .
In the absence of chloramphenicol , the expression of MV-1 and MV-2 in cybrids and hybrids was found to be directly proportional to the ratio of the parental <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNAs .
In the presence of chloramphenicol , the marker polypeptide linked to the chloramphenicol-sensitive <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA continued to be expressed .
This demonstrated that resistant and sensitive <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNAs can cooperate within a cell for gene expression and that the CAP-resistant allele was dominant or codominant to sensitive .
Such cooperation suggests that <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNAs can be exchanged between mitochondria .
Plasma homocysteine as a risk factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and Alzheimer 's disease .
In cross-sectional studies , elevated plasma homocysteine levels have been associated with poor cognition and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Studies of newly diagnosed <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> are required in order to establish whether the elevated homocysteine levels precede the onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> or result from dementia-related nutritional and vitamin deficiencies .
A total of 1092 subjects without <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ( 667 women and 425 men ; mean age , 76 years ) from the Framingham Study constituted our study sample .
We examined the relation of the plasma total homocysteine level measured at base line and that measured eight years earlier to the risk of newly diagnosed <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> on follow-up .
We used multivariable proportional-hazards regression to adjust for age , sex , apolipoprotein E genotype , vascular risk factors other than homocysteine , and plasma levels of folate and vitamins B12 and B6 . Over a median follow-up period of eight years , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> developed in 111 subjects , including 83 given a diagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease .
The multivariable-adjusted relative risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> was 1.4 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 .1 to 1 .9 ) for each increase of 1 SD in the log-transformed homocysteine value either at base line or eight years earlier .
The relative risk of Alzheimer 's disease was 1.8 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1.3 to 2.5 ) per increase of 1 SD at base line and 1.6 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1.2 to 2.1 ) per increase of 1 SD eight years before base line .
With a plasma homocysteine level greater than 14 micromol per liter , the risk of Alzheimer 's disease nearly doubled .
An increased plasma homocysteine level is a strong , independent risk factor for the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and Alzheimer 's disease .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Schizophrenia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Schizophrenia <END> is still one of the most mysterious and costliest mental disorders in terms of human suffering and societal expenditure .
Here , we focus on the key developments in biology , epidemiology , and pharmacology of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and provide a syndromal framework in which these aspects can be understood together .
Symptoms typically emerge in adolescence and early adulthood .
The incidence of the disorder varies greatly across places and migrant groups , as do symptoms , course , and treatment response across individuals .
Genetic vulnerability is shared in part with bipolar disorder and recent molecular genetic findings also indicate an overlap with developmental disorders such as autism .
The diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> is associated with demonstrable alterations in brain structure and changes in dopamine neurotransmission , the latter being directly related to <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> delusions <END> .
Pharmacological treatments , which block the dopamine system , are effective for <START:PHENOTYPE> delusions <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> but less so for disabling cognitive and motivational impairments .
Specific vocational and psychological interventions , in combination with antipsychotic medication in a context of community-case management , can improve functional outcome but are not widely available .
100 years after being so named , research is beginning to understand the biological mechanisms underlying the symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and the psychosocial factors that moderate their expression .
Although current treatments provide control rather than cure , long-term hospitalisation is not required and prognosis is better than traditionally assumed .
Nonsense and frameshift mutations in ZFHX1B , encoding Smad-interacting protein 1 , cause a complex developmental disorder with a great variety of clinical features .
Mutations in ZFHX1B , encoding Smad-interacting protein 1 ( SIP1 ) , have been recently reported to cause a form of <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> ( HSCR ) .
Patients with ZFHX1B deficiency typically show <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed motor development <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , distinct facial features , and/or congenital heart disease , in addition to the cardinal form of HSCR . To investigate the breadth of clinical variation , we studied DNA samples from six patients with clinical profiles quite similar to those described elsewhere for ZFHX1B deficiency , except that they did not have HSCR .
The results showed the previously reported R695X mutation to be present in three cases , with three novel mutations-a 2-bp insertion ( 76 0ins CA resulting in 254fs262X) , a single-base deletion ( 270delG resulting in 91fs107X ) , and a 2-bp deletion ( 2178delTT resulting in 727fs75 4X )-newly identified in the other three .
All mutations occurred in one allele and were de novo events .
These results demonstrate that ZFHX1B deficiency is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> complex developmental disorder and that individuals with functional null mutations present with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed motor development <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and a wide spectrum of clinically heterogeneous features suggestive of neurocristopathies at the cephalic , cardiac , and vagal levels .
Further evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> in SPG4-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> .
To investigate the progression of cognitive impairment and its behavioral aspects in patients with SPG4-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( SPG4-ADHSP ) .
Sixteen patients , 45 years or older , from five families with SPG4-ADHSP were prospectively assessed .
Eleven of these , from three families , were followed and 10 had two cognitive examinations using the Cambridge Cognitive Assessment ( CAMCOG ) 2 .9 years apart .
The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly ( IQCODE) , the Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI) , and the Nurses ' Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients ( NOSGER ) were completed by close relatives of the 11 patients at the second assessment .
Eleven matched control subjects had CAMCOG examinations 3.1 years apart .
The mean CAMCOG score at the initial assessment was lower for the 10 HSP patients ( 73 .5 /107 ) than for 10 control subjects ( 91 .7/107 , p = 0.005 ) .
After 2 .9 years , the HSP patients experienced a fall in the mean CAMCOG by 9.1 points to 64 .4/107 ( p = 0.008 ) .
The mean CAMCOG score for the control subjects (90.8/107 ) fell by only 0.9 points after 3.1 years ( p = 0.36 ) .
The CAMCOG scores of two HSP patients moved from the mild (6 0 to 80 ) into the moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> category ( 35 to 59 ) and in three other patients into the mild <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> range from borderline normal scores ( 81 to 85 ) . IQCODE scores were abnormal in 9/11 HSP patients and 1/11 controls ( p = 0.001 ) .
Seven of the 11 HSP patients were considered as having <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
This study indicates an active progression of cognitive deterioration and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> in older patients with SPG4-ADHSP .
A 26-month-old child with Marden-Walker syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> .
We recently examined a 26-month-old boy with abnormal face , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> talipes equinovarus <END> , and joint contractures .
Subsequently he manifested failure to thrive , respiratory infections , and developmental delay .
These congenital anomalies and associated findings are consistent with a diagnosis of the Marden-Walker syndrome .
He also had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> and duodenal bands , not previously reported in this syndrome .
This syndrome appears to be an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait in some families .
A summary of findings of the 16 previous published patients is presented .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> Bethlem myopathy.
Bethlem <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> is a well-defined clinical entity among collagen VI disorders , featuring <START:PHENOTYPE> proximal muscle weakness <END> and contractures of the fingers , wrists , and ankles .
It is an early-onset , <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> , and relatively mild disease , invariably associated to date with heterozygous dominant mutations in the 3 collagen VI genes .
We have characterized the clinical , laboratory , and genetic features of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Bethlem <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> in 2 unrelated patients .
This study is based on clinical , histochemical , immunocytochemical , and electron microscope evaluation of the muscle and dermal fibroblasts , CT imaging of the muscles , and biochemical and molecular analysis .
Both patients carry a truncating COL6A2 mutation ( Q819X ; R366X ) associated with missense changes in the partnering allele lying within the C2 domain of the alpha2(VI ) chain ( D871 N ; R843W-R830Q ) .
They show decreased amounts of collagen VI in the basal lamina of muscle fibers and in dermal fibroblast cultures and altered behavior of collagen VI tetramers .
Biochemical studies supported the pathogenic effect of identified amino acid substitutions , which involve strictly conserved residues .
The reported patients illustrate the occurrence of Bethlem <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> with a recessive mode of inheritance .
This observation completes the hereditary pattern in collagen VI myopathies with both Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and Bethlem <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> underlined by either recessive or dominant effecting mutations .
This finding has relevant implications for genetic counseling and molecular characterization of patients with Bethlem <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , as well as for genotype-phenotype correlations in collagen VI disorders .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Arthrogryposis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> and other anomalies in two sisters .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ectodermal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> is an uncommon condition .
We describe two daughters of a distant consanguineous couple with oligodentia , <START:PHENOTYPE> enamel abnormalities <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , longitudinally broken nails , growth retardation , joint contractures with <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophy <END> , hypohidrotic skin with tendency to excessive bruising and scarring after injuries and scratching , kypho-scoliosis , mild facial dysmorphia and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
The condition is probably due to an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> gene , the parents being gypsies of the same ancestral origin .
Cold-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> syndrome with neonatal features of Crisponi syndrome : longitudinal observation of a patient homozygous for a CRLF1 mutation .
Cold-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> syndrome ( CISS ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder caused by mutations in CRLF1 ( cytokine receptor-like factor 1 ) , characterized by profuse <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> in cold environmental temperature and craniofacial and skeletal features .
Mutations in CRLF1 also cause Crisponi syndrome ( CS) , characterized by neonatal-onset paroxysmal muscular contractions as well as craniofacial and skeletal manifestations and abnormal functions of the autonomic nerve system .
To date , it is an unresolved problem whether the two conditions are distinct clinical entities or a single clinical entity with variable expressions or with different presentations depending on the patients ' age at diagnosis .
We report on a 30-year-old Japanese woman with CISS and homozygous out-of-frame 23-base deletion of CRLF1 .
In infancy , she did not show paroxysmal muscular contractions , but showed feeding difficulty , hyperthermia , and facial characteristics including thick and arched eyebrows , a short nose with <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nostrils <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> full cheeks <END> , an inverted upper lip , and a small mouth , resembling those observed in CS . Profuse <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> was noticed at 3 years of age .
Cold-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> was recognized in her elementary school days .
In adolescence to adulthood , she showed a Marfanoid habitus with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> and craniofacial characteristics including dolichocephaly , a slender face with poor expression , a distinctive nose with hypoplastic nares , malar hypoplasia , prognathism , and a small mouth .
This is the first report of detailed longitudinal observation of a patient with CRLF1 abnormalities , compatible with the notion that CISS and CS may be a single clinical entity .

A major susceptibility locus for atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> maps to chromosome 3q21 .
Atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> ) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with onset mainly in early childhood It is commonly the initial clinical manifestation of allergic disease , often preceding the onset of respiratory allergies .
Along with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> allergic rhinitis <END> , atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> is an important manifestation of atopy that is characterized by the formation of allergy antibodies ( IgE ) to environmental allergens .
In the developed countries , the prevalence of atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> is approximately 15 % , with a steady increase over the past decades .
Genetic and environmental factors interact to determine disease susceptibility and expression , and twin studies indicate that the genetic contribution is substantial .
To identify susceptibility loci for atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> , we ascertained 199 families with at least two affected siblings based on established diagnostic criteria .
A genome-wide linkage study revealed highly significant evidence for linkage on chromosome 3q21 ( Zall=4.31 , P= 8.42 10( -6) ) .
Moreover , this locus provided significant evidence for linkage of allergic sensitization under the assumption of paternal imprinting ( hlod=3.71 ,alpha=44% ) , further supporting the presence of an atopy gene in this region .
Our findings indicate that distinct genetic factors contribute to susceptibility to atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> and that the study of this disease opens new avenues to dissect the genetics of atopy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Growth hormone deficiency <END> in two siblings with AlstrÃ¶m syndrome .
To investigate if there is an endocrinologic explanation for the <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> in patients with AlstrÃ¶m syndrome .
Patient reports .
The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia , Pa . Two siblings with AlstrÃ¶m syndrome who were referred to the Endocrine Division for evaluation of obesity , growth , and glucose metabolism .
None .
The low growth velocity in both patients prompted growth hormone evaluation .
The abnormal results of two provocative tests of growth hormone function , as well as low concentrations in frequent overnight sampling of serum growth hormone , were compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> growth hormone deficiency <END> .
However , the patients had advanced bone ages , early normal growth , and normal insulinlike growth factor 1 concentrations .
The results of the glucose tolerance tests revealed marked elevation of insulin ( 5955 pmol/L and 7677 pmol/L ) and glucose intolerance consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> .
Pituitary stimulation studies revealed normal thyroid and gonadotropin axes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Growth hormone deficiency <END> may account for the <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> in some patients with AlstrÃ¶m syndrome .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> advanced bone age <END> and normal early growth may be due to hyperinsulinism .
A specific defect in the signal transduction of insulin action and possibly hormone spillover on another receptor may account for the existence of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> in the presence of normal growth and <START:PHENOTYPE> growth hormone deficiency <END> .
Sperm abnormalities in <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
To determine the fatty acid composition of erythrocytes and sperm , along with the functional characteristics of sperm , in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
Sperm and retinal cells share important homologies .
Both are rich in the highly polyunsaturated fatty acid , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA , 22:6[ n-3] ) , and both contain a structural component called the axoneme .
Low concentrations of DHA in the retina of monkeys are known to cause visual impairment .
Because blood levels of DHA in <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> patients are less than normal , reduced DHA in the retina might contribute to the visual impairment characteristic of this disease .
This study was conducted on the hypothesis that the sperm of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> patients might be abnormal and that these abnormalities might infer similar lipid and structural abnormalities of the retina .
The lipid composition of erythrocytes and sperm ( fatty acids and sterols ) and sperm function were analyzed in 26 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> and in 8 healthy men .
The sperm of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> had a much lower DHA concentration , a lower desmosterol-to-cholesterol ratio , reduced motility , abnormal structure , and lower sperm counts compared with that in normal subjects .
Usher 's II patients exhibited the most pronounced reductions of DHA in sperm .
Sperm DHA concentration was positively correlated to sperm motility , to sperm count , and to the desmosterol-to-cholesterol ratio .
Lower erythrocyte DHA was also observed in <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> patients .
These results indicate that the sperm of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , particularly those with Usher 's II , have an abnormal lipid composition that is associated with reduced motility .
The possibility exists that these patients might have similar abnormalities in the DHA biochemistry of the retina .
Sperm biochemistry and function may be a marker for this disease .
A clinical trial of DHA in <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> is suggested for future study .
Endomyocardial biopsy in right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Right ventricular cardiomyopathy <END> is characterized by a progressive myocyte loss and fibro-fatty substitution of the right ventricle .
The aim of our study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy .
Using an imaging analyser system , histomorphometric parameters of myocytes , interstitium , fibrous tissue and fatty tissue were evaluated on endomyocardial biopsy from 30 patients with arrhythmogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> right ventricular cardiomyopathy <END> , 29 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 30 control patients .
The percent area of myocytes decreased from 78 .1 0 +/- 7.34 in control to 63 .39 +/- 9.22 in dilated cardiomyopathy ( P < 0.05 ) and to 47.28 +/- 15 . 01 in arrhythmogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> right ventricular cardiomyopathy <END> ( P < 0.01 ) .
Fibrous tissue increased from 8 .1 0 +/- 3.89 in control to 21.8 0 +/- 9.29 in dilated cardiomyopathy ( P < 0.05 ) and to 24.6 0 +/- 11 .37 in arrhythmogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> right ventricular cardiomyopathy <END> ( P < 0.05 ) .
Fatty tissue varied from 0.33 +/- 1.44 in control and 0.07 +/- 0.31 in dilated cardiomyopathy to 13.30 +/- 17 .30 in arrhythmogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> right ventricular cardiomyopathy <END> ( P < 0.05 ) .
Fatty tissue was a feature of arrhythmogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> right ventricular cardiomyopathy <END> ( 67 % of patients vs . 6% of control and dilated cardiomyopathy patients ) .
Diagnostic values typifying arrhythmogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> right ventricular cardiomyopathy <END> , obtained by excluding any overlapping between confidence intervals in the three groups , were : myocytes < 44 .95 % ; fibrous tissue > 40.38% , and fatty tissue > 3.21% , with 67 % sensitivity and 91 .53 % specificity for at least one parameter .
In conclusion , a significant difference between arrhythmogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> right ventricular cardiomyopathy <END> , dilated cardiomyopathy and control exists in terms of amount of myocytes , fibrous tissue and fatty tissue .
Presence of fatty tissue and fibrous tissue exceeding 3.21% and 40.38% , respectively should be considered highly suspect for arrhythmogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> right ventricular cardiomyopathy <END> in right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> and subcortical ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
A clinicopathological study .
We recently described an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome characterized mainly by recurrent strokes and neuroimaging evidence of leukoencephalopathy.
We now report the pathological findings in one of the affected subjects .
A 40-year-old woman experienced her first grand mal <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> in 1971 .
From 1983 on she suffered recurrent strokes , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric disturbances <END> with depressions , manic episodes , and dementia .
In 1988 , after her fourth <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> , she became tetraplegic with a severe <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudobulbar palsy <END> , and she died in 199 0 .
Pathological examination disclosed a recent capsulolenticular hematoma , multiple small deep infarcts , a diffuse myelin loss and pallor of the hemispheric white matter , and a widespread vasculopathy of the small arteries penetrating the white matter .
The arterial wall was markedly thickened with an extensive nonamyloid eosinophilic deposit in the media and reduplication of the internal elastic lamella .
The underlying lesion of this hereditary disorder is located in the small arteries and is of unknown etiology .
It differs from arteriosclerotic and amyloid angiopathies but is similar to that described in some cases of hereditary multi-infarct dementia .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> frontal <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> misdiagnosed as sleep disorder .
We describe a distinctive <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome in six families , which is the first partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome to follow single gene inheritance .
The predominant <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> pattern had frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> semiology with clusters of brief motor attacks occurring in sleep .
Onset was usually in childhood , often persisting through adult life .
Misdiagnosis as night terrors , nightmares , hysteria , or paroxysmal nocturnal dystonia was common , and the inheritance pattern was often not appreciated .
This <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome is ideal for identification of partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> genes .
Clinical features and linkage analysis of a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is an uncommon form of open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> that is usually recognized during childhood or early adulthood and which often has a strong family history .
The authors clinically characterized a large multigeneration family with autosomal-dominant , juvenile-onset , open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Linkage analysis with short tandem repeat polymorphisms was used to evaluate the Rieger 's syndrome locus as the site of the disease-causing mutation .
Forty members of a family with a five-generation history of open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> were examined .
Clinical data were available from an additional five individuals , three of whom were decreased .
Older family members provided limited information about the visual history of five other deceased individuals in the first three generations .
Fifty-nine people were at 5 0 % risk of harboring the disease-causing mutation ; and of these , 30 were affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> by examination or by family history .
All affected patients had an affected parent .
The average age at diagnosis was 18 years ( range , 8-30 years ) .
Affected family members tended to be myopic but lacked other ocular or systemic abnormalities .
The intraocular pressures ( IOPs ) of affected individuals were commonly more than 50 mmHg when they were first examined .
Gonioscopy showed the angles to be open , with no abnormal pigmentation , iris processes , or embryonic tissue .
Topical medications were initially effective in controlling IOP , but surgery was usually required for long-term pressure control .
The Rieger 's syndrome locus on chromosome 4q25 was excluded as the site of the disease-causing mutation .
Juvenile open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> can occur as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait with high penetrance .
Genetic linkage analysis of the family reported here has the potential to identify the chromosomal location of a glaucoma-causing gene .
This gene is genetically distinct from the chromosome 4 locus that was recently associated with Rieger 's syndrome .
Pallister-Hall syndrome with stenosis of the cricoid cartilage and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphallus <END> without hypopituitarism .
The Pallister-Hall syndrome is characterised by a spectrum of anomalies including congenital hypothalamic " hamartoblastoma " hypopituitarism , <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , polydactyly and various visceral anomalies .
Rare familial cases with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> pattern with variable expressivity have been reported .
Cases of more mildly affected individuals with Pallister-Hall syndrome have been described , including cases of asymptomatic individuals .
We report a case of Pallister-Hall syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphallus <END> and without <START:PHENOTYPE> growth hormone deficiency <END> that has been followed successfully for two years .
The patient presented <START:PHENOTYPE> postaxial polydactyly of hands <END> , dysplasic nails , <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small penis <END> , scrotum bifidum with very thin urethra , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid epiglottis <END> and a bilateral simian crease .
There was vesico-ureteral-reflux , insertional hexadactyly of the left hand and two Y shaped metacarpal with six fingers at the right hand .
Brain MR imaging revealed a large sellar and suprasellar mass .
A perineal anorectoplasty and a vesicostomy were performed .
Laryngeal dyspnea appeared when he was 13 months old .
Bronchoscopy revealed anterior synechia of vocal cords with cricoidian stenosis .
A tracheostomy was performed .
Mental development was normal .
No mutation of the zinc finger transcription factor gene , GLI 3 was detected .
Recessive omodysplasia : five new cases and review of the literature .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> omodysplasia ( MIM 258315 ) is a rare skeletal dysplasia characterized by severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> micromelia <END> with shortening and distal tapering of the humeri and femora to give a club-like appearance .
Fewer than 20 cases have been reported in the literature so far .
The purpose of this study was to more clearly describe the clinical and radiographic phenotypes and their changes with age .
Five new patients , including two sibs , with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> omodysplasia are presented .
Clinical features are <START:PHENOTYPE> rhizomelic dwarfism <END> with limited extension of elbows and knees and a distinct face with a <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , midline haemangiomas in infants and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> in males .
Radiological findings are distal hypoplasia of the <START:PHENOTYPE> short humerus <END> and femur with characteristic radial dislocation and radioulnar diastasis .
Based on a review of these and 16 previously reported patients , the regressive nature of the humerofemoral changes and the obvious male predominance are stressed .
Phenotypic similarities with the atelosteogenesis group of disorders and with diastrophic dysplasia suggest common pathogenetic mechanisms .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> : evidence for a fourth disease locus .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxias have proved particularly difficult to classify due to the lack of phenotypic concordance both within and between families .
Genetic heterogeneity has been established , and disease loci for spinal <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> have been assigned to chromosomes 6 ( SCA1 ) , 12 ( SCA2 ) and 14 ( Machado Joseph disease ( MJD) ) .
Genetic analysis performed on a large Thai kindred with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , in which frontal lobe signs and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> are commonly observed in affected family members , exclude linkage to the SCA1 , SCA2 and MJD loci .
This demonstrates that mutation in at least one further locus can cause spinal <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , indicating the need for caution in the use of markers for predictive testing or prenatal diagnosis these disorders .
High-resolution studies in patients with aniridia-Wilms tumor association , <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> or related congenital abnormalities .
We attempted to determine whether all cases of AWTA ( anirida-Wilms tumor association ) or any of the following groups of patients show 11p deletion : cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> with congenital abnormalities other than aniridia , those without any congenital abnormalities , tumor itself in cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> without constitutional 11p deletion and cases of aniridia or hemihypertrophy without <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> .
We studied a total of 29 index patients including five cases of AWTA , four cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> with various congenital abnormalities , 16 cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> without other abnormalities , three cases of aniridia in one of which <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> developed later and a case of hemihypertrophy.
In all five cases of AWTA and in a case of aniridia who later developed <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> , 11p deletion involving the p13 band was detected .
The mother of the latter also showed an identical 11p deletion .
The common segment of deletion was the middle part of the p13 .
Two possible hypotheses on the mechanism through which <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> might develop were evaluated , based on the distribution of break points .
All other cases , including five with tumor culture , showed a normal karyotype .
Linkage of a human brain malformation , familial <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> , to chromosome 7 and evidence for genetic heterogeneity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Holoprosencephaly <END> ( HPE ) is a common malformation of the developing forebrain and midface characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> incomplete penetrance <END> and variable expressivity .
Familial HPE has been reported in many families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> in some and apparent autosomal recessive inheritance in others .
We have examined 125 individuals from nine families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> HPE . Expression in gene carriers varied from alobar HPE and <START:PHENOTYPE> cyclopia <END> through microforms such as microcephaly or single central incisor to normal phenotype .
We performed linkage studies by either Southern blot or polymerase chain reaction analyses with DNA markers ( D7S22 , D7S55 0 , and D7S483 ) that are deleted from some patients with sporadic HPE and flank a translocation breakpoint in 7q36 associated with HPE .
The strongest support for linkage was with D7S22 , which was linked with no recombination to <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> HPE in eight of nine families with a combined logarithm of odds score of 6.4 with an affected-only model-free analysis and 8.2 with a reduced-penetrance model and all phenotypes .
Close linkage to this region could be excluded in one family , and there was significant evidence of genetic heterogeneity .
These results show that a gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> HPE is located in a chromosomal region ( 7q36 ) known to be involved in sporadic HPE with visible cytogenetic deletions .
They also demonstrate genetic heterogeneity in familial HPE .
We hypothesize that mutations of a gene in 7q36 , designated HPE3 , are responsible for both sporadic HPE and a majority of families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> HPE .
New X-linked mental retardation syndrome with the gene mapped tentatively in Xp22.3 . X-linked mental retardation ( XLMR ) is genetically heterogeneous and clinically variable .
We describe a new XLMR syndrome of severe mental retardation and multiple congenital anomalies .
Two sisters have ( with 3 different partners ) 3 severely handicapped sons .
In 2 cases , oligohydramnios and intrauterine growth retardation were noted .
Common anomalies included a square-shaped face , high and <START:PHENOTYPE> broad forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , downward slant of palpebral fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , thin upper lip , and apparently low-set ears .
One boy has bilateral microphthalmos and sclerocornea , and his cousin has atrophy of the optic nerve .
All 3 patients are blind and have profound statomotor and mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and a grossly abnormal electroencephalographic pattern .
Additional findings are <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone maturation <END> , hydronephrosis , vesicorenal reflux , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , clinodactyly of the 5th fingers , and transverse palmar creases .
The karyotype is normal ( 46 , XY ) .
Segregation analysis showed perfect coinheritance between the clinical phenotype and alleles at several loci in Xp22.3 , whereas recombinants were identified with marker loci from Xp22.2-qter .
Analysis of multiple informative meioses suggests that the disease locus maps in Xp22.3 distal to DXS16 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epiphyseal dysplasia <END> with coxa vara , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and normal intelligence in sibs : expanded spectrum of Lowry-Wood syndrome ?
We report on a brother and sister with <START:PHENOTYPE> epiphyseal dysplasia <END> and coxa vara , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
This constellation of findings similar to that found in the Lowry-Wood syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> Epiphyseal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and mental retardation ) .
In the sibs we describe , mental retardation is not apparent , and they have the additional finding of developmental coxa vara .
Despite these 2 exceptions , this family probably represents the same disorder described by Lowry and Wood ( Clinical Genetics 8:269-274 , 1975 ) , and serves to expand the spectrum of the syndrome to include coxa vara .
It is also possible that these sibs represent a previously undescribed syndrome , most likely with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Intragenic deletions and duplications of the LIS1 and DCX genes : a major disease-causing mechanism in <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> and subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> .
Classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , or isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> sequence ( ILS) , and subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> ( SBH ) are neuronal migration disorders associated with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Abnormalities of the LIS1 and DCX genes are implicated in the majority of patients with these disorders and account for approximately 75 % of patients with ILS , whereas mutations of DCX account for 85 % of patients with SBH .
The molecular basis of disease in patients with ILS and SBH , in whom no abnormalities have been identified , has been questioned .
We studied a series of 83 patients with ILS , SBH or <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> , in whom no abnormalities of the LIS1 or DCX genes had been identified , for intragenic deletions and duplications by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ( MLPA ) .
In 52 patients with ILS , we identified 12 deletions and 6 duplications involving the LIS1 gene ( 35% ) , with the majority resulting in grade 3 <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Three deletions of the DCX gene were identified in the group of nine female patients with SBH ( out of 31 patients with DCX-suggestive brain anomalies) , ie 33% .
We estimate an overall mutation detection rate of approximately 85 % by LIS1 and DCX sequencing and MLPA in ILS , and 90 % by DCX sequencing and MLPA in SBH .
Our results show that intragenic deletions and duplications of the LIS1 and DCX genes account for a significant number of patients with ILS and SBH , where no molecular defect had previously been identified .
Incorporation of deletion/duplication analysis of the LIS1 and DCX genes will be important for the molecular diagnosis of patients with ILS and SBH .
Mutational mosaicism and genetic counseling in <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Mutations may arise throughout an organism 's life cycle .
Typically , <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> meiotic mutations give rise to individuals with all their germinal and somatic cells bearing the mutant gene .
These mutations may be amorphs ( with full penetrance and expressivity ) or hypomorphs ( with reduced penetrance and expressivity ) .
Mutational mosaicism , however , involves the origin of mutations occurring during mitosis , whether in the parent at some stage prior to reproductive maturity or in the offspring at some time following fertilization .
The phenotypic expression and transmission of these new mutations are dependent on the proportion of cells bearing the mutant gene as well as the location of these cells in somatic and/or germinal tissues .
Mutational mosaicism was used as a developmental model to analyze 1 ,50 0 <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> and 179 familial cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> from the world literature .
This model provided an interpretation for the origin , onset , and transmissibility of the <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> cases , which represent over 60 % of all <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> patients .
The model also permits a reclassification of all transmissible types of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ; based on this classification , more accurate risk figures for genetic counseling can be offered .
In addition , mutational mosaicism can be extended as a model to other <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and X-linked mutations .
A novel ryanodine receptor gene mutation causing both cores and rods in congenital myopathy.
Central core disease ( CCD ) and nemaline rod <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> are generally considered two genetically and histologically distinct disorders .
CCD is defined by the presence of well-demarcated round cores within most myofibers .
Nemaline rod <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> is distinguished by the presence of characteristic <START:PHENOTYPE> nemaline bodies <END> within myofibers .
The simultaneous occurrence of both cores and rods in the same muscle biopsy has been described , but no gene mutations have been reported yet for this condition .
To describe a family containing 16 affected individuals in six generations with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> that shows clinical and histologic features of both CCD and nemaline <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , and to determine the genetic etiology and protein composition of the cores/rods in this family .
The results of linkage analyses excluded involvement of the two <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> nemaline <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> loci on chromosome 1 , but were consistent with a localization of the disease gene at the CCD locus on chromosome 19q13.1 ( ryanodine receptor ) .
SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing identified a novel Thr4637Ala mutation in the transmembrane region of the ryanodine receptor protein .
Immunofluorescence studies of patient muscle biopsies showed the central cores to stain for ryanodine receptor .
These data suggest that the occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> nemaline bodies <END> can be a secondary feature of CCD , and that genetic studies on previously reported core/rod families should be targeted to the ryanodine receptor locus .
The results of the immunofluorescence studies suggest that the cores contain excess abnormal ryanodine receptor protein .
Familial occipital calcifications , hemorrhagic strokes , leukoencephalopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , and external carotid dysplasia .
To describe a new familial association of late-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , patchy leukoencephalopathy , intracerebral hemorrhages , bilateral occipital calcifications ( BOC) , and external carotid artery dysplasia ( ECAD ) .
At age 62 , the proband , who was of Spanish descent , had left temporal hemorrhage in a background of progressive mental deterioration .
Neuroimaging revealed fine tram-line BOC , extensive leukoencephalopathy , and bilateral ECAD .
Biologic screening for celiac disease was negative .
Skin biopsy with ultrastructural study revealed heretofore unreported changes in the basal lamina of capillaries , with multilayered appearance and round-shaped microcalcifications .
Of 19 next-of-kin who survived beyond 60 years of age , six had brain disorders ; four of the six presented at least three components of the syndrome .
The proband 's mother had died at age 83 with profound <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ; one sister , who was diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> with BOC and leukoencephalopathy at age 67 , died 2 years later from intracerebral hemorrhage ; a brother had an occipital hemorrhage at age 58 , at which time BOC and leukoencephalopathy were discovered ; and another brother died after a minor <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> at age 70 with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , leukoaraiosis , BOC , and ECAD .
A proband 's cousin also had an unexplained ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> at age 55 , but without other features of the entity .
In no subject was there evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , facial angioma , or intracranial vascular malformation , and arterial hypertension was neither constant nor severe .
These clinical , neuroradiologic , and histologic features suggest a new familial cerebrovascular entity with widespread microvascular calcifications and autosomal ( presumably dominant ) inheritance .
We suggest the acronym FOCHS-LADD , for familial occipital calcifications , hemorrhagic strokes , leukoencephalopathy , arterial dysplasia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Faisalabad histiocytosis mimics Rosai-Dorfman disease : brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphadenopathy <END> , intrauterine fractures , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
Rosai-Dorfman disease ( RDD ) is a rare , sporadic histiocytic disorder characterized by painless but protracted lymphadenopathy.
Its etiology remains unclear .
The observation of congenital disease and reports of familial cases with seven pairs of siblings including three sets of identical twins suggests a genetic predisposition in some patients with this condition .
We now report two brothers of consanguineous Palestinian parents , whose <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphadenopathy <END> , lymph node histology , and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia indicated RDD .
The presence of intrauterine fractures , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural hearing impairment <END> suggested a rare familial form of the disorder .
Moynihan et al . recently described a Pakistani family with a familial histiocytic disorder highly reminiscent of the brothers reported here , whose lymph node morphology was apparently consistent with RDD as well .
The presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and joint contractures , however , suggested a separate , rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome referred to as Faisalabad histiocytosis , after the family 's place of origin .
We believe that the brothers described here represent a second family with Faisalabad histiocytosis , which mimics RDD histologically .

SOX2 <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> syndrome .
Heterozygous , de novo , loss-of-function mutations in SOX2 have been shown to cause bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> .
Here we provide a detailed description of the clinical features associated with SOX2 mutations in the five individuals with reported mutations and four newly identified cases ( including the first reported SOX2 missense mutation ) .
The SOX2-associated ocular malformations are variable in type , but most often bilateral and severe .
Of the nine patients , six had bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> and two had <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> with contralateral <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> .
The remaining case had <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> with contralateral <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , posterior cortical cataract and a dysplastic optic disc , and was the only patient to have measurable visual acuity .
The relatively consistent extraocular phenotype observed includes : learning disability , seizures , brain malformation , specific motor abnormalities , male genital tract malformations , mild facial dysmorphism , and <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth failure <END> .
Identifying SOX2 mutations from large cohorts of patients with structural eye defects has delineated a new , clinically-recognizable , multisystem disorder and has provided important insight into the developmental pathways critical for morphogenesis of the eye , brain , and male genital tract .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Angioid streaks <END> in homozygous beta thalassemia .
One hundred patients with homozygous beta thalassemia ( 62 had beta thalassemia major and 38 had beta thalassemia intermedia ) were examined by ophthalmoscopy for <START:PHENOTYPE> angioid streaks <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Angioid streaks <END> were found in 20 patients from both the beta thalassemia major and beta thalassemia intermedia groups ( nine and 11 patients , respectively ) .
A positive correlation was found between age and <START:PHENOTYPE> angioid streaks <END> ( P = .0017 ) , as was a difference in the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> angioid streaks <END> between the two forms of the disease ( P = .079 ) .
Additionally , a significant correlation was noted between chelating therapy and the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> angioid streaks <END> ( P = .039 ) .
However , using multivariate analysis to correct for the effects of age , the correlation of <START:PHENOTYPE> angioid streaks <END> with the form of disease disappeared , whereas the level of significance between chelation therapy and <START:PHENOTYPE> angioid streaks <END> was reduced ( P = .05 ) .
The high frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> angioid streaks <END> observed in patients with beta thalassemia and the severe complications observed in one patient render a thorough ophthalmoscopic examination and follow-up of such patients necessary for both early diagnosis and possible therapeutic intervention .
Molecular basis of low-penetrance <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinoblastoma <END> is a malignant tumor of the retina that occurs primarily in young children as a result of mutations in the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> gene ( RB) , the first tumor suppressor gene to be identified .
In about 35 % to 40% of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , an RB gene mutation is present in the germline , resulting in hereditary transmission of the disease .
Most families with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> demonstrate <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> with almost complete penetrance and high expressivity .
However , some families display an inheritance pattern characterized by reduced penetrance and expressivity .
Recent advances in our understanding of the structure and function of the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> protein ( pRB ) now provide new insights into the molecular basis of this low-penetrance form of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Low-penetrance <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> mutations either cause a reduction in the amount of normal pRB that is produced ( class 1 mutations ) or result in a partially functional mutant pRB ( class 2 mutations ) .
Erythromelalgia : a hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pain <END> syndrome enters the molecular era .
In contrast with acquired <START:PHENOTYPE> pain <END> syndromes , molecular substrates for hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pain <END> disorders have been poorly understood .
Familial erythromelalgia ( Weir Mitchell 's disease) , also known as primary erythermalgia , is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterized by burning <START:PHENOTYPE> pain <END> in the extremities in response to warm stimuli or moderate exercise .
The cause of this disorder has been enigmatic , and treatment has been empirical and not very effective .
Recent studies , however , have shown that familial erythromelalgia is a channelopathy caused by mutations in the gene encoding the Na(v )1.7 sodium channel which lead to altered channel function .
Selective expression of Na(v )1.7 within dorsal root ganglion neurons including nociceptors ( in which this channel is targeted to sensory terminals , close to impulse trigger zones ) and within sympathetic ganglion neurons explains why patients experience <START:PHENOTYPE> pain <END> but do not suffer from seizures or other manifestations of altered excitability within central nervous system neurons .
Erythromelalgia is the first human disorder in which it has been possible to associate an ion channel mutation with chronic neuropathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pain <END> .
Identification of mutations within a peripheral neuron-specific sodium channel suggests the possibility of rational therapies that target the affected channel .
Moreover , because some other <START:PHENOTYPE> pain <END> syndromes , including acquired disorders , involve altered sodium channel function , erythromelalgia may emerge as a model disease that holds more general lessons about the molecular neurobiology of chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> pain <END> .
Prenatal diagnosis of X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> without <START:PHENOTYPE> aqueductal stenosis <END> .
The outcome of four successive pregnancies in a woman heterozygous for X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> is described .
The last two were scanned by ultrasound .
In one , a good prognosis was given ; the fetus was male but there was no evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cerebral ventricles <END> .
In the other , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> was diagnosed .
The absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> aqueductal stenosis <END> in this case supports the hypothesis that in this X linked condition communicating <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> is the primary defect and <START:PHENOTYPE> aqueductal stenosis <END> is secondary .
A previously undescribed syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> thoracic dysplasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> communicating hydrocephalus <END> in two sibs , one diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound .
We describe two opposite sexed sibs , the offspring of consanguineous Pakistani parents , with a previously undescribed syndrome .
The main features are <START:PHENOTYPE> short ribs <END> with a <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow chest <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> thoracic dysplasia <END> , mild shortening of the limbs , <START:PHENOTYPE> communicating hydrocephalus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
One sib was diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound at 18 weeks ' gestation .
The inheritance of the condition is presumed to be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> sequence ( HS ) is characterized by abnormalities in forebrain cleavage and midface development .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> has been reported in several families and there appears to be variable expression of the disorder in those who inherit the gene .
Previous investigators have suggested <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> and/or missing central incisors as mild manifestations of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> HS .
We evaluated a large kindred with three individuals with severe brain anomalies and 12 individuals with minor manifestations of the disorder .
The most consistent sign in those mildly affected was <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
We suggest that head circumference is an important part of the evaluation of the relatives of a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> Conradi-HÃ¼nermann syndrome presenting as congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> erythroderma <END> .
A family with Conradi-HÃ¼nermann syndrome was identified after a scaly , erythrodermic neonate was seen .
Although examination of the female infant yielded no specific findings suggestive of the syndrome , her mother and maternal great-grandmother had features that allowed the diagnosis to be made .
Only after 5 months did the streaky hyperkeratotic pattern characteristic of the syndrome develop in the child .
Family members bore other stigmata , including patchy cicatricial <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , coarse hair , follicular atrophoderma , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and short proximal limbs .
The pattern of inheritance in this family is compatible with that of an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> genodermatosis with variable expression .
Histopathologic findings from skin biopsy specimens were psoriasiform rather than ichthyotic .
Decreased peroxisomal enzyme activity was discovered on fibroblast cultures , linking this syndrome with other peroxisomal disorders .
Treatment with oral bezafibrate and clofibrate , which are potential inducers of hepatic peroxisomes , did not result in clinical improvement .
It is recommended that usage of the term chondrodysplasia punctata be restricted to the descriptive radiologic finding of stippled calcifications and that Conradi-HÃ¼nermann syndrome refer only to the disease described herein , which is transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> trait .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum <END> in a Spanish patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> aspartylglucosaminuria <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum <END> ( ACD) , initially considered to be synonymous with Fabry 's disease , represents a well-known cutaneous marker of some other lysosomal enzyme disorders .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Aspartylglucosaminuria <END> ( AGU ) is a rare hereditary disorder mostly affecting the Finnish population , with only a few sporadic patients of non-Finnish origin .
To date , only three patients with AGU have been reported with cutaneous lesions of ACD .
A 19-year-old Spanish woman presented with a 10-year history of progressive ACD affecting the limbs , buttocks and trunk .
After the age of 6 years she had developed progressive mental deterioration , <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse facies <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> macroglossia <END> with a scrotal appearance .
Peripheral blood smears showed many <START:PHENOTYPE> vacuolated lymphocytes <END> .
Enzyme analysis in cultured fibroblasts revealed a decreased activity of aspartylglucosaminidase .
By the age of 31 years the patient had developed a bipolar psychosis , polycystic ovarian disease and severe impairment of cognitive skills .
This is the first case of AGU detected in a Spanish patient presenting with cutaneous lesions of ACD . To our knowledge , <START:PHENOTYPE> macroglossia <END> with a scrotal appearance and polycystic ovarian disease have not been reported in previous cases of AGU .
Muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency : clinical and molecular genetic features and diagnostic aspects .
Muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase ( CPT) II deficiency is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder of fatty acid oxidation characterized by attacks of <START:PHENOTYPE> myalgia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> myoglobinuria <END> .
This review summarizes the clinical features of this disease , analyzing data of 28 patients with biochemically and genetically confirmed CPT II deficiency .
The review shows that exercise-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> myalgia <END> is the most frequent symptom , whereas <START:PHENOTYPE> myoglobinuria <END> , known as the clinical hallmark , is missing in 21% of the patients .
Typically , <START:PHENOTYPE> myalgia <END> starts in childhood , whereas attacks with <START:PHENOTYPE> myoglobinuria <END> mostly emerge in adolescence or early adulthood .
However , there are also patients with only <START:PHENOTYPE> myalgia <END> , patients with attacks triggered by factors other than exercise , and patients with late-onset disease .
Molecular or biochemical analysis is necessary for diagnosis , since no myopathologic hallmark exists .
For screening patients , analysis of not only the common S113L mutation but also the P50H and Q413fs-F448 L mutations is recommended .
The phenotype of muscle CPT II deficiency might be influenced by the underlying mutation , and patients with a truncating mutation on 1 allele might be affected more severely .
Phenocopies in BRCA1 and BRCA2 families : evidence for modifier genes and implications for screening .
The identification of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> kindreds allows genetic testing of at-risk relatives .
Those who test negative are usually reassured and additional <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> surveillance is discontinued .
However , we postulated that in high-risk families , such as those seen in clinical genetics centres , the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> might be influenced not only by the BRCA1 / BRCA2 mutation but also by modifier genes .
One manifestation of this would be the presence of phenocopies in BRCA1 / BRCA2 kindreds .
277 families with pathogenic BRCA1 / BRCA2 mutations were reviewed and 28 <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> phenocopies identified .
The relative risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in those testing negative was assessed using incidence rates from our cancer registry based on local population .
Phenocopies constituted up to 24% of tests on women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> after the identification of the mutation in the proband .
The standardised incidence ratio for women who tested negative for the BRCA1 / BRCA2 family mutation was 5.3 for all relatives , 5. 0 for all first-degree relatives ( FDRs ) and 3.2 ( 95 % confidence interval 2.0 to 4.9 ) for FDRs in whose family all other cases of breast and ovarian cancer could be explained by the identified mutation .
13 of 107 ( 12 .1% ) FDRs with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and no unexplained family history tested negative .
In high-risk families , women who test negative for the familial BRCA1 / BRCA2 mutation have an increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> consistent with genetic modifiers .
In light of this , such women should still be considered for continued surveillance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> ( SEMDJL ) : a Brazilian case .
This is a report on a Brazilian patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> ( SEMDJL ; MIM 271640) , a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal dysplasia <END> characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> , articular hypermobility , progressive intractable spinal malalignment , a typical facies and a propensity to <START:PHENOTYPE> joint dislocation <END> and subluxation .
The condition has been described only in 20 children of Afrikaans-speaking parents in South Africa .
This is the first report of a non-Afrikaans patient with this genetic entity .
Hypomagnesaemia of hereditary renal origin .
Cases of hypomagnesaemia of hereditary renal origin represent at least three different congenital disorders of tubular reabsorption of magnesium ( Mg ) .
Isolated familial hypomagnesaemia has been reported in a heterogeneous group of patients and an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance has often been found to be present .
Familial hypokalaemia-hypomagnesaemia , inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait , has been reported in 17 patients and we now describe 3 additional cases .
Hypomagnesaemia is accompanied by hypokalaemia , metabolic alkalosis , hypocalciuria and moderate sodium chloride wasting .
Titration of renal Mg reabsorption indicates the presence of a low threshold but a normal Tm .
The inherited defect is probably situated at the level of the distal convoluted tubule and mimics the therapeutic effect of thiazides .
This condition is frequently confused with Bartter 's syndrome .
Familial hypomagnesaemia-hypercalciuria , also inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait , has been reported in at least 15 patients and we now add 3 new cases .
Hypomagnesaemia is always accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> .
Ocular abnormalities such as <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> and horizontal <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> are often present .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypermagnesiuria <END> is of a greater degree than that observed in the previous entity and reflects a low Tm of Mg reabsorption .
The defect must be situated at the level of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and affects the transport of both calcium and Mg but not of sodium and chloride .
This condition has not been clearly separated from hereditary distal <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> in the literature .
Additional case of craniofacial and digital anomalies as reported by Harrod et al . In 1977 Harrod et al . [ BD:OAS XIII ( 3B ) : 111 -115 ] reported 2 brothers with an unusual syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> unusual facial appearance <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large protruding ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogenitalism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , and minor anomalies .
We report on a 46-year-old man with striking resemblance to the children described by Harrod who also has secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> megacolon <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> varicose veins <END> , suggesting a connective tissue disorder .
Occurrence of a multiple sclerosis-like illness in women who have a Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutation .
Eight women are described who presented with bilateral , usually sequential , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> , six of whom later developed a neurological syndrome indistinguishable from multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .
Magnetic resonance imaging , performed in five of the patients with an MS-like illness and in the two others with <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> alone , showed widespread white matter lesions as seen in MS .
All of these women had matrilineal relatives with Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> , although this was not always apparent at presentation , and the most common <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutation associated with this disorder was detected in each of the women and their affected relatives .
On the basis of observations made in these patients , the clinical features of Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> in males , and evidence for mitochondrially encoded peptides involved in the immune response in rodents , we propose that optic nerve damage in this disease could be immunologically mediated and that <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genes may contribute to susceptibility to MS .
ASIP and TYR <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> variants associate with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous melanoma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> .
Fair color increases risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous melanoma <END> ( CM ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> ( BCC ) .
Recent genome-wide association studies have identified variants affecting hair , eye and skin <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> in Europeans .
Here , we assess the effect of these variants on risk of CM and BCC in European populations comprising 2 ,121 individuals with CM , 2 ,163 individuals with BCC and over 40,000 controls .
A haplotype near ASIP , known to affect a similar spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> traits as MC1R variants , conferred significant risk of CM ( odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.45 , P = 1.2 x 10( -9) ) and BCC ( OR = 1.33 , P = 1.2 x 10( -6) ) .
The variant in TYR encoding the R402Q amino acid substitution , previously shown to affect eye color and tanning response , conferred risk of CM ( OR = 1.21 , P = 2.8 x 10( -7) ) and BCC ( OR = 1 .14 , P = 6.1 x 10( -4) ) .
An eye color variant in TYRP1 was associated with risk of CM ( OR = 1 .15 , P = 4.6 x 10( -4) ) .
The association of all three variants is robust with respect to adjustment for the effect of <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> .
The hypobetalipoproteinemias .
The fifth- and ninety-fifth-percentile concentrations of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol in most Western populations are approximately 90 and 200 mg/dl , respectively .
Persons with LDL cholesterol levels equal to or less than the fifth percentile are defined as having <START:PHENOTYPE> hypobetalipoproteinemia <END> .
Epidemiologic studies show that such individuals have lower-than-average risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease but higher risk for a variety of cancers , pulmonary , and gastrointestinal diseases than persons with higher levels of cholesterol .
The reasons for this are not known , nor are the causes of most cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypobetalipoproteinemia <END> .
However , in some well-studied kindreds the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypobetalipoproteinemia <END> phenotype is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
Heterozygotes in such kindreds are usually healthy and have no difficulty absorbing dietary fat .
In most kindreds , the molecular variants responsible for the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypobetalipoproteinemia <END> are unknown , but a subset of kindreds have strong genetic linkages between the low-cholesterol phenotype and truncation-producing mutations of the apolipoprotein ( apo ) B-10 0 gene .
The truncations of apoB are named according to a centile nomenclature .
The full-length 4536-amino acid protein is called apoB-100 , and the 25 truncations identified to date have been named apoB-2 to apoB-89 .
The mutations introduce premature termination codons resulting from frameshift-producing base additions or deletions .
The mutations produce slowed rates of secretion of the truncated apoBs relative to the apoB-100s present in the heterozygotes .
In addition , the apoB-10 0 molecules of the heterozygotes are also secreted at rates slower than those observed in closely matched normolipidemic controls .
These physiologic results account for the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypobetalipoproteinemia <END> of these subjects .
The response of the plasma lipoproteins of heterozygotes to the manipulation of various dietary components remains to be determined .
Additional low-cholesterol syndromes are autosomal recessive forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypobetalipoproteinemia <END> , chylomicron retention disease , and abetalipoproteinemia .
The molecular causes of the first two are unknown .
Abetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal recessive condition resulting from mutations of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein .
All three conditions are characterized by vanishingly small concentrations of LDL , dietary <START:PHENOTYPE> fat malabsorption <END> , and failure to thrive in infancy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Vitiligo <END> : complex segregation and linkage disequilibrium analyses with respect to microsatellite loci spanning the HLA .
Familial clustering and linkage disequilibrium studies suggest that genetic factors predispose to <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> , although a clear transmission pattern and cosegregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> with specific mutations have not been demonstrated .
We collected pedigree data on <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> from a set of 56 multigeneration families belonging to the Paisa community from Antioquia , Colombia , with the goal of applying the unified model of complex segregation and linkage disequilibrium analyses to test the hypotheses of the existence of a major gene predisposing to <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> and that allelic or haplotype polymorphisms of microsatellite loci at 6p21.3-21.4 spanning HLA ( D6S276 , D6S265 , D6S273 , and D6S291 ) are associated with this predisposition .
Minimum sibship sample size to discriminate dominant and recessive inheritance models was largely accomplished .
Between the 15 models of complex segregation used , the one that best fitted the data was that of a major dominant gene and the existence of strong environmental effects acting on the recessive genotype .
The penetrance and risk estimations discriminated two sets of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> patients : those with early onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> cosegregating with a dominant mode of inheritance without environmental effects , and those with late onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> cosegregating with the recessive genotype and being influenced by environmental effects .
After establishing the normal distribution of allelic frequencies and performing multiple comparisons correction , the linkage disequilibrium analysis suggested that a major genetic factor could be located at 6p21.3-21.4 , because we detected significant case-control differences for allele 122 at D6S265 ( Pc= 0.0264 ) and significant linkage disequilibrium between loci D6S276 and D6S273 in the cases but not in the controls .
We cannot explain these results as a consequence of evolutionary forces or as genetic stratification acting differentially on cases and controls , because there was neither deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg expectations nor genetic subdivision between cases and controls , as theta ; ( non-biased F( ST) ) was not significantly different from 0 .
Cantu syndrome in a woman and her two daughters : Further confirmation of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> and review of the cardiac manifestations .
Cantu syndrome , or hypertrichosis-osteodysplasia-cardiomegaly syndrome , is a rare disorder of unknown etiology , associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , characteristic facial features , skeletal abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomegaly <END> , and occasional <START:PHENOTYPE> pericardial effusions <END> .
Although autosomal recessive inheritance was originally proposed , a man with three affected children has been reported , making <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> likely .
We report on a woman and her two daughters with Cantu syndrome , further confirming dominant inheritance .
All three of our patients have cardiac involvement , and symptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> pericardial effusions <END> requiring surgical intervention occurred in the mother and one of her daughters .
Chromosome microarray analysis was normal in one of the girls .
The etiology of the <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomegaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pericardial effusions <END> in Cantu syndrome is unknown .
We review all previously reported cases of Cantu syndrome and the associated cardiac manifestations .

MASA syndrome is due to mutations in the neural cell adhesion gene L1CAM .
MASA syndrome is a recessive X-linked disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> shuffling gait <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> aphasia <END> and , in some cases , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> .
Since it has been shown that X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> can be caused by mutations in L1CAM , a neuronal cell adhesion molecule , we performed an L1CAM mutation analysis in eight unrelated patients with MASA syndrome .
Three different L1CAM mutations were identified : a deletion removing part of the open reading frame and two point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions .
L1CAM , therefore , harbours mutations leading to either MASA syndrome or HSAS , and might be frequently implicated in X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> .
Homozygosity mapping identifies an additional locus for Wolfram syndrome on chromosome 4q . Wolfram syndrome , which is sometimes referred to as " DIDMOAD " ( <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and deafness ) , is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> neurodegenerative disorder for which only insulin-dependent <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> are necessary to make the diagnosis .
Researchers have mapped Wolfram syndrome to chromosome 4p16 .1 , and , recently , a gene encoding a putative transmembrane protein has been cloned and mutations have been identified in patients .
To pursue the possibility of locus heterogeneity , 16 patients from four different families were recruited .
These patients , who have the Wolfram syndrome phenotype , also have additional features that have not previously been reported .
There is an absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> in all affected family members .
In addition , several patients have profound upper gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding .
With the use of three microsatellite markers ( D4S432 , D4S3023 , and D4S2366 ) reported to be linked to the chromosome 4p16 .1 locus , we significantly excluded linkage in three of the four families .
The two affected individuals in one family showed homozygosity for all three markers from the region of linkage on chromosome 4p16 .1 .
For the other three families , genetic heterogeneity for Wolfram syndrome was verified by demonstration of linkage to chromosome 4q22-24.
In conclusion , we report the unique clinical findings and linkage-analysis results of 16 patients with Wolfram syndrome and provide further evidence for the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder .
We also provide data on a new locus that plays a role in the etiology of insulin-dependent <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> .
Detection of a cryptic paracentric inversion within band 11p13 in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> by fluorescence in situ hybridization .
We report the first familial case of dominantly inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> with a cryptic inversion within band 11p13 .
High-resolution chromosome analysis gave a suspicion of a tiny constitutional aberration around band 11p13 and fluorescence in situ hybridization using 11p cosmids successfully confirmed that the <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> patients of this family have an inversion within band 11p13 .
The distal breakpoint of the inversion is telomeric to a candidate <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> gene ( AN2 ) and suggests that more genes might be involved in the etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
In situ hybridization is a powerful tool to detect cryptic rearrangements in sporadic or familial patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
This family indicated the importance of careful observation of the 11p13 region of <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> patients , even if the <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> was autosomal dominantly inherited .
FAME 3 : a novel form of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and epilepsy .
Familial adult myoclonic epilepsy ( FAME ) is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , and rare seizures , and is a <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive disorder <END> linked to the FAME 1 locus .
A similar disorder has been linked to the FAME 2 locus . Seventeen patients from two families with <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and epilepsy were evaluated clinically and underwent EEG , EMG , jerk-locked averaging , and MRI scanning .
Three had responses to magnetic stimulation assessed .
Linkage was assessed for microsatellite markers across the FAME 1 and 2 loci .
The median age at onset was 20 years , with many patients having frequent seizures , cognitive impairment , and cerebellar dysfunction .
Electrophysiologic features of cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> were typically present , but photosensitivity was uncommon .
MRI frequently demonstrated cerebellar atrophy.
Pathology of a single case showed Purkinje cell loss , dentate atrophy , and neuronal loss and gliosis in the olives and pallidum .
Analysis of genotypes for markers at the FAME 1 and FAME 2 loci excluded these as the region containing the same locus in one family , but only the FAME 2 locus was excluded in the other family .
This form of familial adult myoclonic epilepsy does not show linkage to either of the known familial adult myoclonic epilepsy loci , and is characterized in some members by frequent seizures , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , dementia , and progression of the disease .
This may represent a new form of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and epilepsy , which we have termed familial adult myoclonic epilepsy type 3 .
Developmental <START:PHENOTYPE> coxa vara <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> spondylometaphyseal dysplasia <END> ( DCV/SMD ) : " SMD-corner fracture type " ( DCV/SMD-CF ) demonstrated in most reported cases .
This paper reports three children with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> : developmental <START:PHENOTYPE> coxa vara <END> unilateral in the first case and bilateral in the other two ; somewhat squared and " ovoid " vertebral bodies in the first patient , and normal to slightly tall vertebral bodies in the third ; metaphyseal changes in some long tubular bones including bone fragments similar to the corner fractures seen in child abuse in all three patients .
The first and second patients were sisters ; their mother , also quite short , had surgical procedures in early life for bilateral " <START:PHENOTYPE> coxa vara <END> " ; their brother , also of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , had bilateral coxa valga with otherwise normal femoral heads and necks , and mild metaphyseal changes associated with two minute " corner fractures " in the proximal metaphysis of the left tibia .
A review of reported cases of developmental <START:PHENOTYPE> coxa vara <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> spondylometaphyseal dysplasia <END> revealed that simulated corner fractures were present in most instances .
Craniofrontonasal dysplasia : phenotypic expression in females and males and genetic considerations .
The phenotype and pattern of inheritance of craniofrontonasal dysplasia were analyzed in 66 affected persons from 18 families , including one four-generation kindred personally studied .
Females were more severely affected than males .
Affected females had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal root <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly of toes <END> and fingers , and vertical grooving of nails .
Males had increased bony interorbital distances and distances between the inner canthi of the eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal root <END> , broad halluces , and vertical grooving of nails but no <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> .
Affected men transmitted the condition to all of their daughters but to no sons , while affected women transmitted the disorder to about half their daughters and half their sons .
This pattern is compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant inheritance <END> , but the far milder manifestation of the syndrome in males cannot be explained by simple mendelian genetics .
A novel variation in the Twinkle linker region causing late-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Variations in the mitochondrial helicase Twinkle ( PEO1 ) gene are usually associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> ( PEO ) .
We describe five patients from two unrelated Alsatian families with the new R374W variation in the Twinkle linker region who progressively developed an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> multisystem disorder with PEO , hearing loss , myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphonia <END> , sensory neuropathy , and late-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> resembling Alzheimer 's disease . These observations demonstrate that Twinkle variations in the linker domain alter cerebral function and further implicate disrupted mitochondrial DNA integrity in the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Mice deficient in Six5 develop <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> : implications for myotonic dystrophy.
Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3 ' UTR of the gene DMPK at the DM1 locus on chromosome 19 causes myotonic dystrophy , a dominantly inherited disease characterized by skeletal muscle dystrophy and <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac conduction defects <END> .
Targeted deletion of Dm15 , the mouse orthologue of human DMPK , produced mice with a mild myopathy and <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac conduction abnormalities <END> , but without other features of myotonic dystrophy , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
We , and others , have demonstrated that repeat expansion decreases expression of the adjacent gene SIX5 ( refs 7,8 ) , which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor .
To determine whether SIX5 deficiency contributes to the myotonic dystrophy phenotype , we disrupted mouse Six5 by replacing the first exon with a beta-galactosidase reporter .
Six5-mutant mice showed reporter expression in multiple tissues , including the developing lens .
Homozygous mutant mice had no apparent abnormalities of skeletal muscle function , but developed lenticular opacities at a higher rate than controls .
Our results suggest that SIX5 deficiency contributes to the <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> phenotype in myotonic dystrophy , and that myotonic dystrophy represents a multigenic disorder .
A hereditary moyamoya syndrome with multisystemic manifestations .
We report a detailed description of a family affected by a hereditary multisystem disorder associated with moyamoya syndrome .
In this family case report , we evaluated 9 members of the same family originating from Algeria .
Investigations included neuroimaging , cardiologic and ophthalmologic evaluation , hormonal testing , hemoglobin electrophoresis , chromosomal karyotyping , muscle biopsy for morphology , immunohistochemistry and enzyme assays , mtDNA mutation screening , and haplotype analysis of 2 loci previously linked to moyamoya , on chromosomes 10 ( ACTA2 ) and 17 . Five males related through a maternal lineage were affected , suggesting an X-linked inheritance .
Four of them had symptomatic moyamoya syndrome with an onset of acute neurologic manifestations between 4 and 32 years .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> azoospermia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> of postnatal onset ( -2 to -4 SD in adulthood) , <START:PHENOTYPE> premature graying of hair <END> , and dysmorphism were present in all patients .
The other features of the disease included early <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> in 4 , <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> in 3 , and partial <START:PHENOTYPE> growth hormone deficiency <END> in 2 members . Muscle biopsy data did not reveal signs of a mitochondrial disorder .
All conditions known to be associated with moyamoya syndrome such as Down syndrome , neurofibromatosis , and sickle cell disease were excluded .
We also excluded linkage to the 2 loci previously reported to be involved in autosomal dominant syndromic and nonsyndromic moyamoya .
Carrier females had normal phenotype and clinical history .
These data strongly suggest that this family is affected by a hereditary moyamoya multisystem disorder with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> pattern of inheritance .
Familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> : recognition among patients referred after unsuccessful parathyroid exploration .
Of 67 patients referred after unsuccessful surgery for presumed primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> , six were shown to be members of kindreds with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
This diagnosis had not been recognized in any of the six previosuly . Most of the remaining 61 cases had proven or probable typical primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> , and a subgroup of four had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> with suppression of the parathyroid glands .
Urine calcium excretion expressed as the calcium:creatinine clearance ratio provided an easily measurable and effective index to separate the groups with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> , typical primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> , and suppressed parathyroids .
Thus , at least 9% of patients referred after unsuccessful parathyroidectomy had familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
The assessment of urine calcium excretion by indices such as the calcium:creatinine clearance ratio should facilitate recognition of this condition , which responds poorly to standard subtotal parathyroidectomy .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> oto-facial syndrome with midline malformations .
Two sisters from a Lebanese family presented with slight <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , frontal bossing , mild hyperplastic supra-orbital ridges , broad nasal root , small dysplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , high arched palate , short neck , and hearing impairment .
In addition , the oldest affected sister had <START:PHENOTYPE> esophageal atresia <END> and the other sister had <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
Temporal bone abnormalities included hypoplasia of the external auditory canal , small middle ear cavity , abnormal ossicles , and inner ear malformations with enlarged vestibular acqueducts .
Differential diagnosis is discussed , and the possibility of a newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome is raised .

A systematic mutation screen of 10 nuclear and 25 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> candidate genes in 21 patients with cytochrome c oxidase ( COX ) deficiency shows tRNA( Ser ) ( UCN ) mutations in a subgroup with syndromal encephalopathy.
COX deficiency is believed to be the most common defect in neonates and infants with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> diseases .
To explore the causes of this group of disorders , we examined 25 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genes ( three COX subunit genes and 22 tRNA genes ) and 10 nuclear COX subunit genes for disease associated mutations using PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing of polymorphic SSCP fragments .
DNA from one patient with severe COX deficiency and with consanguineous parents was entirely sequenced .
The patient population consisted of 21 unrelated index patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disorders and predominant ( n=7 ) or isolated ( n=14 ) COX deficiency .
We detected two distinct tRNA( Ser ) ( UCN ) mutations , which have been recently described in single kindreds , in a subgroup of four patients with COX deficiency , deafness , myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Besides a number of nucleotide variants , a single novel missense mutation , which may contribute to the disease phenotype , was found in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encoded COX 1 gene ( G648 0A ) .
Mutations in nuclear encoded COX subunit genes were not detected in this study .
HOXA2 haploinsufficiency in dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral microtia <END> and hearing loss .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microtia <END> is a rare , congenital malformation of the external ear that in some cases has a genetic etiology .
We ascertained a three-generation family with <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral microtia <END> and hearing loss segregating as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
Exome sequencing of affected family members detected only seven shared , rare , heterozygous , nonsynonymous variants , including one protein truncating variant , a HOXA2 nonsense change ( c.703C>T , p.Q235* ) .
The HOXA2 variant was segregated with <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> and hearing loss in the family and was not seen in 6 ,50 0 individuals sequenced by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project or in 218 control individuals sequenced in this study .
HOXA2 has been shown to be critical for outer and middle ear development through mouse models and has previously been associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral microtia <END> .
Our data extend these conclusions and define HOXA2 haploinsufficiency as the first genetic cause for autosomal-dominant nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Megalencephaly <END> with dysmyelination , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and distinctive neurophysiological findings in two siblings .
A progressive neurological condition characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> megalencephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in two siblings of consanguineous parents is described .
The electroencephalogram showed posterior discharges and an unusual photoparoxysmal response whereas brainstem auditory evoked potential findings were consistent with a white matter disorder .
Computerized tomography scans revealed diffuse hypodensity of the white matter and a brain biopsy on one sibling showed features of dysmyelination without evidence of demyelination , Rosenthal fibres or the spongy changes characteristic of Canavan 's disease .
There was no detectable biochemical abnormality .
This combination of clinical , neurophysiological and neuropathological abnormalities has not previously been described .
Restrictive dermopathy : report and review .
Restrictive dermopathy ( RD ) is a lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> genodermatosis ( MIM No . 275 210 ) in which tautness of the skin causes fetal akinesia or hypokinesia deformation sequence ( FADS ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Polyhydramnios <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced fetal movements <END> is followed by <START:PHENOTYPE> premature delivery <END> at around 31 weeks gestation .
Manifestations include a tightly adherent , thin , translucent skin with prominent vessels , typical facial changes , generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> enlarged fontanelles <END> , dysplasia of clavicles , <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory insufficiency <END> , and an enlarged placenta with <START:PHENOTYPE> short umbilical cord <END> .
Histologic abnormalities of the skin include thin dermis with paucity and hypoplasia of the appendages and abnormally arranged collagen bundles .
Elastic fibers are nearly missing .
The subcutaneous fat is slightly increased .
These skin findings usually appear after 22 or 24 weeks of gestation , which is why prenatal diagnosis with skin biopsy may fail .
This disease is easily differentiated from other congenital FADS , such as Pena-Shokeir syndrome , COFS syndrome , Parana hard-skin syndrome , etc .
We report on an affected boy of consanguineous parents and 30 previous cases are reviewed .
X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> : a survey of a 20 year period in Victoria , Australia .
This study ascertained 164 males with non-communicating <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> in live or stillborn patients in Victoria .
Australia in 1962 to 1982 , after excluding those cases secondary to brain malformations other than aqueduct stenosis .
Ascertainment was considered near complete , especially for the period since 1974 , but details of the aqueduct pathology were inadequate in half the cases .
A total of 91 families was seen to record detailed family information .
The overall incidence of primary non-communicating <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> was estimated to be 0.6 +/- 0.2 per 1000 live and stillbirths , with three-fifths of the cases male .
Twelve patients were classified as having definite X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> and 13 others as probable cases of this condition .
Deformities of the thumbs ( generally adduction deformity ) were present in nearly half of these cases .
The pyramids were absent from sections of the medulla whenever these were available .
Four of five survivors had signs suggesting pyramidal tract lesions , compared to four of 25 surviving non-X linked cases .
The intellectual outcome was notably poorer in the X linked cases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Poor school performance <END> was also described in five of 19 mothers of X linked cases but in only one of 64 mothers of the remaining cases .
Familial recurrence in the whole group of patients was almost confined to the X linked families .
The exceptions were two families in whom <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> is possible .
It is important to remember X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> in genetic counselling .
Examination of the thumbs , search for clinical signs of pyramidal tract lesions , and anatomical examination of the pyramids in medullary sections are all important , along with careful questioning for a history of affected maternal relatives .
The presence of any of these features is grounds for counseling on the basis of X linked inheritance .
An empirical figure was derived to use when counseling about a male with non-communicating <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> in whom there is no adequate information about the thumbs or the pyramids : a 4% recurrence risk in male sibs and 2% in females .
Mentally retarded siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> , peculiar facies and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> in the male : possible McDonough syndrome with coincidental ( X ; 20) translocation .
We report on a family in which two of the three children ( girl and boy ) have a MCA/MR syndrome consisting of peculiar facies , retarded psychomotor development , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diastasis recti <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> in the boy .
This syndrome is quite similar to that of the only family previously described and which was denominated McDonough Syndrome .
The syndrome is delineated and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> is suggested as the most likely etiology .
A balanced translocation ( X ; 20) in the affected boy and in the unaffected mother was a coincidental finding .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> linked to chromosome 16q22.1 is associated with a single-nucleotide substitution in the 5 ' untranslated region of the gene encoding a protein with spectrin repeat and Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange-factor domains .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> ( ADCA ) is a group of heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders .
By positional cloning , we have identified the gene strongly associated with a form of degenerative <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( chromosome 16q22.1-linked ADCA ) that clinically shows progressive pure <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
Detailed examination by use of audiogram suggested that <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural hearing impairment <END> may be associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> in our families .
After restricting the candidate region in chromosome 16q22.1 by haplotype analysis , we found that all patients from 52 unrelated Japanese families harbor a heterozygous C-->T single-nucleotide substitution , 16 nt upstream of the putative translation initiation site of the gene for a hypothetical protein DKFZP434I216 , which we have called " puratrophin-1 " ( Purkinje cell atrophy associated protein-1 ) .
The full-length puratrophin-1 mRNA had an open reading frame of 3,576 nt , predicted to contain important domains , including the spectrin repeat and the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) for Rho GTPases , followed by the Dbl-homologous domain , which indicates the role of puratrophin-1 in intracellular signaling and actin dynamics at the Golgi apparatus .
Puratrophin-1--normally expressed in a wide range of cells , including epithelial hair cells in the cochlea--was aggregated in Purkinje cells of the chromosome 16q22.1-linked ADCA brains .
Consistent with the protein prediction data of puratrophin-1 , the Golgi-apparatus membrane protein and spectrin also formed aggregates in Purkinje cells .
The present study highlights the importance of the 5 ' untranslated region ( UTR ) in identification of genes of human disease , suggests that a single-nucleotide substitution in the 5 ' UTR could be associated with protein aggregation , and indicates that the GEF protein is associated with cerebellar degeneration in humans .
A recessive contiguous gene deletion causing infantile hyperinsulinism , <START:PHENOTYPE> enteropathy <END> and deafness identifies the Usher type 1C gene .
Usher syndrome type 1 describes the association of profound , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vestibular hypofunction <END> and childhood onset <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
It is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition and is subdivided on the basis of linkage analysis into types 1A through 1E . Usher type 1C maps to the region containing the genes ABCC8 and KCNJ11 (encoding components of ATP-sensitive K + ( KATP ) channels ) , which may be mutated in patients with hyperinsulinism .
We identified three individuals from two consanguineous families with severe hyperinsulinism , profound <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> enteropathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular dysfunction <END> .
The molecular basis of the disorder is a homozygous 122-kb deletion of 11p14-15 , which includes part of ABCC8 and overlaps with the locus for Usher syndrome type 1C and DFNB18 .
The centromeric boundary of this deletion includes part of a gene shown to be mutated in families with type 1C Usher syndrome , and is hence assigned the name USH1C .
The pattern of expression of the USH1C protein is consistent with the clinical features exhibited by individuals with the contiguous gene deletion and with isolated Usher type 1C .
Localization of the gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia <END> syndrome , on the long arm of chromosome 1 , by homozygosity mapping .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia <END> , also known as " TR MA " or " Rogers syndrome, " is an early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder defined by the occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> megaloblastic anemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , responding in varying degrees to thiamine treatment .
On the basis of a linkage analysis of affected families of Alaskan and of Italian origin , we found , using homozygosity mapping , that the TR MA-syndrome gene maps to a region on chromosome 1q23.2-23.3 ( maximum LOD score of 3.7 for D1S1679 ) .
By use of additional consanguineous kindreds of Israeli-Arab origin , the putative disease-gene interval also has been confirmed and narrowed , suggesting genetic homogeneity .
Linkage analysis generated the highest combined LOD-score value , 8 .1 at a recombination fraction of 0 , with marker D1S2799 .
Haplotype analysis and recombination events narrowed the TRMA locus to a 16-cM region between markers D1S194 and D1S278 6 .
Several heterozygote parents had <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , deafness , or <START:PHENOTYPE> megaloblastic anemia <END> , which raised the possibility that mutations at this locus predispose carriers in general to these manifestations .
Characterization of the metabolic defect of TRMA may shed light on the role of thiamine deficiency in such common diseases .
Uruguay facio-cardio-musculo-skeletal syndrome : a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> disorder .
We report on three male patients from a single family with a <START:PHENOTYPE> brachyturricephaly <END> , " pugilistic " facial appearance , a muffled voice , <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> , muscular hypertrophy , broad hands , wide feet with <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive pes cavus <END> deformities , <START:PHENOTYPE> dislocation of toes <END> , variable <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hip dislocation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
Three other males in the family , now deceased from cardiac disease , appear to have had the same disorder .
The mother of the propositus has milder signs of the syndrome .
All affected males are related through the maternal line .
These cases represent an apparently previously undescribed <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> syndrome .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> megalencephaly <END> at birth and <START:PHENOTYPE> low intelligence <END> level .
To evaluate the association between primary <START:PHENOTYPE> megalencephaly <END> ( PMG ) at birth and psychosensory conditions and to determine mother-child similarity for PMG at birth . PMG is defined as a head circumference ( HC ) above the 98th percentile that most likely is due to brain enlargement and is not secondary to disease . Previously , PMG in children was reported to be associated with learning disabilities .
Contradictory results regarding an association between PMG and intelligence in children exist .
Many believe PMG expressed in childhood and adulthood may be inherited .
Birth records on HC from 144 ,273 boys , of whom 732 had PMG , were linked to data concerning intelligence level , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and impairment of vision and hearing .
A potential association between PMG at birth and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> was also examined in 3,204 mentally retarded boys and girls .
Parent-offspring similarity for PMG at birth was determined in 13 ,585 mother-child pairs .
PMG was significantly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> low intelligence <END> level ( odds ratio , 1.32 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI] , 1 .11 to 1.38 ) .
The estimated odds ratio for <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in PMG cases versus controls was 1.31 ( 95 % CI , 0.8 0 to 2.02 ) .
There were no differences in frequencies of vision and hearing impairments between PMG cases and controls .
Associations between mother 's and child 's birth weight-normalized HC ( r = 0.14 ; p< 0.0001 ) and PMG ( odds ratio , 2.55 ; CI , 2.00 to 3.25 ) were found , supporting a multifactorial inheritance of PMG . PMG at birth is a risk factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> low intelligence <END> level but not for vision and hearing impairments .
The heritability of HC and PMG is moderate .
Recurrence of the T666M calcium channel CACNA1A gene mutation in familial hemiplegic migraine with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
Familial hemiplegic migraine ( HM ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine with aura <END> .
In 20% of HM families , HM is associated with a mild permanent <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> ( PCA ) .
The CACNA1A gene encoding the alpha1A subunit of P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels is involved in 5 0 % of unselected HM families and in all families with HM/PCA .
Four CACNA1A missense mutations have been identified in HM : two in pure HM and two in HM/PCA .
Different CACNA1A mutations have been identified in other <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> conditions : mutations leading to a truncated protein in episodic <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 2 ( EA2 ) , small expansions of a CAG trinucleotide in spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 6 and also in three families with EA2 features , and , finally , a missense mutation in a single family suffering from episodic <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and severe progressive PCA .
We screened 16 families and 3 nonfamilial case patients affected by HM/PCA for specific CACNA1A mutations and found nine families and one nonfamilial case with the same T666M mutation , one new mutation ( D715E ) in one family , and no CAG repeat expansion .
Both T666M and D715E substitutions were absent in 12 probands belonging to pure HM families whose disease appears to be linked to CACNA1 A . Finally , haplotyping with neighboring markers suggested that T666M arose through recurrent mutational events .
These data could indicate that the PCA observed in 20% of HM families results from specific pathophysiologic mechanisms .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraparesis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> x-linked <END> neurodegenerative disorder .
We studied a large kindred with a chronic neurodegenerative disorder , affecting at least six male members in three generations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spastic paraparesis <END> , beginning at about 10 years of age , and hearing deficits were present in all affected members .
Additionally , <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> ophthalmologic abnormalities , sensory deficits , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein , and absent or prolonged somatosensory evoked potentials were seen in some relatives .
Although clinically similar to adrenomyeloneuropathy , the plasma and fibroblast levels of saturated very long-chain fatty acids were normal .
This syndrome probably represents a new type of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraparesis <END> .
Neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> cyanosis <END> due to a novel fetal hemoglobin : Hb F-Circleville [Ggamma63 ( E7) His-->Leu , CAT> CTT] .
Neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> cyanosis <END> can result from a multitude of acquired and inherited causes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cyanosis <END> resulting from fetal M hemoglobin ( Hb ) variants is very rare .
Only two ( G)gamma variants causing <START:PHENOTYPE> methemoglobinemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cyanosis <END> in the newborn have been reported to date .
Here we describe a novel fetal Hb variant , Hb F-Circleville [Ggamma63 ( E7) His-->Leu] , associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> methemoglobinemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cyanosis <END> in the newborn .
The patient 's sister also had neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> cyanosis <END> at birth .
Children with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hemihypertrophy <END> and beckwith-wiedemann syndrome have different constitutional epigenotypes associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> wilms tumor <END> .
Idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hemihypertrophy <END> ( IH) is a congenital overgrowth syndrome associated with an increased risk of embryonal cancers in childhood .
A related developmental disorder is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ( BWS) , which increases risk for embryonal cancers , including <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> .
Constitutional epigenetic alterations associated with BWS have been well characterized and include epigenetic alterations of imprinted genes on 11p15 .
The frequency of hypermethylation of H19 in children with IH and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> , 20% ( 3/15 ) , was significantly lower than the frequency in children with BWS and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> , 79 % ( 11 /14 ; P = .0028 ) .
These results indicate that children with IH and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> have different constitutional epigenotypes from those of children with BWS and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> .
A <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutation at nucleotide pair 14459 of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 gene associated with maternally inherited Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
A five-generation Hispanic family expressing maternally transmitted Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> and/or early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral basal ganglia lesions <END> was studied .
Buffy coat <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( mtDNA ) from a severely affected child was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and greater than 90 % sequenced .
The mtDNA proved to be a Native American haplogroup D genotype and differed from the standard " Cambridge " sequence at 40 nucleotide positions .
One of these variants , a G-to-A transition at nucleotide pair ( np ) 14459 , changed a moderately conserved alanine to a valine at NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 ( ND6 ) residue 72 .
The np 14459 variant was not found in any of 38 Native American haplogroup D mtDNAs , nor was it detected in 108 Asian , 103 Caucasian , or 99 African mtDNAs .
Six maternal relatives in three generations were tested and were found to harbor the mutation , with one female affected with Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> being heteroplasmic .
Thus , the np 14459 G-to-A missense mutation is specific to this family , alters a moderately conserved amino acid in a complex I gene , is a unique mtDNA variant in Native American haplogroup D , and is heteroplasmic , suggesting that it is the disease-causing mutation .
Allgrove syndrome : an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of ACTH insensitivity , <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> .
Allgrove syndrome ( isolated glucocorticoid deficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> ) was found in eight members of an inbred French Canadian/North American Indian pedigree .
The high degree of consanguinity supports an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance for this disorder .
Six patients presented with hypoglycaemia and other evidence of cortisol deficiency between 2.5 and 8 years of age ; however , two others became cortisol deficient after initial testing showed normal cortisol responses to ACTH , evidence that the <START:PHENOTYPE> glucocorticoid insufficiency <END> of this syndrome may not be congenital , but may develop as late as the third decade .
No evidence of mineralocorticoid deficiency has been found during 65 patient-years of follow-up .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Alacrima <END> was the earliest and most consistent clinical sign of Allgrove syndrome . Other manifestations of peripheral or autonomic neuropathy were found in four patients .
The patients showed similar facial features , and three had significant velo-pharyngeal incompetence .
All showed oesophageal dysmotility even in the absence of symptomatic dysphagia .
In-vitro studies of lymphocyte ACTH binding showed no differences from normal controls .
If such lymphocyte binding , as has been suggested , reflects adrenal ACTH receptor activity , these data would suggest that the glucocorticoid deficiency of Allgrove syndrome is not the result of a defect in that receptor .
However , the observation that ACTH does not elicit increased adenylate cyclase activity even in normal lymphocytes casts considerable doubt on the physiological significance of ACTH binding to lymphocytes .
It seems likely , therefore , that true ACTH receptors are not expressed on peripheral lymphocytes , and any conclusions regarding a possible receptor defect in Allgrove syndrome must await studies of receptor expression on adrenal cell membranes .
Identification of a novel GPR143 mutation in a large Chinese family with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> as the most prominent and consistent manifestation .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> is characterized by involuntary , rhythmical , repeated oscillations of one or both eyes .
We studied a large Chinese family with <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> as a prominent and consistent manifestation phenotype in nine patients to map and identify a disease-causing gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> recessive inheritance was observed in the family , and foveal hypoplasia was detected in some of the nine patients .
The disease gene was mapped to an approximately 10.6 Mb region flanked by DXS996 and DXS7593 on Xp22 with a significant peak multipoint LOD score .
Analysis of 21 candidate genes in the region revealed a novel p.S89F mutation in the second transmembrane domain of GPR143 , a G protein-coupled receptor which causes <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> when mutated .
All male patients in the family were hemizygous for the mutation ; the female carriers were heterozygous for the mutation .
The p.S89F mutation was not identified in 100 normal females or 100 normal males .
Our results indicate that a mutation in the GPR143 gene can cause a variant form of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> , with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> as the most prominent and only consistent finding in all patients in this Chinese family .
These results expand the spectrum of clinical phenotypes associated with GPR143 mutations .
Identification of a CRYAB mutation associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> posterior polar cataract <END> in a Chinese family .
A four-generation Chinese family with 13 members affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> posterior polar cataract <END> was studied .
The purpose of this study was to identify the disease-causing gene in the family and to validate that mutations in CRYAB , the alphaB-crystallin gene , cause the <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> .
Linkage analysis was performed with a panel of microsatellite markers flanking candidate genetic loci for cataracts , including 14 known <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> ( ADCC ) genes .
For mutation analysis , the complete coding region and exon-intron boundaries of CRYAB were sequenced with DNA from the proband .
Single-strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis for exon 1 of CRYAB was performed in all family members and 200 normal control subjects .
The disease gene in the Chinese family was mapped to chromosome 11 in region q22-22.3 with a maximum lod score of 4.52 .
Direct DNA sequence of CRYAB revealed a heterozygous C-->T transition at nucleotide 58 , resulting in a novel 58 C-->T ( Pro20Ser ) mutation .
The Pro20Ser mutation cosegregated with all affected individuals and was not present in unaffected members in the family or in 200 normal control subjects .
The mutation occurs at the evolutionarily conserved residue Pro20 in the N-terminal region of alphaB-crystallin .
To date , only one CRYAB mutation has been associated with congenital isolated cataract .
This study identified a second novel mutation in CRYAB in a large Chinese cataract family .
Together , these results provide strong evidence that CRYAB is a pathogenic gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> .
Dyslipemia in familial partial lipodystrophy caused by an R482W mutation in the LMNA gene .
Lipatrophic diabetes , also referred to as familial partial lipodystrophy , is a rare disease that is metabolically characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> .
Affected patients typically present with regional loss of body fat and muscular hypertrophic appearance .
Variable symptoms may comprise pancreatitis and/or eruptive xanthomas due to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> , polycystic ovaria , and carpal tunnel syndrome .
Mutations within the LMNA gene on chromosome 1q21.2 were recently reported to result in the phenotype of familial partial lipodystrophy.
The genetic trait is <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> .
We identified a family with partial lipodystrophy carrying the R482W ( Arg(482 )Trp ) missense mutation within LMNA .
Here we present the lipoprotein characteristics in this family in detail .
Clinically , the loss of sc fat and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypertrophy <END> especially of the lower extremities started as early as in childhood .
Acanthosis and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> developed later in life , followed by diabetes .
The characterization of the lipoprotein subfractions revealed that affected children present with hyperlipidemia .
The presence and severity of hyperlipidemia seem to be influenced by age , apolipoprotein E genotype , and the coexistence of <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> .
In conclusion , dyslipemia is an early and prominent feature in the presented lipodystrophic family carrying the R482W mutation within LMNA .
Genetic heterogeneity in <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> : the SLC3A1 gene is linked to type I but not to type III <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cystinuria <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> amino-aciduria where three urinary phenotypes have been described ( I , II , and III ) .
An amino acid transporter gene , SLC3A1 ( formerly rBAT) , was found to be responsible for this disorder .
To assess whether mutations in SLC3A1 are involved in different <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> phenotypes , linkage with this gene and its nearest marker ( D2S119 ) was analyzed in 22 families with type I and/or type III <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> .
Linkage with heterogeneity was proved ( alpha = 0.45 ; P < 0.008 ) .
Type I/I families showed homogeneous linkage to SLC3A1 ( Zmax > 3. 0 at theta = 0.00 ; alpha = 1 ) , whereas types I/III and III/III were not linked .
Our data suggest that type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> is due to mutations in the SLC3A1 gene , whereas another locus is responsible for type III.
This result establishes genetic heterogeneity for <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> , classically considered as a multiallelic monogenic disease .
The Renpenning syndrome spectrum : new clinical insights supported by 13 new PQBP1-mutated males .
Since the first reports of polyglutamine-binding protein 1 ( PQBP1 ) mutations in Renpenning syndrome and related disorders , the spectrum of PQBP1-linked clinical manifestations has been outlined from rare published case reports .
The phenotypic description is often obtained from medical archives , and therefore , heterogeneous .
Moreover , some aspects such as brain imaging or cognitive and behavioral functioning are rarely described .
In this study , 13 PQBP1-mutated French patients were subjected to a standardized clinical , cognitive and behavioral assessment .
Physical measurements of their relatives were also collected .
We report on a recognizable clinical and radiological phenotype .
All patients presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , leanness and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , relative to familial measurements .
Three new clinical features are described : upper back progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular atrophy <END> , metacarpophalangeal ankylosis of the thumb and velar dysfunction .
The specific facial dysmorphic features included at least four of the following signs : long <START:PHENOTYPE> triangular face <END> , large ridged nose , half-depilated eyebrows , dysplastic or <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding ears <END> and rough slightly <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> .
An over-aged appearance was noticed in elderly patients .
Cortical gyrification was normal based on available magnetic brain imaging of six patients . PQBP1-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( or Renpenning syndrome ) is an X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome , which has clinically recognizable features .

Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , midface prominence , prominent/simple ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> severe myopia <END> , borderline intelligence , and bone fragility in two brothers : new syndrome ?
We report on two brothers , born to double first cousin Jordanian Arab parents , with a syndrome comprising severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> with upslanted palpebral fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , abnormal ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> sloping shoulders <END> , enamel hypoplasia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopenia <END> with repeated fractures .
Both have <START:PHENOTYPE> severe myopia <END> , mild to moderate sensori-neural hearing loss and borderline intelligence .
Results of chromosome analysis were normal as was a FISH assay for subtelomeric rearrangements .
The father has mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> but the family history is otherwise unremarkable .
We think that this represents a previously unrecognized autosomal or X-linked recessive syndrome .

Expanding the spectrum of the Perlman syndrome .
We report on an infant with manifestations of Perlman syndrome including <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrosomia <END> , bilateral nephromegaly with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephroblastomatosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> visceromegaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> . Other findings in this infant not seen in previous patients were <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> interrupted aortic arch <END> , hypospadias and polysplenia .
This infant meets the diagnostic criteria for Perlman syndrome , suggesting that <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> and cardiac defects may be additional findings in this disorder .
Ocular findings in primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperoxaluria <END> .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperoxaluria <END> ( primary oxalosis ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> inborn error of glyoxylate metabolism that causes widespread calcium oxalate crystal deposition in diverse tissues .
Because others have reported only occasional ocular involvement , we reviewed the ophthalmologic findings in our 24 patients with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperoxaluria <END> to document its funduscopic variability and to determine its visual prognosis and its possible systemic significance .
Eight (30% ) of our 24 patients with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperoxaluria <END> exhibited a bilaterally symmetrical retinopathy.
The abnormalities were predominantly confined to the posterior pole and ranged from many small (100- to 200-microns ) subretinal black ringlets to single large ( 2- to 3-disc diameter ) geographic lesions .
In 3 of the 8 patients with oxalate <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , diffuse optic disc pallor was evident .
Five patients with both normal-appearing optic discs and oxalate <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> had relatively good visual acuities .
The maculopathy of primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperoxaluria <END> caused mild visual impairment while optic nerve dysfunction associated with this disease appeared to be much visually debilitating .
Also , the presence of oxalate maculopathy was associated with a more severe systemic course for the disease .
Third case of cerebral , ocular , dental , auricular , skeletal anomalies ( CODAS ) syndrome , further delineating a new malformation syndrome : first report of an affected male and review of literature .
CODAS syndrome ( MIM# 600373 ) is a rare multiple congenital anomalies syndrome .
The disorder is highly distinctive with characteristic features consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , unusual enamel projections , overfolded and crumpled ears , epiphyseal dysplasia , and dysmorphic features ( grooved nose , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> ) .
To date , there have been two affected female children reported .
The first was a Canadian girl of Mennonite descent , reported by our group , and the second was a girl from Brazil .
The etiology and pattern of inheritance of CODAS is unknown .
Herein we report a third affected child , a Canadian male infant of Mennonite ancestry .
The child , now two years old , exhibits <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> overfolded ears <END> , grooved nasal tip , dental projections , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and characteristic skeletal anomalies .
The findings are characteristic for CODAS syndrome .
All investigations including karyotype , metabolic screening , peroxisomal studies , and studies of cholesterol biosynthesis were normal .
The underlying defect responsible for CODAS syndrome remains unknown .
Many of the features suggest a possible underlying collagen gene defect .
The fact that this child is the second child from the Manitoba Mennonite community , a genetic isolate , suggests the possibility of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
To date , there has not been a familial recurrence .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Lissencephaly <END> .
The first reported case of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> resulting from a consanguinous union strengthens the supposition that in some cases , it is transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
Comparison of this case with a sporadically occurring case of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , with different cortical morphology , suggests that <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> may be an example of either varying gene expressivity or genetic heterogeneity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lissencephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> may eventually be shown to be due to different causes , some inherited , some acquired .
The classical examples of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> are different morphologically from a case in which antenatal cytomegalovirus infection had produced a small smooth brain .
This suggests that antenatal viral infections are destructive rather than teratogenic .
Prenatal diagnosis of Walker-Warburg syndrome in three sibs .
Walker-Warburg syndrome ( WWS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition characterized by diffuse neurodysplasia , resulting in brain and eye abnormalities .
We report on 3 prenatally diagnosed cases of this syndrome born to a consanguineous couple .
An ultrasonographic examination showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> at the 27th week of the first pregnancy .
Amniocentesis documented a normal male karyotype .
The couple opted for termination of the pregnancy but declined an autopsy .
Seven months later , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> was observed at 20 weeks of the second pregnancy .
Termination of pregnancy was performed at the 22nd week .
Autopsy of this male fetus showed dilated ventricles , thin cortex , and <START:PHENOTYPE> type II lissencephaly <END> with microscopic evidence of chaotic architecture .
Eye examination showed <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dysplasia <END> .
Notwithstanding the lack of demonstrable muscle change , the diagnosis of Walker-Warburg syndrome was made .
Ten months later , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> was discovered in the third fetus , a female , at 13 weeks of gestation .
Termination of pregnancy was performed at 20 weeks .
At autopsy , brain , eye , and muscular findings were similar to those of the previous case .
In addition , cystic changes and a stenosis of the pyelo-ureteral junction were found in the right kidney .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Type II lissencephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dysplasia <END> are characteristic of WWS . Muscular dystrophy has been pointed out as an additional abnormality in postnatal cases .
By contrast , the lack of demonstrable muscle changes in the fetal period must be emphasized .
Those cases illustrate practical problems in the ultrasound and pathologic diagnosis of WWS in the fetal period .
Daughter and her mildly affected father with Keipert syndrome .
A 10-year-old girl with characteristic features of Keipert syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> broad terminal phalanges <END> , especially of the thumb and hallux , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , unusual facial features , <START:PHENOTYPE> large head circumference <END> , maxillary hypoplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hoarse voice <END> ) and her mildly affected father ( <START:PHENOTYPE> broad terminal phalanges <END> , especially of the thumb and hallux , <START:PHENOTYPE> large head circumference <END> , maxillary hypoplasia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hoarse voice <END> ) are presented .
The girl is the first reported female with this rare syndrome to date , and the fact that she probably inherited the disease from her father suggests an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern of inheritance .

Mutant myocilin nonsecretion in vivo is not sufficient to cause <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Glaucoma <END> is a leading cause of blindness , affecting over 70 million people worldwide .
Vision loss is the result of death of the retinal ganglion cells .
The best-known risk factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is an elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP) ; however , factors leading to IOP elevation are poorly understood .
Mutations in the MYOC gene are an important cause of open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Over 70 MYOC mutations have been identified , and they lead to approximately 5 % of all primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> cases .
Nevertheless , the pathogenic mechanisms by which these mutations elevate IOP are presently unclear .
Data suggest that a dominant interfering effect of misfolded mutant MYOC molecules may be pathogenic .
To test this hypothesis , we have generated mice carrying a mutant allele of Myoc that is analogous to a human mutation that leads to aggressive <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in patients .
We show that mutant MYOC is not secreted into the aqueous humor .
Instead of being secreted , mutant MYOC accumulates within the iridocorneal angle of the eye , consistent with the behavior of abnormally folded protein .
Surprisingly , the accumulated mutant protein does not activate the unfolded protein response and lead to elevated intraocular pressure or <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in aged mice of different strains .
These data suggest that production , apparent misfolding , and nonsecretion of mutant MYOC are not , by themselves , sufficient to cause <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in vivo .
Array comparative genomic hybridisation of 52 subjects with a Smith-Magenis-like phenotype : identification of dosage sensitive loci also associated with schizophrenia , <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
Smith-Magenis syndrome ( SMS ) is caused by del(17 ) ( p11 .2) , including the retinoic acid induced 1 gene ( RAI1) , or mutation of RAI1 .
Haploinsufficiency of RAI1 results in <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep disturbance <END> , self-abusive behaviors , and most features commonly seen in SMS .
In this study , 52 subjects were referred for molecular analysis of RAI1 due to the presence of an SMS-like phenotype in each case .
For this cohort , deletion and mutation analyses of RAI1 were negative ; thus , the clinical diagnosis of SMS could not be confirmed and suggested that at least one other locus was responsible for the phenotype(s ) observed .
Here , we present whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization and detailed phenotypic data of these 52 subjects .
This SMS-like cohort exhibited developmental delays , <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep disturbance <END> , self-abusive behaviors , motor dysfunction , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> of the same type and prevalence as that of SMS .
In this analysis , we identified at least 5 new loci that likely contribute to the SMS-like phenotype , including CNVs that were found in more than one subject .
Genes in these regions function in development , neurological integrity , and morphology , all of which are affected in SMS .
Given the phenotypic overlap between SMS and the SMS-like cases , these data may provide some insight into the function of RAI1 , including the pathways in which it may be involved and the genes it may regulate .
These data will improve diagnosis , understanding , and potentially treatment of these complex behavior and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndromes .
Genetic heterogeneity in <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple epiphyseal dysplasia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia <END> ( MED ) comprises a group of hereditary chondrodysplasias in which there are major anatomic abnormalities of the long tubular bones .
The Fairbank and Ribbing types are the most frequently cited types of MED .
They are primarily defined radiographically and are <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> conditions .
Recently , MED in one family was shown to map to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 19 and is probably allelic to pseudoachondroplasia .
We have tested linkage with six short tandem repeat markers from chromosome 19 to <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> MED in one four-generation family and to MED in a unique family with three of seven siblings affected and with unaffected parents .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> MED in family 1 was linked with a maximum LOD score , at D19S212 , of 3.22 at a recombination fraction ( theta ) of .00 .
Linkage to chromosome 19 was excluded with MED in the other family , under both <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> , with either reduced-penetrance or germ line-mosaicism models .
Linkage to candidate genes COL9A1 , COL9A2 , and COL11A2 was tested and excluded for both genetic models in this family .
COL11A1 was excluded under a recessive model .
We have confirmed linkage of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Fairbank MED to chromosome 19 and have demonstrated that MED is genetically heterogeneous .
A chromosome 4p haplotype segregating with Parkinson 's disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> postural tremor <END> .
We investigated a large family with levodopa-responsive , Lewy body <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> in which the disease segregates as an apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
After performing a genome screen , we identified a chromosome 4p haplotype that segregates with the disease .
However , this haplotype also occurs in individuals in the pedigree who do not have clinical Lewy body <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> but rather suffer from <START:PHENOTYPE> postural tremor <END> , consistent with essential tremor .
These data demonstrate a new locus for Lewy body <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and suggest that in some circumstances <START:PHENOTYPE> postural tremor <END> can be an alternative phenotype of the samepathogenic mutation as Lewy body <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
Friedreich 's ataxia : a clinical and genetic study of 90 families with an analysis of early diagnostic criteria and intrafamilial clustering of clinical features .
The clinical features of 115 patients from 90 families with Friedreich 's ataxia are described .
Onset of symptoms was before the age of 25 ( mean 10.52 ) years in all the index cases .
An analysis of early cases suggested that limb and truncal ataxia and absent tendon reflexes in the legs were the only consistent diagnostic criteria within five years of presentation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dysarthria <END> , signs of pyramidal tract dysfunction in the legs and loss of joint position and vibration sense are not necessarily present during the first five years of symptoms , but appear to develop eventually in all cases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Scoliosis <END> and ECG evidence of cardiomyopathy were found in over two-thirds of the patients studied ; <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , distal amyotrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> and deafness were all less frequent .
The disorder was gradually progressive in all cases .
The mean age of losing the ability to walk was 25 years ; 95 per cent were chair-bound by the age of 44 years .
About 10 per cent of the patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> which was controlled by oral hypoglycaemic drugs in one quarter .
Diabetes appeared to be associated with a higher incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and deafness .
Diabetes also clustered within sibships ; the risk of an individual with Friedreich 's ataxia developing diabetes if an affected sib has it is over 40 per cent .
Similarly , cardiomyopathy ran true within affected members of the same sibship , but there were instances of discordance which suggest that the development of the non-neurological features of Friedreich 's ataxia may be controlled by modifying genes rather than heterogeneity of the main gene .
Segregation analysis and an increased consanguinity rate amongst parents of patients ( 5 .55 per cent ) confirmed that this disorder is of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
A study of 101 first degree relatives of the patients with Friedreich 's ataxia failed to demonstrate any neurological or electrocardiographic abnormalities which could be ascribed to the heterozygous state .
Genetic refinement of dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( OPA1 ) locus to within a 2 cM interval of chromosome 3q . <START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( OPA , MIM 165500 ) is an eye disease characterised by variable <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and reduction in visual acuity .
It has an <START:PHENOTYPE> insidious onset <END> in the first decade of life and is clinically highly heterogeneous .
It is associated with a <START:PHENOTYPE> centrocecal scotoma <END> of varying size and density and an acquired <START:PHENOTYPE> blue-yellow dyschromatopsia <END> .
Recent studies of three large Danish pedigrees have mapped a gene for dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( OPA1 ) to a 10 cM region on chromosome 3q , between markers D3S1314 and D3S1265 ( 3q28-qter ) .
Genetic linkage analysis in five British pedigrees confirms mapping to chromosome 3q28-qter .
Haplotype analysis of a seven generation pedigree positions the disease causing gene between loci D3S3590 and D3S1305 , corresponding to a genetic distance of 2 cM . This represents a significant linkage refinement and should facilitate positional cloning of the disease gene .
Inherited forms of renal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> : an update .
The kidney plays an important role in ion homeostasis in the human body .
Several hereditary disorders characterized by perturbations in renal magnesium reabsorption leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> have been described over the past 50 years , with the most important of these being Gitelman syndrome , familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis , familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> with secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> , autosomal dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> with hypocalciuria , and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> .
Only recently , following positional cloning strategies in affected families , have mutations in renal ion channels and transporters been identified in these diseases .
In this short review , I give an update on these hypomagnesemic disorders .
Elucidation of the genetic etiology and , for most of these disorders , also the underlying pathophysiology of the disease , has greatly increased our understanding of the normal physiology of renal magnesium handling .
This is yet another example of the importance of studying rare disorders in order to unravel physiological and pathophysiological processes in the human body .
Ligneous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> in plasminogen-deficient mice .
Ligneous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> is a rare form of chronic pseudomembranous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> that is associated with systemic membranous pathological changes .
A probable link between plasminogen and ligneous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> has been indicated by the recent diagnoses of plasminogen deficiency in five patients suffering from ligneous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> .
The current study reports that plasminogen-deficient mice develop conjunctival lesions indistinguishable from human ligneous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> in both appearance and histology .
Both human and mouse lesions contain acellular material rich in fibrin , and aberrant or disrupted epithelium .
The incidence of lesion development in mice increases with age and is strongly influenced by genetic background .
Interestingly , ligneous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> was not observed in plasminogen-deficient mice simultaneously lacking fibrinogen .
This study provides direct evidence that plasminogen deficiency is one cause of ligneous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> and suggests that plasminogen-deficient mice may be an excellent model for the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this debilitating disease .
An X-linked channelopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomegaly <END> due to a CLIC2 mutation enhancing ryanodine receptor channel activity .
Chloride intracellular channel 2 ( CLIC2 ) protein is a member of the glutathione transferase class of proteins .
Its ' only known function is the regulation of ryanodine receptor ( RyR ) intracellular Ca( 2+ ) release channels .
These RyR proteins play a major role in the regulation of Ca( 2+ ) signaling in many cells .
Utilizing exome capture and deep sequencing of genes on the X-chromosome , we have identified a mutation in CLIC2 ( c.303C>G , p.H101Q ) which is associated with X-linked intellectual disability ( ID) , atrial fibrillation , <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> ( CHF) , some somatic features and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Functional studies of the H101Q variant indicated that it stimulated rather than inhibited the action of RyR channels , with channels remaining open for longer times and potentially amplifying Ca( 2+ ) signals dependent on RyR channel activity .
The overly active RyRs in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells and neuronal cells would result in abnormal cardiac function and trigger post-synaptic pathways and neurotransmitter release .
The presence of both <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomegaly <END> and CHF in the two affected males and atrial fibrillation in one are consistent with abnormal RyR2 channel function .
Since the dysfunction of RyR2 channels in the brain via 'leaky mutations ' can result in mild <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , our data also suggest a vital role for the CLIC2 protein in maintaining normal cognitive function via its interaction with RyRs in the brain .
Therefore , our patients appear to suffer from a new channelopathy comprised of ID , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and cardiac problems because of enhanced Ca( 2+ ) release through RyRs in neuronal cells and cardiac muscle cells .
Two additional cases of the Ohdo <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> syndrome .
Two additional cases of the Ohdo <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> syndrome are described and compared to the 5 patients previously reported .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , dental hypoplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> can be considered as common manifestations of the syndrome .
Male patients show <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> scrotal hypoplasia <END> .
Autosomal-dominant giant platelet syndromes : a hint of the same genetic defect as in Fechtner syndrome owing to a similar genetic linkage to chromosome 22q11 -13 .
Families with 3 different syndromes characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> low platelet count <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> giant platelets <END> were studied .
Fechtner syndrome is an autosomal-dominant variant of Alport syndrome manifested by <START:PHENOTYPE> nephritis <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> formation in addition to macrothrombocytopenia and polymorphonuclear inclusion bodies .
Sebastian platelet syndrome is an autosomal-dominant macrothrombocytopenia combined with neutrophil inclusions that differ from those found in May-Hegglin syndrome or Chediak-Higashi syndrome or the Dohle bodies described in patients with sepsis .
These inclusions are , however , similar to those described in Fechtner syndrome . Other features of Alport syndrome , though , including deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephritis <END> , are absent in Sebastian platelet syndrome .
Epstein syndrome is characterized by macrothrombocytopenia without neutrophil inclusions , in addition to the classical Alport manifestations-deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , and nephritis-and it is also inherited in an autosomal-dominant mode .
We mapped the disease-causing gene to the long arm of chromosome 22 in an Italian family with Fechtner syndrome , 2 German families with the Sebastian platelet syndrome , and an American family with the Epstein syndrome .
Four markers on chromosome 22q yielded an LOD score greater than 2.76 . A maximal 2-point LOD score of 3.41 was obtained with the marker D22S683 at a recombination fraction of 0.00 . Recombination analysis placed the disease-causing gene in a 3.37- Mb interval between the markers D22S284 and D22S693 .
The disease-causing gene interval in these 3 syndromes is similar to the interval described recently in an Israeli family with a slightly different Fechtner syndrome than the one described here .
Recombination analysis of these 3 syndromes refines the interval containing the disease-causing gene from 5.5 Mb to 3.37 Mb .
The clinical likeness and the similar interval containing the disease-causing gene suggest that the 3 different syndromes may arise from a similar genetic defect .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> : a new syndrome .
Eight children ( four boys and four girls ) with extreme failure to thrive , dysmorphic features , developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> , and abnormal skeletal survey were studied .
They were the products of seven consanguinous marriages , two of the patients being brothers .
In the remaining six families , a further four children had affected siblings who had died in infancy .
When assessed the children were aged 0.47-12 .8 years ; SD scores were less than -2 for height , weight , and head circumference in all patients .
The children had identical facies with deep set eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> with beaked nose , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , thin upper lip , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , and large floppy earlobes .
They were all developmentally retarded .
The following abnormalities were found on investigation : <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcaemia <END> in all ( of whom six of seven had hypoparathyroidism) , medullary stenosis and other skeletal survey defects in seven of the eight children , and reduced numbers of T cell subsets in four of four tested .
We believe that these children represent a new , as yet undescribed genetically determined syndrome .
Phenotypic variation in a large Swedish pedigree due to SNCA duplication and triplication .
The " Lister family complex , " an extensive Swedish family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Parkinson disease , was first described by Henry MjÃ¶nes in 1949 .
On the basis of clinical , molecular , and genealogic findings on a Swedish and an American family branch , we provide genetic evidence that explains the <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> in this extended pedigree .
Clinical methods included a detailed neurologic exam of the proband of the Swedish family branch , MRI , and ( [123]I )-beta-CIT SPECT imaging .
Genomic analysis included alpha-synuclein sequencing , SNCA real-time PCR dosage , chromosome 4q21 microsatellite analysis , and high-resolution microarray genotyping .
The geographic origin and ancestral genealogy of each pedigree were researched in the medical literature and Swedish Parish records .
The proband of the Swedish family branch presented with early <START:PHENOTYPE> dysautonomia <END> followed by progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> suggestive of multiple system atrophy.
Molecular analysis identified a genomic duplication of < 0.9 Mb encompassing alpha-synuclein and multimerin 1 ( SNCA-MMRN1 ) , flanked by long interspersed repeat sequences ( LINE L1 ) . Microsatellite variability within the genomic interval was identical to that previously described for a Swedish American family with an alpha-synuclein triplication .
Subsequent genealogic investigation suggested that both kindreds are ancestrally related to the Lister family complex .
Our findings extend clinical , genetic , and genealogical research on the Lister family complex .
The genetic basis for familial <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> is an SNCA-MMRN11 multiplication , but whereas SNCA-MMRN1 duplication in the Swedish proband ( Branch J ) leads to late-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autonomic dysfunction <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , SNCA-MMRN1 triplication in the Swedish American family ( Branch I ) leads to early-onset Parkinson disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Clinical features and genetic analysis of a new form of spinocerebellar ataxia .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxias ( ADCA ) are a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders .
The mutations for SCA1 , SCA2 , SCA3 , SCA6 , SCA7 , SCA8 , and SCA-12 are identified and caused by an expansion of a CAG or a CTG repeat sequence of these genes .
Six additional loci for SCA4 , SCA5 , SCA-10 , SCA-11 , SCA-13 , and SCA-14 are mapped .
The growing heterogeneity of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> forms of these diseases shows that the genetic etiologies of at least 20% of ADCA have yet to be elucidated .
The authors ascertained and clinically characterized a four-generation pedigree segregating an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> phenotype for SCA .
Direct mutation analysis , repeat expansion detection analysis , and linkage analysis for all known SCA loci were performed .
Direct mutational analysis excluded SCA1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 12 ; genetic linkage analysis excluded SCA4 , 5 ,10 , 11 , 13 , and 14 , giving significant negative lod scores .
Examination of the family showed that all affected members had gait ataxia and <START:PHENOTYPE> akinesia <END> with variable features of <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyporeflexia <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual impairment <END> .
Eye movements were normal .
Head MRI showed atrophy of the cerebellum without involvement of the brainstem .
In 10 parent-child pairs , median onset occurred 10.5 years earlier in offspring than in their parents , suggesting anticipation .
This family is distinct from other families with SCA and is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal signs <END> .
Vestibular dysfunction in adult patients with osteogenesis imperfecta .
Progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> is a major symptom in osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI) , a genetic brittle bone disease . Vertigo is frequently associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> in which the <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> clinically resembles that in OI . Vertigo is also common in basilar impression ( BI ) found in up to 25% of adult OI patients .
In order to evaluate the cause , frequency , and characteristics of vertigo in OI , 42 patients were studied by interview , clinical examination , and audiological examination supplemented with electronystagmography ( ENG ) and lateral skull radiography.
Audiometry showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> in 25 patients ( 59 .5% ) .
Nine patients ( 21% ) displayed abnormal skull base anatomy in the forms of basilar impression , basilar invagination , or both , all designated here as BI . Twenty-two patients (52 .4% ) reported vertigo , mostly of floating or rotational sensation of short duration .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> tended to have more vertigo than patients with normal hearing .
Vertigo was not correlated with type of <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> or auditory brain-stem response ( ABR ) pathology .
ENG was abnormal in 14 patients ( 33.3% ) .
No dependency was found between vertigo and deviant ENG results .
Patients with BI tended to have more vertigo than patients with normal skull base but the difference was not statistically significant .
Neither ENG pathology , nor the presence or type of <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> showed correlation with BI .
In conclusion , vertigo is common in patients with OI .
In most cases , it may be secondary to inner ear pathology , and in only some patients does BI explain it .
Since some OI patients without BI or <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> also suffer from vertigo , further clinical and neurological studies are needed to define the pathogenesis of vertigo in OI . Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss , Inc .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> arteriovenous fistulas <END> with dominant transmission in the absence of metabolic disorders .
A three-generation family with members affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> angiokeratoma corporis diffusum <END> ( ACD ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> arteriovenous fistulas <END> of the legs is described .
Our purpose was to investigate possible lysosomal storage defects previously described in association with ACD .
Results of physical examination of both affected and unaffected family members were otherwise normal as was the life span .
The inheritance pattern of both ACD and <START:PHENOTYPE> arteriovenous fistula <END> traits was <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> , with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance .
Microscopic examination of ACD lesions showed dilated capillaries without vacuolation of cells .
Ultrastructural studies failed to reveal lysosomal abnormalities .
Normal levels of alpha-galactosidase , beta-galactosidase , alpha-fucosidase , and alpha-sialidase were detected in peripheral blood leukocytes and skin fibroblasts .
The association of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> ACD and <START:PHENOTYPE> arteriovenous fistulas <END> might represent a novel syndrome .
However , pathogenesis of these lesions remains unknown .
Hereditary motor and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory neuropathy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> .
Hereditary motor and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory neuropathy <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ( OMIM 218000 ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disease of early onset characterized by a delay in developmental milestones , a severe sensory-motor polyneuropathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> , a variable degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophy <END> , hypotonia , and cognitive impairment .
Although this disorder has rarely been reported worldwide , it has a high prevalence in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region of the province of Quebec ( Canada ) predominantly because of a founder effect .
The gene defect responsible for this disorder recently has been identified , and it is a protein-truncating mutation in the SLC12A6 gene , which codes for a cotransporter protein known as KCC3 .
Herein , we provide the first extensive review of this disorder , covering epidemiological , clinical , and molecular genetic studies .
Localization of a mutant gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> in an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> Icelandic family .
Common congenital malformations such as cleft lip and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> are in most cases multifactorial in origin , involving both environmental and genetic components .
Molecular biology techniques have enabled the successful chromosomal localization of many mutant genes from disorders that exhibit simple Mendelian segregation , whether autosomally dominant ( e.g. , Huntington 's disease) , autosomal recessive ( e.g. , cystic fibrosis ) , or <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> ( e.g. , Duchenne muscular dystrophy ) .
Studying the genetic aspect of multifactorial disorders is more complex .
It requires a model family or families within which the common multifactorial phenotype is displayed as a single gene defect .
Such a model has been recently exploited in the form of a large Icelandic family ( over 280 members ) exhibiting <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ( CP ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> ( A ) ( tongue-tied ) as a single gene mutation .
Using this family and the large bank of well-characterized DNA probes available for the human X chromosome , the gene for CP + A was localized by linkage analysis to Xq13-q21.1 ( LOD score = 3.07 , linked to anonymous probe DXYS1 ) .
Further fine mapping , using other X probes from this region ( confirmed by analysis of DNA from a deletion cell-line ) has placed the gene between markers DXYS12 and DXS17 ( LOD score = 4.1 ) at Xq21.3-q22 .
The approximate distance between these two probes is 5 centimorgans ( cM) , equivalent to approximately 5 million base pairs .
Now that the limits of genetic linkage have been fully tested and there are two markers flanking the defect locus , strategies are being pursued to clone the gene responsible .( ABSTR ACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Early diagnosis of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome : consensus statement .
European Community Concerted Action : <START:PHENOTYPE> Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma <END> .
The diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> medullary thyroid carcinoma <END> by biochemical and genetic testing is possible in families with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 .
At an early stage total thyroidectomy usually cures the patient .
As the clinical penetrance of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> , transmitted , multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 gene is not complete , family screening is indicated for every new patient who presents with apparently sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> medullary thyroid carcinoma <END> .
Problems related to a screening programme and early diagnosis have led the members of the European Community Concerted Action : <START:PHENOTYPE> Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma <END> group to formulate a consensus on biochemical and genetic screening .
For biochemical screening , measurement of basal and pentagastrin and/or calcium stimulated serum levels of calcitonin by radioimmunoassay are essential starting at the age of three and continuing annually until 35 years of age .
Furthermore , annual screening for <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> by measuring the urinary excretion of catecholamines and for <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> by serum calcium determination is indicated .
Genetic screening using linked markers can be done with a 95 % accuracy in informative families when DNA is available from at least two family members proven to be affected .
Biochemical screening can thus be reserved for gene carriers , while those at low risk can be reassured .
Combined biochemical and genetic screening for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is important and effective for the cure of <START:PHENOTYPE> medullary thyroid carcinoma <END> .
A murine model for type III <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> : lack of immunologically detectable 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase enzyme protein in a novel mouse strain with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertyrosinemia <END> .
We have characterized a new mutant strain of mouse that has <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertyrosinemia <END> .
The blood tyrosine level was persistently high , and increased amounts of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid and its derivatives were excreted into the urine .
Succinylacetone was not detected in urine samples from these mice .
All the animals were apparently healthy , and there was no evidence of hepatorenal dysfunction .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertyrosinemia <END> was transmitted through an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Analyses of hepatic enzymes related to tyrosine metabolism revealed that 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase activity was virtually absent , while fumarylacetoacetase and tyrosine aminotransferases ( cytosolic and mitochondrial forms ) were normal in these mutant mice .
Immunoblot analysis of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase protein in the liver indicated that the subunit protein of the enzyme was absent .
It would appear that <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertyrosinemia <END> in this mutant strain was caused by a genetic defect in 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase .
These features are similar to type III <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> in humans .
Analysis of this mutant strain of mouse is expected to provide valuable information on the pathogenesis of human type III <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> and can also serve as a useful system for studies on tyrosine metabolism .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Protein C deficiency <END> in two Austrian families .
Protein C antigen was determined by Laurell rocket immunoelectrophoresis in 225 patients with a history of venous thrombosis .
Among these patients two females with <START:PHENOTYPE> protein C deficiency <END> were detected .
Additional studies in the families of the protein C deficient patients revealed further 7 family members with <START:PHENOTYPE> protein C deficiency <END> .
In 8 not anticoagulated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> protein C deficiency <END> the protein C ranged from 36 to 62 % ( median : 45% ) .
In one patient on oral anticoagulant treatment protein C antigen concentration was less than 10% , F II and FX were 65 and 5 0% , respectively .
The pattern of inheritance was consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
5 of the 9 protein C deficient patients had severe thrombotic tendency characterized by recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> deep venous thrombosis <END> ( n = 4) , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary embolism <END> ( n = 1 ) , probable mesenteric vein thrombosis ( n = 1 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> superficial thrombophlebitis <END> ( n = 2 ) . All protein C deficient patients without thrombosis were less than 17 years old .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> : macrophage hypercatabolism of lipoproteins associated with apolipoprotein E mutation [apolipoprotein E (delta149 Leu) ] .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Splenomegaly <END> with sea-blue histiocytes is not associated with dyslipidemia , except in severe cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , Tangier disease , or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency .
We describe two kindreds in which the sea-blue histiocyte syndrome was associated with an apoE variant in the absence of severe dyslipidemia .
Both patients presented with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> .
After splenectomy both patients developed severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> .
Pathological evaluation of the spleen revealed the presence of sea-blue histiocytes .
A mutation of apoE was demonstrated , with a 3-bp deletion resulting in the loss of a leucine at position 149 in the receptor-binding region of the apoE molecule [apoE (delta149 Leu) ] .
Although both probands were unrelated , they were of French Canadian ancestry , suggesting the possibility of a founder effect .
In summary , we describe two unrelated probands with primary sea-blue histiocytosis who had normal or mildly elevated serum triglyceride concentrations that markedly increased after splenectomy .
In addition , we provide evidence linking the syndrome to an inherited dominant mutation in the apoE gene , a 3-bp deletion on the background of an apoE 3 allele that causes a derangement in lipid metabolism and leads to <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> in the absence of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> .
Linkage of type II and type III <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> to 19q13.1 : codominant inheritance of two cystinuric alleles at 19q13.1 produces an extreme stone-forming phenotype .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cystinuria <END> , a renal tubule disease affecting urinary cystine excretion with or without kidney stone formation , previously was mapped to chromosome region 2p.21 . Mutations in the gene SLC3A1 or NBAT , the reported candidate gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> at 2p.21 , have been demonstrated in individuals with the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> phenotype .
Recently , the Type III <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> phenotype was mapped to chromosome region 19q13.1 .
Here we report a kindred of 39 persons in two families of cystinurics , Types II and III , that support linkage to 19q13.1 and exclude 2p.21 .
Based on a dominant model of inheritance , two-point analysis of the entire pedigree produced a maximum lod score ( Z(max) ) of 3.82 at marker D19S425 .
Multipoint analysis yielded a lod score of 4.96 at this marker , and a resultant lod score of 5 .90 using a codominant model of inheritance .
Furthermore , a candidate gene interval of 8 .9 cM , flanked by markers D19S225 and D19S223 , was obtained using multipoint and haplotype analyses .
Thus , this kindred demonstrates the linkage of Type II <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> to 19q13.1 and confirms the linkage of Type III <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> at 19q13.1 while excluding the marker D19S225 that was previously included in the critical interval .

Genetically distinct subsets within ANCA-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> .
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( ANCA )-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> is a severe condition encompassing two major syndromes : granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( formerly known as Wegener 's granulomatosis ) and microscopic polyangiitis .
Its cause is unknown , and there is debate about whether it is a single disease entity and what role ANCA plays in its pathogenesis .
We investigated its genetic basis .
A genomewide association study was performed in a discovery cohort of 1233 U.K . patients with ANCA-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> and 5884 controls and was replicated in 1454 Northern European case patients and 1666 controls .
Quality control , population stratification , and statistical analyses were performed according to standard criteria .
We found both major-histocompatibility-complex ( MHC ) and non-MHC associations with ANCA-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> and also that granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis were genetically distinct .
The strongest genetic associations were with the antigenic specificity of ANCA , not with the clinical syndrome .
Anti-proteinase 3 ANCA was associated with HLA-DP and the genes encoding Î±(1 ) -antitrypsin ( SERPINA1 ) and proteinase 3 ( PRTN3 ) ( P=6.2Ã—10( -89) , P=5 .6Ã—10( -12 , ) and P=2.6Ã—10( -7) , respectively ) .
Anti-myeloperoxidase ANCA was associated with HLA-DQ ( P=2.1Ã—10( -8) ) .
This study confirms that the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> has a genetic component , shows genetic distinctions between granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis that are associated with ANCA specificity , and suggests that the response against the autoantigen proteinase 3 is a central pathogenic feature of proteinase 3 ANCA-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> .
These data provide preliminary support for the concept that proteinase 3 ANCA-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> and myeloperoxidase ANCA-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> are distinct autoimmune syndromes .

A novel <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> spinocerebellar ataxia ( SCA22 ) linked to chromosome 1p21-q23.
The <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxias ( ADCA ) are a clinically , pathologically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders .
Ten responsible genes have been identified for spinocerebellar ataxia types SCA1 , SCA2 , SCA3 , SCA6 , SCA7 , SCA8 , SCA10 , SCA12 and SCA17 , and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy ( DRPLA ) .
The mutation is caused by an expansion of a CAG , CTG or ATTCT repeat sequence of these genes .
Six additional loci , SCA4 , SCA5 , SCA11 , SCA13 , SCA14 and SCA16 have also been mapped .
The growing heterogeneity of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> forms of these diseases shows that the genetic aetiologies of at least 20% of ADCA have yet to be elucidated .
We ascertained and clinically characterized a four-generation Chinese pedigree segregating an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> phenotype for cerebellar ataxia .
Direct mutation analysis , linkage analysis for all known SCA loci and a genome-wide linkage study were performed .
Direct mutation analysis excluded SCA1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 17 and DRPLA , and genetic linkage analysis excluded SCA4 , 5 , 11 , 13 , 14 and 16 .
The genome-wide linkage study suggested linkage to a locus on chromosome 1p21-q23 , with the highest two-point LOD score at D1S1167 ( Zmax = 3.46 at theta = 0.00 ) .
Multipoint analysis and haplotype reconstruction traced this novel SCA locus ( SCA22 ) to a 43.7- cM interval flanked by D1S206 and D1S2878 ( Zmax = 3.78 under four liability classes , and 2.67 using affected-only method ) .
The age at onset ranged from 10 to 46 years .
All affected members had <START:PHENOTYPE> gait ataxia <END> with variable features of <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyporeflexia <END> .
Head MRI showed homogeneous atrophy of the cerebellum without involvement of the brainstem .
In six parent-child pairs , median onset occurred 10 years earlier in offspring than in their parents , suggesting anticipation .
This family is distinct from other families with SCA and is characterized by a <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> , pure cerebellar ataxia .
Char syndrome ( unusual mouth , <START:PHENOTYPE> patent ductus arteriosus <END> , phalangeal anomalies ) .
A mother and son are described with unusual facies , <START:PHENOTYPE> patent ductus arteriosus <END> , fusion of distal interphalangeal joints and mild learning difficulties .
The facial features include <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> triangular mouth <END> .
This <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome has been reported in one other family by F . Char ( 1978 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Severe mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , anal anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> distal phalangeal hypoplasia <END> in siblings .
We report two sisters born to consanguineous parents with an identical syndrome consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic terminal phalanges <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> anteriorly displaced anus <END> .
Further metabolic and genetic testing failed to detect the etiology .
A whole genome linkage scan showed homozygosity for a 28-Mb region on chromosome 1p , and a 65 - Mb region spanning most of chromosome 14 . These results are consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition that is similar to , but likely distinct from , Coffin-Siris syndrome .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> type I : lack of correlation between clinical findings and amount of immunoreactive fumarylacetoacetase protein .
Immunoblot analyses with bovine fumarylacetoacetase antibodies have been performed in fibroblast extracts from 28 patients with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> of various clinical phenotypes , in one healthy individual homozygous for a " pseudodeficiency " gene for fumarylacetoacetase , and in three <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> families in which one or both parents are compound heterozygotes for the <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> and pseudodeficiency genes .
Liver extracts from two chronic patients were also investigated .
None of the patients with the acute type of <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> had detectable immunoreactive protein in fibroblast extracts .
Only two of seven patients with typical chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> had definite immunoreactivity in fibroblasts .
In liver tissue , one of the patients had cross-reactive material and the other had no immunoreactivity .
Four of 13 patients with intermediate clinical findings showed immunoreactivity in fibroblasts .
There was no relationship between severity of symptoms and amount of cross-reactive material in this group .
The pseudodeficiency gene product gave almost no detectable immunoreactivity in fibroblasts .
The results indicate that chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> may be due to at least two protein variants , and immunoblotting does not classify <START:PHENOTYPE> tyrosinemia <END> patients according to clinical findings .
Clark-Baraitser syndrome : report of a new case and review of the literature .
We describe the case of a boy with moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> tall stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and typical facial features , characterized by a large 'square ' forehead , prominent supraorbital ridges , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal tip <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent lower lip <END> and minor dental anomalies .
We think that our proband is affected by Clark-Baraitser syndrome , a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> disorder , to date described only in five male subjects .
We present a more complete definition of the clinical phenotype of the syndrome with particular attention to the behavioural aspect that , in combination with the body size and the dysmorphic picture , we think is distinctive for the Clark-Baraitser syndrome .
We also summarize the mild features described in female relatives of the patients , as it could disclose a possible carrier condition and be of help with genetic counselling in the families with male patients , until a molecular test is available .
Wagner <START:PHENOTYPE> vitreoretinal degeneration <END> .
Follow-up of the original pedigree .
Wagner disease belongs to a heterogeneous group of hereditary vitreoretinal degenerations .
The authors have observed complications of this disorder that have not been reported before and therefore re-examined Wagner 's original pedigree to further delineate the spectrum of the associated findings and its prognosis .
Sixty members of the family agreed to be examined .
All had complete clinical eye examinations , 40 had dark adaptation studies as well as single-flash and Ganzfeld rod and cone electroretinography.
Fluorescein angiograms were performed in selected patients .
Twenty-eight family members were affected .
The most consistent finding was an empty vitreous cavity with avascular strands or veils .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Chorioretinal atrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> increased with the patients ' age and had occurred in all patients older than 45 years of age .
Four patients had a history of a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in one eye at a median age of 20 years .
The authors observed peripheral tractional retinal detachments in 55 % of eyes among patients older than 45 years .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Glaucoma <END> was present in ten eyes ( 18% ) , four of which showed neovascular <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Of all patients , 63 % showed elevated rod and cone thresholds on dark adaptation , and 87 % showed subnormal b-wave amplitudes of the rod- and of the cone system on the electroretinography.
Clinical expressivity of Wagner disease varies from unaffected carriers to bilateral blindness .
Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is observed infrequently , whereas <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral traction retinal detachment <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal atrophy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> are present in most of the elderly affected individuals .
Progression of the chorioretinal pathology is paralleled by electrophysiologic abnormalities .
Clinical features of five pedigrees genetically linked to the juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> locus on chromosome 1q21-q31 .
Primary juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is a rare form of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> that typically affects individuals between 3 and 20 years of ages and is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
One gene responsible for this condition has been localized to the 1q21-q31 region of chromosome 1 . To investigate the clinical features of this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , the authors have examined the affected members of five pedigrees demonstrating genetic linkage to the 1q21-q31 locus .
Clinical characterization of 23 affected patients was performed .
Genetic linkage to the 1q21-q31 locus was confirmed by segregation of the disease trait in each pedigree with genetic markers located in the 1q21-q31 region .
The clinical features of affected members of the five pedigrees presented are generally homogeneous .
The average age of diagnosis was 18 .5 years ( range , 5-30 years ) , and the average initial intraocular pressure was 38.5 mmHg ( range , 30-53 mmHg ) .
Eighty-seven percent of affected individuals were myopic and 83 % of affected individuals required surgical treatment for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
There were no uniformly associated systemic or ocular conditions .
One possible nonpenetrant carrier was identified and a difference in phenotypic expression of the presumed disease gene was observed in a pair of affected monozygotic twins .
We also identified two pedigrees with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and three pedigrees affected by the pigment dispersion syndrome that are not genetically linked to the 1q21-q31 region .
The form of juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> caused by a gene located in the q21-q31 region of chromosome 1 is generally phenotypically homogeneous .
The severe elevation of intraocular pressure typically seen in affected patients suggests the product of the predisposing gene may participate in the outflow function of the eye .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> .
An oculocutaneous macromelanosomal disorder .
Three unrelated kindreds with the Nettleship-Falls type of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> were studied .
Postmortem examination of the eyes of an affected man revealed the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> macromelanosomes <END> in the pigment epithelia .
Skin biopsy specimens of this patient , seven other affected male , and nine carrier female kindred members revealed the presence of Fontana-positive and dopa oxidase-positive <START:PHENOTYPE> macromelanosomes <END> within the epidermis and dermis .
Although clinically this disorder has been considered to be a form of albinism confined to the eyes , these findings indicate that an unusual disturbance in melanosome production characterized by macromelanosome formation affects the skin and the eyes .
Histopathologic study of the skin is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> , both in the affected and the carrier states .
Linkage studies confirmed the close association of the Xg blood group with this disorder .
Lipocalin 2 promotes <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> progression .
Here , we report that lipocalin 2 ( Lcn2 ) promotes <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> progression , and we identify the mechanisms underlying this function .
We first found that Lcn2 levels were consistently associated with invasive <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in human tissue and urine samples .
To investigate the function of Lcn2 in <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> progression , Lcn2 was overexpressed in human <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> cells and was found to up-regulate mesenchymal markers , including vimentin and fibronectin , down-regulate the epithelial marker E-cadherin , and significantly increase cell motility and invasiveness .
These changes in marker expression and cell motility are hallmarks of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT) .
In contrast , Lcn2 silencing in aggressive <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> cells inhibited cell migration and the mesenchymal phenotype .
Furthermore , reduced expression of estrogen receptor ( ER ) alpha and increased expression of the key EMT transcription factor Slug were observed with Lcn2 expression .
Overexpression of ERalpha in Lcn2-expressing cells reversed the EMT and reduced Slug expression , suggesting that ERalpha negatively regulates Lcn2-induced EMT. Finally , orthotopic studies demonstrated that Lcn2-expressing breast tumors displayed a poorly differentiated phenotype and showed increased local tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis .
Taken together , these in vitro , in vivo , and human studies demonstrate that Lcn2 promotes <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> progression by inducing EMT through the ERalpha/Slug axis and may be a useful biomarker of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dystonia <END> in the Woodhouse Sakati syndrome : A new family and literature review .
Woodhouse Sakati syndrome is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> neuroendocrine disorder characterized by the combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , hypogonadism , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , sensory neural <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and extrapyramidal features .
Movement disorders mainly consist of <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> and chorea of the limbs with onset in adolescence .
Facial muscles are usually spared , but <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> is common .
Pyramidal features and peripheral abnormalities are inconsistent features .
Most of the reported families are from the Middle Eastern countries although rarely Caucasian cases have been described .
Here we present clinical details of two affected siblings from a new Middle East family and draw attention of movement disorder specialists to this entity .
We summarize findings from pervious cases with particular focus on neurological and movement disorder features .

Adenosine kinase deficiency disrupts the methionine cycle and causes <START:PHENOTYPE> hypermethioninemia <END> , encephalopathy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal liver function <END> .
Four inborn errors of metabolism ( IEMs ) are known to cause <START:PHENOTYPE> hypermethioninemia <END> by directly interfering with the methionine cycle .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypermethioninemia <END> is occasionally discovered incidentally , but it is often disregarded as an unspecific finding , particularly if liver disease is involved .
In many individuals the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypermethioninemia <END> resolves without further deterioration , but it can also represent an early sign of a severe , progressive neurodevelopmental disorder .
Further investigation of unclear <START:PHENOTYPE> hypermethioninemia <END> is therefore important .
We studied two siblings affected by severe <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> liver dysfunction <END> .
Biochemical analysis revealed increased plasma levels of methionine , S-adenosylmethionine ( AdoMet) , and S-adenosylhomocysteine ( AdoHcy ) but normal or mildly elevated homocysteine ( Hcy ) levels , indicating a block in the methionine cycle .
We excluded S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase ( SAHH ) deficiency , which causes a similar biochemical phenotype , by using genetic and biochemical techniques and hypothesized that there was a functional block in the SAHH enzyme as a result of a recessive mutation in a different gene .
Using exome sequencing , we identified a homozygous c.902C> A ( p.Ala301Glu ) missense mutation in the adenosine kinase gene ( ADK) , the function of which fits perfectly with this hypothesis .
Increased urinary adenosine excretion confirmed ADK deficiency in the siblings .
Four additional individuals from two unrelated families with a similar presentation were identified and shown to have a homozygous c.653 A> C ( p.Asp218 Ala ) and c.38G>A ( p.Gly13Glu ) mutation , respectively , in the same gene .
All three missense mutations were deleterious , as shown by activity measurements on recombinant enzymes .
ADK deficiency is a previously undescribed , severe IEM shedding light on a functional link between the methionine cycle and adenosine metabolism .

Hyperphosphatasia-mental retardation syndrome due to PIGV mutations : expanded clinical spectrum .
Hyperphosphatasia-mental retardation syndrome is a recently delineated disorder associated with a recognizable facial phenotype and brachytelephalangy .
This <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition is caused by homozygous and compound heterozygous missense mutations of PIGV , encoding a member of the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway .
Here , we report on two further , unrelated patients with developmental delay , elevated serum levels of AP , distinctive facial features , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic terminal phalanges <END> , anal atresia in one and <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> in the other patient .
By sequencing PIGV we detected compound heterozygous mutations c.467G >A and c.1022C> A in Patient 1 and a homozygous mutation c.1022C> A in Patient 2 .
We reviewed the eight reported cases with proven PIGV mutations and re-defined the phenotypic spectrum associated with PIGV mutations : <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , the distinct facial gestalt , brachytelephalangy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphosphatasia <END> are constant features but also anorectal malformations and <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> as well as cleft lip/palate and hearing impairment should be considered as part of the clinical spectrum .
Moreover , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> are frequently associated with PIGV mutations .

Renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia : an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder with renal and hepatic failure .
We report two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysplasia <END> and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> .
One patient died shortly after birth of <START:PHENOTYPE> lung hypoplasia <END> .
The second developed end-stage <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> at 14 months .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> progressed to <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> and hepatic failure .
Pancreatic function was normal , but increased echogenicity was seen on ultrasound .
At age 3 years and 9 months a successful combined liver-kidney transplantation was performed .
The features of our patients are compatible with the " renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia " syndrome .
Conclusion : Renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder with variable expression .
Combined liver-kidney transplantation offers a new therapeutic option .
Probable Opitz <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> C syndrome with medulloblastoma .
We report on a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> , biparietal widening as a result of metopic synostosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> upslanted palpebral fissures <END> , apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> with abnormal helices , deeply furrowed palate , postaxial polysyndactyly of the feet , ankle flexion deformities , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> loose skin <END> , and severe mental retardation , findings compatible with a diagnosis of the Opitz <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> C syndrome ( OTS ) .
At the age of 12 years this patient presented with symptoms of raised intracranial pressure .
A biopsy showed findings diagnostic of a medulloblastoma WHO Grade IV , an unprecedented finding in OTS .
The possibility of coincidence should not prevent continued surveillance of OTS patients in the future for the occurrence of malignancy .
Muscle histopathology in <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> ( MERRF ) .
Histopathologic findings were examined in skeletal muscle biopsies from 6 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> ( MERRF ) who had an A to G base substitution at <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( mtDNA ) nucleotide pair 8344 .
In addition to variation in fiber size and <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> , all specimens in cross sections showed focal cytochrome c oxidase ( CCO ) deficiency , suggesting that this finding is crucial in elucidating the role of the mutant mtDNA in the pathogenesis of this disorder .
Along the length of single muscle fibers , defects in CCO activity were distributed segmentally with blurred borders in 5 patients which were in contrast with segmental defects with sharply delineated borders seen in chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia with deleted mtDNA .
These morphologically heterogeneous defects in CCO activity may in part be due to differing populations of and distributions of wild and mutants mtDNAs .
Novel locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> , on chromosome 8q . Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( HSP ) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by insidiously progressive spastic weakness in the legs .
Genetic loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> HSP exist on chromosomes 2p , 14q , and 15 q .
These loci are excluded in 45 % of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> HSP kindreds , indicating the presence of additional loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> HSP .
We analyzed a Caucasian kindred with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> HSP and identified tight linkage between the disorder and microsatellite markers on chromosome 8q ( maximum two-point LOD score 5.51 at recombination fraction 0 ) . Our results clearly establish the existence of a locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> HSP on chromosome 8q23-24.
Currently this locus spans 6.2 cM between D8S1804 and D8S1774 and includes several potential candidate genes .
Identifying this novel HSP locus on chromosome 8q23-24 will facilitate discovery of this HSP gene , improve genetic counseling for families with linkage to this locus , and extend our ability to correlate clinical features with different HSP loci .
A clinical and genetic study of <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> : the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> as a discrete disease entity .
A clinical and genetic study of <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> ( SMA ) of <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> is reported .
A genetic analysis of all cases of SMA occurring over a ten-year period in North-east England ( 48 index cases ) has shown that chronic proximal SMA of <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> is a distinct clinical and genetic entity , and is not a variant of the more common and relatively benign late juvenile cases .
Nine cases of SMA of <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> have been studied , occurring in 6 families .
The median age of clinical onset was 35 years and the mean age at initial medical presentation was 37 years .
The sex ratio was 5: 4 ( males:females ) .
The condition is relatively benign and there is no evidence to date that life expectancy is shortened ; there is usually no premonitory evidence of muscular weakness in early adult life .
The muscular involvement is relatively symmetrical and the distal musculature is well preserved ; clinical progression of the disease is interrupted by periods of apparent arrest .
No patient was able to walk completely unaided twenty years after the initial clinical onset ; the median age of patients in the study was 61 years but only one was confined to a wheelchair .
In the early stages the recessive form of familial motor neuron disease must be excluded .
A segregation analysis of sibs born after index cases was undertaken ( segregation ratio of 0.20) .
This finding is consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> with an extended period during which the disease might initially present .
The presence of new dominant mutations cannot be excluded , but is unlikely to account for more than 10 % of cases .
The carrier rate in the English population is estimated to be 1 in 300 , with a gene frequency q = 0.00165 .
Prevalence is 0.32 per 100,000 in the general population .
Empirical risks for genetic counselling are presented .
Interferon regulatory factor 6 ( IRF6 ) gene variants and the risk of isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> or palate .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cleft lip <END> or palate ( or the two in combination ) is a common birth defect that results from a mixture of genetic and environmental factors .
We searched for a specific genetic factor contributing to this complex trait by examining large numbers of affected patients and families and evaluating a specific candidate gene .
We identified the gene that encodes interferon regulatory factor 6 ( IRF6 ) as a candidate gene on the basis of its involvement in an autosomal dominant form of <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate , Van der Woude 's syndrome .
A single-nucleotide polymorphism in this gene results in either a valine or an isoleucine at amino acid position 274 ( V274I ) .
We carried out transmission-disequilibrium testing for V274I in 8003 individual subjects in 1968 families derived from 10 populations with ancestry in Asia , Europe , and South America , haplotype and linkage analyses , and case-control analyses , and determined the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> or palate that is associated with genetic variation in IRF6 .
Strong evidence of overtransmission of the valine ( V ) allele was found in the entire population data set ( P<10( -9) ) ; moreover , the results for some individual populations from South America and Asia were highly significant .
Variation at IRF6 was responsible for 12 percent of the genetic contribution to <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> or palate and tripled the risk of recurrence in families that had already had one affected child .
DNA-sequence variants associated with IRF6 are major contributors to <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> , with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
The contribution of variants in single genes to <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> or palate is an important consideration in genetic counseling .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> associated with hearing impairment and impaired glucose regulation caused by a missense mutation in the WFS1 gene .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( ADOA ) is genetically heterogeneous , with OPA1 on 3q28 being the most prevalently mutated gene .
Additional loci are OPA3 , OPA4 , and OPA5 , located at 19q13.2 , 18q12 .2 , and 22q12 .1-q13.1 , respectively .
Mutations in the WFS1 gene , at 4p16 .3 , are associated with either <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( OA ) as part of the autosomal recessive Wolfram syndrome or with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> progressive low frequency sensorineural hearing loss ( LFSNHL ) without any ophthalmological abnormalities .
Linkage and sequence mutation analyses of the ADOA candidate genes OPA1 , OPA3 , OPA4 , and OPA5 , including the genes WFS1 , GJB2 , and GJB6 associated with recessive inherited OA or dominant LFSNHL , were performed .
We identified one novel WFS1 missense mutation E864K , c.259 0G-->A in exon 8 that co-segregates with ADOA combined with hearing impairment and impaired glucose regulation .
This is the first example of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and hearing loss associated with a WFS1 mutation , supporting the notion that mutations in WFS1 as well as in OPA1 may lead to ADOA combined with impaired hearing .
Mutations of presenilin genes in <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> .
Two common disorders of the elderly are <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> and Alzheimer disease ( AD ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Heart failure <END> usually results from <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( DCM ) .
DCM of unknown cause in families has recently been shown to result from genetic disease , highlighting newly discovered disease mechanisms .
AD is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease of older Americans .
Familial AD is caused most commonly by presenilin 1 ( PSEN1 ) or presenilin 2 ( PSEN2 ) mutations , a discovery that has greatly advanced the field .
The presenilins are also expressed in the heart and are critical to cardiac development .
We hypothesized that mutations in presenilins may also be associated with DCM and that their discovery could provide new insight into the pathogenesis of DCM and <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> .
A total of 315 index patients with DCM were evaluated for sequence variation in PSEN1 and PSEN2 .
Families positive for mutations underwent additional clinical , genetic , and functional studies .
A novel PSEN1 missense mutation ( Asp333Gly ) was identified in one family , and a single PSEN2 missense mutation ( Ser130Leu ) was found in two other families .
Both mutations segregated with DCM and <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> .
The PSEN1 mutation was associated with complete penetrance and progressive disease that resulted in the necessity of cardiac transplantation or in death .
The PSEN2 mutation showed partial penetrance , milder disease , and a more favorable prognosis .
Calcium signaling was altered in cultured skin fibroblasts from PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutation carriers .
These data indicate that PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations are associated with DCM and <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> and implicate novel mechanisms of myocardial disease .
Newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> faciothoracoskeletal syndrome .
We report on 2 brothers , born to consanguineous parents presenting thin/long face , <START:PHENOTYPE> small ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malar hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long neck <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , brachycamptodactyly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sacral dimple <END> .
We suspect that these patients represent a previously undescribed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoparathyroidism <END> type Ib is associated with a heterozygous microdeletion that likely disrupts a putative imprinting control element of GNAS .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoparathyroidism <END> type Ib ( PHP-Ib ) have <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphosphatemia <END> due to renal parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) resistance , but lack physical features of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.
PHP-Ib is thus distinct from PHP-Ia , which is caused by mutations in the GNAS exons encoding the G protein alpha subunit .
However , an imprinted <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of PHP-Ib ( AD-PHP-Ib ) has been mapped to a region of chromosome 20q13.3 containing GNAS .
Furthermore , loss of methylation at a differentially methylated region ( DMR ) of this locus , exon A/B , has been observed thus far in all investigated <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> PHP-Ib cases and the affected members of multiple AD-PHP-Ib kindreds .
We now report that affected members and obligate gene carriers of 12 unrelated AD-PHP-Ib kindreds and four apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> PHP-Ib patients , but not healthy controls , have a heterozygous approximately 3-kb microdeletion located approximately 220 kb centromeric of GNAS exon A/ B .
The deleted region , which is flanked by two direct repeats , includes three exons of STX16 , the gene encoding syntaxin-16 , for which no evidence of imprinting could be found .
Affected individuals carrying the microdeletion show loss of exon A/ B methylation but no epigenetic abnormalities at other GNAS DMRs .
We therefore postulate that this microdeletion disrupts a putative cis-acting element required for methylation at exon A/B , and that this genetic defect underlies the renal PTH resistance in AD-PHP-Ib .
Familial idiopathic brain calcification with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
We report a family with brain calcification , predominantly in the basal ganglia , and no evident cause such as abnormal calcium or phosphorus metabolism .
The proband , a 48-year-old man , had intellectual decline , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , and mild cerebellar ataxia .
He had bilateral and symmetric <START:PHENOTYPE> calcification of the basal ganglia <END> , thalamus , dentate nucleus , cerebral cortex , subcortical white matter , and hippocampus on CT. Calcified areas showed low- or high-intensity signals on MRI T1 -weighted images , and low-intensity signals on MRI T2-weighted images .
Two sons and both parents , all asymptomatic , also showed <START:PHENOTYPE> calcification of the basal ganglia <END> , suggesting an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Familial idiopathic brain calcification is a rare disorder with less than 20 previously reported families .
Twelve families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> showed a relatively homogeneous clinical picture , which may represent a distinct clinical entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental deterioration <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , and cerebellar ataxia appear in adult life and progress gradually .
CT imaging , rather than MRI , is a simple and useful means to screen family members for this condition .
Gene mapping and serendipity .
The locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> torticollis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> keloids <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysplasia <END> ( 31430 , Mckusick ) is at Xq28 , distal to the G6PD locus .
The syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> torticollis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> keloids <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysplasia <END> was described by Goeminne ( 1968 ) in a large family , and listed as X-linked incomplete dominant by McKusick ( 1978 ; No . 31430 ) .
We mapped the locus on the long arm of the X chromosome at band q28 and distal to the G6PD locus .
This was achieved by the chance discovery in the literature that two females , each with a balanced X/autosome translocation involving Xq28 , had partial manifestation of the syndrome as was the case with the females in the larger family of Goeminne ( 1968 ) .
Genetics of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> : paternal inheritance and a locus on chromosome 6p .
The pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> is not fully understood , but population and twin studies suggest a large heritable component to the etiology .
Several large population studies have also suggested a parental sex effect .
Since 1994 , three main genetic loci ( on chromosomes 17q , 4q , and 6p ) have been reported in genome scans .
With a view to elucidating the genetic basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> , we have carried out linkage analysis in a large number of families with well-characterized <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
From a cohort of 1250 probands with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> , 395 individuals (301 affected , 94 unaffected ) in 103 families were recruited .
Each subject was carefully examined by an experienced dermatologist and stringent diagnostic criteria applied .
Genotypes were generated at 11 polymorphic loci on chromosomes 17q , 4q , and 6p and the results were analyzed parametrically and nonparametrically .
In the population from which the probands were drawn , there was evidence of a parental sex effect , more probands having an affected father than an affected mother .
Genetic anticipation was also apparent and most marked if the disease was inherited from the father .
The loci on chromosomes 17 and 4 were not replicated but there was strong evidence for linkage to chromosome 6p ( maximum two point LOD score 4.63 at D6S291 ) .
The evidence for linkage in sibling pair analysis was greatest when the allele was of paternal origin and was most significant in those families without psoriatic <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> .
These studies confirm the presence of a susceptibility gene on chromosome 6p .
The available evidence suggests that a different genetic susceptibility may underlie <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> and psoriatic <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> .
Germ-line mutations in nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> .
The group of susceptibility genes for <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> that included the proto-oncogene RET ( associated with multiple endocrine <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> type 2 [ MEN-2] ) and the tumor-suppressor gene VHL ( associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease ) now also encompasses the newly identified genes for succinate dehydrogenase subunit D ( SDHD ) and succinate dehydrogenase subunit B ( SDHB) , which predispose carriers to pheochromocytomas and glomus tumors .
We used molecular tools to classify a large cohort of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> with respect to the presence or absence of mutations of one of these four genes and to investigate the relevance of genetic analyses to clinical practice .
Peripheral blood from unrelated , consenting registry patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> was tested for mutations of RET, VHL , SDHD , and SDHB .
Clinical data at first presentation and follow-up were evaluated .
Among 271 patients who presented with nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> and without a family history of the disease , 66 ( 24 percent ) were found to have mutations ( mean age , 25 years ; 32 men and 34 women ) .
Of these 66 , 30 had mutations of VHL , 13 of RET, 11 of SDHD , and 12 of SDHB .
Younger age , multifocal tumors , and extraadrenal tumors were significantly associated with the presence of a mutation .
However , among the 66 patients who were positive for mutations , only 21 had multifocal <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> .
Twenty-three ( 35 percent ) presented after the age of 30 years , and 17 ( 8 percent ) after the age of 40 . Sixty-one (92 percent ) of the patients with mutations were identified solely by molecular testing of VHL , RET, SDHD , and SDHB ; these patients had no associated signs and symptoms at presentation . Almost one fourth of patients with apparently sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> may be carriers of mutations ; routine analysis for mutations of RET, VHL , SDHD , and SDHB is indicated to identify pheochromocytoma-associated syndromes that would otherwise be missed .
Benign familial microcytic <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytosis <END> is an extremely rare disorder , so far reported in only a handful of families .
In the majority of cases the characteristics were of essential thrombocythemia .
Most patients presented with a platelet count above 800,000/mm3 , were diagnosed as having a myeloproliferative disease , and some required chemotherapy .
We describe a benign form of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> in five healthy members of three generations of a family , all of whom had moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytosis <END> within the range 422,000-662 ,000/mm3 , characterized by low mean platelet volume .
A careful medical history and a 5-year follow up of the subjects did not reveal any untoward clinical development .
This variant of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytosis <END> is therefore of a benign nature .
Possible mechanisms linking <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytosis <END> with platelet microcytosis in this family are discussed .
X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , craniofacial dysmorphology , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> in a large South African kindred is localised to Xq24-q27. To date over 150 X linked mental retardation ( XLMR ) conditions have been documented .
We describe a five generation South African family with XLMR , comprising 16 affected males and 10 carrier females .
The clinical features common to the 16 males included profound mental retardation (100% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> mutism <END> despite apparently normal hearing (100% ) , grand mal <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ( 87.5% ) , and limited life expectancy ( 68 .8% ) .
Of the four affected males examined , all had mild craniofacial dysmorphology and three were noted to have bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> truncal ataxia <END> .
Three of 10 obligate female carriers had mild mental retardation .
Cerebellar and brain stem atrophy was shown by cranial imaging and postmortem examination .
Linkage analysis shows the gene to be located between markers DXS424 ( Xq24) and DXS548 ( Xq27.3) , with a maximum two point lod score of 3.1 0 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Breast cancer <END> after prophylactic bilateral mastectomy in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation .
Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation have a high risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and may choose to undergo prophylactic bilateral total mastectomy .
We investigated the efficacy of this procedure in such women .
We conducted a prospective study of 139 women with a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation who were enrolled in a breast-cancer surveillance program at the Rotterdam Family Cancer Clinic .
At the time of enrollment , none of the women had a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Seventy-six of these women eventually underwent prophylactic mastectomy , and the other 63 remained under regular surveillance .
The effect of mastectomy on the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> was analyzed by the Cox proportional-hazards method in which mastectomy was modeled as a time-dependent covariate .
No cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> were observed after prophylactic mastectomy after a mean ( + /-SE ) follow-up of 2 .9+ /-1.4 years , whereas eight breast cancers developed in women under regular surveillance after a mean follow-up of 3.0+/-1.5 years ( P= 0.003 ; hazard ratio , 0 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0 to 0.36 ) .
The actuarial mean five-year incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> among all women in the surveillance group was 17 + /-7 percent .
On the basis of an exponential model , the yearly incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in this group was 2.5 percent .
The observed number of breast cancers in the surveillance group was consistent with the expected number ( ratio of observed to expected cases , 1.2 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.4 to 3.7 ; P= 0.80 ) .
In women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation , prophylactic bilateral total mastectomy reduces the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> at three years of follow-up .
Long-term course of lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) deficiency due to homozygous LPL( Arita ) in a patient with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> , retained glucose tolerance , and atherosclerosis .
Lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) deficiency is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder caused by LPL gene mutation and is characterized by severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperchylomicronemia <END> .
Patients with LPL deficiency suffer from the frequent recurrence of acute <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> , but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood .
A 22-yr-old male Japanese patient with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperchylomicronemia <END> was admitted to our hospital in 1973 .
He had no consanguinity and no family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlipidemia <END> .
He was genetically diagnosed as LPL deficiency ( homozygous for LPL( Arita) ) with no LPL mass or activity in postheparin plasma .
He has experienced recurrent acute <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> 22 times during our 31-yr clinical follow-up , but no pancreatic pseudocyst , irregularity of the pancreatic duct , or abnormal pancreatic calcification was observed in computed tomography.
Moreover , his pancreatic endocrine function , as assessed by the oral glucose tolerance test , has preserved more than 30 yr .
Although he was a current smoker , no clinically significant atherosclerotic lesion had been observed .
From the long-term observation of this patient , we propose that LPL deficiency is not invariably associated with high mortality and that even with repeated episodes of acute <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> , pancreatic function may be slow to decline .
A novel form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> caused by a new SPG7 mutation .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( HSP ) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive spastic paraparesis of the lower limbs .
To identify the genotype and characterize the phenotype in a family with a novel form of complicated <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary spastic paraparesis ( ARHSP ) .
Six subjects of a Turkish family were examined by clinical evaluation , detailed neuropsychological testing , neurophysiologic studies , MRI , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , and mutation analysis of SPG7 gene .
Three individuals were affected by a juvenile-onset form of complicated ARHSP due to the missense mutation c.2075 G > C in exon 15 of the SPG7 gene in the homozygous state , substituting serine with threonine at codon 692 .
As additional clinical features , cerebellar syndrome , supranuclear palsy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> , particularly disturbance of attention and executive functions , were found .
MRI showed <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> and mild frontal cerebral atrophy.
DTI revealed bilateral disturbance of white matter integrity in corticospinal tracts , frontal lobes , and the midbrain .
The new SPG7 gene mutation leads to a novel complicated <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary spastic paraparesis phenotype that widens the spectrum of different brain systems that are optionally affected in hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( HSP ) .
In this novel phenotype , spastic paraparesis is related to cerebral damage of corticospinal tracts .
Impairment of attention and executive functions is due to white matter loss in frontal lobes .
Furthermore , supranuclear palsy is caused by white matter damage in the midbrain .
This multisystem affection , which was detected by the use of diffusion tensor imaging , may reflect a mitochondrial dysfunction that contributes to the underlying pathogenesis of SPG7- HSP .
Manifestations and treatment of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia : 14 new cases and a review of the literature .
Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia ( SIOD ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia .
The characteristic features of SIOD include 1 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperpigmented macules <END> and an unusual facies , 2 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> , 3 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphopenia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> , and 4 ) cerebral ischaemia .
Although 25 patients have been reported with this disorder , the clinical course and phenotype of SIOD are not well characterized .
This report summarizes the clinical findings , course and treatment of reported patients and includes 14 additional patients with SIOD .
We emphasize the high incidence of cerebral ischaemia and ocular abnormalities , define the high incidence of thyroid dysfunction and blood cytopenia , and confirm the absence of effective and durable medical therapies .
Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia is a multi-system <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder with variable expression that affects the skeletal , renal , immune , vascular , and haematopoietic systems .
Medical therapy is limited especially for more severely affected individuals .
Functional SNP of ARHGEF10 confers risk of atherothrombotic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
Although <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> is a common cause of death and a major cause of disability all over the world , genetic components of common forms of ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> are largely unknown .
To identify susceptibility genes of atherothrombotic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> , we performed a large case-control association study and a replication study in a total of 2775 cases with atherothrombotic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> and 2839 controls .
Through the analysis in 860 cases and 860 age - and sex-matched controls , we found that a single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) , rs2280887 , in the ARHGEF10 gene was significantly associated with atherothrombotic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> even after the adjustment of multiple testing by a permutation test [unadjusted P = 1.2 x 10( -6) , odds ratio = 1.80 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.42-2.28] .
This association was replicated in independent 1915 cases and 1979 controls .
Subsequent fine mapping found another three SNPs which showed similar association due to strong linkage disequilibrium to rs2280887 ( r(2 ) > 0.95 ) .
In the functional analyses of these four highly associated SNPs , using luciferase assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay we found that rs4376531 affected ARHGEF10 transcriptional activity due to the different Sp1-binding affinity .
In small GTPase activity assay , we found that a gene product of ARHGEF10 specifically activated RhoA .
A population-based cohort study revealed the subjects with rs4376531 CC or CG to increase the incidence of ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> ( P = 0.033 , hazard ratio = 1.79 , 95 % CI = 1.05-3.04 ) .
Our data suggest that the functional SNP of ARHGEF10 confers the susceptibility to atherothrombotic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
Kallmann 's syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> mirror movements <END> associated with bilateral corticospinal tract hypertrophy.
To investigate the etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> mirror movements <END> in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> Kallmann 's syndrome ( xKS ) through statistical analysis of pooled white matter data from structural MR images .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mirror movements <END> occur in 85 % of xKS patients .
Previous electrophysiologic studies have suggested an abnormal ipsilateral corticospinal tract projection in xKS patients exhibiting <START:PHENOTYPE> mirror movements <END> .
However , an alternative hypothesis has proposed a functional lack of transcallosal inhibitory fibers .
T1 -weighted brain scans were normalized into stereotaxic space with segregation of gray and white matter to allow comparison of pooled white matter data on a voxel-by-voxel basis using SPM-96 software .
Nine xKS patients were compared with two age-matched groups of nonmirroring individuals : nine patients with autosomal Kallmann 's syndrome ( aKS ) and nine age-matched normal ( healthy ) men .
Hypertrophy of the corpus callosum was found in both Kallmann 's syndrome groups : the anterior and midsection in xKS , and the genu and posterior section in aKS .
Bilateral hypertrophy of the corticospinal tract was found only in the group of xKS patients exhibiting <START:PHENOTYPE> mirror movements <END> .
SPM analysis was validated by an independent region of interest analysis of corpus callosum size .
Although morphometry on its own cannot determine the cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> mirror movements <END> , the specific finding of a hypertrophied corticospinal tract in xKS is consistent with electrophysiologic evidence suggesting that <START:PHENOTYPE> mirror movements <END> in xKS result from abnormal development of the ipsilateral corticospinal tract fibers .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spherocytosis <END> .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spherocytosis <END> is a common inherited disorder that is characterised by anaemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> jaundice <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> .
It is reported worldwide and is the most common inherited anaemia in individuals of northern European ancestry .
Clinical severity is variable with most patients having a well-compensated <START:PHENOTYPE> haemolytic anaemia <END> .
Some individuals are asymptomatic , whereas others have severe <START:PHENOTYPE> haemolytic anaemia <END> requiring erythrocyte transfusion .
The primary lesion in hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spherocytosis <END> is loss of membrane surface area , leading to reduced deformability due to defects in the membrane proteins ankyrin , band 3 , beta spectrin , alpha spectrin , or protein 4.2 .
Many isolated mutations have been identified in the genes encoding these membrane proteins ; common hereditary spherocytosis-associated mutations have not been identified .
Abnormal spherocytes are trapped and destroyed in the spleen and this is the main cause of haemolysis in this disorder .
Common complications are <START:PHENOTYPE> cholelithiasis <END> , haemolytic episodes , and aplastic crises .
Splenectomy is curative but should be undertaken only after careful assessment of the risks and benefits .
Incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> identified by the presence of serum endomysial antibodies in children with chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus <END> .
We determined the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> in the western New York area to be 1.29 per 10,000 live births .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Celiac disease <END> occurred in 29 children with gastrointestinal symptoms .
Two children ( 1.7% ) of 117 with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and 10 ( 4. 0% ) of 211 with diabetes mellitus had serum anti-endomysial antibodies .
We conclude that the incidence of childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> in our area is much less than that reported in Europe .
A major susceptibility gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> maps to chromosome 14q24.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> is a complex genetic disorder with a heterogeneous phenotype , largely attributed to the interactions among many genes and between these genes and the environment .
Numerous loci and candidate genes have been reported to show linkage and association to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and atopy .
Although some studies reporting these observations are compelling , no gene has been mapped that confers a sufficiently high risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> to meet the stringent criteria for genomewide significance .
Using 175 extended Icelandic families that included 596 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , we performed a genomewide scan with 976 microsatellite markers .
The families were identified by cross-matching a list of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> from the Department of Allergy/Pulmonary Medicine of the National University Hospital of Iceland with a genealogy database of the entire Icelandic nation .
We detected linkage of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> to chromosome 14q24 , with an allele-sharing LOD score of 2.66 . After we increased the marker density within the locus to an average of one microsatellite every 0.2 cM , the LOD score rose to 4.00 .
We designate this locus "asthma locus one " ( AS1 ) .
Taken together , these results provide evidence of a novel susceptibility gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> on chromosome 14q24.
Congenital bilateral perisylvian syndrome : study of 31 patients .
The CBPS Multicenter Collaborative Study . Advances in neuroimaging techniques have enabled the recognition of developmental malformations of the brain during life .
Careful correlation of clinical and imaging features has identified several new syndromes .
We have studied 31 patients with a congenital neurological syndrome characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudobulbar palsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive deficits <END> , and bilateral perisylvian abnormalities on imaging studies .
All patients had diplegia of the facial pharyngeal , and masticatory muscles , of variable severity .
Some patients had slight dysarthria , whereas others were unable to speak .
85 % of patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , ranging from mild to severe .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> was present in 27 ( 87% ) and commonly consisted of atypical absence , atonic/tonic , tonic-clonic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and , less frequently , partial attacks .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> were poorly controlled in 55 % .
Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral perisylvian cortical malformations consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> , confirmed at necropsy .
Division of the corpus callosum in several patients resulted in <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> improvement .
This congenital bilateral perisylvian syndrome can be clinically diagnosed and confirmed by imaging studies .
Further studies are necessary to elucidate its cause .
Absence of linkage to 8q24 in a European family with familial adult myoclonic epilepsy ( FAME ) .
Familial adult myoclonic epilepsy ( FAME ) is defined by <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> of the extremities , infrequent epileptic seizures , <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive course <END> , abnormality of polyspikes and waves on examination by EEG and photosensitivity , <START:PHENOTYPE> giant somatosensory evoked potentials <END> , enhancement of C reflex , and premyoclonus spike detected by means of the jerk-locked averaging EEG method .
These findings were also observed in patients with benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy ( BAFME ) and patients with familial cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> .
FAME and BAFME have been described only in Japan .
The genes responsible for FAME and BAFME were mapped in the same genetic interval in 8q22.3-q24.1 To study clinical and genetic characteristics of a European family with FAME .
A four-generation European kindred presenting with FAME , including 18 members , is described .
Clinical analysis was performed on 15 living subjects and electrophysiologic study on 5 patients .
Linkage analysis was performed with fluorescent microsatellites encompassing the FAME/BAFME locus ( 8q23.3-q24.1 ) .
Ten living and three deceased relatives had the clinical characteristics of FAME .
Mean age at onset of the 10 living patients was 41 years ( range , 30-6 0 years ) .
Eight of the 13 affected subjects had <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized tonic-clonic seizures <END> .
Electrophysiologic studies confirmed the diagnosis of FAME in the five patients studied .
The pattern of inheritance was consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
The locus responsible for FAME/BAFME was excluded .
Observation of a European family extends the occurrence of familial adult myoclonic epilepsy to non-Japanese patients .
Exclusion of linkage of this family to the locus for familial adult myoclonic epilepsy/benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy established the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder .
Early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> dementia with ataxia , extrapyramidal features , and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
To perform a clinical and molecular study of a large <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> family with a complex neurologic syndrome that comprises early-onset dementia , extrapyramidal and cerebellar features , and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Early-onset forms of dementia often are caused by genetic factors .
Mutations of three different genes-amyloid precursor protein ( APP) , presenilin 1 ( PS-1 ) , presenilin 2 ( PS-2 )-have been found in early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> forms of AD , of the human microtubule associated-protein tau gene ( MAPT) in frontotemporal dementia and <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> linked to chromosome 17 ( FTD P-17 ) , of the BRI gene in familial British dementia , of the PI12 gene in familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies .
Linkage to chromosome 3 has been found in familial nonspecific dementia ( FND ) and linkage to chromosome 20 has been found in Huntington disease ( HD )-like neurodegenerative disease .
Dementia may be a feature of other neurodegenerative diseases such as HD , dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy ( DRPLA) , diseases caused by mutations of the prion protein gene ( PRNP) , spinocerebellar ataxias ( SCA) , and familial <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
A southern Italian family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> dementia-plus was observed .
The family includes 57 individuals in 5 generations ( 14 affected , 7 personally observed ) .
The authors performed linkage analysis to APP , PS-1 , PS-2 , FTD P-17 , BRI , PI12 , FND , HD-like , SCA4 , SCA5 , SCA10 , SCA11 , SCA13 , PARK1 , PARK2 , PARK3 loci ; direct mutation analysis of HD , DRPLA , SCA1 , SCA2 , SCA3 , SCA6 , SCA7 , SCA8 , SCA12 , and PRNP genes ; and sequencing of the PRNP open reading frame .
Linkage to the examined loci was excluded .
All of the direct mutation analyses were negative excluding mutations in the examined genes .
This family has a peculiar phenotype and molecular analyses excluded genes known to cause hereditary dementias .
Familial periventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> : missense and distal truncating mutations of the FLN1 gene . To examine the clinical and MRI associations in bilateral periventricular nodular <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> ( BPNH ) ( MIM # 300049 ) in two families segregating a missense mutation and a C-terminal deletion of the filamin 1( FLN1 ) gene .
Classical familial BPNH , an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> disorder , has been associated with protein truncations or splicing mutations , which tend to cluster at the N-terminal of the FLN1 protein , causing severe predicted loss of the protein function .
The clinical syndrome includes symmetrical contiguous nodular <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> lining the lateral ventricles , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , mild retardation to normal cognitive level in affected females , and prenatal lethality in hemizygous boys .
Clinical examination , cognitive testing , MRI , mutation analysis ( direct sequencing , single-strand conformation polymorphism ) in seven patients from two families with BPNH .
In Family 1 , harboring an A > T change in exon 2 ( E82V) , heterotopic nodules were few , asymmetric , and noncontiguous .
Five boys born from affected females had died unexpectedly early in life .
In Family 2 , harboring an 8 base pair deletion in exon 47 ( 7627_7634del TGTG CCCC) , heterotopic nodules were thick and contiguous .
Affected females in both families showed normal to borderline IQ and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Missense mutations and distal truncations consistent with partial loss of FLN1 function cause familial BPNH with the classical clinical phenotype including <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mild mental retardation <END> , if any .
However , missense mutations have milder anatomic consequences in affected females and are possibly compatible with live birth but short survival of boys .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Tetra-amelia <END> and lung hypo/aplasia syndrome : new case report and review .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Tetra-amelia <END> is a rare malformation that may be associated with other anomalies and is usually inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> pattern .
We describe a fetus , born to a nonconsanguineous couple , with <START:PHENOTYPE> tetra-amelia <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate and bilateral lung agenesis , without other anomalies .
Karyotype was normal ( 46 , XX ) and premature centromere separation was excluded .
No mutation was identified upon molecular analysis of WNT3 , HS6ST1 , and HS6ST3 .
We reviewed the literature and the differential diagnosis to clarify the clinical delineation of conditions associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> tetra-amelia <END> .
The present report describes the sixth family with this pattern of malformations and reinforces the evidence that the " <START:PHENOTYPE> tetra-amelia <END> and lung hypo/aplasia syndrome " is a distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition , with no identified gene thus far .

Two sibs with an unusual pattern of skeletal malformations resembling osteogenesis imperfecta: a new type of skeletal dysplasia ?
We report a 6 year old boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple fractures <END> owing to bilateral , peculiar , wave-like defects of the tibial corticalis with alternative hyperostosis and thinning .
Furthermore , he had <START:PHENOTYPE> Wormian bones <END> of the skull , <START:PHENOTYPE> dentinogenesis imperfecta <END> , and a distinct facial phenotype with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> periorbital fullness <END> .
Collagen studies showed normal results .
His sister , aged 2 years , showed the same facial phenotype and dental abnormalities as well as <START:PHENOTYPE> Wormian bones <END> , but no radiographical abnormalities of the tubular bones so far .
The mother also had dentine abnormalities but no skeletal abnormalities on x ray .
This entity is probably the same as that described in a sporadic case by Suarez and Stickler in 1974 .
In spite of the considerable overlap with osteogenesis imperfecta ( <START:PHENOTYPE> bone fragility <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Wormian bones <END> , and dentinogenesis imperfecta) , we believe this disorder to be a different entity , in particular because of the unique cortical defects , missing osteopenia , and normal results of collagen studies .
Lateral <START:PHENOTYPE> meningocele <END> syndrome : three new patients and review of the literature .
One female and two male patients with multiple lateral meningoceles are presented .
They do not have neurofibromatosis or Marfan syndrome and share findings with the two previously described patients with multiple lateral meningoceles .
The original report by Lehman et al . [ 1977 : J Pediatr 90:49-54 ] was titled " familial osteosclerosis , " because osteosclerosis was present in the proposita and her mother ; the patient described by Philip et al . [ 1995 : Clin Dysmorphol 4:347-351 ] also had increased bone density of the skull base and the sutures .
Thickened calvaria were present in one of our patients ; two had a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent metopic suture <END> .
Other shared findings include multiple lateral meningoceles , <START:PHENOTYPE> Wormian bones <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malar hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanted palpebral fissures <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high narrow palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> in males .
In addition , our patients showed ligamentous laxity , keloid formation , hypotonia , and developmental delay .
A short umbilical cord was noted in two patients .
One had a hypoplastic posterior arch of the atlas and an enlarged sella , as reported by Lehman et al . [ 1977 ] .
Our patients appear to have the same syndrome as previously reported .
We suggest it be called " lateral <START:PHENOTYPE> meningocele <END> syndrome, " because of this unique finding .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> . <START:PHENOTYPE> Sclerocornea <END> is a primary anomaly in which scleralization of a peripheral part of the cornea , or the entire corneal tissue , occurs .
In the peripheral type of <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> , the affected area is vascularized with regular arcades of superficial scleral vessels .
In total <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> , the entire cornea is opaque and vascularized . To our knowledge , 97 cases of all types of <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> have been reported in the world literature , either as a primary anomaly or in association with cornea plana .
Peripheral <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> in association with cornea plana was found in nine members of one family , in four of five generations studied .
To our knowledge , this is the largest pedigree of hereditary peripheral <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> identified .
Our pedigree suggests the autosomal-dominant transmission of this entity but doesn 't rule out phenocopies or other modes of inheritance in other cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> sclerocornea <END> .
Chromosomal analyses of representative family members revealed normal karyotypes .
Hereditary palmoplantar keratosis of the Gamborg Nielsen type .
Clinical and ultrastructural characteristics of a new type of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> palmoplantar keratosis .
A new kind of diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> and without associated symptoms was described in Norrbotten , Sweden by Gamborg Nielsen in 1985 .
Clinically , it ranges between the less severe dominant Unna-Thost type and the more severe recessive Meleda type , as it is milder than the latter .
Skin biopsies of five patients from three different families with this new <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> , as well as five obligatory heterozygotes from one family , were investigated ultrastructurally in order to characterize this new entity and to differentiate it from the Meleda type .
Several features are common to both <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> palmoplantar keratoses .
They show a broadened granular layer , a transit region consisting of cells with a marginal envelope , and considerable hyperkeratosis .
Morphologically , this transformation delay is less pronounced in the Gamborg Nielsen type than in the classical Meleda type .
As is typical for ridged skin , both types of palmoplantar keratoses possess composite keratohyaline granules .
In contrast to the normal appearance of keratohyaline granules in the Meleda type , the Gamborg Nielsen type also shows qualitative deviations of keratohyaline granules with different degrees of spongiosity and electron density and sometimes with a granular border .
It seems that abnormal keratohyaline proteins are synthesized that behave differently .
The sudden transformation of a granular into a horny cell is physiologically regulated by different enzymes .
A delay in this process may be caused by a mutation that reduces or alters the enzymes concerned .
We assume the <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> of the Gamborg Nielsen type to be a variant of the heterogeneous group of the Meleda type of <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Evidence for genetic heterogeneity within eight <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> families , with the GLC1A Gln368STOP mutation being an important phenotypic modifier .
To investigate the phenotype and age-related penetrance of primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> ( POAG ) in Australian families with the most common Myocilin mutation ( Gln368 STOP ) .
Cross-sectional genetic study .
Eight pedigrees carrying the Gln368STOP mutation were ascertained from 1730 consecutive cases of POAG in the <START:PHENOTYPE> Glaucoma <END> Inheritance Study in Tasmania .
Index cases and available family members were examined for signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , and the presence of the GLC1A Gln368STOP mutation was ascertained by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and subsequent direct sequencing .
From the eight pedigrees , 29 Gln368STOP mutation-carrying individuals with either ocular hypertension ( OHT) or POAG were found , with a mean age at diagnosis of 52 .4 +/- 12 .9 years and a mean peak intraocular pressure ( IOP ) of 28.4 +/- 4.7 mmHg .
A further 11 mutation carriers older than 40 years have been studied , who as yet show no signs of OHT or POAG .
Within the 8 pedigrees , a further 31 individuals with OHT or POAG were identified who did not carry the Gln368STOP mutation .
For these individuals the mean age at diagnosis was higher ( 62 .3 +/- 13.7 years , P < 0.01 ) , and the mean peak IOP was lower ( 25.4 +/- 6.4 mmHg , P = 0.01 ) .
For Gln368STOP carriers , age-related penetrance for OHT or POAG was 72 % at age 40 years and 82 % at age 65 years .
A positive family history of POAG was present in all index cases .
Five of the eight pedigrees had a positive family history on both maternal and paternal sides .
Seven of the eight pedigrees had one or more individuals with POAG who did not carry the mutation .
Eight of the 29 Gln368STOP carriers with OHT or POAG had undergone trabeculectomy .
The GLC1A Gln368STOP mutation is associated with POAG , which in the pedigrees studied is of a younger age of onset and higher peak IOP than non-mutation <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> cases .
In addition , Gln368STOP mutation <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> cases were more likely to have undergone <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> drainage surgery .
We have not observed simple <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> patterns for POAG in these pedigrees .
Other factors , as yet uncharacterized , are involved in expression of the POAG phenotype in Gln368STOP pedigrees .
De novo mutations in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> ND3 gene as a cause of infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalopathy and complex I deficiency .
Both nuclear and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations can cause energy generation disorders .
Respiratory chain complex I deficiency is the most common energy generation disorder and a frequent cause of infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalopathies such as Leigh 's disease and lethal infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disease .
Most such cases have been assumed to be caused by nuclear gene defects , but recently an increasing number have been shown to be caused by mutations in the mitochondrially encoded complex I subunit genes ND4 , ND5 , and ND6 .
We report the first four cases of infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalopathies caused by mutations in the ND3 subunit gene .
Three unrelated children have the same novel heteroplasmic mutation ( T1 0158C) , only the second mutation reported in ND3 , and one has the previously identified T10191C mutation .
Both mutations cause disproportionately greater reductions in enzyme activity than in the amount of fully assembled complex I , suggesting the ND3 subunit plays an unknown but important role in electron transport , proton pumping , or ubiquinone binding .
Three cases appear to have a de novo mutation , with no mutation detected in maternal relatives .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> DNA disease may be considerably more prevalent in the pediatric population than currently predicted and should be considered in patients with infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalopathies and complex I deficiency .
Premature aging and <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> : Mulvihill-Smith syndrome ?
We report on a 30-year-old woman with premature aging , <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> , and other abnormalities .
She had many manifestations of the Mulvihill-Smith syndrome , a disorder that has been described in 4 sporadic individuals , ranging in age from 4 to 17 years .
The common manifestations include <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , microcephaly , a senile face with an underdeveloped lower half , diminished facial subcutaneous fat , <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple pigmented nevi <END> , sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , and a low IgG level .
Our patient also had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , brachydactyly , severe T cell dysfunction , and suffered from severe verruca vulgaris and a chronic , active Epstein-Barr virus infection .
The fact that her parents were first cousins suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> of her disorder .
Two alternative possibilities were considered : the disorder in the patient represents the Mulvihill-Smith syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> immune deficiency <END> as a sign of its advanced stage , or a hitherto undescribed syndrome .
Genetic mapping in the Xp11 .2 region of a new form of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> .
Human X-linked dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> ( HPDR I ) is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , hyperphosphaturia , abnormal vitamin D metabolism , and rickets/osteomalacia .
Two closely linked hypophosphatemic genes , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> ( Hyp ) and Gyro ( Gy) , are known on the mouse X chromosome .
The Hyp phenotype is the equivalent of the human X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , while the human equivalent of the Gyro mouse has not been unambiguously identified .
We observed an Italian four-generation pedigree with a new form of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> ( XLRH ) .
We demonstrated that HPDR I and XLRH are two different X-linked genes and that XLRH maps in the Xp11 .2 region at 0% recombination fraction from the DXS1039 locus .
We discuss this new finding in relation to the identification of the human equivalent of the Gyro mouse and to the recent mapping in Xp11 .22 of another <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> renal disorder named Dent disease .
Hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> : <START:PHENOTYPE> microangiopathic hemolytic anemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , and renal insufficiency occurring in consecutive generations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , and renal insufficiency occurred in a mother an daughter when each was in her third decade .
The mother had prominent neurological findings , <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , and expired from renal insufficiency .
Her daughter 's only major symptom was renal insufficiency .
The similarity of the mother 's illness to thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> and of the daughter 's to adult <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> suggests that these diseases are variants of a single clinical disorder , while their occurrence in direct descendents strengthens the postulate that in selected instances a genetic predisposition to these disorders may be important .
Unexplained aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> ( Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome ) due to mutations in the dyskeratosis congenita gene , DKC1 .
Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson ( HH ) syndrome is a multisystem disorder affecting boys characterized by aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> ( AA ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , cerebellar-hypoplasia and growth retardation .
Its pathogenesis is unknown .
X-linked dyskeratosis congenita ( DC ) is an inherited bone-marrow-failure syndrome characterized by skin pigmentation , <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dystrophy <END> and leucoplakia which usually develop towards the end of the first decade of life .
AA occurs in >90 % of cases of DC .
We speculated that mutations in the gene responsible for X-linked DC ( DKC1 ) may account for the HH syndrome , due to the phenotypic similarities between the disease in respect of AA and gender bias .
We therefore analysed the DKC1 gene in two HH families .
In one family a nucleotide change at position 361 ( A --> G ) in exon 5 was found in both affected brothers ; in the other family a nucleotide change at position 146 ( C --> T) in exon 3 was found in the affected boys .
The finding of these two novel missense DKC1 mutations demonstrates that HH is a severe variant of DC . They also show that mutations in DKC1 can give rise to a very wide clinical spectrum of manifestations .
Boys with unexplained AA or <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> should be tested for mutations in DKC1 even though they may lack diagnostic features of DC .
A loss of function mutation in the COL9A2 gene causes <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Stickler syndrome .
Stickler syndrome is characterized by ocular , auditory , skeletal , and orofacial abnormalities .
We describe a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Stickler syndrome .
The main clinical findings consisted of <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vitreoretinal degeneration <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> , hearing loss , and short stature .
Affected family members were found to have a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in COL9A2 , c.843_c.846 + 4del8 .
A family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Stickler syndrome was previously described and found to have a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in COL9A1 .
COL9A1 , COL9A2 , and COL9A3 code for collagen IX. All three collagen IX Î± chains , Î±1 , Î±2 , and Î±3 , are needed for formation of functional collagen IX molecule .
In dogs , two causative loci have been identified in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> oculoskeletal dysplasia .
This dysplasia resembles Stickler syndrome .
Recently , homozygous loss-of-function mutations in COL9A2 and COL9A3 were found to co-segregate with the loci .
Together the data from the present study and the previous studies suggest that loss-of-function mutations in any of the collagen IX genes can cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Stickler syndrome .

Terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 , del( 3pter-p25 ) : a recognizable syndrome .
The 3p- syndrome ( terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 with breakpoint at 3p25 ) was found in the G-banded karyotypes from an undergrown and developmentally retarded 13-month-old girl with a distinct pattern of congenital abnormalities .
Features present in the patient and characteristic of the 3p- syndrome included low birthweight , brachy-trigonocephaly , a high and narrow forehead with a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent metopic suture <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> upslanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> small mandible <END> .
She lacked <START:PHENOTYPE> postaxial polydactyly of fingers <END> and toes which is present in about half of the so far reported about one dozen 3p- cases , but she showed an anteriorly placed anus .
The deletion was overlooked at a first routine cytogenetic examination .
At a later clinical evaluation of the patient , the suspicion of the 3p- syndrome was raised and the aberration found at revision of the old karyotypes .
The importance of a good information flow between clinicians and cytogeneticists is stressed .
Clinical and neurophysiological development of Unverricht-Lundborg disease in four Swedish siblings .
Four siblings aged 12-18 years with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> epilepsy demonstrated a subclinical stage at the age of 9-11 years , with visual blackouts and polyspike electroencephalographic ( EEG ) activity on photic stimulation , an early myoclonic stage at the age of 12-15 years , with increasing segmental , stimulus-sensitive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , occasional nocturnal buildup myoclonic " cascade " seizures , slowing of EEG alpha-activity , episodic 4-6 Hz bilateral sharp waves and polyspikes with myoclonias on photic stimulation , and a disabling myoclonic stage at the age of 16-18 years , with periodic generalized myoclonias , nocturnal myoclonic " cascade " seizures , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , mental changes , intermittent wheelchair dependency , and continuous EEG slow waves with polyspikes and intense myoclonias on photic stimulation .
One of the siblings died at the age of 18 years with no apparent cause of death .
Treatment with antiepileptic drugs other than valproate may have contributed but none of the siblings were ever treated with phenytoin .
Extensive clinical and laboratory investigations revealed no abnormalities and excluded other known possible causes of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> epilepsy .
The diagnosis was consistent with Unverricht-Lundborg disease and rested on typical age of onset , clinical signs , EEG , and evoked response abnormalities .
Buildup myoclonic seizures are typical in advanced stages of Unverricht-Lundborg disease .
We have labeled these myoclonic " cascade " seizures .
A typical seizure was studied with video-EEG and cardiorespiratory monitoring .
Characteristics revealed were onset with continuous arrhythmic <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonic jerks <END> followed by intense rhythmic <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> with increasing muscle tone that successively reduced the amplitude of the jerks .
The EEG during the whole seizure showed intense polyspike activity .
Obstructive apnea was seen at the peak of the seizure .
There were no cardiac dysrhythmias .
Consciousness was normal or only slightly impaired .
Postictal drowsiness was not observed .
Myoclonic " cascade " seizures are easily confused with <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized tonic-clonic seizures <END> .
FG syndrome in a premature male .
A 30-week premature male infant is presented with dolichocephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> .
He is the fifth patient to be presented with FG syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
The patient 's syndromic manifestations became more obvious during an inpatient observation period of 3 months .
Albright hereditary osteodystrophy with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> , normocalcemia , and normal Gs protein activity : a family presenting with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoma <END> cutis .
The syndrome of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy ( AHO) , <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoparathyroidism <END> ( PHP ) and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism ( PPHP ) is clinically and genetically heterogeneous .
Classically , patients with PHP have the skeletal features of AHO , resistance to multiple hormones that work via cAMP such as parathyroid hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone , and deficient activity of Gs protein , the guanine nucleotide-binding protein that stimulates adenylate cyclase .
However , patients without hormone resistance but with AHO and Gs deficiency were described ( PPHP) , as well as patients with multiple hormone resistance but without AHO or Gs deficiency .
In a few patients with deficient Gs activity , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> rather than hypocalcemia was the initial presentation of the disorder .
We describe here a new variant of the syndrome , affecting 5 individuals in a 3 generation family with AHO , normal Gs activity and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> .
In the first 2 generations , mild features of AHO were present .
The 2 sibs in the third generation had severe manifestations of AHO , including mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> as well as <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> .
Diagnosis of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoma <END> cutis at birth of the proband led to the diagnosis of the family .
Elucidation of the molecular defect will shed light on the relationship between hormone resistance and AHO , as well as on the physiological mechanism of hormonal signal transduction .
Genealogy , natural history , and phenotype of AlstrÃ¶m syndrome in a large Acadian kindred and three additional families .
We describe a large Acadian kindred including 8 Alstrom Syndrome ( AS ) patients , with an age range of 4 to 26 at the time of clinical assessment .
The affected subjects come from 5 nuclear families within this kindred .
The phenotype includes early childhood retinopathy , progressive sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> truncal obesity <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> .
In addition , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> with normal cholesterol levels were observed in most affected individuals tested .
Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and growth retardation appear to be age-related manifestations that occur post-adolescence .
Younger affected children are not overtly hyperglycemic and are normal or above average height for age .
Although the AS patients in kindred 1 presumably carry the same mutation , many manifestations of the disease are variable .
For example , of the 8 children in the Acadian kindred , 4 have <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , 2 have had infantile cardiomyopathy , 2 are hypothyroid , 1 has had hepatic dysfunction and is hypertensive , and 4 have developed <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Seven subjects described in this kindred exhibit <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
One additional manifestation not described widely in the literature , <START:PHENOTYPE> advanced bone age <END> , was observed in all subjects tested .
The clinical data from this large Acadian kindred , together with information obtained from 4 additional AS patients in 3 unrelated kindreds , confirm and extend clinical observations previously described .
In addition , the Acadian kindred with multiple affected individuals , probably arising from a common founder , should allow for identification of the chromosomal localization of a gene causing AS .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> and impaired prohormone processing associated with mutations in the human prohormone convertase 1 gene . Human <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> has an inherited component , but in contrast to rodent <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , precise genetic defects have yet to be defined .
A mutation of carboxypeptidase E ( CPE) , an enzyme active in the processing and sorting of prohormones , causes <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in the fat/fat mouse .
We have previously described a women with extreme childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ( Fig .
1 ) , abnormal glucose homeostasis , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocortisolism <END> and elevated plasma proinsulin and pro-opiomelanocortin ( POMC ) concentrations but a very low insulin level , suggestive of a defective prohormone processing by the endopeptidase , prohormone convertase 1 ( PC1 ; ref . 4 ) .
We now report this proband to be a compound heterozygote for mutations in PC1 .
Gly-->Arg483 prevents processing of proPC1 and leads to its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) .
A-->C+4 of the intro-5 donor splice site causes skipping of exon 5 leading to loss of 26 residues , a frameshift and creation of a premature stop codon within the catalytic domain .
PC1 acts proximally to CPE in the pathway of post-translational processing of prohormones and neuropeptides .
In view of the similarity between the proband and the fat/fat mouse phenotype , we infer that molecular defects in prohormone conversion may represent a generic mechanism for <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , common to humans and rodents .
Cerebellar MR in Fukuyama <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> : <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> with cystic lesions .
To determine the MR appearance of cerebellar abnormalities in Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy.
We reviewed brain MR images of 25 patients with Fukuyama <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> and examined the autopsy specimens of a 23-month-old girl with the disease to determine the pathologic nature of the MR findings .
MR studies revealed two characteristic cerebellar abnormalities : (a ) disorganized cerebellar folia ( 16 cases ) that were recognized as unusual distortions of the cortex ; and (b ) clusters of intraparenchymal cysts ( 23 cases ) .
The two lesions were located close to each other , and milder lesions tended to affect only the superior semilunar lobule .
The autopsy specimen revealed small <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar cysts <END> , which consisted of dilated subarachnoid spaces buried beneath the malformed cortex .
The disorganized folia represent cerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> , and the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar cysts <END> is related to the <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> .
These two MR changes are often present in Fukuyama <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> and are distinct enough to suggest the radiologic diagnosis .
[Familial congenital hypotrichosis with " <START:PHENOTYPE> uncombable hair <END> , " <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal pigmentary dystrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile cataract <END> and brachymetacarpia : another entity of the ectodermal dysplasia group ] .
A new ectodermal dysplasia syndrome is reported in a family of Caucasian ancestry .
The syndrome consists of congenital hypotrichosis with " <START:PHENOTYPE> uncombable hair <END> " , <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal pigmentary dystrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> and brachymetacarpia , and is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
Novel intragenic deletion in OPHN1 in a family causing XLMR with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> and distinctive facial appearance .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) is notably a heterogeneous condition and often poses a diagnostic challenge .
The oligophrenin 1 gene ( OPHN1 ) is a protein with a Rho-GTPase-activating domain required in the regulation of the G-protein cycle .
Mutations in the OPHN1 cause XLMR with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> and distinctive facial appearance .
We report a large Saudi family of four boys and one girl affected with XLMR .
The boys had moderate MR , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> disorder , facial dysmorphism , and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia .
The girl had mild MR , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
A novel deletion of at least exons 7-15 was identified by polymerase chain reaction analysis and multiple ligation probe amplification of the OPHN1 gene .
The array comparative genomic hybridization further delineated approximately 68 kb deletion of the 7-15 exons and nearly half of intron 15 .
In addition , the X-inactivation confirmed random pattern in the girl .
Although the affected boys have remarkably similar phenotype , there was some variability in the severity of the <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> disorder and the <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
The report confirms the previous findings that carrier females may be symptomatic .

Idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> in the oromandibular region during sleep : a possible source of confusion in sleep <START:PHENOTYPE> bruxism <END> diagnosis .
As part of a larger study , polysomnographic and audiovisual data were recorded over 2 nights in 41 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of sleep <START:PHENOTYPE> bruxism <END> ( SB ) .
Electromyographic ( EMG ) events related to SB were scored according to standard criteria ( Lavigne et al . J Dent Res 1996 ;75 :546-552 ) .
Post hoc analysis revealed that rapid shock-like contractions with the characteristics of <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> in the jaw muscles were observed in four subjects .
EMG bursts characterized as <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> were significantly shorter in duration than bursts classified as SB . None of the subjects had any history of <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> while awake .
Myoclonic episodes were more frequent in sleep stages 1 and 2 than in REM .
Half of the episodes contained one or two contractions whereas the other half had three or more repetitive contractions .
SB and <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> coexisted in one subject .
To rule out sleep epilepsy , full electroencephalogram montage was done in three subjects and no epileptic spikes were noted .
Our results suggest that approximately 10 % of subjects clinically diagnosed as SB could present oromandibular <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> during sleep .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> acro-fronto-facio-nasal dysostosis associated with genitourinary anomalies .
We report a 6-month-old boy , born of consanguineous ( first-cousin ) parents ( F = 1/16 ) presenting microbrachycephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> wide forehead <END> , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nose <END> with a midline groove with a bilateral small " blind dimple " in each side , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> between fingers 3 and 4 , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad thumbs <END> , and halluces .
This association of anomalies suggests the diagnosis of a " new " type of acro-fronto-facio-nasal dysostosis .
Normal chromosomes , parental consanguinity , and familial occurrence suggest <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Three VSX1 gene mutations , L159M , R166W , and H244R , are not associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
Three mutations , L159M , R166W , and H244R , in the VSX1 gene have been recently reported to be associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> by direct sequencing in familial panels .
In an attempt to confirm this observation , we surveyed the same mutations of the VSX1 gene for a white sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> case-control panel and a larger familial panel to test its association with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
A case-control panel , with 77 <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> patients and 71 healthy controls , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> familial panel , with 444 individuals from 75 families , were surveyed .
DNA from each individual was tested for the previously reported mutations by ABI allelic discrimination technology ( L159 M and R166W ) and restriction fragment length polymorphism assay ( H244R ) .
We observed no mutations of R166W and H244R and 1 heterozygous mutation of L159M in a healthy individual in the case-control panel .
For the familial panel , we observed no polymorphism of R166 W ; 3 heterozygous for H244R , with 2 affected and 1 unaffected ; and 5 heterozygous for L159M , with 3 affected and 2 unaffected .
We cannot confirm the previously reported association of the polymorphism in the VSX1 gene with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
In our case-control sample panel and the larger familial sample panel , we did not observe the reported polymorphism of the VSX1 gene , and the distribution of these 3 polymorphisms was not significant enough to support a pathogenetic role in <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
Association of the presence of Helicobacter in gallbladder tissue with <START:PHENOTYPE> cholelithiasis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cholecystitis <END> .
The presence of Helicobacter DNA species has been investigated in the biliary epithelium of patients with biliary diseases .
However , conflicting results have been observed that may have been due to the small number of subjects studied , difficulty in obtaining a healthy control group , absence of controlling for confounding factors , or differences among populations .
Therefore , we investigated the presence of Helicobacter species by culture and nested PCR of 16S rRNA genes in gallbladder tissue and bile from 46 Brazilian subjects with and 18 without <START:PHENOTYPE> cholelithiasis <END> .
The control group was mainly composed of liver donors and of patients who had submitted to cholecystectomy as part of the surgical treatment for morbid obesity .
No Helicobacter species were grown from the bile or gallbladder tissues .
Helicobacter DNA was detected in the gallbladder tissue and bile from 31 .3 and 42 .9% of the patients , respectively .
In a logistic regression model , <START:PHENOTYPE> cholelithiasis <END> was positively and independently associated with the female gender ( P = 0.02) , increasing age ( P = 0.002) , and the presence of Helicobacter DNA in the gallbladder tissue ( P = 0.009 ) .
The presence of Helicobacter DNA in the bile was not associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cholelithiasis <END> ( P = 0.8 ) .
A significant association between the presence of Helicobacter DNA in the gallbladder epithelium and histological <START:PHENOTYPE> cholecystitis <END> , even after adjusting for gender and age ( P = 0.002) , was also observed .
The sequences of the 16S rRNA genes were >99 % similar to that of Helicobacter pylori .
In conclusion , our results support the hypothesis that Helicobacter is associated with the pathogenesis of human <START:PHENOTYPE> cholelithiasis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cholecystitis <END> .
Confirmation of a <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> susceptibility locus on chromosome 1p34-p36 in a set of 100 Canadian families .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dyslexia <END> is a common and genetically complex trait that manifests primarily as a <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> independent of general intelligence and educational opportunity .
Strong evidence for a <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> susceptibility locus on chromosome 1p34-p36 ( near marker D1S199 ) was recently reported , and an earlier study found suggestive evidence for linkage to the same region .
We tested for the presence of a <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> gene in this region in a sample of 100 Canadian families using both qualitative and quantitative definitions of the phenotype .
Using a qualitative definition of <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> ( affected , unaffected , or uncertain) , the largest multipoint Genehunter Maximum LOD-Score ( MLS ) in 100 core nuclear families was 3.65 at D1S507 , distal to D1S199 .
Quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) linkage analysis was performed for four measures of <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> ( phonological awareness , phonological coding , spelling , and rapid automatized naming speed ) employing the variance components approach implemented in Genehunter .
Using a model with QTL additive and dominance variance and polygenic additive variance , the multipoint LOD scores maximized proximal to D1S199 ( between D1S552 and D1S1622) , with peaks of 4.01 for spelling and 1.65 for phonological coding ( corresponding LOD scores under 1 degree of freedom were 3.30 and 1 .13 , respectively ) .
In conclusion , our study confirms and strengthens recent findings of a <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> susceptibility gene on chromosome 1p34-p36 ( now designated DYX8 ) .

<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> bulbospinal neuronopathy : a report of ten cases .
A form of <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> ' bulbospinal <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular atrophy <END> ' of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive inheritance <END> is described in 10 patients from eight families .
Muscle weakness in the limbs was mainly proximal and developed in the third to fifth decades of life , often preceded by <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle cramps <END> on exertion and <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> of the hands .
Weakness and <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculation <END> of the facial muscles and tongue were prominent .
All the patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> gynaecomastia <END> and some were infertile .
Two had diabetes mellitus .
Motor nerve conduction studies were normal but most patients had small or unrecordable sensory action potentials in the absence of clinical sensory loss .
Plasma creatine kinase levels were considerably elevated and muscle biopsies showed neurogenic atrophy together with secondary myopathic changes .
The importance of recognising this distinctive disorder in single cases (six of the present series ) is emphasised .
Genome-wide association study meta-analysis identifies seven new <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> risk loci .
To identify new genetic risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> , we conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of 5 ,539 autoantibody-positive individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( cases ) and 20,169 controls of European descent , followed by replication in an independent set of 6 ,76 8 <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> cases and 8 ,806 controls .
Of 34 SNPs selected for replication , 7 new <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> risk alleles were identified at genome-wide significance ( P < 5 x 10( -8) ) in an analysis of all 41 ,282 samples .
The associated SNPs are near genes of known immune function , including IL6ST, SPRED2 , RBPJ , CCR6 , IRF5 and PXK .
We also refined associations at two established <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> risk loci ( IL2RA and CCL21 ) and confirmed the association at AFF3 . These new associations bring the total number of confirmed <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> risk loci to 31 among individuals of European ancestry .
An additional 11 SNPs replicated at P < 0.05 , many of which are validated autoimmune risk alleles , suggesting that most represent genuine <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> risk alleles .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal dysplasia <END> : a distinct syndrome ?
We report on 2 unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> , and chorioretinal changes .
They are compared with previously reported patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with chorioretinal changes .
The question is raised whether all of these patients represent one entity or are separate syndromes .
Until more data are available we propose that our patients represent a single entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> with preserved para-arteriolar retinal pigment epithelium .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinitis pigmentosa <END> with preserved para-arteriolar retinal pigment epithelium is a rare form of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> that starts early in life with preservation of retinal pigment epithelium adjacent to and under the retinal arterioles and that has hitherto been described as an isolated form .
We examined 22 patients from one large family , together with two isolated patients , and confirmed the presumed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance in this type of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
New findings associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> with preserved para-arteriolar retinal pigment epithelium were asteroid hyalosis in four ( 17% ) of 24 patients , tortuosity of retinal arterioles in 11 ( 46% ) of 24 patients , peripheral regions of opacified vessels in eight ( 33% ) of 24 patients , and preservation not only of the para-arteriolar pigment epithelium , but also of the peripheral retinal pigment epithelium in 13 (54% ) of 24 patients .
Previously reported signs present in these patients were nystagmus in six ( 25% ) of 24 patients , hypermetropia in 23 ( 96% ) of 24 patients , optic nerve head drusen in nine ( 38% ) of 24 patients , vascular sheathing in 11 ( 46% ) of 24 patients , maculopathy in all 24 patients (100% ) , yellow round deposits in the posterior pole in nine ( 38% ) of 24 patients , exudates resembling those in Coats ' disease in two ( 8% ) of 24 patients , visual field defects in all 24 patients (100% ) , and nondeductible electroretinograms in 21 ( 91% ) of 23 patients .
Linkage analysis carried out in the large family resulted in the assignment of a gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> with preserved para-arteriolar retinal pigment epithelium to chromosome 1q31-q32 .1 .
Candidate gene regions and <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> in gluten sensitivity .
Gluten sensitivity is a common multifactorial disorder , manifested in the small intestine or on the skin as typical coeliac disease or <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> herpetiformis , respectively .
The only established genetic risk factor is HLA DQ2 .
We tested genetic linkage of previously reported chromosomal loci 5q and 11q in Finnish families with gluten sensitivity .
We also tested if genetic linkage to candidate loci on 5q , 11q , 2q33 , and HLA DQ differed with respect to clinical manifestations or sex .
We studied 102 Finnish families with affected sibpairs .
For <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> analysis , families were divided into subgroups according to sex and the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> herpetiformis , the skin manifestation of gluten sensitivity .
Non-parametric linkage between microsatellite markers and disease was tested .
Linkage <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> between subgroups was tested using the M test .
The transmission/disequilibrium test and association analysis were performed .
Evidence of linkage to 11q ( MLS 1.37) , but not to 5q , was found in the entire dataset of 102 families .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Heterogeneity <END> between subgroups was suggested : families with only the intestinal disease showed linkage mainly to 2q33 whereas families with <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> herpetiformis showed linkage to 11q and 5q , but not to 2q33 .
Linkage in all three non-HLA loci was strongest in families with predominantly male patients .
HLA DQ2 conferred much stronger susceptibility to females than males .
Independent evidence for the suggested genetic linkage between 11q and gluten sensitivity was obtained .
The possible linkage <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> suggests genetic differences between intestinal and skin manifestations , and the gender dependent effect of HLA DQ2 .
Clinical and genetic heterogeneity in <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> due to mutations in polymerase gamma .
The mendelian forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> ( PEO ) associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions <END> are clinically heterogeneous disorders transmitted as dominant or recessive traits .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> PEO is caused by mutations in at least 3 genes : adenine nucleotide translocator-1 ( ANT1 ) , encoding the muscle-specific adenine nucleotide translocator ; chromosome 10 open reading frame 2 ( C10orf2) , encoding Twinkle helicase ; and polymerase gamma ( POLG) , encoding the alpha subunit of polymerase gamma .
Mutations in POLG can also cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> PEO , which is often associated with multisystemic disorders .
To further investigate the frequency and genotype-phenotype correlations of mutations in the POLG gene , we used single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing to screen 30 patients with familial or sporadic PEO and <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions <END> in muscle but without mutations in ANT1 and C10orf2 .
Four unrelated patients had novel POLG mutations .
A woman with PEO and mental retardation had a heterozygous Gly1076Val mutation .
Two patients , one with PEO , <START:PHENOTYPE> exercise intolerance <END> , and gastrointestinal dysmotility and the other with PEO , neuropathy , deafness , and hypogonadism , both had a Pro587Leu change .
The fourth patient , who was compound heterozygous for Ala889Thr and Arg579Trp mutations , had PEO , gastrointestinal dysmotility , and neuropathy.
These mutations were not detected in 120 healthy control alleles .
Our results demonstrate that POLG mutations account for a substantial proportion of patients ( 13% ) with PEO and <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions <END> and cause both clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders .
Family studies in <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
I . Complex segregation analysis .
The genetic background of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> is unknown and its mode of inheritance is still controversial .
Family studies in <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> were based on complex segregation analysis and a special computer programme was prepared .
The results of the analysis in 244 families strongly suggest <START:PHENOTYPE> multifactorial inheritance <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> vulgaris .
Among the nine hypotheses of rank 1 and rank 2 , the lowest value of chi-square , 72 .847 , was for recessive inheritance , but for the multifactorial model it was extremely low ( chi-square = 35 .980 ) .
The estimated heritability was 82% .
It might be possible that at least two genetically distinct subpopulations of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> vulgaris exist : one with <START:PHENOTYPE> multifactorial inheritance <END> and a second with multigenic determination , if the disease were due to recessive genes and to one or more dominant factors .
The theoretical recurrence risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> for the multifactorial model was computed for families with normal parents and for families with one affected parent .
Dyskeratosis congenita: a genetic disorder of many faces .
Dyskeratosis congenita ( DC ) is an inherited syndrome exhibiting marked clinical and genetic heterogeneity .
It is characterized by multiple features including mucocutaneous abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> and an increased predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Three genetic subtypes are recognized : <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> DC bears mutations in DKC1 , the gene encoding dyskerin , a component of H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles ; <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> ( AD ) DC has heterozygous mutations in either TERC or TERT, the RNA and enzymatic components of telomerase , respectively , and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> DC in which the genes involved remain largely elusive .
Disease pathology is believed to be a consequence of chromosome instability because of telomerase deficiency due to mutations in DKC1 , TERC and TERT; in patients with DKC1 mutations , defects in ribosomal RNA modification , ribosome biogenesis , translation control or mRNA splicing may also contribute to disease pathogenesis .
The involvement of telomerase complex components in X-linked and AD forms and the presence of short telomeres in DC patients suggest that DC is primarily a disease of defective telomere maintenance .
Treatment is variable and complicated by the development of secondary cancers but , being a monogenic disorder , it could potentially be treated by gene therapy .
DC overlaps both clinically and genetically with several other diseases including Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome , aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> myelodysplasia <END> , among others and its underlying telomeric defect has implications for a broader range of biological processes including ageing and many forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Meta-analysis for linkage to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and atopy in the chromosome 5q31-33 candidate region .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> is a common , complex human disease .
Gene discovery in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> has been complicated by substantial etiological heterogeneity , the possibility of genes of small effect and the concomitant requirement for large sample sizes .
Linkage to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> phenotypes has been investigated most intensively in the 5q chromosomal region , although results have been inconsistent across studies and all studies have had modest sample sizes .
One potential solution to these issues is to combine data from multiple studies in a retrospective meta-analysis by pooling either summary statistics or raw data .
The International Consortium on <START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> Genetics combined data from 11 data sets ( n = 6277 subjects ) to investigate evidence for linkage of 35 markers spanning the cytokine cluster on chromosome 5q31â€“33 to 'asthma ' dichotomy and total serum immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) levels .
Chromosome 5q markers typed in different centers were integrated into a consensus map to facilitate effective data pooling .
Multipoint linkage analyses using a new Hasemanâ€“Elston method were performed with all data sets pooled together , and also separately with the resulting linkage statistics pooled by meta-analytic methods .
Our results did not provide any evidence significant at the 5 % level that loci conferring susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> or atopy are present in the 5q31â€“33 region ; however , there was some weak evidence ( empirical P = 0.077 ) of linkage to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> affection .
This study suggests that loci in 5q31â€“33 have at most a modest effect on susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> or total serum IgE levels , may not be detectable or present in all human populations and are difficult to detect even using combined linkage evidence from 2400â€“260 0 full sibling pairs .
A genome-wide search for linkage to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> phenotypes in the genetics of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> international network families : evidence for a major susceptibility locus on chromosome 2p. <START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> is a complex disease and the intricate interplay between genetic and environmental factors underlies the overall phenotype of the disease .
Families with at least two siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> were collected from Europe , Australia and the US .
A genome scan using a set of 364 families with a panel of 396 microsatellite markers was conducted .
Nonparametric linkage analyses were conducted for <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and three asthma-related phenotypes : bronchial hyper-reactivity ( BHR) , strict definition of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Nine chromosomal regions with LOD scores greater than 1.5 were identified ( chromosomes 1q , 2p , 3q , 4p , 4q , 6q , 12q , 20p and 21 ) .
Linkage refinement analysis was performed for three BHR loci by genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms at an average marker density of 1 cM .
The LOD scores increased to 3.07 at chromosome 4p and 4.58 at chromosome 2p , while the chromosome 6p locus did not refine .
The LOD score at the chromosome 2p locus is highly significant on a genome-wide basis .
The refined locus covers a region with a physical size of 12 .2 Mb .
Taken together , these results provide evidence for a major <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> susceptibility locus on chromosome 2p.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> associated with chorioretinopathy.
Two sisters and their brother affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , chorioretinal degeneration , and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> were studied .
Besides the clinical features derived from the main abnormalities , nanosomy and cutis marmorata were found in the three patients .
Both parents and three other sibs were normal .
Possible intrauterine non-genetic etiologic factors ( X-rays , toxoplasmosis , cytomegalovirus ) which can lead to phenocopies were investigated with negative results .
Based on these and previous observations , it seems clear that a distinct form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> associated with chorioretinal degeneration can be separated from the heterogenous group of entities which presents <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
Syndrome of polydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> , lingual hamartomas , renal hypoplasia , hearing loss , and <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> : variant of the Mohr syndrome or a new syndrome ?
Three sibs , the proband and two monozygotic twins , have a condition including <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , postnatal somatic retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> preaxial polydactyly of the feet <END> , bifid third metacarpal , median <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> , fatty hamartomas on the dorsum of the tongue , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> , and unilateral or bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> renal agenesis <END> .
This probably <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome could be a further example of the condition described by VÃ¡radi et al or a variant of the Mohr syndrome .
Non-type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> caused by mutations in SLC7A9 , encoding a subunit ( bo ,+AT ) of rBAT.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cystinuria <END> ( MIM 220100 ) is a common recessive disorder of renal reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids .
Mutations in SLC3A1 , encoding rBAT , cause <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> type I ( ref . 1 ) , but not other types of <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> ( ref . 2 ) .
A gene whose mutation causes non-type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> has been mapped by linkage analysis to 19q12-13.1 ( Refs 3,4 ) .
We have identified a new transcript , encoding a protein ( bo , +AT , for bo , + amino acid transporter ) belonging to a family of light subunits of amino acid transporters , expressed in kidney , liver , small intestine and placenta , and localized its gene ( SLC7A9 ) to the non-type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> 19q locus .
Co-transfection of bo ,+AT and rBAT brings the latter to the plasma membrane , and results in the uptake of L-arginine in COS cells .
We have found SLC7A9 mutations in Libyan-Jews , North American , Italian and Spanish non-type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> patients .
The Libyan Jewish patients are homozygous for a founder missense mutation ( V17 0M ) that abolishes b o ,+AT amino-acid uptake activity when co-transfected with rBAT in COS cells .
We identified four missense mutations ( G105R , A182T, G195R and G295R ) and two frameshift (52 0ins T and 596delTG ) mutations in other patients .
Our data establish that mutations in SLC7A9 cause non-type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> , and suggest that bo ,+AT is the light subunit of rBAT.
Apparent Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome : a patient with unusual manifestations .
Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome was first described by Lenz et al . in 1955 (9 ) .
The cardinal features of the syndrome are <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , external ear , digital , cardiac , skeletal , dental and genitourinary anomalies .
Here we present a case of Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome that shows the typical characteristics and , additionally , macrophallus , a broad chest with widely spaced nipples , wide gap between first and second toes , which are unusual manifestations in Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> Microphthalmia <END> Syndrome .
Chromosome 3 duplication q21 leads to qter deletion p25 leads to pter syndrome in children of carriers of a pericentric inversion inv(3 ) ( p25q21 ) .
Close phenotypic similarity between two cases carrying a rec(3 ) dup q ,inv(3 ) ( p25q21) , 12 additional infants from the same inv (3 ) (p25q21 ) kindred who lived less than 1 year , and eight cases studied in other medical centers has led us to postulate the existence of a distinct chromosome 3 duplication-deletion syndrome .
In the presence of trisomy for (3 )q21 leads to qter and monosomy for (3 )p25 leads to pter , the facial dysmorphy is unique : a distorted head shape due to irregular cranial sutures , thick low eyebrows , <START:PHENOTYPE> long eyelashes <END> , persistent lanugo , distended veins on the scalp , hypertelorism , oblique palpebral fissures , a very short nose with a broad depressed bridge and <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , protruding maxilla , <START:PHENOTYPE> thin upper lip <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , and a short webbed neck .
Port-wine stains , congenital glaucoma , cloudy corneas , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and harelip also occur frequently .
Each infant has difficulty sucking and swallowing .
Congenital anomalies of the cardiovascular system , of midgut rotation , and of the urogenital system are noted for the infants who died neonatally .
Most frequent is a <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , followed by atrial septal defect , patent ductus arteriosus , patent foramen ovale , and coarctation of the aorta .
Omphalocele , umbilical hernia , hyperplastic kidneys , polycystic kidneys , double ureter , hydro-ureter , hydronephrosis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> often occur .
The extremities are short in proportion to the length of the trunk .
Clinodactyly , coxa valga , talipes , and spina bifida are frequently observed .
Early manifestations of the carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome .
We diagnosed the carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome in five children who were seen during their first year of life with <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , feeding difficulties , <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> esotropia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> inverted nipples <END> , lipodystrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> pericardial effusion <END> , and hepatic dysfunction .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Steatosis <END> was observed in liver biopsy specimens , and cerebellar hypoplasia was present on computed tomography.
The disorder is characterized by a complex carbohydrate deficiency in certain glycoproteins , notably transferrin , which can be used as a marker of the disease .
The carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome may be an important and easily identifiable cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> and neurologic dysfunction in infancy .
The presence of the disorder in siblings of different gender and the finding of biochemical abnormalities in some unaffected parents suggest an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Individualization of a syndrome with mental deficiency , macrocranium , peculiar facies , and cardiac and skeletal anomalies .
The authors report four unrelated girls presenting mild mental deficiency and a distinct malformation syndrome , mainly consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , macrocranium , peculiar facies with <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> exophthalmos <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac anomalies <END> and cutis laxa with characteristic <START:PHENOTYPE> wrinkled palms and soles <END> , typical ribs , <START:PHENOTYPE> small vertebral bodies <END> and slender long bones .
All were <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases of non-consanguineous parents of advanced age at their births , suggesting a de novo autosomal dominant mutation .
The new Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome critical region ( WHSCR-2 ) : a description of a second case .
The Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome ( WHS) , is a well known contiguous gene syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent glabella <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthal folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> or palate , cardiac defects , growth and mental retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
The currently accepted WHS critical region ( WHSCR ) is localized between the loci D4S166 and D4S3327 , where a deletion seems to generate all the clinical manifestations of the syndrome .
Here we present a patient with a subtelomeric deletion of 4p16 .3 showing growth and <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor delay <END> with a typical WHS facial appearance and two episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in conjunction with fever .
The high-resolution G-banded karyotype was normal .
Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) with a set of cosmids from 4p16 .3 , showed that the deletion in this patient was from the D4S3327 to the telomere , enabling the size of the deletion to be estimated as 1 .9 Mb , excluding the accepted WHSCR deletion .
This patient supports the recent proposal by Zollino et al . [2003 ] that the critical region for WHS is located distally to the WHSCR between the loci D4S3327 and D4S98-D4S16 , and it is called " WHSCR-2 " [Zollino et al. , 2003] .

Mutations in PTP N11 , encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 , cause Noonan syndrome .
Noonan syndrome ( MIM 163950 ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterized by dysmorphic facial features , proportionate <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and heart disease ( most commonly <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonic stenosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Webbed neck <END> , chest deformity , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and bleeding diatheses also are frequently associated with this disease .
This syndrome is relatively common , with an estimated incidence of 1 in 1,000-2,50 0 live births .
It has been mapped to a 5-cM region ( NS1 ) [corrected ] on chromosome 12q24.1 , and <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> has also been documented .
Here we show that missense mutations in PTPN11 ( MIM 176876 ) -a gene encoding the nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 , which contains two Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domains-cause Noonan syndrome and account for more than 5 0 % of the cases that we examined .
All PTPN11 missense mutations cluster in interacting portions of the amino N-SH2 domain and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase domains , which are involved in switching the protein between its inactive and active conformations .
An energetics-based structural analysis of two N-SH2 mutants indicates that in these mutants there may be a significant shift of the equilibrium favoring the active conformation .
This implies that they are gain-of-function changes and that the pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome arises from excessive SHP-2 activity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> attributable to a mutation in the sodium glucose cotransporter ( SGLT2 ) .
Patients with primary renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> have normal blood glucose levels , normal oral glucose tolerance test results , and isolated persistant <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> .
Congenital renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> is postulated to be attributable to defects in the SGLT2 gene .
The Na(+ )/glucose cotransporter gene SGLT2 ( = SLC5A2 ) was analyzed in a Turkish patient with congenital isolated renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> .
Genomic DNA was used as a template for amplification by the polymerase chain reaction of each of the 14 exons of the SGLT2 gene .
The amplification products were sequenced .
DNA sequence analysis revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 11 of the SGLT2 gene leading to the formation of a truncated cotransporter .
Both parents and a younger brother , all three without renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> , are heterozygous for the nonsense mutation .
Our data provide the first direct evidence of an etiologic role for the sodium/glucose cotransporter type 2 in the pathogenesis of renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> .
Family studies in patients with primary parathyroid hyperplasia .
The relatives of 25 index patients with primary parathyroid hyperplasia were tested for <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
At least 13 of these patients had one or more first degree relatives with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
Two familial syndromes each with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission were recognized .
Two index patients were part of large kindreds categorized as having familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> ( FHH ) .
Manifestations of multiple endocrine neoplasia type I were present in the kindreds of at least four other index patients ( FMEN I ) .
In seven other kindreds there were too few affected members to allow definitive classification .
Differences between manifestations of FHH and FMEN I were described .
Among offspring of affected persons in kindreds with FHH , as distinct from FMEN I , the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> approached the theoretic maximum of 50 per cent during the first two decades .
In FHH , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> and peptic disease were unusual; moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> occurred without hypercalciuria ; and subtotal parathyroidectomy did not abolish <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
Concentrations of peptide hormones other than parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) were normal in those with FHH ; in FMEN I high concentrations of glucagon in plasma were found in five of six patients tested , and high concentrations of gastrin were found in three of 12 patients .
Hypergastrinemia generally accompanied obvious peptic disease .
Distinction of the two conditions is important since patients with FHH may not benefit from subtotal parathyroidectomy , but they generally have a better clinical prognosis than do patients with FMEN I .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome of characteristic facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> preauricular pits <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> fifth finger clinodactyly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> .
This report describes six relatives with a syndrome of mild prenatal-onset growth deficiency , an altered craniofacial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> preauricular pits <END> , and clinodactyly of the fifth finger ; three had <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> .
The clinical impact of this condition appears to be related to the severity of the cardiac defect .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant inheritance <END> is implied by the occurrence of the disorder in three successive generations with documented male-to-male transmission .
Recognition of this syndrome is important in counseling families regarding recurrence risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> .
Disruption of LDL but not VLDL clearance in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> .
Genetic defects in LDL clearance result in severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> and premature <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> .
Mutations in the LDL receptor ( LDLR ) cause familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> ( FH) , the most severe form of genetic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> .
A phenocopy of FH , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> ( ARH) , is due to mutations in an adaptor protein involved in LDLR internalization .
Despite comparable reductions in LDL clearance rates , plasma LDL levels are substantially lower in ARH than in FH . To determine the metabolic basis for this difference , we examined the synthesis and catabolism of VLDL in murine models of FH ( Ldlr( -/-) ) and ARH ( Arh( -/-) ) .
The hyperlipidemic response to a high-sucrose diet was greatly attenuated in Arh( -/- ) mice compared with Ldlr( -/- ) mice despite similar rates of VLDL secretion .
The rate of VLDL clearance was significantly higher in Arh( -/- ) mice than in Ldlr( -/- ) mice , suggesting that LDLR-dependent uptake of VLDL is maintained in the absence of ARH . Consistent with these findings , hepatocytes from Arh( -/- ) mice ( but not Ldlr( -/- ) mice ) internalized beta-migrating VLDL ( beta-VLDL ) .
These results demonstrate that ARH is not required for LDLR-dependent uptake of VLDL by the liver .
The preservation of VLDL remnant clearance attenuates the phenotype of ARH and likely contributes to greater responsiveness to statins in ARH compared with FH .
Premature aging syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> , erythroid macrocytosis , severe growth and developmental deficiency .
We describe a premature aging disorder in a 15 -year-old girl with severe growth and developmental deficiency .
Her clinical findings included <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> , nuclear and subcapsular <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , insulin-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> , epilepsy , foot ulcers , erythroid macrocytosis , and unusual facial appearance .
Hyaluronic acid levels in serum and urine were normal .
Cultured skin fibroblasts had a normal potential for in vitro growth .
This finding represents a new and unique premature aging syndrome .
The genetics of idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
Idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> is an uncommon congenital deformity that clusters in families but does not fit typical Mendelian inheritance patterns .
Studies done on twins , different incidences in various ethnic groups , and transmission between generations all suggest a genetic component to <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> causation .
Complex segregation analysis strongly supports the hypothesis that one major gene is responsible for a large portion of the risk for having a <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
A few studies suggest an environmental causation of <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> , but are not persuasive .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Clubfoot <END> may be etiologically and/or genetically heterogeneous resulting in its complex inheritance pattern .
Alternatively , idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> may require a predisposing gene acting in a particular background of polygenes or environmental influences .
Discovery of the cause or causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> will provide improved genetic counseling and the potential for improved treatment , and insights into normal foot and leg development .
" Baltic " <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> epilepsy : hereditary disorder of childhood made worse by phenytoin .
A survey of 15 families in the USA with Baltic <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> epilepsy showed that the 27 individuals who were affected had the following clinical picture from about the age of 1 0 : photosensitive , occasionally violent , <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , usually worse upon waking ; <START:PHENOTYPE> generalised tonic-clonic seizures <END> , sometimes associated with absence attacks ; and light-sensitive , generally synchronous , spike-and-wave discharges on EEG that preceded clinical manifestations .
Necropsy revealed marked loss of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum , but no inclusion bodies .
Since the disease was confined to sibs and consanguinity was present in two families , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> is probable .
The disease progressed more rapidly in these families than it did in the early cases , seen in the Baltic region .
This difference could be due to a toxic effect of phenytoin because phenytoin given alone or with other antiepileptic drugs was associated with progressive motor and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual deterioration <END> , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and even death .
Treatment with valproic acid , and the concomitant reduction or elimination of phenytoin , has been associated with marked improvement in at least 8 patients .
Baltic <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> epilepsy must be distinguished from Lafora body disease , which is invariably fatal and discernible on clinical grounds .
Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-russe : new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> in Balkan Gypsies .
A novel <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral neuropathy <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> has been identified in Balkan Gypsies and termed hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Russe ( HMSN-R ) .
We investigated 21 affected individuals from 10 families .
Distal lower limb weakness began between the ages of 8 and 16 years , upper limb involvement beginning between 10 and 43 years , with an average of 22 years .
This <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive disorder <END> led to severe weakness of the lower limbs , generalized in the oldest subject ( aged 57 years ) , and marked distal upper limb weakness .
Prominent distal sensory loss involved all modalities , resulting in neuropathic joint degeneration in two instances .
All patients showed <START:PHENOTYPE> foot deformity <END> , and most showed hand deformity .
Motor nerve conduction velocity was moderately reduced in the upper limbs but unobtainable in the legs .
Sensory nerve action potentials were absent .
There was <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of larger myelinated nerve fibers <END> and profuse regenerative activity in the sural nerve .
HMSN-R is a new form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> inherited HMSN caused by a single founder mutation in a 1 Mb interval on chromosome 10q .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
The disease "deafness and <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> " ( DOD ) is characterized by congenital hearing impairment and dystrophic or <START:PHENOTYPE> absent nails <END> and teeth .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of the disorder has been previously reported only in one family .
We describe here another family in which three members in three generations ( a girl , her mother , and her maternal grandfather ) were affected with DOD .
Our finding is consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode of inheritance and confirms <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> DOD ( DDOD , MIM *124480 ) as a recognizable clinical entity .
Oncofetal gene SALL4 in aggressive <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hepatocellular carcinoma <END> is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide .
In the <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> group of hepatocellular carcinomas , those with characteristics of embryonic stem-cell and progenitor-cell gene expression are associated with the worst prognosis .
The oncofetal gene SALL4 , a marker of a subtype of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> with progenitor-like features , is associated with a poor prognosis and is a potential target for treatment .
We screened specimens obtained from patients with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> for the expression of SALL4 and carried out a clinicopathological analysis .
Loss-of-function studies were then performed to evaluate the role of SALL4 in hepatocarcinogenesis and its potential as a molecular target for therapy .
To assess the therapeutic effects of a peptide that targets SALL4 , we used in vitro functional and in vivo xenograft assays .
SALL4 is an oncofetal protein that is expressed in the human fetal liver and silenced in the adult liver , but it is reexpressed in a subgroup of patients who have <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> and an unfavorable prognosis .
Gene-expression analysis showed the enrichment of progenitor-like gene signatures with overexpression of proliferative and metastatic genes in SALL4-positive hepatocellular carcinomas .
Loss-of-function studies confirmed the critical role of SALL4 in cell survival and tumorigenicity .
Blocking SALL4-corepressor interactions released suppression of PTEN ( the phosphatase and tensin homologue protein ) and inhibited tumor formation in xenograft models in vivo .
SALL4 is a marker for a progenitor subclass of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> with an aggressive phenotype .
The absence of SALL4 expression in the healthy adult liver enhances the potential of SALL4 as a treatment target in <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> .

Bethlem <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> : a <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> congenital muscular dystrophy with contractures .
Bethlem <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> is an early-onset benign <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> with contractures caused by mutations in collagen type VI genes .
It has been reported that onset occurs in early childhood .
We investigated the natural course of Bethlem <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> in five previously published kindreds and two novel pedigrees , with particular attention to the mode of onset in 23 children and the progression of weakness in 36 adult patients .
Our analysis shows that nearly all children exhibit weakness or contractures during the first 2 years of life .
Early features include diminished foetal movements , <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal hypotonia <END> and congenital contractures which are of a dynamic nature during childhood .
The course of Bethlem <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> in adult patients is less benign than previously thought .
Due to slow but ongoing progression , more than two-thirds of patients over 50 years of age use a wheelchair .
Mental retardation , growth retardation , unusual nose , and <START:PHENOTYPE> open mouth <END> : an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> entity .
In this paper , I describe the investigations in three members of an extended consanguineous family from Saudi Arabia , in which nine members show <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long eyelashes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> , underdeveloped malae , <START:PHENOTYPE> low hanging columella <END> , thin upper vermillion , and everted lower vermillion , <START:PHENOTYPE> retrognathia <END> , and an <START:PHENOTYPE> open mouth <END> apparently caused by mandibular dentoalveolar protrusion .
Pedigree analysis makes it likely that this is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder .
A detailed literature search failed to show a similar entity .

Genomewide genetic linkage analysis confirms the presence of susceptibility loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , on chromosomes 1q32.2 , 5q33.2 , and 8p21-22 and provides support for linkage to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , on chromosomes 11q23.3-24 and 20q12 .1-11 .23.
We have performed genetic linkage analysis in 13 large multiply affected families , to test the hypothesis that there is extensive <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> of linkage for genetic subtypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Our strategy consisted of selecting 13 kindreds containing multiple affected cases in three or more generations , an absence of bipolar affective disorder , and a single progenitor source of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> with unilineal transmission into the branch of the kindred sampled .
DNA samples from these families were genotyped with 365 microsatellite markers spaced at approximately 10-cM intervals across the whole genome .
We observed LOD scores >3. 0 at five distinct loci , either in the sample as a whole or within single families , strongly suggesting etiological <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Heterogeneity <END> LOD scores >3. 0 in the sample as a whole were found at 1q33.2 ( LOD score 3.2 ; P=.0003) , 5q33.2 ( LOD score 3.6 ; P=.0001 ) , 8p22.1-22 ( LOD score 3.6 ; P=.0001 ) , and 11q21 ( LOD score 3.1 ; P=.0004 ) .
LOD scores >3. 0 within single pedigrees were found at 4q13-31 ( LOD score 3.2 ; P=.0003 ) and at 11q23.3-24 ( LOD score 3.2 ; P=.0003 ) .
A LOD score of 2 .9 was also found at 20q12 .1-11 .23 within in a single family .
The fact that other studies have also detected LOD scores >3. 0 at 1q33.2 , 5q33.2 , 8p21-22 and 11q21 suggests that these regions do indeed harbor schizophrenia-susceptibility loci .
We believe that the weight of evidence for linkage to the chromosome 1q22 , 5q33.2 , and 8p21-22 loci is now sufficient to justify intensive investigation of these regions by methods based on linkage disequilibrium .
Such studies will soon allow the identification of mutations having a direct effect on susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Mutations of the human thyrotropin receptor gene causing <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid hypoplasia <END> and persistent congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> .
The pathogenesis of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> due to thyroid dysgenesis is still unknown .
A point mutation in the TSH receptor ( TSHR ) of the hypothyroid hyt/hyt mouse invoked the TSHR as a candidate gene for congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> .
Therefore , we screened for mutations in the TSHR gene in patients with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> and hypoplasia of the gland .
In one girl detected in neonatal screening with the confirmed diagnosis of permanent congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> with reduced thyroid volume , two novel mutations in the TSHR gene were identified .
Single strand conformational polymorphism and subsequent DNA sequencing studies of a fragment of the TSHR gene showed that the patient is a compound heterozygote for 2 loss of function mutations in exon 10 of the TSHR gene .
In the mutant maternal allele , 18 nucleotides ( positions 1217-1234 ) are deleted , and 4 novel bp are inserted , resulting in a frame-shift and premature termination of the coding sequence .
Transfection studies showed that this truncated TSHR was trapped intracellularly and completely lacked cell surface expression .
The paternal gene harbors a missense mutation at nucleotide position 1170 , leading to the exchange of the highly conserved C-390 for a W residue .
This alteration resulted in a drastic loss of affinity and potency of TSH acting at the mutant compared to the wild-type receptor .
In contrast to the published loss of function mutations of the TSHR leading to euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia , the two new mutations lead to persistent congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> and defective organ development .
Further studies will have to analyze to what extent TSHR mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> as opposed to other genetic or environmental factors .
Mutation of OPA1 causes dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> with external <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , deafness and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions : a novel disorder of mtDNA maintenance .
Mutations in nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) maintenance cause a wide range of clinical phenotypes associated with the secondary accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions in affected tissues .
The majority of families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> progressive external <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> ( PEO ) harbour mutations in genes encoding one of three well-characterized proteins--pol gamma , Twinkle or Ant 1 . Here we show that a heterozygous mis-sense mutation in OPA1 leads to multiple mtDNA deletions in skeletal muscle and a mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase ( COX ) .
The disorder presented with visual failure and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> in childhood , followed by PEO , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , deafness and a sensory-motor <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> in adult life .
COX-deficient skeletal muscle fibres contained supra-threshold levels of multiple mtDNA deletions , and genetic linkage , sequencing and expression analysis excluded POLG1 , PEO1 and SLC25A4 , the gene encoding Ant 1 , as the cause .
This demonstrates the importance of OPA1 in mtDNA maintenance , and implicates OPA1 in diseases associated with secondary defects of mtDNA .
Ligneous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> .
Ligneous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> ( McKusick 217 090 ) is a rare form of chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> characterized by the development of firm fibrin-rich , woody-like pseudomembraneous lesions mainly on the tarsal conjunctivae .
Less frequently , similar lesions may occur on other mucous membranes of the body indicating that these manifestations are part of a systemic disease .
Histopathological findings from affected humans and ( plasminogen-deficient ) mice indicate that wound healing , mainly of injured mucosal tissue , is impaired due to markedly decreased ( plasmin-mediated ) extracellular fibrinolysis .
Pseudomembraneous lesions of the eyes and other mucosal tissue mainly contain clotted fibrin(ogen ) .
Actually , systemic plasminogen deficiency has been linked to ligneous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> in humans and mice .
In one case , ligneous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> has been induced by antifibrinolytic treatment with tranexamic acid .
Further rare associated disorders of ligneous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> are congenital occlusive <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> and juvenile colloid milium .
This review outlines the historical background , clinical characteristics of ligneous <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> and its associated complications , histological abnormalities of pseudomembraneous lesions , inheritance , hemostasiologic and molecular genetic findings in affected patients , current treatment approaches , and the plasminogen-deficient mouse as an animal model .
Further refinement of the MYP2 locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> by linkage disequilibrium analysis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> High myopia <END> ( >-6.00 diopters ) is a complex common disorder that predisposes individuals to <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> , glaucoma , macular degeneration , and premature cataracts .
A recent linkage analysis of seven families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> has identified one locus ( MYP2 ) for <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> on chromosome 18p11 .31 ( Young et al. : Am J Hum Genet 1998 ;63 :1 09-119 ) .
Haplotype analysis revealed an initial interval of 7. 6 centimorgans ( cM ) .
Transmission disequilibrium tests ( TDT) with both the Statistical Analysis for Genetic Epidemiology ( SAGE ) 3.1 TDTEX and GENEHUNTER 2 ( GH2 ) programs were performed using chromosome 18p marker alleles for this interval .
Using SAGE analysis , the following p values were obtained for markers in marker order in this region : D18S1146 ( p = 0.227) , D18S481 ( p = 0.001 ) , D18S63 ( p = 0.062 ) , D18S1138 ( p = 0.0004) , D18S52 ( p = 1.79 x 10( -6) ) , and D18S62 ( p = 0.141 ) .
GH2 TDT analysis revealed the following p values for the best allele for the markers : D18S1146 ( p = 0.083) , D18S481 ( p = 0.108 ) , D18S63 ( p = 0.034) , D18S1138 ( p = 0.011 ) , D18S52 ( p = 0.007) , and D18S62 ( p = 0.479 ) .
These data suggest that the gene for 18p11 .31-linked
<START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> is most proximal to marker D18S52 , with a likely interval of 0.8 cM between markers D18S63 and D18S52 .
Due to the contraction of the interval size by TDT, these results provide a basis for focused positional cloning and candidate gene analysis at the MYP2 locus .
Whole-exome sequencing identifies compound heterozygous mutations in WDR62 in siblings with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Polymicrogyria <END> is a disorder of neuronal development resulting in structurally abnormal cerebral hemispheres characterized by over-folding and abnormal lamination of the cerebral cortex .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Polymicrogyria <END> is frequently associated with severe neurologic deficits including <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , motor problems , and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
There are acquired and genetic causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> , but most patients with a presumed genetic etiology lack a specific diagnosis .
Here we report using whole-exome sequencing to identify compound heterozygous mutations in the WD repeat domain 62 ( WDR62 ) gene as the cause of recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> in a sibling pair .
Sanger sequencing confirmed that the siblings both inherited 1-bp ( maternal allele ) and 2-bp ( paternal allele ) frameshift deletions , which predict premature truncation of WDR62 , a protein that has a role in early cortical development .
The probands are from a non-consanguineous family of Northern European descent , suggesting that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> PMG due to compound heterozygous mutation of WDR62 might be a relatively common cause of PMG in the population .
Further studies to identify mutation frequency in the population are needed .

Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> in a 9-year-old Brazilian girl due to a novel inactivating mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor .
Familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> ( FHH ) and neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> ( NSHPT) are consequent to inactivating mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor ( CaR ) gene .
FHH is usually associated with heterozygous inactivating mutations of the CaR gene , whereas NSHPT is usually due to homozygous inactivation of the CaR gene .
FHH is generally asymptomatic and is characterized by mild to moderate lifelong <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> , relative <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalciuria <END> , and normal intact PTH , whereas individuals with NSHPT frequently show life-threatening <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
In this study , we report a novel inactivating mutation of the CaR gene , identified in a 9-yr-old Brazilian girl who was found to be severely hypercalcemic during investigation of a 6-month history of headaches and vomits .
Direct sequencing of the CaR gene from this patient showed a novel homozygous mutation ( L13P ) in exon 2 . Functional characterization by intracellular calcium measurement by fluorometry showed that the mutant receptor had a dose-response curve shifted to the right relative to that of wild type .
The proband 's consanguineous parents , who had mild asymptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> , showed the same mutation in the heterozygous form .
The mutation described in this study is the inactivating missense mutation present at the most N-terminal end among the known CaR missense mutations .
This study reinforces the fact that patients with homozygous inactivation of the CaR gene may present with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> in different phases of life .
Lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> and the debrisoquine metabolic phenotype .
In a case-control study , we tested the hypothesis that the genetically determined ability to metabolize debrisoquine is related to risk of lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Overall , individuals who were extensive metabolizers of debrisoquine were at significantly greater risk of lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> than those who were poor or intermediate metabolizers ( odds ratio = 6.1 ; 95 % confidence interval = 2.2-17 .1 ) .
In this study , case patients had lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> , and control subjects had either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cancers other than lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Results were adjusted for age , race , asbestos exposure , and smoking .
Both black and white individuals who were extensive metabolizers of debrisoquine were at significantly increased risk after similar adjustment ( for blacks , odds ratio = 4.5 , 95 % confidence interval = 1 .1-18 .1 ; for whites , odds ratio = 10.2 , 95 % confidence interval = 2.0-51 .4 ) .
Significantly increased risk of lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> was also present for individuals who were extensive metabolizers when subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other cancers were considered separately .
These data confirm that the ability to metabolize debrisoquine is a major determinant of susceptibility to lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Evaluation of the marker in other case-control settings , further exploration of racial differences , and the prospective evaluation of this marker in subgroups at high risk of lung <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> are areas worthy of further study .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> : reduction of the SPG11 interval and evidence for further genetic heterogeneity .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( HSP ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> ( TCC ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> of complicated HSP mainly characterized by slowly progressive spastic paraparesis and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deterioration <END> beginning in the second decade of life .
The locus for HSP-TCC , designated SPG11 , was mapped to chromosome 15q13-15 in some of the affected families from Japan , Europe , and North America , spanning an interval of 17.5 megabases ( Mb ) .
To perform a clinical and genetic study of HSP-TC C .
Case series ; multi-institutional study .
Seven patients with HSP-TC C who belong to 3 consanguineous families of Arab origin residing in Israel .
The 7 patients manifested a relatively similar combination of adolescence-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive decline <END> and spastic paraparesis with TCC on brain magnetic resonance imaging .
After excluding the SPG7 locus , we tested the 3 families for linkage to the SPG11 , SPG21/ MAST, and ACCPN loci associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorders with TC C .
Two families showed evidence for linkage to SPG11 ( Z(max ) = 5.55 ) and reduced the candidate region to 13 Mb .
Our findings in HSP-TC C further confirm its worldwide distribution and genetic heterogeneity , and they significantly reduce the candidate SPG11 interval .
Further delineation of the Van den Ende-Gupta syndrome .
Van Den Ende-Gupta syndrome ( VDEGS ) is an infrequently described disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , camptodactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malar hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> convex nasal ridge <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> everted lower lip <END> .
Patients show normal growth and cognition .
We report on three male and three female cases from four consanguineous families , of which three belong to the same highly inbred tribe from Qatar .
The phenotype in the patients is remarkably homogeneous .
VDEGS has been suggested both to follow an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> and autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance , but our observations suggest an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> pattern of inheritance , although genetic heterogeneity cannot be excluded .

Two distinct MICA gene markers discriminate major autoimmune diabetes types .
The polymorphism of the major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A gene is associated with type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> .
The major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A gene 5 allele is significantly more frequent in Caucasian type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> children than in healthy subjects , but no information is available on the association with adult-onset type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> or with the so-called slowly progressive latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult in the same ethnic group .
In this study we estimated the frequency of major histocompatibility complex class I chain- related A gene alleles and human leukocyte antigen-DRB1* 03-DQA1* 05 01- DQB1* 0201 and human leukocyte antigen-DRB1* 04- DQA1* 0301- DQB1* 0302 in 195 type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> subjects , in 80 latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult subjects , and in 158 healthy subjects from central Italy .
Major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A gene 5 was significantly associated with type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> only in the 1-25 yr age group at diagnosis , and the odds ratio of the simultaneous presence of both major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A gene 5 and human leukocyte antigen-DRB1* 03- DQA1* 05 01- DQB1* 0201 and/or human leukocyte antigen-DRB1* 04-DQA1* 0301- DQB1* 0302 was as high as 54 and higher than 388 when compared with double negative individuals .
Adult-onset type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> ( age at diagnosis , >25 yr ) and latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult were significantly associated with major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A gene 5 .1 , which was not significantly increased among diabetic children .
Only the combination of major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A gene 5 .1 and human leukocyte antigen-DRB1* 03-DQA1* 05 01- DQB1* 0201 and/or human leukocyte antigen-DRB1* 04-DQA1* 0301- DQB1* 0302 conferred increased risk for adult-onset type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> or for latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult .
Our study provides demonstration of the existence of distinct genetic markers for childhood/young-onset type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and for adult-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus/latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult , namely major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A gene 5 and major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A gene 5 .1 , respectively .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> distal muscle wasting <END> in the Old Order Amish ; atypical Troyer syndrome or " new " syndrome .
The Troyer syndrome was found by Cross & McKusick ( 1967 ) in 20 members of 12 Old Order Amish families in Holmes County , Ohio ; it is a form of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> combined with <START:PHENOTYPE> distal muscle wasting <END> , i.e . signs of involvement of lower motor neurons .
The condition usually begins at 1 to 2 years and progresses at variable rates .
Further manifestations include growth retardation , delayed speech development with <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> drooling <END> , and cerebellar signs ; mental functions are usually not affected but severe <START:PHENOTYPE> emotional lability <END> is a common finding .
Brothers in a Wisconsin Old Order Amish family are reported with spastic diplegia , mental retardation , behavioral disorder and shortness of stature ; the condition apparently is not progressive , and may be a " new " syndrome but could also represent a variant of the Troyer syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> is most likely , although consanguinity of the parents could not be proven .
Another child in this family suffers from focal scleroderma ( morphea ) which is not related to the neurological syndrome .
A novel loss-of-function mutation in TTF-2 is associated with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid agenesis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
Thyroid dysgenesis is the most common cause of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> ( CH ) and its genetic basis is largely unknown .
Here , we describe the second homozygous missense mutation in TTF-2 ( or FOXE1) , a transcription factor that has been implicated in thyroid development .
Two male siblings , born to consanguineous parents , presented with CH , athyreosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and were found to be homozygous for a mutation corresponding to a serine to asparagine substitution at codon 57 ( S57N ) in the forkhead DNA binding domain of TTF-2 .
Their heterozygous parents were unaffected and this mutation was not found in 31 unrelated cases of athyreosis or normal controls .
Consistent with its location , the S57N TTF-2 mutant protein showed impaired DNA binding and partial loss of transcriptional function .
Such incomplete loss of TTF-2 function may account for the absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid epiglottis <END> in our patients , anomalies which were present together with CH and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> in two other individuals with the only other , more deleterious , TTF-2 mutation ( A65V ) described previously .
Our observations support the role of TTF-2 in both thyroid and palate development but suggest phenotypic heterogeneity of this syndromic form of CH .
Effect of sodium benzoate in the treatment of atypical nonketotic <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperglycinaemia <END> .
A 6-month-old girl presented with hypotonia and mild psychomotor retardation .
Subsequently , an atypical manifestation of a nonketotic <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperglycinaemia <END> was diagnosed , confirmed by significantly reduced activity of the glycine cleavage system in the liver tissue .
After the patient developed hypsarrhythmia and had a single cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> , treatment with both sodium benzoate and dextromethorphan was started .
During the following year , the girl was free of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> with improvement of the EEG activity and showed retarded but continuously progressing psychomotor development .
At the age of 20 months she began to walk freely but had generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> and moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Discontinuation of dextromethorphan medication after one year of treatment did not change the clinical and electroencephalographic status .
However , after cessation of sodium benzoate therapy , epileptic activity in the EEG and behavioural changes occurred .
These changes disappeared promptly after sodium benzoate therapy was reinstituted .
Thus , this case of mild atypical nonketotic <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperglycinaemia <END> with only moderate psychomotor retardation and without <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> benefited from treatment with sodium benzoate in terms of electroencephalographic and behavioural changes .
Early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> with diurnal fluctuation maps to a locus for juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
Early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> with diurnal fluctuation ( EPDF ) is a dopa-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> characterized by early onset and improvement of parkinsonian symptoms after sleep .
A pathologic study of one case of EPDF showed selective neuronal degeneration in the zona compacta of the substantia nigra without Lewy body formation .
To determine the disease locus for EPDF , the authors examined 53 members of 17 EPDF families and analyzed 151 meioses .
Multipoint linkage analysis gave a peak lod score of 14.2 at 1. 0 cM telomeric to D6S305 and placed the disease locus in the 17- cM interval between D6S437 and D6S253 , which is exactly the same position mapped for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> ( ARJP ; Mendelian inheritance in man 600116 ) .
The highest two-point lod score was obtained at D6S305 (1 0 .13 at theta = 0 ) . Haplotype analysis agreed with the result of multipoint analysis .
A high proportion of nonconsanguinity ( 8 /17 families) , the absence of commonly shared haplotypes , and the widespread geographic distribution of the families ' origins suggest that EPDF has multiple founder mutations .
The authors concluded that EPDF and ARJP are allelic disorders and should be included in the spectrum of a single-clinicogenetic entity of chromosome 6q-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
This disease could be characterized by a benign clinical course and relatively selective degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons with no Lewy body formation .
To determine whether ARJP/EPDF constitutes a significant proportion of familial or sporadic forms of benign early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> will require further study .
Exclusion of the locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> type 1 from the mineralocorticoid receptor gene region on human chromosome 4q by linkage analysis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> type 1 ( PHA1 ) is an uncommon inherited disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> salt-wasting <END> in infancy arising from target organ unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids .
Clinical expression of the disease varies from severely affected infants who may die to apparently asymptomatic individuals .
Inheritance is Mendelian and may be either autosomal dominant or <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
A defect in the mineralocorticoid receptor has been implicated as a likely cause of PHA1 .
The gene for human mineralocorticoid receptor ( MLR ) has been cloned and physically mapped to human chromosome 4q31 .1-31.2 .
The etiological role of MLR in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> PHA1 was investigated by performing linkage analysis between PHA1 and three simple sequence length polymorphisms ( D4S192 , D4S1548 , and D4S413 ) on chromosome 4q in 10 consanguineous families .
Linkage analysis was carried out assuming <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> with full penetrance and zero phenocopy rate using the MLINK program for two-point analysis and the HOMOZ program for multipoint analysis .
Lod scores of less than -2 were obtained over the whole region from D4S192 to D4S413 encompassing MLR .
This provdes evidence against MLR as the site of mutations causing PHA1 in the majority of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> families .
Oculo-palato-cerebral syndrome : a third case supporting <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
In 1985 , Frydman et al . [ 1985 : Clin Genet 27: 414-419 ] described a syndrome characterized by growth failure , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous <END> ( PHPV ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , connective tissue abnormality , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and spastic quadriplegia .
The syndrome was termed as oculo-palato-cerebral dwarfism .
The first patients described were offsprings of a consanguineous couple of Moroccan Jewish descent , suggesting <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
An additional case was reported by Pellegrino et al . [2001 : Am J Med Genet 99:200-203 ] in 2001 .
The clinical features were milder than the original cases , and there was no consanguinity .
We report a third patient with oculo-palato-cerebral syndrome , supporting <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> , and a detailed comparison with the previous cases .

Localization , by linkage analysis , of the <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> type III gene to chromosome 19q13.1 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cystinuria <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> aminoaciduria in which three urinary phenotypes ( I , II , and III) have been described .
An amino acid transporter gene , SLC3A1 ( formerly rBAT) , was found to be responsible for this disorder .
Mutational and linkage analysis demonstrated the presence of genetic heterogeneity in which the SLC3A1 gene is responsible for type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> but not for type II or type III.
In this study , we report the identification of the <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> type III locus on the long arm of chromosome 19 ( 19q13.1 ) , obtained after a genomewide search .
Pairwise linkage analysis in a series of type III or type II families previously excluded from linkage to the <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> type I locus ( SLC3A1 gene ) revealed a significant maximum LOD score ( zeta max ) of 13.11 at a maximum recombination fraction ( theta max ) of .00 , with marker D19S225 .
Multipoint linkage analysis performed with the use of additional markers from the region placed the <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> type III locus between D19S414 and D19S220.
Preliminary data on type II families also seem to place the disease locus for this rare type of <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> at 19q13.1 (significant zeta max = 3.11 at theta max of .00 , with marker D19S225 ) .
Anticipation or ascertainment bias in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ?
Penrose 's familial mental illness sample .
Several studies have observed anticipation ( earlier age at onset [ AAO ] in successive generations ) in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
However , whether true anticipation or ascertainment bias is the principal originating mechanism remains unclear .
In 1944 L . S . Penrose collected AAO data on a large , representative sample of familial mental illness , using a broad ascertainment strategy .
These data allowed examination of anticipation and ascertainment biases in five two-generation samples of affected relative pairs .
The median intergenerational difference ( MID) in AAO was used to assess anticipation .
Results showed significant anticipation in parent-offspring pairs with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ( n = 137 pairs ; MID 15 years ; P = .0001 ) and in a positive control sample with Huntington disease ( n = 11 ; P = .01 ) .
Broadening the diagnosis of the <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> sample suggested anticipation of severity of illness .
However , other analyses provided evidence for ascertainment bias , especially in later-AAO parents , in parent-offspring pairs .
Aunt /uncle-niece/nephew <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> pairs showed anticipation ( n = 111 ; P = .0001 ) , but the MID was 8 years and aunts/uncles had earlier median AAO than parents .
Anticipation effects were greatest in pairs with late-AAO parents but remained significant in a subgroup of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> pairs with early parental AAO ( n = 31 ; P = .03 ) .
A small control sample of other diseases had MID of 5 years but no significant anticipation ( n = 9 ; P = .38 ) .
These results suggest that , although ascertainment-bias effects were observed in parent-offspring pairs , true anticipation appears to be inherent in the transmission of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
The findings support investigations of unstable mutations and other mechanisms that may contribute to true anticipation in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Golabi-Ito-Hall syndrome results from a missense mutation in the WW domain of the PQBP1 gene .
Golabi , Ito , and Hall reported a family with X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR) , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , postnatal growth deficiency , and other anomalies , including <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> , in 1984 .
This family was restudied as part of our ongoing study of XLMR , but significant linkage to X chromosome markers could not be found .
Extreme <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> as well as other new clinical findings were observed .
Mutations in the polyglutamine tract binding protein 1 gene ( PQBP1 ) have recently been reported in four XLMR disorders ( Renpenning , Hamel cerebro-palato-cardiac , Sutherland-Haan , and Porteous syndromes ) as well as in several other families .
The clinical similarity of our family to these patients with mutations in PQBP1 , particularly the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> , prompted examination of this gene .
A missense mutation in PQBP1 was identified which changed the conserved tyrosine residue in the WW domain at position 65 to a cysteine ( p.Y65C ) .
This is the first missense mutation identified in PQBP1 and the first mutation in the WW domain of the gene .
The WW domain has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of transcription by interacting with the PPxY motif found in transcription factors .
The p.Y65 C mutation may affect the proper functioning of the PQBP1 protein as a transcriptional co-activator .
Clinical and molecular genetic spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy due to mutations of the lamin A/ C gene .
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ) is characterized by early <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures of the elbows <END> and Achilles tendons , <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> muscle wasting and weakness , and life-threatening cardiomyopathy with conduction blocks .
We recently identified LMNA encoding two nuclear envelope proteins , lamins A and C , to be implicated in the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of EDMD .
Here , we report on the variability of the phenotype and spectrum of LMNA mutations in 53 <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> EDMD patients ( 36 members of 6 families and 17 sporadic cases ) .
Twelve of the 53 patients showed cardiac involvement exclusively , although the remaining 41 all showed muscle weakness and contractures .
We were able to identify a common phenotype among the patients with skeletal muscle involvement , consisting of humeroperoneal wasting and weakness , <START:PHENOTYPE> scapular winging <END> , rigidity of the spine , and elbow and <START:PHENOTYPE> Achilles tendon contractures <END> .
The disease course was generally slow , but we observed either a milder phenotype characterized by late onset and a mild degree of weakness and contractures or a more severe phenotype with early presentation and a rapidly progressive course in a few cases .
Mutation analysis identified 18 mutations in LMNA ( i .e. , 1 nonsense mutation , 2 deletions of a codon , and 15 missense mutations ) .
All the mutations were distributed between exons 1 and 9 in the region of LMNA that is common to lamins A and C . LMNA mutations arose de novo in 76 % of the cases ; 2 of these de novo mutations were typical hot spots , and 2 others were identified in 2 unrelated cases .
There was no clear correlation between the phenotype and type or localization of the mutations within the gene .
Moreover , a marked inter- and intra-familial variability in the clinical expression of LMNA mutations exists , ranging from patients expressing the full clinical picture of EDMD to those characterized only by cardiac involvement , which points toward a significant role of possible modifier genes in the course of this disease .
In conclusion , the high proportion of de novo mutations together with the large spectrum of both LMNA mutations and the expression of the disease should now prompt screening for LMNA in familial and sporadic cases of both EDMD and <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> associated with conduction system disease .
HLA-Cw6-positive and HLA-Cw6-negative patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> Psoriasis <END> vulgaris have distinct clinical features .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Psoriasis <END> is associated with HLA-Cw6 , and Caucasians who carry this allele have about a 10-fold increased risk of developing <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
We have HLA- C typed 369 patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> and compared the clinical features of the patients carrying HLA-Cw6 against those carrying other HLA- C types .
Some striking clinical differences were observed between the two groups .
Patients who are Cw6 positive had a lower age at onset ( p=3x10( -7) ) .
Cw6-positive women had an earlier disease onset than Cw6-positive men ( p = 0.02) , but such a difference was not observed for the Cw6-negative patients .
The guttate-type onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> was mostly confined to this group ( p=2x10( -4) ) and persistent disseminated guttate-like papules were also predominantly observed in the Cw6-positive patients ( p <10(- )4 ) .
The Cw6-positive patients also had more extensive plaques on their arms , legs , and trunk ( p = 0.001 ) , more severe disease ( p = 0.003) , higher incidence of the Koebner 's phenomenon ( p = 0.005 ) , reported more often that their <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> got worse during or after throat infections ( p = 0.02) , and more often a favorable response to sunlight ( p = 0.008 ) In contrast , dystrophic nail changes were more common in the Cw6-negative patients ( p = 0.002 ) and also psoriatic <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , although this was not significant ( p = 0.135 ) .
It is concluded that patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> have different clinical features depending on whether they are HLA-Cw6 positive or negative .
Mutations in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> cytochrome c oxidase genes segregate with late-onset Alzheimer disease . Mounting evidence suggests that defects in energy metabolism contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease ( AD ) .
Cytochrome c oxidase ( CO ) is kinetically abnormal , and its activity is decreased in brain and peripheral tissue in late-onset AD . CO is encoded by both the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> and the nuclear genomes .
Its catalytic centers , however , are encoded exclusively by two <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genes , CO1 and CO2 (encoding CO subunits I and II , respectively ) .
We searched these genes , as well as other <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genes , for mutations that might alter CO activity and cosegregate with AD .
In the present study , specific missense mutations in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> CO1 and CO2 genes but not the CO3 gene were found to segregate at a higher frequency with AD compared with other neurodegenerative or metabolic diseases .
These mutations appear together in the same <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA molecule and define a unique mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome .
Asymptomatic offspring of AD mothers had higher levels of these mutations than offspring of AD fathers , suggesting that these mutations can be maternally inherited .
Cell lines expressing these mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA molecules exhibited a specific decrease in CO activity and increased production of reactive oxygen species .
We suggest that specific point mutations in the CO1 and CO2 genes cause the CO defect in AD .
A CO defect may represent a primary etiologic event , directly participating in a cascade of events that results in AD .
Clinical spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> type 2 .
The authors searched for mutations in CACNA1A in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> and describe the clinical spectrum in genetically defined patients .
Eighteen families and nine sporadic cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> were evaluated for mutations in CACNA1 A .
The families were first genotyped to check for linkage to the chromosome 19p locus of CACNA1 A .
In families consistent with linkage and in the sporadic cases , the authors screened for polymorphisms in CACNA1A using single-strand conformational polymorphism and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography followed by direct sequencing to identify specific nucleotide changes .
Of the 18 families , 11 were linked to 19p and mutations were found in 9 . Mutations were detected in four of the nine sporadic cases .
Overall , five nonsense mutations , four missense mutations , two deletions , one insertion , and one donor splice mutation were identified .
All but two of the 64 genetically defined patients reported episodes of ataxia ( two members of one family only had <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive ataxia <END> ) .
All but one had onset before age 20 and all but four had interictal nystagmus .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Migraine headaches <END> occurred in more than half , and about two thirds reported a good response to treatment with acetazolamide .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Vertigo <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> accompanied the ataxia in more than half of the genetically defined patients .
One family had multiple members with epilepsy .
A wide range of mutations in CACNA1A were associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> .
Four of 13 were missense mutations ; the remainder predicted truncated proteins .
The mutations were scattered throughout the gene , and only 2 of the 13 mutations identified in our laboratory have been reported by other laboratories , so it will not be possible to screen a few "hot spots " in CACNA1 A .
Overall , the type of mutation , missense versus nonsense , or the location of altered or truncated amino acid residues did not predict the clinical phenotype .
Spherophakia associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> molybdenum cofactor deficiency <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Molybdenum cofactor deficiency <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by lack of activity of the enzymes sulfite oxidase , aldehyde oxidase , and xanthine dehydrogenase or oxidase .
The clinical manifestations are indistinguishable from those of isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> sulfite oxidase deficiency <END> : craniofacial alterations , intractable neonatal convulsions , very severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> , and death in the first decade of life .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lens dislocation <END> is found in nearly all patients after neonatal age .
In the present case it developed late ( at the age of 8 years ) and was preceded by bilateral spherophakia .
We hypothesize that an abnormal relaxation of the zonular fibers is the cause of spherophakia in this disease ; this causes <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> eventually , after days , months , or years .
Pharmacological aspects of human and canine <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> .
Narcolepsy-cataplexy is a disabling neurological disorder that affects 1/2000 individuals .
The main clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> excessive daytime sleepiness <END> and symptoms of abnormal REM sleep ( <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> , sleep paralysis , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypnagogic hallucinations <END> ) are currently treated using amphetamine-like compounds or modafinil and antidepressants .
Pharmacological research in the area is facilitated greatly by the existence of a canine model of the disorder .
The mode of action of these compounds involves presynaptic activation of adrenergic transmission for the anticataplectic effects of antidepressant compounds and presynaptic activation of dopaminergic transmission for the EEG arousal effects of amphetamine-like stimulants .
The mode of action of modafmil is still uncertain , and other neurochemical systems may offer interesting avenues for therapeutic development .
Pharmacological and physiological studies using the canine model have identified primary neurochemical and neuroanatomical systems that underlie the expression of abnormal REM sleep and excessive sleepiness in <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> .
These involve mostly the pontine and basal forebrain cholinergic , the pontine adrenergic and the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic systems .
These studies confirm a continuing need for basic research in both human and canine <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> , and new treatments that act directly at the level of the primary defect in <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> might be forthcoming .
Polyarticular pigmented villonodular <START:PHENOTYPE> synovitis <END> in children : evidence for a genetic contribution .
Pigmented villonodular <START:PHENOTYPE> synovitis <END> rarely occurs in multiple joints , and only once has been noted in siblings .
We identified this disorder in 2 generations and found evidence for its presence in a third .
It occurred in 2 sibling children at multiple sites .
All affected individuals also had a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder , the multiple lentigines syndrome .
Among the developmental abnormalities in this kindred were fibrous dysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , pectus excavatum , <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> , and primary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> .
The etiology of pigmented villonodular <START:PHENOTYPE> synovitis <END> is uncertain , and suggested causes include trauma , inflammation , neoplasia , and repeated hemorrhage .
Our observations suggest genetic factors might also be important in the development of pigmented villonodular <START:PHENOTYPE> synovitis <END> .
Recessive twinkle mutations cause severe epileptic encephalopathy.
The C10orf2 gene encodes the mitochondrial DNA helicase Twinkle , which is one of the proteins important for mitochondrial DNA maintenance .
Dominant mutations cause multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions and progressive external <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> , but recent findings associate recessive mutations with mitochondrial DNA depletion and encephalopathy or hepatoencephalopathy.
The latter clinical phenotypes resemble those associated with recessive POLG1 mutations .
We have previously described patients with infantile onset spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( MIM271245 ) caused either by homozygous ( Y508C ) or compound heterozygous ( Y508 C and A318T) Twinkle mutations .
Our earlier reports focused on the spinocerebellar degeneration , but the 20-year follow-up of 23 patients has shown that refractory <START:PHENOTYPE> status epilepticus <END> , migraine-like headaches and severe psychiatric symptoms are also pathognomonic for the disease .
All adolescent patients have experienced phases of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , and seven patients had antipsychotic medication .
Epilepsia partialis continua occurred in 15 patients leading to generalized epileptic statuses in 13 of them .
Eight of these patients have died .
Valproate treatment was initiated on two patients , but had to be discontinued because of a severe elevation of liver enzymes .
The patients recovered , and we have not used valproate in infantile onset spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> since .
The first <START:PHENOTYPE> status epilepticus <END> manifested between 15 and 34 years of age in the homozygotes , and at 2 and 4 years in the compound heterozygotes .
The epileptic statuses lasted from several days to weeks .
Focal , stroke-like lesions were seen in magnetic resonance imaging , but in infantile onset spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> these lesions showed no predilection .
They varied from resolving small cortical to large hemispheric oedematous lesions , which reached from cerebral cortex to basal ganglia and thalamus and caused permanent necrotic damage and brain atrophy.
Brain atrophy with focal laminar cortical necrosis and hippocampal damage was confirmed on neuropathological examination .
The objective of our study was to describe the development and progression of encephalopathy in infantile onset spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> syndrome , and compare the pathognomonic features with those in other mitochondrial encephalopathies .
Telomerase mutations in families with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
Idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> is progressive and often fatal; causes of familial clustering of the disease are unknown .
Germ-line mutations in the genes hTERT and hTR , encoding telomerase reverse transcriptase and telomerase RNA , respectively , cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> dyskeratosis congenita , a rare hereditary disorder associated with premature death from <START:PHENOTYPE> aplastic anemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
To test the hypothesis that familial idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> may be caused by short telomeres , we screened 73 probands from the Vanderbilt Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> Pulmonary Fibrosis <END> Registry for mutations in hTERT and hTR .
Six probands ( 8% ) had heterozygous mutations in hTERT or hTR ; mutant telomerase resulted in short telomeres .
Asymptomatic subjects with mutant telomerase also had short telomeres , suggesting that they may be at risk for the disease .
We did not identify any of the classic features of dyskeratosis congenita in five of the six families .
Mutations in the genes encoding telomerase components can appear as familial idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
Our findings support the idea that pathways leading to telomere shortening are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease . Copyright 2007 Massachusetts Medical Society .
A deletion of the HBII-85 class of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs ) is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphagia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and hypogonadism .
Genetic studies in patients with severe early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> have provided insights into the molecular and physiological pathways that regulate body weight in humans .
We report a 19-year-old male with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphagia <END> and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , mild learning difficulties and hypogonadism , in whom diagnostic tests for Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) had been negative .
We carried out detailed clinical and metabolic phenotyping of this patient and investigated the genetic basis of this <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> syndrome using Agilent 185 k array comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH ) and Affymetrix 6. 0 genotyping arrays .
The identified deletion was validated using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and long-range PCR , followed by breakpoint sequencing which enabled precise localization of the deletion .
We identified a approximately 187 kb microdeletion at chromosome 15q11 -13 that encompasses non-coding small nucleolar RNAs ( including HBII-85 snoRNAs ) which were not expressed in peripheral lymphocytes from the patient .
Characterization of the clinical phenotype revealed increased ad libitum food intake , normal basal metabolic rate when adjusted for fat-free mass , partial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and growth failure .
We have identified a novel deletion on chromosome 15q11 -13 in an individual with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphagia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , hypogonadism and other features associated with PWS , which is normally caused by deficiency of several paternally expressed imprinted transcripts within chromosome 15q11 -13 , a region that includes multiple protein-coding genes as well as several non-coding snoRNAs .
These findings provide direct evidence for the role of a particular family of non-coding RNAs , the HBII-85 snoRNA cluster , in human energy homeostasis , growth and reproduction .
Truncations of titin causing dilated cardiomyopathy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy arise from mutations in many genes .
TTN , the gene encoding the sarcomere protein titin , has been insufficiently analyzed for cardiomyopathy mutations because of its enormous size .
We analyzed TTN in 312 subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , 231 subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , and 249 controls by using next-generation or dideoxy sequencing .
We evaluated deleterious variants for cosegregation in families and assessed clinical characteristics .
We identified 72 unique mutations ( 25 nonsense , 23 frameshift , 23 splicing , and 1 large tandem insertion ) that altered full-length titin .
Among subjects studied by means of next-generation sequencing , the frequency of TTN mutations was significantly higher among subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> (54 of 203 [27% ] ) than among subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( 3 of 231 [1% ] , P=3Ã—10( -16) ) or controls ( 7 of 249 [3% ] , P=9Ã—10( -14) ) . TTN mutations cosegregated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> in families ( combined lod score , 11 .1 ) with high ( >95% ) observed penetrance after the age of 40 years .
Mutations associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> were overrepresented in the titin A-band but were absent from the Z-disk and M-band regions of titin ( Pâ‰¤ 0.01 for all comparisons ) .
Overall , the rates of cardiac outcomes were similar in subjects with and those without TTN mutations , but adverse events occurred earlier in male mutation carriers than in female carriers ( P=4Ã—10( -5) ) .
TTN truncating mutations are a common cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , occurring in approximately 25% of familial cases of idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and in 18 % of sporadic cases .
Incorporation of sequencing approaches that detect TTN truncations into genetic testing for <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> should substantially increase test sensitivity , thereby allowing earlier diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for many patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.
Defining the functional effects of TTN truncating mutations should improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy.

Microdeletions of chromosome 17p13 as a cause of isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lissencephaly <END> ( agyria-pachygyria ) is a brain malformation manifested by a smooth cerebral surface , resulting from arrest of neuronal migration at 10-14 wk gestation .
Type I , or classical , <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> can occur either in association with the Miller-Dieker syndrome ( MDS ) or as an isolated finding , termed "isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> sequence " ( ILS ) .
About 90 % of MDS patients have visible or submicroscopic deletions of 17p13.3 .
We therefore investigated the possibility that some ILS patients have smaller deletions in this chromosomal region .
Forty-five ILS patients with gyral abnormalities ranging from complete <START:PHENOTYPE> agyria <END> to mixed agyria/pachygyria and complete <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> were studied .
RFLP analysis with five polymorphic loci in 17p13.3 was performed on all patients and their parents .
Somatic cell hybrids were constructed on three patients , to confirm a deletion or to determine the boundaries of a deletion .
In-situ hybridization using cosmid probes from within a newly defined <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> critical region was performed on 31 patients as a further method of deletion detection .
Six submicroscopic deletions were detected ( 13.3% ) .
Three of the deletions among 45 ILS patients were detected by RFLP analysis , 4 deletions in 31 patients were detected by in situ hybridization , and one deletion was detected only by somatic cell hybrid studies ( in situ hybridization was not performed ) .
Overall , in situ hybridization proved to be the most rapid and sensitive method of deletion detection .
The centromeric boundary of these deletions overlapped that of MDS patients , while the telomeric boundary for four ILS deletions was proximal to that of MDS and narrows the critical region for a <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> locus .( ABSTR ACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Complications of the naevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome : results of a population based study .
There are many potential complications which have been reported in association with the naevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome .
We have been able to show the relative frequencies of these problems in a population based study of 84 cases in the north west of England .
The major complications of <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> and jaw cysts occur in over 90 % of patients by 40 years of age , but may both occur before 10 years of age .
Less well described complications are ovarian calcification or fibroma ( 24% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> ( 5% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac fibroma <END> ( 3% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ( 5% ) , and ophthalmic abnormalities such as <START:PHENOTYPE> squint <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> ( 26% ) .
This study more clearly defines the possible complications of the syndrome and gives clearer guidelines for counselling and screening affected and at risk persons .
A family with <START:PHENOTYPE> acute leukemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic anemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> : association with bone marrow C-monosomy .
The eldest brother in a sibship of five children died of acute myelogenous leukemia at 10 years of age .
The second and third eldest brothers died of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic anemia <END> at ages five and nine years , respectively .
A surviving 6 year old brother , the proband of the study , has abnormalities that suggest a preleukemic state : mild <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> , platelet dysfunction , immunodeficiency , and bone marrow hypoplasia with approximately 18 per cent blast forms .
His 17 year old sister has a mild normochromic normocytic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> .
Cytogenetic studies revealed C-group monosomy in the bone marrows of the proband and the third brother ( 45 , XY , -C) ; band studies demonstrated that a No . 8 chromosome was missing in the proband ( 45 , XY , -8 ) .
At least four of the siblings and their father had <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , and evidence of a small cerebellum at autopsy examination or by computerized axial tomography.
The disorder in this family has major features of two autosomal recessive preleukemic diseases , ataxia-telangiectasia and Fanconi 's <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> .
However , these and other inherited conditions were excluded by clinical or laboratory criteria , and no environmental causes of the familial disorder were found .
The constellation of abnormalities in the family may constitute a new genetic syndrome .
Wide clinical spectrum in Zimmermann-Laband syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Gingival fibromatosis <END> can be present as an isolated form or be part of a genetic disease .
The Zimmermann-Laband syndrome ( ZLS ) is a rare disorder inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion , clinically characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival fibromatosis <END> , bulbous soft nose , thick floppy ears , nail dysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hyperextensibility <END> , hepatosplenomegaly , skeletal anomalies and occasional mental retardation .
We studied a girl aged five years with clinical and radiological features of the ZLS , additionally she presented <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> not previously described in the ZLS , as only partial <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> was reported in some patients .
The father presented some facial features suggestive of ZLS , nevertheless he did not have <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival fibromatosis <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> .
We suggest that this case supports that ZLS can be part a contiguous genes syndrome or be consequence ofa gene mutation with wide variable expression .
The present report supports that ZLS has a wide clinical spectrum .
Haploinsufficiency of a spliceosomal GTPase encoded by EFTUD2 causes <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibulofacial dysostosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mandibulofacial dysostosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( MFDM ) is a rare sporadic syndrome comprising craniofacial malformations , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and a recognizable dysmorphic appearance .
Major sequelae , including <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , each occur in a significant proportion of affected individuals .
We present detailed clinical findings in 12 unrelated individuals with MFDM ; these 12 individuals compose the largest reported cohort to date . To define the etiology of MFDM , we employed whole-exome sequencing of four unrelated affected individuals and identified heterozygous mutations or deletions of EFTUD2 in all four .
Validation studies of eight additional individuals with MFDM demonstrated causative EFTUD2 mutations in all affected individuals tested .
A range of EFTUD2-mutation types , including null alleles and frameshifts , is seen in MFDM , consistent with haploinsufficiency ; segregation is de novo in all cases assessed to date .
U5-116kD , the protein encoded by EFTUD2 , is a highly conserved spliceosomal GTPase with a central regulatory role in catalytic splicing and post-splicing-complex disassembly .
MFDM is the first multiple-malformation syndrome attributed to a defect of the major spliceosome .
Our findings significantly extend the range of reported spliceosomal phenotypes in humans and pave the way for further investigation in related conditions such as Treacher Collins syndrome .

TMEM70 mutations are a common cause of nuclear encoded ATP synthase assembly defect : further delineation of a new syndrome .
The TMEM70 gene defect was recently identified as a novel cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ATP synthase deficiency .
Most of the 28 patients with TMEM70 disorder reported to date display a distinctive phenotype characterised by neonatal onset of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> , facial dysmorphism , profound <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> 3-methylglutaconic aciduria <END> .
Almost all share a common Roma descent and are homozygous for a single founder splice site mutation .
Six new patients from four separate families , with clinical and biochemical diagnosis of ATP synthase deficiency , were studied .
TMEM70 sequence analysis of the three exons and their flanking splice junction consensus sequences was performed in all patients .
In addition their clinical phenotype and disease course was strictly studied .
Four novel deleterious homozygous TMEM70 mutations were identified .
The previously described clinical spectrum was expanded to include infantile onset <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , early onset gastrointestinal dysfunction and congenital hypertonia with multiple contractures resembling arthrogryposis .
The first characterisation of fetal presentation of the syndrome is also provided , featuring significant <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> oligohydramnios <END> , fetal hypotonia , and myocardial wall thickening .
The current report corroborates the previously described unique phenotype of TMEM70 deficiency .
The study identifies TMEM70 gene defect as a pan-ethnic disorder and further redefines it as the most common cause of nuclear-origin ATP synthase deficiency .
Hereditary mental <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Parkinsonism <END> with taurine deficiency .
An unusual neuropsychiatric disorder inherited in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion occurred in three successive generations of a family .
Symptoms commenced late in the fifth decade in six affected patients and led to death in four to six years .
The earliest and most prominent symptom was mental <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> not responsive to antidepressant drugs or electroconvulsive therapy .
This was accompanied by exhaustion , <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep disturbances <END> , and marked <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> .
Later in the disease , symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> appeared , and <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> occured terminally .
The most recently affected family member was investigated biochemically late in his illness .
Concentrations of taurine were greatly diminished in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid , and at autopsy , all regions of brain examined had a markedly reduced taurine content .
Since taurine is a putative inhibitory synaptic transmitter , deficiency of brain taurine may possibly have caused the psychiatric and neurological manifestations of this disorder .
Eyelid abnormalities in lamellar ichthyoses .
To describe eyelid abnormalities in lamellar ichthyoses ( LI ) .
Retrospective observational case series .
Eight patients with classic LI and two patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma <END> .
Results of eyelid and corneal examinations of 10 patients with LI were reviewed and analyzed with emphasis on the relationship between eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> ectropion <END> and corneal damage .
All patients presented with cicatricial lagophthalmos .
Of the eight patients with classic LI , five had <START:PHENOTYPE> ectropion <END> of the four eyelids , one had only lower <START:PHENOTYPE> ectropion <END> , and two had no degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> ectropion <END> .
Two patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma <END> had distinct eyelid abnormalities , including madarosis and eyelash retraction .
Loss of vision caused by corneal damage was found in three patients with classic LI . Of these three patients , two did not have upper eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> ectropion <END> .
Severe corneal damage can occur in LI even if there is no upper or lower eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> ectropion <END> .
Strong association of de novo copy number mutations with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Schizophrenia <END> is an etiologically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> psychiatric disease , which exists in familial and nonfamilial ( sporadic ) forms .
Here , we examine the possibility that rare de novo copy number ( CN ) mutations with relatively high penetrance contribute to the genetic component of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
We carried out a whole-genome scan and implemented a number of steps for finding and confirming CN mutations .
Confirmed de novo mutations were significantly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ( P = 0.00078 ) and were collectively approximately 8 times more frequent in sporadic ( but not familial ) cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> than in unaffected controls .
In comparison , rare inherited CN mutations were only modestly enriched in sporadic cases .
Our results suggest that rare de novo germline mutations contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> vulnerability in sporadic cases and that rare genetic lesions at many different loci can account , at least in part , for the <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> of this disease .
X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( SPG2 ) : <START:PHENOTYPE> clinical heterogeneity <END> at a single gene locus .
X linked hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> is a rare condition that has been divided into two forms ( the pure spastic form and the complicated form ) as a function of clinical course and severity .
A gene for pure hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( SPG2 ) has been mapped to the proximal long arm of the X chromosome ( Xq21 ) by linkage to the DXS17 locus , while a gene for a complicated form of the disease has been mapped to the distal long arm by linkage to the DXS52 locus ( Xq28 ) .
Here we report on the mapping of a gene for complicated hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> to the Xq21 region by linkage to the probe S9 at the DXS17 locus ( Z = 5 at theta = 0.04 ) in a three generation pedigree .
Multipoint linkage analysis supports the distal location of the disease gene with respect to the DXYS1- DXS17 block ( cen-DXYS1- DXS3-DXS17- SPG2-tel ) .
The observation of a complicated form of <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> mapping to Xq21 raises the difficult issue of variable phenotypic expression , allelic heterogeneity , or even close proximity of two genes for hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> in this region .
However , since our study provides clinical evidence for intrafamilial heterogeneity in complicated X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> , the present data support the hypothesis of variable clinical expression of a single gene at the SPG2 locus , as previously suggested for SPG1 .
Finally , we report here what we believe to be the first evidence of clinical expression in heterozygous carriers , a feature that is relevant to genetic counselling in at risk females .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 1 in Southern Italy : late onset and variable phenotype .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 1 ( AOA1 ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> , and peripheral neuropathy.
The causative gene ( APTX ) has been recently identified in Portuguese and Japanese kindreds .
Three patients with AOA1 were identified in an APTX mutation screening on 28 Southern Italian patients with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and peripheral neuropathy.
A novel homozygous missense mutation ( H201Q ) was found in one patient and a Japanese missense mutation ( P206L ) in two .
AOA1 clinical heterogeneity and onset later than previously described are shown .
A longitudinal study of visual function in carriers of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
This study was carried out to evaluate the progression of visual function impairment in carriers of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
We also assessed the relationship between the retinal findings at presentation and the extent of deterioration .
Observational , retrospective , case series .
Twenty-seven carriers of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
Each carrier was clinically categorized into one of four grades ( grades 0 through 3 ) depending on the presence or absence of a tapetal-like retinal reflex and the extent of peripheral pigmentary degeneration .
A complete ophthalmologic examination was performed and data for visual acuity , visual field area , and electroretinographic measurements were collected on the most recent visit in both eyes .
These were then compared with similar data obtained on their initial visits .
A comparison of visual function was carried out between the initial visit and the most recent visit on each carrier .
The visual acuity was measured with Snellen 's acuity charts .
The visual fields to targets V-4-e and II-4-e were planimeterized and used for the analysis .
The electroretinographic ( ERG ) measures used were light-adapted single-flash b-wave amplitudes and 30-Hz red flicker for cone function , dark-adapted maximal b-wave amplitudes , and response to a low intensity blue-flash for rod function .
None of the 11 carriers with a tapetal-like reflex only ( grade 1 ) showed any significant change in visual acuity or fields as compared with 3 of 7 ( 43% ) carriers with diffuse peripheral pigmentary findings ( grade 3 ) who showed significant deterioration in visual acuity in at least one eye , and 6 of 7 ( 86% ) who showed a significant decrease in visual field area with at least one target size in at least one eye .
By comparison , only 1 of 10 carriers with a grade 1 fundus finding demonstrated a significant decrease in maximal dark-adapted ERG function as compared with 5 of 6 ( 83% ) carriers with grade 3 in response to a single-flash stimulus and with 4 of 5 (8 0% ) carriers in response to a single-flash blue stimulus .
For the single-flash photopic response , none of the 10 carriers with grade 1 showed any significant deterioration , whereas 2 of 4 (5 0% ) with grade 3 did show such deterioration .
The ERG responses for carriers with grade 2 were in between the extent of decrease in ERG amplitudes of those in carriers with grades 1 and 3 . In our cohort of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> carriers , those with only a tapetal-like retinal reflex at presentation had a better prognosis to retain visual function than those with peripheral retinal pigmentation .
These data are useful in counseling such carriers as to their visual prognosis .
Fitzsimmons syndrome : spastic paraplegia , brachydactyly and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> .
Fitzsimmons syndrome is an infrequently described entity comprising slowly <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive spastic paraplegia <END> , brachydactyly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cone-shaped epiphyses <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , and low-normal intelligence .
Five patients with this syndrome have been reported .
The cause remains unknown .
Here we describe a 16-year-old boy with Fitzsimmons syndrome .
He was noted to toe-walk at age 18 months and spasticity progressed slowly into a spastic gait with contractures .
He has mild <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypernasal speech <END> .
Brachydactyly is notable but cannot be classified into one of the recognized types .
A <START:PHENOTYPE> cone-shaped epiphysis <END> was apparent on the only available childhood radiograph .
He has moderate cognitive handicap and pervasive <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
A detailed comparison of this patient with the earlier described cases is presented to further delineate the condition and increase awareness of this syndrome .
Acetazolamide-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> congenita .
We have studied 14 patients from a kindred with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> , with features differing from most cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> or recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> congenita .
All patients had painful <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle stiffness <END> that was provoked by fasting and oral potassium administration and was relieved by carbohydrate-containing foods .
Muscle biopsies showed the presence of type 1 , 2A , and 2B fibers , as opposed to the absence of type 2B fibers seen in some patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> congenita .
Acetazolamide was dramatically effective in alleviating <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> in all patients and was more effective than other antimyotonic agents .
Clinical phenotype of desmosterolosis .
We describe a child with lethal multiple malformations and generalised accumulation of desmosterol .
The infant had <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thick alveolar ridges <END> , gingival nodules , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> , short limbs , and generalised <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosclerosis <END> .
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated an abnormal accumulation of desmosterol in kidney , liver .
and brain .
Higher than normal levels of the same sterol were detected in plasma samples obtained from both parents .
The biochemical phenotype in this infant is highly suggestive of a novel inborn error of cholesterol biosynthesis caused by an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> deficiency of 3betahydroxysterol-delta24- reductase .
A phenotypic overlap of this case with Raine syndrome was noted ; however , desmosterol accumulation was not found on postmortem tissue samples from a previously reported case of this disorder .
Prediction of familial predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinoblastoma <END> is a childhood cancer , predisposition to which is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
We used restriction-fragment-length and isozymic alleles of loci on chromosome 13 in five families predisposed to <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , to provide identification before illness of persons likely to have tumors .
The likelihood of disease was predicted in two cases , and freedom from disease in three .
The calculated predictive accuracy was greater than 94 percent in cases with informative loci flanking the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( RB1 ) locus , and our prediction has been fulfilled in each such instance .
A case that was informative at several loci indicated the occurrence of meiotic recombination , and accurate prediction was based on data obtained with DNA markers and isozymic forms of esterase D .
The calculated predictive accuracy in another case , which was informative only for loci distal to the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> locus , was about 70 percent .
This patient was expected to acquire the disease but had not done so at the age of one year , illustrating the need for more markers that are also more informative and genetically closer to the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> locus .
These studies provide the basis for prenatal and postnatal prediction of susceptibility to inherited cancer using arbitrary recombinant DNA markers .
Such predictions should make genetic counseling for familial <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> more accurate and lead to earlier tumor detection and more effective therapy .
Primordial birdheaded nanism associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive ataxia <END> , early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistant diabetes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> primary gonadal insufficiency <END> .
A new syndrome .
A new syndrome in two siblings with primordial birdheaded nanism , <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> primary gonadal insufficiency <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistant diabetes mellitus <END> is presented .
Plasma concentrations of TSH , PTH , LH , FSH , ACTH , glucagon and insulin all working through cell membrane receptors were elevated .
A generalized cell membrane defect was suggested to be the pathophysiological abnormality in these patients .
Molecular analysis of the inheritance of phenylketonuria and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphenylalaninemia <END> in families with both disorders .
Clinical phenylketonuria and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphenylalaninemia <END> represent two different phenotypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency <END> .
To determine the genetic relation between these two phenotypes , we studied two families in which one member had phenylketonuria and other members had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphenylalaninemia <END> .
We identified restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms that differentiated the four phenylalanine hydroxylase alleles in each family .
Phenylketonuria and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphenylalaninemia <END> were found to be allelic ; certain pairs of alleles induced the more severe phenylketonuria phenotype , and other pairs induced the less severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphenylalaninemia <END> phenotype .
Several of the alleles that were identified can contribute to either phenylketonuria or mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphenylalaninemia <END> .
These results demonstrate that there are multiple and distinct mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene , with different levels of severity , and that various combinations of the mutant alleles can result in different phenotypes of the metabolic disorders of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphenylalaninemia <END> .
Refinement of cortical dysgeneses spectrum associated with TUBA1A mutations .
We have recently shown that de novo mutations in the TUBA1A gene are responsible for a wide spectrum of neuronal migration disorders .
To better define the range of these abnormalities , we searched for additional mutations in a cohort of 100 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> spectrum for whom no mutation was identified in DCX , LIS1 and ARX genes and compared these data to five previously described patients with TUBA1A mutations .
We detected de novo TUBA1A mutations in six patients and highlight the existence of a prominent form of TUBA1A related <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
In four patients , the mutations identified , c.1190T> C ( p.L397P ) , c.1265 G >A ( p.R422H) , c.1264 C> T ( p.R422C) , c.1306G>T ( p.G436R ) , have not been reported before and in two others , the mutation corresponds to a recurrent missense mutation , c.79 0C> T ( p.R264C ) , likely to be a hot spot of mutation .
All together , it emerges that the TUBA1A related <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> spectrum ranges from perisylvian <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> , in the less severe form , to posteriorly predominant <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> in the most severe , associated with dysgenesis of the anterior limb of the internal capsule and mild to severe cerebellar hypoplasia .
When compared with a large series of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> of other origins ( ILS17 , ILSX or unknown origin) , these features appear to be specific to TUBA1A related <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
In addition , TUBA1A mutated patients share a common clinical phenotype that consists of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , mental retardation and diplegia/tetraplegia .
Our data highlight the presence of consistent and specific abnormalities that should allow the differentiation of TUBA1A related lissencephalies from those related to LIS1 , DCX and ARX genes .
Familial idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
Evidence of lung inflammation in unaffected family members .
We evaluated 17 clinically unaffected members of three families with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> for evidence of alveolar inflammation .
Each person in the study was examined by gallium-67 scanning for a general estimate of pulmonary inflammation , and by bronchoalveolar lavage for characterization of the types of recovered cells and their state of activation .
Eight of the 17 subjects had evidence of alveolar inflammation on the lavage studies .
Supporting data included increased numbers of neutrophils and activated macrophages that released one or more neutrophil chemoattractants , and growth factors for lung fibroblasts--findings similar to those observed in patients with overt idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
Four of these eight also had a positive gallium scan ; in all the other clinically unaffected subjects the scan was normal .
During a follow-up of two to four years in seven of the eight subjects who had evidence of inflammation , no clinical evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> has appeared .
These results indicate that alveolar inflammation occurs in approximately half the clinically unaffected family members at risk of inheriting <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
Whether these persons with evidence of pulmonary inflammation but no fibrosis will proceed to have clinically evident <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> is not yet known .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> : linkage to Xp22.3 . <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> with late-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> ( OASD ) is an autonomous disorder that poses significant clinical problems , causing affected individuals to be blind and deaf by early middle age .
Classical <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> ( without deafness ; OA1 ) has recently been linked to markers in the Xp22.2-Xp22.3 region of the human genome .
In the present report , a large South African family with OASD was investigated at the molecular level and tight linkage was found to the DXS452 locus at Xp22.3 using 25 informative meioses , with a maximum lod score of 7. 1 at a recombination fraction of 0.00 . These findings suggest that OA1 and OASD are allelic variants or that they may be due to contiguous gene defects .
" New " <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and syndactyly .
We describe a girl with an unusual form of <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> .
She was mildly mentally retarded , had normal height , weight , and head circumference , a large <START:PHENOTYPE> scalp defect <END> , a peculiar face with large palpebral fissures , a <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> and constantly <START:PHENOTYPE> open mouth <END> , abnormally-modeled ears , syndactyly of fingers/toes , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypohidrosis <END> , and severe onychogryposis .
Her hair was short , abundant , and stiff , her eyebrows were sparse , and her skin was dry .
Analysis of the literature showed that this type of association of <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> and other defects has not been previously described .
Number of people with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> worldwide .
To estimate the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> among people worldwide .
Available published data on <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> prevalence were reviewed to determine the relation of open angle and angle closure <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> with age in people of European , African , and Asian origin .
A comparison was made with estimated world population data for the year 2000 .
The number of people with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in the world by the year 2000 is estimated at nearly 66 .8 million , with 6.7 million suffering from bilateral blindness .
In developed countries , fewer than 5 0 % of those with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> are aware of their disease .
In the developing world , the rate of known disease is even lower .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Glaucoma <END> is the second leading cause of vision loss in the world .
Improved methods of screening and therapy for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> are urgently needed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Direct hyperbilirubinemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> : a new presentation of Jeune syndrome ( asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy ) .
Jeune syndrome ( asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> skeletal dysplasia with multisystem involvement .
The disorder is usually considered lethal , with death resulting from <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory insufficiency <END> during infancy , or from <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> during childhood .
Hepatic dysfunction , diagnosed on the basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> direct hyperbilirubinemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> , led to early diagnosis of Jeune syndrome in a newborn infant .
Review of the literature indicates that the specific pathologic lesion ( biliary dysgenesis with portal fibrosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> bile duct proliferation <END> ) has been observed as an incidental finding at autopsy , but that clinically significant liver dysfunction has not been appreciated as an important manifestation in this disorder .
The characteristic histopathologic abnormality has been present in every patient studied , and may advance during infancy ; in contrast , clinical liver dysfunction resolves over the first few months of life .
Whereas many patients with Jeune syndrome die early , several have survived into adolescence , suggesting that aggressive treatment is appropriate , especially for those with minimal respiratory and renal involvement .
Longitudinal evaluation of liver function and pathology in these survivors is needed to define the long-term prognosis .
A distinctive <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> vacuolar neuromyopathy linked to 19p13 . To characterize a kindred with a distinctive <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> neuromuscular disorder .
The authors studied a large Italian family affected by a progressive neuromyopathy.
Ten individuals over three generations were affected .
The disease was characterized by onset from the late teens to early 50s with distal leg weakness and atrophy , development of generalized muscle weakness with distal-to-proximal progression sparing facial and ocular muscles , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphonia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> and areflexia , variable clinical expression ranging from subclinical myopathy to severely disabling weakness , and mixed neurogenic and myopathic abnormalities on electromyography.
Morphologic , immunocytochemical , and ultrastructural studies were performed in muscle biopsies from three affected patients .
A genomewide linkage analysis through the genotyping of 292 microsatellite markers spanning the 22 autosomes was undertaken to map the disorder segregating in this family .
All muscle biopsies showed variation of fiber size , panesterase-positive angular fibers , mild to severe fibrosis , and numerous "rimmed vacuoles. "
Electron microscopy failed to demonstrate the nuclear or cytoplasmic filamentous inclusions specific of inclusion-body myopathies and , accordingly , immunohistochemistry did not show any positivity with SMI-31 antibodies detecting hyperphosphorylated tau .
Preliminary analysis of 292 microsatellite markers provided evidence for linkage to chromosome 19p13 .
This distinctive <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder is characterized by a vacuolar neuromyopathy.
Localization to chromosome 19p13 will allow the genetic relationship between this disease and inherited myopathies with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> , in particular <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> inclusion-body myopathies , to be defined .
Al-Aqeel Sewairi syndrome , a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder with multicentric osteolysis , nodulosis and arthropathy.
The first genetic defect of matrix metalloproteinase 2 gene .
We report a distinctive <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> multicentric osteolysis in Saudi Arabian families with distal arthropathy of the metacarpal , metatarsal and interphalangeal joints , with ultimate progression to the proximal joints with decreased range of movements and deformities with ankylosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized osteopenia <END> .
In addition , they had large , painful to touch palmar and plantar pads .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hirsutism <END> and mild dysmorphic facial features including <START:PHENOTYPE> proptosis <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bulbous nose <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
Using a genome-wide search for microsatellite markers from 11 members of the family from the Armed Forces Hospital and King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre , Riyadh , Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , localized the disease gene to chromosome 16q12-21 .
Haplotype analysis with additional markers narrowed the critical region to 1.2cM and identified the matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( MMP-2) , ( gelatinase A , collagenase type IV , EC 3.4 , 24,24) gene as a disease candidate at Mount Sinai School of Medicine , New York , United States of America in April 2000 .
Some affected individuals were homoallelic for a nonsense mutation ( TC A>TAA ) in codon 244 of exon 5 , predicting the replacement of a tyrosine residue by a stop codon in the first fibronectin type II domain ( Y244X ) . Other affected members had a missense mutation in exon 2 arginine 101-histidine ( R101H ) leading to no MMP-2 enzyme activity in serum or fibroblast or both of affected individuals .
In other affected members , a non-pathogenic homoallelic GT transversion resulted in the substitution of an aspartate with a tyrosine residue in codon 210 of exon 4 ( D210Y ) .
The MMP-2-null mouse has no developmental defects , but are small , which may reflect genetic redundancy .
The discovery that deficiency of this well-characterized gelatinase/collagenase results in an inherited form of an osteolytic and arthritic disorder provides an invaluable insights for the understanding of osteolysis and arthritis and is the first genetic evidence that MMP2 deficiency is important in growth and development .
NPHS2 , encoding the glomerular protein podocin , is mutated in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> steroid-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Familial idiopathic nephrotic syndromes represent a heterogeneous group of kidney disorders , and include <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> steroid-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> , which is characterized by early childhood onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rapid progression <END> to <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal disease <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> .
A causative gene for this disease , NPHS2 , was mapped to 1q25-31 and we report here its identification by positional cloning .
NPHS2 is almost exclusively expressed in the podocytes of fetal and mature kidney glomeruli , and encodes a new integral membrane protein , podocin , belonging to the stomatin protein family .
We found ten different NPHS2 mutations , comprising nonsense , frameshift and missense mutations , to segregate with the disease , demonstrating a crucial role for podocin in the function of the glomerular filtration barrier .
Further delineation of the phenotype associated with heterozygous mutations in ZFHX1B .
Mutations or deletions involving ZFHX1B ( previously SIP1 ) have recently been found to cause one form of syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> ( HSCR) , associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and distinctive facial features .
Patients with the characteristic facial phenotype and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , but without HSCR , have now also been shown to have mutations in this gene .
Mutations of ZFHX1B are frequently associated with other congenital anomalies , including congenital heart disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , renal tract anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ( ACC ) .
We present the clinical data and mutation analysis results from a series of 23 patients with this clinical syndrome , of whom 21 have proven ZFHX1B mutations or deletions ( 15 previously unpublished ) .
Two patients with the typical features ( one with and one without HSCR ) did not have detectable abnormalities of ZFHX1B .
We emphasize that this syndrome can be recognized by the facial phenotype in the absence of either HSCR or other congenital anomalies , and needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of dysmorphism with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> +/- <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .

Distinct , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia segregating in an inbred Pakistani kindred .
We describe a large inbred kindred from a remote area of Pakistan , comprising eight generations , with a distinct form of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia ( SEMD ) .
We evaluated 16 affected individuals : 11 males and 5 females . Analysis of the pedigree strongly suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> , and consanguineous loops could account for all the affected individuals being homozygous for the abnormal allele .
The clinical findings included <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> evident at birth , short <START:PHENOTYPE> bowed lower limbs <END> , mild brachydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , an abnormal gait , enlarged knee joints , precocious osteoarthropathy , and normal intelligence .
Radiographs demonstrated delayed epiphyseal ossification at the hips and knees , <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> irregular end plates <END> and narrowed joint spaces , diffuse , early osteoarthritic changes , primarily in the spine and hands , and mild brachydactyly .
Mild metaphyseal abnormalities were seen predominantly at hips and knees .
This distinctive phenotype is distinct from other <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> forms of SEMD because of the mild degree of metaphyseal involvement , the type of brachydactyly , and the absence of loose joints or other clinical findings .
Familial leucine-sensitive <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> of infancy due to a dominant mutation of the beta-cell sulfonylurea receptor .
Familial leucine-sensitive <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> of infancy was described in 1956 as a condition in which symptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> was provoked by protein meals or the amino acid , leucine .
The purpose of this study was to determine the genetic basis for <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> in a family diagnosed with leucine-sensitive <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> in 196 0 .
Recently diagnosed family members showed a dominantly transmitted pattern of diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinism ( HI ) .
However , they did not fit the characteristics of HI caused by glutamate dehydrogenase gene mutations , previously felt to explain leucine-sensitive <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> .
Islet function was examined using acute insulin response ( AIR) tests to calcium , leucine , glucose , and tolbutamide as well as oral protein tolerance tests .
Five of five affected family members showed an abnormal positive calcium AIR , and two of five showed a positive leucine AIR. Protein-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> was demonstrated in five of six affected subjects .
Mutation analysis of four known HI genes ( sulfonylurea receptor 1 , Kir6.2 , glutamate dehydrogenase , and glucokinase ) in family members identified an R1353H missense mutation in exon 33 of SUR1 .
( 86 ) Rb(+ ) efflux and electrophysiological studies of R1353H SUR1 coexpressed with wild-type Kir6.2 in COSm6 cells demonstrated partially impaired ATP-dependent potassium channel function .
Leucine-sensitive <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> in this family was found to result from a dominantly expressed SUR1 mutation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myopathy <END> phenotype in transgenic mice expressing mutated PABPN1 as a model of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy ( OPMD ) is a late-onset disorder characterized clinically by <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> limb weakness <END> , and by unique intranuclear inclusions in the skeletal muscle fibers .
The disease is caused by the expansion of a 10-alanine stretch to 12-17 alanine residues in the poly(A )-binding protein , nuclear 1 ( PABPN1 ; PABP2 ) .
While PABPN1 is a major component of the inclusions in OPMD , the exact cause of the disease is unknown .
To elucidate the molecular mechanism and to construct a useful model for therapeutic trials , we have generated transgenic mice expressing the hPABPN1 .
Transgenic mice lines expressing a normal hPABPN1 with 10-alanine stretch did not reveal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathic changes <END> , whereas lines expressing high levels of expanded hPABPN1 with a 13-alanine stretch showed an apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> phenotype , especially in old age .
Pathological studies in the latter mice disclosed intranuclear inclusions consisting of aggregated mutant hPABPN1 product .
Furthermore , some TUNEL positive nuclei were shown around degenerating fibers and a cluster of it in the lesion in necrotic muscle fibers .
Interestingly , the degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathic changes <END> was more prominent in the eyelid and pharyngeal muscles .
Further , muscle weakness in the limbs was apparent as shown by the fatigability test .
Nuclear inclusions seemed to develop gradually with aging , at least after 1 week of age , in model mouse muscles .
We established the first transgenic mouse model of OPMD by expressing mutated PABPN1 , and our model mice appear to have more dramatic alternations in myofiber viability .
A novel heterozygous mutation in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma gene in a patient with familial partial lipodystrophy.
Familial partial lipodystrophies ( FPL ) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders characterized by marked loss of subcutaneous ( sc ) fat from the extremities .
Affected individuals show an increased preponderance of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslipidemia <END> .
Recently , lamin A/ C gene mutations were found in patients with FPL , Dunnigan variety .
However , the genetic basis of other phenotypes remains unknown .
We studied peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) gene as a candidate gene in seven FPL patients who did not appear to have Dunnigan variety .
Analysis of the coding region of PPARG revealed C to T heterozygous mutation at nucleotide 1273 in exon 6 which changes a highly conserved residue , arginine at position 425 to cysteine ( R425C ) in the patient FX200.21 .
The patient is a 64-year-old nonHispanic white woman who developed <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> at age 32 years and <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> of the extremities and face at age 50 years .
She also had <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> .
Anthropometry and whole body magnetic resonance imaging revealed marked loss of sc fat particularly from the extremities but sc truncal fat was slightly increased .
None of the four unaffected family members harbored the mutation .
We conclude that heterozygous , R425C , mutation in PPARG could be the molecular basis for one of the familial partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> phenotypes .
Oculofaciocardiodental and Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndromes result from distinct classes of mutations in BCOR .
Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern and comprises <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , mental retardation , and skeletal and other anomalies .
Two loci associated with this syndrome , MAA ( <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> with associated anomalies ) and MAA2 , are situated respectively at Xq27-q28 ( refs . 1 ,2 ) and Xp11 .4-p21.2 ( ref . 3 ) .
We identified a substitution , nt 254 C-->T; P85L , in BCOR (encoding BCL-6-interacting corepressor , BCOR ) in affected males from the family with Lenz syndrome previously used to identify the MAA2 locus .
Oculofaciocardiodental syndrome ( OFCD ; OMIM 300166 ) is inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> pattern with presumed male lethality and comprises <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , radiculomegaly , and cardiac and digital abnormalities .
Given their phenotypic overlap , we proposed that OFCD and MAA2-associated Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> were allelic , and we found different frameshift , deletion and nonsense mutations in BCOR in seven families affected with OFCD .
Like wild-type BCOR , BCOR P85L and an OFCD-mutant form of BCOR can interact with BCL-6 and efficiently repress transcription .
This indicates that these syndromes are likely to result from defects in alternative functions of BCOR , such as interactions with transcriptional partners other than BCL-6 .
We cloned the zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) ortholog of BCOR and found that knock-down of this ortholog caused developmental perturbations of the eye , skeleton and central nervous system consistent with the human syndromes , confirming that BCOR is a key transcriptional regulator during early embryogenesis .
Two sisters with Toriello-Carey syndrome .
Toriello-Carey syndrome comprises <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Robin sequence <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormally shaped ears <END> , cardiac defect , and hypotonia .
We describe two Japanese sisters with a Toriello-Carey syndrome whose phenotypes were as severe as reported male cases .
The younger sister died suddenly at age 4 months .
Our patients with a severe phenotype and possible parental consanguinity suggest <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> of Toriello-Carey syndrome .

Prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> Celiac disease <END> among children in Finland .
Wheat , rye , and barley proteins induce <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> , an autoimmune type of gastrointestinal disorder , in genetically susceptible persons .
Because the disease may be underdiagnosed , we estimated the prevalence of the disease and tested the hypothesis that assays for serum autoantibodies can be used to detect untreated <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> and that positive findings correlate with specific HLA haplotypes .
Serum samples were collected from 3654 students ( age range , 7 to 16 years ) in 1994 and screened in 2001 for endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies .
HLA typing was also performed on stored blood samples .
All antibody-positive subjects were asked to undergo small-bowel biopsy in 2001 .
Of the 3654 subjects , 56 ( 1.5 percent ) had positive antibody tests , as determined in 2001 .
Results of the two antibody tests were highly concordant .
As of 1994 , none of the subjects had received a clinical diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> , but 10 who had positive tests for both antibodies in serum obtained in 1994 received the diagnosis between 1994 and 2001 .
Of the 36 other subjects with positive antibody assays who agreed to undergo biopsy in 2001 , 27 had evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> on biopsy .
Thus , the estimated biopsy-proved prevalence was 1 case in 99 children .
All but two of the antibody-positive subjects had either the HLA-DQ2 or the HLA-DQ8 haplotype .
The prevalence of the combination of antibody positivity and an HLA haplotype associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> was 1 in 67 .
The presence of serum tissue transglutaminase and endomysial autoantibodies is predictive of small-bowel abnormalities indicative of <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> .
There is a good correlation between autoantibody positivity and specific HLA haplotypes .
We estimate that the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> celiac disease <END> among Finnish schoolchildren is at least 1 case in 99 children .

Acro-renal-ocular syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> thumb hypoplasia <END> , renal ectopia , and eye defect .
Seven individuals from 3 generations of a French-Canadian family had various combinations of acral , renal , and ocular defects .
Acral anomalies varied from mild hypoplastic distal portion of the thumbs , with limited motion at IP joint , to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> thumb hypoplasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> preaxial polydactyly <END> .
Renal anomalies varied from mild malrotation to crossed renal ectopia without fusion ; other urinary tract anomalies were <START:PHENOTYPE> vesicoureteral reflux <END> and bladder diverticula .
Ocular manifestations varied from complete eye coloboma , coloboma of the optic nerve , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Duane anomaly <END> .
The syndrome seems to be an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait with high penetrance and variable expressivity .
Dermatoglyphics were abnormal; in addition to a triradius t ' present in all , some also had various combinations of high TRC , thenar exit of A line , and rare patterns in interdigital area IV.
A syndrome of hypogonadism , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , and ECG abnormalities .
A distinct and previously undescribed syndrome has been observed in six Saudi Arabian patients from two highly inbred families .
The parents were normal , indicating an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> pattern of inheritance .
All the patients have a distinctive facial appearance , hypogonadism , sparse or absent hair , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , and variable S-T and T wave abnormalities on the electrocardiograph .
Tbx22null mice have a submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> due to reduced palatal bone formation and also display <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> and choanal atresia phenotypes .
Craniofacial defects involving the lip and/or palate are among the most common human birth defects .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> results from loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the T-box transcription factor TBX22 .
Further studies show that TBX22 mutations are also found in around 5 % of non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> patients .
Although palate defects are obvious at birth , the underlying developmental pathogenesis remains unclear .
Here , we report a Tbx22(null ) mouse , which has a submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ( SMCP ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> , similar to the human phenotype , with a small minority showing overt clefts .
We also find persistent oro-nasal membranes or , in some mice a partial rupture , resulting in choanal atresia .
Each of these defects can cause severe breathing and/or feeding difficulties in the newborn pups , which results in approximately 5 0 % post-natal lethality .
Analysis of the craniofacial skeleton demonstrates a marked reduction in bone formation in the posterior hard palate , resulting in the classic notch associated with SMCP .
Our results suggest that Tbx22 plays an important role in the osteogenic patterning of the posterior hard palate .
Ossification is severely reduced after condensation of the palatal mesenchyme , resulting from a delay in the maturation of osteoblasts .
Rather than having a major role in palatal shelf closure , we show that Tbx22 is an important determinant for intramembranous bone formation in the posterior hard palate , which underpins normal palate development and function .
These findings could have important implications for the molecular diagnosis in patients with isolated SMCP and/or unexplained choanal atresia .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental deficiency <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoparathyroidism <END> type I is associated with Ns-protein deficiency .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pseudohypoparathyroidism <END> type I is a hereditary disorder characterized by resistance to parathyroid hormone and other hormones that work via cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5 ' -monophosphate ( cAMP ) .
Most patients with this disorder have generalized deficient activity of Ns-protein ( type Ia) , which couples stimulatory hormone receptors to catalytic adenylate cyclase .
In patients with normal Ns-protein activity ( type Ib) , a decreased incidence of resistance to hormones other than parathyroid hormone exists .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental deficiency <END> of unknown cause occurs in 47 % to 75 % of all patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoparathyroidism <END> type I . Because mutations in the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system may affect the learning ability of Drosophila flies , we assessed <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deficiency <END> in 25 patients whose Ns-protein activity we had determined : 9 of 14 patients with type Ia disorder and 0 of 11 patients with type Ib disorder had <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deficiency <END> .
We suggest that Ns-protein deficiency , reduced cAMP levels , or both , are involved in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deficiency <END> in these patients and probably in mental function in humans .
Evidence for a role of the NOS1AP ( CAPON ) gene in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and its clinical dimensions : an association study in a South American population isolate .
Recent studies have implicated a region on chromosome 1q21-23 , including the NOS1AP gene , in susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
However , replication studies have been inconsistent , a fact that could partly relate to the marked psychopathological <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
The aim of this study is to evaluate association of polymorphisms in the NOS1AP gene region to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , in patients from a South American population isolate , and to assess if these variants are associated with specific clinical dimensions of the disorder .
We genotyped 24 densely spaced SNPs in the NOS1AP gene region in a <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> trio sample .
The transmission disequilibrium test ( TDT) was applied to single marker and haplotype data .
Association to clinical dimensions ( identified by factor analysis ) was evaluated using a quantitative transmission disequilibrium test ( QTDT) .
We found significant association between eight SNPs in the NOS1AP gene region to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ( minimum p value = 0.004 ) .
The QTDT analysis of clinical dimensions revealed an association to a dimension consisting mainly of negative symptoms ( minimum p value 0.001 ) .
Our findings are consistent with a role for NOS1AP in susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , especially for the 'negative syndrome ' of the disorder .
Gene locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> maps to chromosome 9 . Distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> muscular disorder , characterized clinically by weakness of the distal muscles in the lower limbs in early adulthood .
Recently , the gene locus for familial vacuolar myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> ( hereditary inclusion body myopathy ) was mapped to chromosome 9 by genome-wide linkage analysis of nine Persian-Jewish families .
Since both disease conditions share similar clinical , genetic , and histopathological features , we analyzed seven families with distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> using ten microsatellite markers within the region of the hereditary inclusion body myopathy locus .
Significantly high cumulative pairwise lod scores were obtained with three markers : D9S248 ( Z(max ) = 5 .90 at theta = 0) , D9S43 ( Z(max ) = 5.25 at theta = 0) , and D9S50 ( Z(max ) = 4.23 at theta = 0 ) . Detection of obligate recombination events as well as multipoint linkage analysis revealed that the most likely location of the distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> gene is in a 23.3-cM interval defined by D9S319 and D9S276 on chromosome 9 .
The results raise the possibility that distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> and hereditary inclusion body myopathy in Persian Jews are allelic diseases .
De Barsy syndrome : a review of the phenotype .
De Barsy syndrome is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome characterised by a progeria-like appearance with distinctive facial features and <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> .
Ophthalmological , orthopaedic and neurological abnormalities are also typically present .
The syndrome was first described by de Barsy et al . in 1967 and since that time approximately 27 further cases have been reported worldwide .
We present a case that demonstrates the typical clinical and histological features of de Barsy syndrome .
A female infant , the second child of first-cousin parents from a multiply consanguineous family of Pakistani origin , presented at birth with growth retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> and a progeria-like appearance .
She had thin , overlapping fingers and <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> , blue sclerae , cloudy corneas and <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> .
She has failed to thrive and has marked <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and abnormal <START:PHENOTYPE> athetoid movements <END> .
During the first year of life she developed <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> and her facial appearance became more aged .
To our knowledge there are no previous reports of de Barsy syndrome in individuals of Pakistani origin .
Overgrowth , congenital hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> : variant of dominantly inherited Sotos sequence ?
We report on 2 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , esotropia , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , excessive size , unusual facial appearance , and improvement with age .
Many of these abnormalities are present in Sotos sequence .
The mothers of both patients share some characteristics with their children .
These patients may represent an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of Sotos sequence .
Callosal defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and other anomalies in three sibs .
This study concerns an apparently lethal and previously undescribed syndrome of hypoplastic corpus callosum , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> preauricular skin tag <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , and recurrent bronchopneumonia .
This combination of anomalies is probably inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
A brief literature review of the anomalies or syndromes associated with callosal defects is discussed .
Hypoplasia of cerebellar vermal lobules VI and VII in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> is a neurologic disorder that severely impairs social , language , and cognitive development .
Whether <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> involves maldevelopment of neuroanatomical structures is not known .
The size of the cerebellar vermis in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> was measured on magnetic resonance scans and compared with its size in controls .
The neocerebellar vermal lobules VI and VII were found to be significantly smaller in the patients .
This appeared to be a result of developmental hypoplasia rather than shrinkage or deterioration after full development had been achieved .
In contrast , the adjacent vermal lobules I to V , which are ontogenetically , developmentally , and anatomically distinct from lobules VI and VII , were found to be of normal size .
Maldevelopment of the vermal neocerebellum had occurred in both retarded and nonretarded patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
This localized maldevelopment may serve as a temporal marker to identify the events that damage the brain in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , as well as other neural structures that may be concomitantly damaged .
Our findings suggest that in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , neocerebellar abnormality may directly impair cognitive functions that some investigators have attributed to the neocerebellum ; may indirectly affect , through its connections to the brain stem , hypothalamus , and thalamus , the development and functioning of one or more systems involved in cognitive , sensory , autonomic , and motor activities ; or may occur concomitantly with damage to other neural sites whose dysfunction directly underlies the cognitive deficits in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Macroepiphyseal dysplasia with symptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> , wrinkled skin , and aged appearance : a presumed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition .
We report our detailed investigation of a 7-1/2-year-old girl with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , aged appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased subcutaneous fat <END> and muscle mass , dry <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse hair <END> , foot deformities , macroepiphyses with prominent but <START:PHENOTYPE> lax joints <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent fractures <END> who is the off-spring of first cousins .
This constellation of abnormalities differs from previously reported cases where macroepiphyses were a prominent finding .
Our patient appears , therefore , to have a new , autosomal recessively inherited , syndrome .
Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome ( with or without unilateral unsegmented bar ) .
Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> , failure of normal spinal segmentation causing symmetrical <START:PHENOTYPE> block vertebrae <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> lordosis <END> .
There is a disproportionately <START:PHENOTYPE> short trunk <END> .
Some patients have a unilateral unsegmented bar . Other skeletal changes include <START:PHENOTYPE> carpal synostosis <END> , usually capitate-hamate and lunate-triquetrum .
Tarsal synostoses were present in patients in whom the feet were radiographed .
Stature is short .
The feet are flat .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cleft palate <END> and sensorineural or <START:PHENOTYPE> mixed hearing loss <END> are variable manifestations .
We have reviewed the literature and present 6 new patients , 2 of them sibs .
Confirmation of linkage to 1q21-31 in a Danish <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> juvenile-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> family and evidence of genetic heterogeneity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> juvenile-onset open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> has been mapped to 1q21-31 in a number of American families .
Our study confirms linkage in a Danish five-generation dominant juvenile-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> family with a maximum two-point lod score of 6.67 at the D1S210 locus .
Multipoint linkage analysis in a nine-generation Swedish family with dominant juvenile-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and iris hypoplasia excludes linkage to the region of approximately 18 cM between loci D1S104 and D1S218 , shown to contain the previously mapped <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> gene .
This study thus provides support for genetic heterogeneity with respect to dominant juvenile-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Loss-of-function mutations in the PRPS1 gene cause a type of nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , DFN2 .
We report a large Chinese family with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> postlingual nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> in which the critical linkage interval spans a genetic distance of 5.41 cM and a physical distance of 15 .1 Mb that overlaps the DFN2 locus .
Mutation screening of the PRPS1 gene in this family and in the three previously reported DFN2 families identified four different missense mutations in PRPS1 .
These mutations result in a loss of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( PRPP ) synthetase 1 activity , as was shown in silico by structural analysis and was shown in vitro by enzymatic activity assays in erythrocytes and fibroblasts from patients .
By in situ hybridization , we demonstrate expression of Prps1 in murine vestibular and cochlea hair cells , with continuous expression in hair cells and postnatal expression in the spiral ganglion .
Being the second identified gene associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , PRPS1 will be a good candidate gene for genetic testing for <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> .

Mutation in the SYNJ1 gene associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> Parkinsonism <END> . <START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> , early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> Parkinsonism <END> is clinically and genetically heterogeneous .
Here , we report the identification , by homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing , of a SYNJ1 homozygous mutation ( p.Arg258 Gln ) segregating with disease in an Italian consanguineous family with <START:PHENOTYPE> Parkinsonism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , and cognitive deterioration .
Response to levodopa was poor , and limited by side effects .
Neuroimaging revealed brain atrophy , nigrostriatal dopaminergic defects , and cerebral hypometabolism .
SYNJ1 encodes synaptojanin 1 , a phosphoinositide phosphatase protein with essential roles in the postendocytic recycling of synaptic vesicles .
The mutation is absent in variation databases and in ethnically matched controls , is damaging according to all prediction programs , and replaces an amino acid that is extremely conserved in the synaptojanin 1 homologues and in SAC1-like domains of other proteins .
Sequencing the SYNJ1 ORF in unrelated patients revealed another heterozygous mutation ( p.Ser1422Arg ) , predicted as damaging , in a patient who also carries a heterozygous PINK1 truncating mutation .
The SYNJ1 gene is a compelling candidate for <START:PHENOTYPE> Parkinsonism <END> ; mutations in the functionally linked protein auxilin cause a similar early-onset phenotype , and other findings implicate endosomal dysfunctions in the pathogenesis .
Our data delineate a novel form of human Mendelian <START:PHENOTYPE> Parkinsonism <END> , and provide further evidence for abnormal synaptic vesicle recycling as a central theme in the pathogenesis .

Clinicopathological analysis of the homozygous p.W1327X AGL mutation in glycogen storage disease type 3 .
We report on clinicopathological and whole body MRI analyses of the index patient of a large nonconsanguineous German-Ukraine family with homozygous and heterozygous AGL gene mutations at position p.W1327X ( c.398 0G > A ) . There are only limited reports on this phenotype with a homozygous genotype .
The index patient , a 49-year-old woman presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> and moderate progressive proximal limb myopathy.
Skeletal muscle showed severe vacuolar <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> with storage of PAS-positive non-membrane-limited glycogen .
An increase in glycogen content and completely decrease of debranching enzyme activity was measured in erythrocytes .
Mutational analysis of the AGL gene showed a homozygous p.W1327X mutation .
In the family , two brothers had been affected by severe infantile onset <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> and died within their first years of life by fatal liver cirrhosis .
Furthermore , another sister severely affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> and proximal skeletal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> died at age 33 . Three younger heterozygous sisters and a brother noticed exercise-induced myalgia and <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> since their teens .
In sum , a homozygous p.W1327X mutation leads to a severe generalized glycogenosis types 3a and 3b within the same family .
Even heterozygous p.W1327X mutation carriers may present with mild non-progressive neuromuscular symptoms , such as exercise-induced myalgia and fatigue .

New POMT2 mutations causing congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> : identification of a founder mutation .
Dystroglycanopathies are a group of congenital muscular dystrophies ( CMDs ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> , often associated with CNS and ocular involvement .
They are characterized by the abnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan , and caused by mutations in at least six genes encoding enzymes : FKTN , POMGNT1 , POMT1 , POMT2 , FKRP , and LARGE .
POMT2 mutations have recently been identified in Walker-Warburg syndrome and in a milder muscle-eye-brain disease-like form .
We studied mentally retarded patients with CMD , analyzed POMT2 by sequencing the coding regions , and also performed a haplotype analysis in all patients and their family members carrying the new POMT2 mutation .
We report three novel POMT2 mutations .
One of these , p.Tyr666 Cys , was homozygous in two unrelated patients and in a compound heterozygous state in others .
All patients showed severe diffuse muscle weakness , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and marked lordoscoliosis with hyperextended head .
Elevated CK levels , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral cortical atrophy <END> , and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia were constant findings .
Mild cardiac abnormalities , focal white matter abnormalities , or partial <START:PHENOTYPE> corpus callosum hypoplasia <END> were detected in single cases .
Eye involvement was absent or mild .
By genotype analysis , we defined a distinct 170kb haplotype encompassing POMT2 and shared by all the subjects harboring the mutation p.Tyr666 Cys .
Our results broaden the clinical spectrum associated with POMT2 mutations , which should be considered in patients with CMD associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with or without ocular involvement .
Cerebro-ocular dysplasia-muscular dystrophy syndrome .
Report of two cases .
Cerebro-ocular dysplasia-muscular dystrophy ( COD-MD ) syndrome is a rare disorder encompassing a triad of brain , eye , and muscle abnormalities .
The principal central nervous system features are cerebral and cerebellar agyria-micropolygyria , cortical disorganization , glial-mesodermal proliferation within the leptomeninges , neuronal heterotopias , hypoplasia of nerve tracts , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , and , occasionally , encephalocele .
Ocular abnormalities include <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , immature anterior chamber angle , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dysplasia <END> with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> , persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic nerve hypoplasia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> .
Skeletal muscle findings include fiber splitting , variable fiber size , and endomysial fibrosis .
Recent evidence has shown that COD-MD syndrome may be identical to the Walker-Warburg ( also known as Warburg ) syndrome .
Fukuyama <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> is similar to the COD-MD and Walker-Warburg syndromes , although the ocular manifestations are less severe .
We report the histopathologic findings in two siblings with multiple features of COD-MD syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Adducted thumb <END> syndrome .
Report of a new case and a diagnostic approach .
We report on a female newborn baby with a " myopathic " stiff face , <START:PHENOTYPE> open mouth <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , microgenia , <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized muscular hypotonia <END> , limited extension of elbows , wrists and knees , flexed <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> velopharyngeal insufficiency <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> .
Death occurred at 3 months due to <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory insufficiency <END> .
Muscular biopsy revealed myopathic abnormalities .
Absence of PPP2R1A mutations in <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> .
Evidence from genetic linkage analysis indicates that a gene located at 19q13.4 , FWT2 , is responsible for predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> in many <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> families .
This region has also been implicated in the etiology of sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> through loss of heterozygosity analyses .
The PPP2R1A gene , encoding the alpha isoform of the heterotrimeric serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A) , is located within the FWT2 candidate region and is altered in breast and lung carcinomas .
PPP2R1B , encoding the beta isoform , is mutated in lung , colon , and breast cancers .
These findings suggested that both PPP2R1A and PPP2R1B may be tumor suppressor genes .
Additionally , PP2A is important in fetal kidney growth and differentiation and has an expression pattern similar to that of the <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> suppressor gene WT1 .
Since PPP2R1A was therefore a compelling candidate for the FWT2 gene , we analysed the coding region of PPP2R1A in DNA and RNA samples from affected members of four <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> families and 30 sporadic tumors and identified no mutations in PPP2R1A in any of these 34 samples .
We conclude that PPP2R1A is not the 19q familial <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> gene and that mutation of PPP2R1A is not a common event in the etiology of sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Piebaldism <END> : an autonomous <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Piebaldism <END> is a disorder in which the major clinical features are patchy hypopigmentation of the skin and a <START:PHENOTYPE> white forelock <END> .
The manifestations of <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> overlap with those of other genodermatoses , in particular the Waardenburg syndrome , and it is uncertain whether <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> is a distinct entity .
We have documented a family in which seven affected members in three generations have gross <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> without any additional stigmata .
The intrafamilial phenotypic consistency is suggestive that this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder has independent syndromic status .
Linkage studies using conventional gene markers failed to identity the locus of the faulty gene .
Noonan phenotype associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> .
We report on four patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> and manifestations of Noonan syndrome including <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , "midface hypoplasia, " apparently short <START:PHENOTYPE> webbed neck <END> , learning disabilities , and <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> .
No family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> was present in any case .
Average paternal and maternal age at birth was 37 and 28 years , respectively , suggestive of a new mutation .
The presence of a distinct phenotype and hypotonia in these patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> is suggestive of a new separate disorder .
A study of twins and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
Although there are strong genetic contributions to coronary artery disease , only a few studies have considered heritable influences on <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
We investigated the role of genetic factors in <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> using the Twin Registry maintained by the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council .
The registry includes 15 ,948 male twin pairs born between 1917 and 1927.
In 1985 , 9,475 twins responded to a mailed questionnaire , which covered vascular risk factors , cardiac events , and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
Analysis of twin pairs in which both responded to the questionnaire , and a question on <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> , indicated proband concordance rates of 17 .7% for monozygotic pairs and 3.6 % for dizygotic pairs ( relative risk = 4.3 ; chi 2 = 4.94 , df = 1 ; p less than 0.05 ) .
This nearly fivefold increase in the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> among the monozygotic compared with the dizygotic twin pairs suggests that genetic factors are involved in the etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
The twin study paradigm holds considerable promise for identifying both genetic and environmental influences on <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome presenting with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> colitis <END> .
A four and half-year-old girl was admitted to our clinic with the complaints of <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> since birth and <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> .
The characteristic findings in physical examination were facial dysmorphism , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> , and wooly hair .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Trichorrhexis nodosa <END> was established in microscopic hair examination .
Colonoscopy and histopathologic examination of colonic mucosa revealed mild <START:PHENOTYPE> colitis <END> .
In the light of previously published cases , this patient was accepted as a mild variant of syndromic ( phenotypic ) <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> or tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome .
We conclude that a mild phenotypic variant of this disease exists that may present with <START:PHENOTYPE> colitis <END> .
On the nosology of the " primary true <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> " association .
We describe a male child with prenatal growth retardation , true <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , pedal <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> and characteristic ocular anomalies .
Ophthalmological examination revealed remnants of the posterior hyaloidea , more pronounced in the right eye where a retinal fold extended from the papilla into the vitreum , <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal dysplasia <END> with narrow retinal vessels , multiple large round areas of chorioretinal atrophy and atrophic papillae .
The associations " Microcephaly-chorioretinal dysplasia " , " Microcephaly-retinal folds " and " Microcephaly-lymphoedema " have been reported as separate <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> conditions .
The findings in the present child suggest that these associations could be variable expressions of the same <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> condition .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and deafness ( DIDMOAD ) caused by mutations in a novel gene ( wolframin ) coding for a predicted transmembrane protein .
Wolfram syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and a number of neurological symptoms including deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and peripheral neuropathy.
Mitochondrial DNA deletions have been described in a few patients and a locus has been mapped to 4p16 by linkage analysis .
Susceptibility to psychiatric illness is reported to be high in affected individuals and increased in heterozygous carriers in Wolfram syndrome families .
We screened four candidate genes in a refined critical linkage interval covered by an unfinished genomic sequence of 600 kb .
One of these genes , subsequently named wolframin , codes for a predicted transmembrane protein which was expressed in various tissues , including brain and pancreas , and carried loss-of-function mutations in both alleles in Wolfram syndrome patients .
Two novel point mutations in the long-range SHH enhancer in three families with <START:PHENOTYPE> triphalangeal thumb <END> and preaxial polydactyly .
Spatio-temporal expression of sonic hedgehog ( SHH ) is driven by a regulatory element ( ZRS ) that lies 1 Mb upstream from SHH .
Point mutations within the highly conserved ZRS have been described in the hemimelic extra toes mouse and in four families with preaxial polydactyly [ Lettice et al. , 2003] .
Four North American Caucasian families were identified with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> triphalangeal thumb <END> .
DNA from 20 affected and 36 unaffected family members was evaluated by sequence analysis of a 774-bp highly conserved ZRS contained within LMBR1 intron 5 . Mutations within ZRS were identified in three of four families .
In pedigree A and C , a novel A/ G transition was identified near the 5 ' end of ZRS at bp 739 that segregated with disease or carrier status .
Pedigree A , described previously [Dobbs et al. , 2000] , is a large family with 19 affected members who exhibit a milder phenotype , including predominantly <START:PHENOTYPE> triphalangeal thumbs <END> and low penetrance ( 82% ) relative to other families .
Pedigree C is a small family with two affected family members with <START:PHENOTYPE> triphalangeal thumb <END> , and one affected with both <START:PHENOTYPE> triphalangeal thumb <END> and preaxial polydactyly .
A novel C/ G mutation at bp 621 was identified in pedigree B that segregated with the disease in all four affected individuals who manifested both preaxial polydactyly and <START:PHENOTYPE> triphalangeal thumb <END> .
Both mutations alter putative Cdx transcription factor binding sites .
Mutations within ZRS appear to be a common cause of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> triphalangeal thumb <END> and preaxial polydactyly .
A genotype/phenotype correlate is suggested by pedigree A , whose mutation lies near the 5 ' end of ZRS ; this family demonstrates a higher rate of nonpenetrance and milder phenotype .
However , modifier genes may be contributing to the milder phenotype in this family .

LTBP2 null mutations in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ocular syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> , spherophakia , and secondary glaucoma .
The latent TGFbeta-binding proteins ( LTBPs ) and fibrillins are a superfamily of large , multidomain proteins with structural and TGFbeta-signalling roles in the extracellular matrix .
Their importance is underscored by fibrillin-1 mutations responsible for Marfan syndrome , but their respective roles are still incompletely understood .
We report here on two families where children from healthy , consanguineous parents , presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> and impaired vision associated with small , round , <START:PHENOTYPE> dislocated lenses <END> ( microspherophakia and <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> ) and myopia , as well as a <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , and , in older children , tall stature with an abnormally large arm span over body height ratio , that is , associated features of Marfan syndrome .
Glaucoma was not present at birth , but was diagnosed in older children .
Whole genome homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene analysis identified homozygous truncating mutations of LTBP2 gene in patients from both families .
Fibroblast mRNA analysis was consistent with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay , with no evidence of mutated exon skipping .
We conclude that biallelic null LTBP2 mutations cause the ocular phenotype in both families and could lead to Marfan-like features in older children .
We suggest that intraocular pressures should be followed-up in young children with an ocular phenotype consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> , spherophakia and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> , and recommend LTBP2 gene analysis in these patients .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and psychomotor retardation in three siblings .
Three siblings , devoid of hair at birth , had an unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by universal congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , psychomotor retardation , and severe growth failure .
Metabolic and chromosome studies were normal .
Skin biopsies disclosed immature hair follicles , some of which were filled with keratotic material but had no hair shafts .
Neuropathologic features included cerebral cortical hypoplasia , neuronal depletion , and microcalcifications .
The familial occurrence of universal congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> conjoined with nonprogressive central nervous system abnormalities in this and other kindreds defines a nosologic group of neurocutaneous disorders in which congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> is the solitary cutaneous manifestation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> catecholamine- or exercise-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia : clinical features and assignment of the disease gene to chromosome 1p13-21 .
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia ( PVT) is characterized by episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden death <END> in response to physiological or emotional stress .
In 2 families with autosomal dominant inheritance , the disease gene was mapped to chromosome 1q42-43 .
The objectives of this study were to characterize the clinical features of the disease in a Bedouin tribe from Israel and to map the disease gene .
In this Bedouin tribe , 9 children ( age , 7+ /-4 years ) from 7 related families have died suddenly during the past decade , and 12 other children suffered from recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> starting at the age of 6+ /-3 years .
Parents of affected individuals were asymptomatic and were all related ( first- , second- , or third-degree cousins ) .
Segregation analysis suggested <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
All 12 symptomatic patients and 1 asymptomatic sibling ( mean age , 13+ /-7 years ) were found to have a relative resting bradycardia ( 64 + /-13 bpm , versus 93 + /-12 bpm in the unaffected siblings ) , as well as PVT induced by treadmill or isoproterenol infusion and appearing at a mean sinus rate of 11 0+/-1 0 bpm .
Patients responded favorably to treatment with beta-blockers .
A genome-wide search using polymorphic DNA markers mapped the disease locus to a 16-megabase interval on chromosome 1p13-21 .
A maximal lod score of 8.24 was obtained with D1S189 at theta= 0.00 .
Sequencing of KCND3 , a gene that encodes an I(tO ) potassium channel transporter , did not reveal any significant sequence alterations .
This unique form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> PVT affects young children and may be lethal if left untreated .
Linkage analysis maps this disorder to chromosome 1p13-21 .
A disorder of axonal development , <START:PHENOTYPE> necrotizing myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> : a new familial disease .
We report severe <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital encephalopathy <END> and profound hypotonia associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> necrotizing myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> in 3 infants , including 2 sisters . Brain scans suggested agenesis of the corpus callosum .
Neuropathological findings consisted of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> atrophy of the corpus callosum <END> ( not the usual agenesis with longitudinal callosal bundles) , atrophy of the white matter , and absence of pyramidal tracts in the medulla .
Multiple axonal swellings were present in the white matter and in Purkinje cells .
Except for the corpus subthalamicum , gray matter structures were preserved .
These findings are considered to be the expression of a primary disorder of axonal development leading to a reduction in interneuronal synaptic contacts .
It is suggested that the anomaly may be due to an extension of the normal phenomenon of axonal elimination , related to a primary defect of the axonal cytoskeleton .
The concept of a primary axonal disorder may also apply to other , mostly familial , conditions with progressive atrophy of the cerebral white matter and corpus callosum .
Association between a functional catechol O-methyltransferase gene polymorphism and <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> : meta-analysis of case-control and family-based studies .
There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , but efforts to identify susceptibility genes have been largely unsuccessful because of the low power of individual studies .
The authors ' goal was to evaluate the collective evidence for an association between the Val158 /108Met polymorphism of the catechol O-methyltransferase ( COMT) gene and <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
They performed separate meta-analyses of existing case-control and family-based association studies .
Overall , case-control studies showed no indication of an association between either allele and <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , and family-based studies found modest evidence implicating the Val allele in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> risk .
The pooled analyses of studies from diverse geographical regions may have obscured ethnic differences in patterns of genetic risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Stratification of the studies by ethnicity of the subjects yielded evidence for an association with the Val allele in case-control studies of European samples and , especially , in family-based studies of European samples .
Case-control and family-based studies of Asian samples produced mixed results and , overall , little evidence for association .
The results of the two types of association studies diverged somewhat , but the evidence from the family-based studies , although based on fewer reports , may be more accurate .
The Val allele may be a small but reliable risk factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> for people of European ancestry , but the influence of this polymorphism on risk in Asian populations remains unclear .
These results call for more family-based studies to confirm the association between COMT and <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> in European samples and to clarify its contribution to risk in Asian samples .
They also suggest that case-control studies should use methods of genomic control to avoid being confounded by population stratification .
Population-based risk estimates of Wilms tumor in sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
A comprehensive mutation screening procedure of PAX6 identifies 80% of mutations in <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Aniridia <END> is a severe eye disease characterized by iris hypoplasia ; both sporadic cases and familial cases with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> exist .
Mutations in the PAX6 gene have been shown to be the genetic cause of the disease .
Some of the sporadic cases are caused by large chromosomal deletions , some of which also include the Wilms tumor gene ( WAGR syndrome ) , resulting in an increased risk of developing Wilms tumor .
Based on the unique registration of both cancer and <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> cases in Denmark , we have made the most accurate risk estimate to date for Wilms tumor in sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
We have found that patients with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> have a relative risk of 67 ( confidence interval: 8 .1-241 ) of developing Wilms tumor .
Among patients investigated for mutations , Wilms tumor developed in only two patients out of 5 with the Wilms tumor gene ( WT1 ) deleted .
None of the patients with smaller chromosomal deletions or intragenic mutations were found to develop Wilms tumor .
Our observations suggest a smaller risk for Wilms tumor than previous estimates , and that tumor development requires deletion of WT1 .
We report a strategy for the mutational analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> cases resulting in the detection of mutations in 68 % of sporadic cases and 89% of familial cases .
We also report four novel mutations in PAX6 , and furthermore , we have discovered a new alternatively spliced form of PAX6 .
X chromosome-linked and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> gene control of Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> : evidence from segregation analysis for dependence on X chromosome inactivation . Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> ( LHON ) has been shown to involve mutation(s ) of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA , yet there remain several confusing aspects of its inheritance not explained by <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial inheritance <END> alone , including male predominance , <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced penetrance <END> , and a later age of onset in females .
By extending segregation analysis methods to disorders that involve both a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> and a nuclear gene locus , we show that the available pedigree data for LHON are most consistent with a two-locus disorder , with one responsible gene being <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> and the other nuclear and X chromosome-linked .
Furthermore , we have been able to extend the two-locus analytic method and demonstrate that a proportion of affected females are likely heterozygous at the X chromosome-linked locus and are affected due to unfortunate X chromosome inactivation , thus providing an explanation for the later age of onset in females .
The estimated penetrance for a heterozygous female is 0.11 +/- 0.02 .
The calculated frequency of the X chromosome-linked gene for LHON is 0.08 .
Among affected females , 60 % are expected to be heterozygous , and the remainder are expected to be homozygous at the responsible X chromosome-linked locus .
New clinical aspects of hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia .
Hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia ( HMD ) is a multiepithelial disorder .
It is transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait ( McKusick : Mendelian Inheritance in Man-Catalogs of <START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal Dominant <END> , Autosomal Recessive , and X-Linked Phenotypes , 8th edition .
Baltimore : The Johns Hopkins University Press , pp 499 , 1988 ) .
HMD is characterized by variable combinations of lesions of skin , hair , orificial mucosa , gingiva , eyes , and lungs .
In some previously described patients , the corneal and pulmonary lesions were progressive and led to <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent pneumonia <END> , and/or premature death .
On light microscopy , the lesion is characterized by dyskeratosis , and , on electron microscopy , by a paucity of gap junctions and desmosomes .
Here , we describe a new 5-generation kindred in which affected individuals had the same histologic characteristics but a somewhat different clinical spectrum and a more benign course .
HMD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , follicular <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconjunctivitis <END> , juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , gingival hyperemia , restrictive lung disease , and esophageal stenosis or webs .
Infantile systemic hyalinosis in siblings : clinical report , biochemical and ultrastructural findings , and review of the literature .
A boy presented at age 3.5 months with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> , restlessness , and pain on handling .
His skin was thickened and there were livid-red macular lesions over bony prominences .
Infantile systemic hyalinosis ( ISH ) was diagnosed , a presumably <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , progressive , and painful disorder of as yet unknown pathogenesis .
Observation over three years confirmed the diagnosis as typical changes , such as nodules on both ears , pearly papules in the perinasal folds and on the neck , fleshy nodules in the perianal region , and <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hypertrophy <END> , developed .
Skin lesions and painful <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> progressed in spite of intense physiotherapy , and at age 3 , the child had marked motor disability .
The central nervous system ( CNS ) appeared to be intact and the infant showed normal mental development .
Radiologic findings included marked <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized osteopenia <END> , osteolytic erosions in the metaphyses of the long bones , and cortical thinning .
Electron microscopy of two skin biopsies demonstrated deposition of floccular amorphous substance that was abundant around , and appeared to originate from , small blood vessels in the dermis , partially interfering with collagen fiber formation .
Lysosomal inclusions were not seen .
Serum acid hyaluronidase activity was within the normal range , and the synthesis of hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans in cultured skin fibroblasts was similar to that of control cells .
A younger sister presented at age two months with painful <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> and discrete livid-red macules over both malleoli , and showed a similar progression of the disorder over the first year of life .
The diagnosis of ISH should be considered in infants and children presenting with painful <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> and skin lesions .
The pathogenesis of this disabling and disfiguring disorder remains unclear .
Our data confirm probable <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> , and do not support lysosomal storage , hyaluronidase deficiency , or a primary collagen disorder , but indicate that the amorphous material accumulating in the skin and articular soft tissues may originate from the blood circulation .

Human cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> : clinical review and long-term follow-up of patients .
Human cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is a distinctive disorder of unknown cause characterized by regularly recurrent episodes of profound <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , which have a periodicity of about 3 weeks .
This periodicity remains constant and is remarkably consistent among patients .
Although blood elements other than neutrophils are nt depleted , essentially all patients experience a cycling of monocyte counts with monocyte cycles of the same length as but reciprocal to neutrophil cycles .
Cycling of platelet and reticulocyte numbers also may occur .
Patients experience a clinical syndrome of recurrent illness characterized by malaise , <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , aphthous stomatitis , and cervical adenopathy.
Incidental infections may occur with <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> but respond readily to antibiotics .
The clinical course is benign compared with others conditions in which similar degrees of <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> occur .
The only life-threatening complication encountered during long-term follow-up of patients was the occurrence of spontaneous peritonitis , segmental bowel necrosis , and septicemia which required surgical intervention .
Most patients develop the disease in childhood , but a significant number of patients develop the disease in adulthood as an apparently acquired condition .
The disease occurs equally in both sexes and is familial in some .
Studies of marrow morphology , myelopoiesis , and neotrophil kinetics have shown that cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is primarily a disease of abnormally regulated neutrophil production .
The judicious use of antibiotics , careful oral and dental care , and patient education are the mainstays of management .
Alternate-day corticosteroids have been used successfully to abate the recurrent signs and symptoms , and in one patient the disease was gradually corrected by alternate day prednisolone .
Human cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is of special investigative interest because clarification of this disease may contribute greatly to an understanding of the normal control of myelopoiesis .
A syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic renal failure <END> and XY <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadal dysgenesis <END> in young phenotypic females without genital ambiguity .
A case of XY <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadal dysgenesis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> is presented .
Diagnosis was delayed four years post renal transplantation .
A uterus , fallopian tubes , and vagina were present with a combined gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma found in the right streak gonad .
Six other similar cases have been reported , including concordance in a pair of monozygous twins .
Because of the risk of gonadal malignancy , the serum FSH concentration should be determined in phenotypic females with <START:PHENOTYPE> primary amenorrhea <END> and chronic renal disease .
Due to a physiologic reduction in the serum FSH concentration in agonadal individuals between 5 and 11 years of age , a karyotype may be required to detect affected individuals during this interval .
Gonadectomy should be performed in all cases of XY <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadal dysgenesis <END> .
A urinalysis and serum creatinine concentration should be obtained in girls presenting with XY <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadal dysgenesis <END> .
The serum FSH concentration and karyotype should be determined in females presenting with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Localization of a gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> to chromosome 15q25-q26 .
Among white adults <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> is the single most common cause of hearing impairment .
Although the genetics of this disease are controversial , the majority of studies indicate <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> with reduced penetrance .
We studied a large multi-generational family in which <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> has been inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern .
Five of16 affected persons have surgically confirmed <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> ; the remaining nine have a <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> but have not undergone corrective surgery .
To locate the disease-causing gene we completed genetic linkage analysis using short tandem repeat polymorphisms ( STRPs ) distributed over the entire genome .
Multipoint linkage analysis showed that only one genomic region , on chromosome 15q , generated a lod score >2.0 . Additional STRPs were typed in this area , resulting in a lod score of 3.4 . STRPs FES ( centromeric ) and D15S657 ( telomeric ) flank the 14 . 5 cM region that contains an <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> gene .
Identification and association of polymorphisms in the interleukin-13 gene with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and atopy in a Dutch population .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> and atopy are related conditions that may share similar genetic susceptibility .
Linkage studies have identified a region on chromosome 5q that contains biologic candidates for both <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and atopy phenotypes , including several proinflammatory cytokines .
Interleukin ( IL)-13 , one of the candidate genes in the region , is directly involved in the regulation of immunoglobulin E and has been associated with both <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and atopy .
We sought to identify new polymorphisms in the IL-13 gene , and evaluated the involvement of a subset of these variants in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and atopy in a case-control study using probands and spouses from a Dutch <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> family study .
IL-13 was sequenced in 20 probands and 20 unaffected spouses , and 10 polymorphisms were identified , four novel and six previously reported .
Three single nucleotide ( nt ) polymorphisms ( SNPs ) were detected in the 5 ' -promoter region , two in intron 1 , and five in exon 4 . Only one of the exon 4 SNPs resulted in an amino-acid change ( Arg130Gln ) .
We analyzed three SNPs in IL-13 in an extended group of 184 probands and their spouses : one in the promoter region ( -1111 ) , the Arg130Gln ( nt position 4257 ) , and a 3 ' untranslated region SNP ( nt position 4738 ) .
The most significant associations were observed to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( P = 0.005 ) , bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( P = 0.003) , and skin-test responsiveness ( P = 0.03 ) with the -1111 promoter .
These results provide evidence that variation in the IL-13 gene is involved in the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and atopy .
Further investigation is required to determine which specific alleles or combination of alleles contribute to these phenotypes , and the possible downstream effects of the resulting change in IL-13 levels or activity .
A 6-year-old child with Fryns syndrome : further delineation of the natural history of the condition in survivors .
Fryns syndrome ( FS ) is a rare early lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder .
The diagnosis is clinical since the underlying molecular defect is currently unknown .
We report on a 6-year-old male child displaying an association of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital diaphragmatic hernia <END> ( CDH) , <START:PHENOTYPE> lung hypoplasia <END> , corneal clouding and <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse face <END> in the absence of distal digital/nail hypoplasia .
Based on the recently published diagnostic guidelines , our patient fits the narrow definition of FS .
Only a minority of FS patients surviving the neonatal period have been reported , thus limiting the recognition of the infantile phenotype .
We compared the features observed in our proband with those of 10 published survivors .
Neurological impairment ranging from mild to severe was present in all patients , while <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> manifested in one third of them , often in association with central nervous system malformations . Other characteristic features included central-paracentral corneal clouding , coarsening of the facial traits , gastroesophageal reflux , <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal malrotation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> and vescico-ureteral reflux .
These manifestations are representative of the natural history of this condition and should also be searched for in FS survivors .
Bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> porencephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , and internal malformations : two siblings representing a probably new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> entity .
We report on 2 sibs with bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> porencephaly <END> , absence of the septum pellucidum , and pancerebellar hypoplasia including absence of the vermis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Situs inversus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> was present in one , and an <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> in the other .
This constellation of findings is discussed against the background of familial porencephalies and schizencephalies , familial cerebellar hypoplasias , and asplenia/polysplenia syndromes .
It is concluded that the described constellation of findings constitutes a new entity of probably <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
The spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> in hypertensive patients with neurofibromatosis .
We have found an appreciable number of pheochromocytomas in patients with neurofibromatosis and concurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> ( ten of 18 cases ) .
At diagnosis , the patient age range was 15 to 62 years , the clinical appearance of the neurofibromatosis did not predict who would and who would not have pheochromocytomas , but the age at diagnosis was helpful in that our younger patients tended to have causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> other than <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> .
However , several causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> may coexist .
The biochemical findings were highly diagnostic .
The pheochromocytomas secreted epinephrine as well as norepinephrine and resided in or next to the adrenal gland .
Where <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> is the cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , its resection generally results in a better control of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> than that obtained in patients whose BPs were elevated from other unknown causes .
A decamer duplication in the 3 ' region of the BRI gene originates an amyloid peptide that is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> in a Danish kindred .
Familial Danish <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ( FDD) , also known as heredopathia ophthalmo-oto-encephalica , is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterized by cataracts , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Neuropathological findings include severe widespread cerebral amyloid angiopathy , hippocampal plaques , and neurofibrillary tangles , similar to Alzheimer 's disease . N-terminal sequence analysis of isolated leptomeningeal amyloid fibrils revealed homology to ABri , the peptide originated by a point mutation at the stop codon of gene BRI in familial British <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Molecular genetic analysis of the BRI gene in the Danish kindred showed a different defect , namely the presence of a 10-nt duplication ( 795-796ins TTTAATTTGT) between codons 265 and 266 , one codon before the normal stop codon 267 .
The decamer duplication mutation produces a frame-shift in the BRI sequence generating a larger-than-normal precursor protein , of which the amyloid subunit (designated ADan ) comprises the last 34 C-terminal amino acids .
This de novo-created amyloidogenic peptide , associated with a genetic defect in the Danish kindred , stresses the importance of amyloid formation as a causative factor in neurodegeneration and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
COL4A1 mutations and hereditary angiopathy , nephropathy , aneurysms , and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle cramps <END> .
COL4A3 , COL4A4 , and COL4A5 are the only collagen genes that have been implicated in inherited nephropathies in humans .
However , the causative genes for a number of hereditary multicystic kidney diseases , myopathies with cramps , and heritable intracranial aneurysms remain unknown .
We characterized the renal and extrarenal phenotypes of subjects from three families who had an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy , aneurysms , and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle cramps <END> ( HANAC ) , which we propose is a syndrome .
Linkage studies involving microsatellite markers flanking the COL4A1- COL4A2 locus were performed , followed by sequence analysis of COL4A1 complementary DNA extracted from skin-fibroblast specimens from the subjects .
We identified three closely located glycine mutations in exons 24 and 25 of the gene COL4A1 , which encodes procollagen type IV alpha1 .
The clinical renal manifestations of the HANAC syndrome in these families include <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> and bilateral , large cysts .
Histologic analysis revealed complex basement-membrane defects in kidney and skin .
The systemic angiopathy of the HANAC syndrome appears to affect both small vessels and large arteries .
COL4A1 may be a candidate gene in unexplained familial syndromes with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic kidney disease <END> , intracranial aneurysms , and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle cramps <END> .

Late-onset X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> sideroblastic anemia <END> .
Missense mutations in the erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase ( ALAS2 ) gene in two pyridoxine-responsive patients initially diagnosed with acquired refractory <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> and ringed sideroblasts .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> sideroblastic anemia <END> ( XLSA ) is caused by mutations of the erythroid-specific delta-aminolevulinate synthase gene ( ALAS2 ) resulting in deficient heme synthesis .
The characteristic hypochromic , microcytic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> typically becomes manifest in the first three decades of life .
Hematologic response to pyridoxine is variable and rarely complete .
We report two unrelated cases of highly pyridoxine-responsive XLSA in geriatric patients previously diagnosed with refractory <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> and ringed sideroblasts .
A previously unaffected 77-yr-old male and an 81-yr-old female were each found to have developed severe hypochromic , microcytic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> with ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow , which responded dramatically to pyridoxine with normalization of hemoglobin values .
Sequence analysis identified an A to C transversion in exon 7 ( K299Q ) of the ALAS2 gene in the male proband and his daughter .
In the female proband a G to A transition was identified in exon 5 ( A172T) .
This mutation resulted in decreased in vitro stability of bone marrow delta-aminolevulinate synthase activity .
Each patient 's recombinant mutant ALAS2 enzyme had marked thermolability .
Addition of pyridoxal 5 ' -phosphate in vitro stabilized the mutant enzymes , consistent with the observed dramatic response to pyridoxine in vivo .
This late-onset form of XLSA can be distinguished from refractory <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> and ringed sideroblasts by microcytosis , pyridoxine-responsiveness , and ALAS2 mutations .
These findings emphasize the need to consider all elderly patients with microcytic <START:PHENOTYPE> sideroblastic anemia <END> as candidates for XLSA , especially if pyridoxine responsiveness is demonstrated .
Oculocutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> , immunodeficiency , hematological disorders , and minor anomalies : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome ?
We report on 2 related children , a boy and a girl , from a large Turkish clan .
Their parents are both first cousins and have several common ancestors .
Both children have tyrosinase-positive oculocutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent bacterial infections <END> , granulocytopenia , intermittent thrombopenia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , a protruding midface , rough and projecting hair , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mild mental retardation <END> .
Chromosomes are normal .
Metabolic disorders were excluded .
None of 14 well-known types of <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> , including Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and Chediak-Higashi syndrome , nor any other genetic syndrome , characterizes our patients sufficiently .
Thus , this combination of symptoms is considered a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
Clinical findings in two African-American families with the nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome ( NBCC ) .
The nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome ( NBCC ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> multisystem disorder with <START:PHENOTYPE> variable expressivity <END> .
We present the clinical findings on 11 African-American NBCC cases from 2 families and a review of the literature of NBCC in African-Americans .
The 2 new families , as well as those previously reported , suggest minimal expression of the <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> and full expression of the other components of the syndrome .
The 3 most common findings in the 11 cases were jaw cysts , palmar and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> plantar pits <END> , and calcification of the falx cerebri .
Only 44 % ( 4/11 ) of these cases had one or more confirmed <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> .
This frequency is substantially less than that observed in whites (90 % with <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> ) .
The relative lack of these skin tumors in African-Americans partly reflects ultraviolet radiation protection resulting from increased skin pigmentation .
Future research should help identify the specific mutation(s ) in blacks as well as other modifying genes and environmental exposures that may contribute to the varied manifestations of the syndrome .
The soluble epoxide hydrolase gene harbors sequence variation associated with susceptibility to and protection from incident ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Stroke <END> is the leading cause of severe disability and the third leading cause of death , accounting for one of every 15 deaths in the USA .
We investigated the association of polymorphisms in the soluble epoxide hydrolase gene ( EPHX2 ) with incident ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> in African-Americans and Whites .
Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) spanning EPHX2 were genotyped in a case-cohort sample of 1336 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ( ARIC) study .
In each racial group , Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to assess the relationship between incident ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> and EPHX2 polymorphisms .
A score test method was used to investigate the association of common haplotypes of the gene with risk of ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
In African-Americans , two common EPHX2 haplotypes with significant and opposing relationships to ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> risk were identified .
In Whites , two common haplotypes showed suggestive indication of an association with ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> risk but , as in African-Americans , these relationships were in opposite direction .
These findings suggest that multiple variants exist within or near the EPHX2 gene , with greatly contrasting relationships to ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> incidence ; some associated with a higher incidence and others with a lower incidence .
Combined analysis of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> linkage to 1q24-25 : results from 772 hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> families from the International Consortium for <START:PHENOTYPE> Prostate Cancer <END> Genetics .
A previous linkage study provided evidence for a prostate cancer-susceptibility locus at 1q24-25 . Subsequent reports in additional collections of families have yielded conflicting results .
In addition , evidence for locus heterogeneity has been provided by the identification of other putative hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> loci on Xq27-28 , 1q42-43 , and 1p36 .
The present study describes a combined analysis for six markers in the 1q24-25 region in 772 families affected by hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> and ascertained by the members of the International Consortium for <START:PHENOTYPE> Prostate Cancer <END> Genetics ( ICPCG ) from North America , Australia , Finland , Norway , Sweden , and the United Kingdom .
Overall , there was some evidence for linkage , with a peak parametric multipoint LOD score assuming heterogeneity ( HLOD ) of 1.40 ( P=.01 ) at D1S212 .
The estimated proportion of families ( alpha ) linked to the locus was.06 ( 1- LOD support interval.01- .12 ) .
This evidence was not observed by a nonparametric approach , presumably because of the extensive heterogeneity .
Further parametric analysis revealed a significant effect of the presence of male-to-male disease transmission within the families .
In the subset of 491 such families , the peak HLOD was 2.56 ( P=.0006 ) and alpha = .11 ( 1- LOD support interval.04- .19 ) , compared with HLODs of 0 in the remaining 281 families .
Within the families with male-to-male disease transmission , alpha increased with the early mean age at diagnosis ( <65 years , alpha = .19 , with 1- LOD support interval.06- .34 ) and the number of affected family members ( five or more family members , alpha = .15 , with 1- LOD support interval.04-.28 ) .
The highest value of alpha was observed for the 48 families that met all three criteria ( peak HLOD = 2.25 , P=.001 , alpha=.29 , with 1- LOD support interval.08-.53 ) .
These results support the finding of a prostate cancer-susceptibility gene linked to 1q24-25 , albeit in a defined subset of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> families .
Although HPC1 accounts for only a small proportion of all families affected by hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> , it appears to play a more prominent role in the subset of families with several members affected at an early age and with male-to-male disease transmission .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lens opacities <END> in neurofibromatosis 2 : further significant correlations .
This prospective study of 96 individuals from 29 families with neurofibromatosis 2 , 49 of whom were affected , confirms in an extended series the previously reported association between posterior subcapsular/capsular <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and neurofibromatosis 2 . Posterior subcapsular/capsular <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> were found in 36 (8 0% ) of the 45 affected individuals ( four individuals were excluded from statistical analyses ) .
In addition , the association of peripheral cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> with neurofibromatosis 2 was found to be statistically significant .
Seventeen of the patients with neurofibromatosis 2 ( 37.8% ) had peripheral cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> in comparison with none of the unaffected family members ( p < 0.0001 ) .
In three patients peripheral cortical opacities were present despite the absence of posterior subcapsular/capsular <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
These findings support the inclusion of cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> of early onset , in addition to posterior subcapsular/capsular <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , in the diagnostic criteria of neurofibromatosis 2 .
Adenylosuccinase deficiency : an unusual cause of early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> associated with acquired <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
Adenylosuccinase deficiency , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> inborn error of purine synthesis , was first described in 1984 by Jaeken and Van den Berghe ( reviewed in J Inher Metab Dis 20;1997 : 193 ) .
The cardinal features are variable <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor delay <END> often accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and autistic features .
Diagnosis is made by detection of abnormal purine metabolites in body fluids .
We report a girl who presented with early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , associated with acquired <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> severe psychomotor retardation <END> , as the most prominent symptoms .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital generalized lipodystrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and slender bones : a newly recognized syndrome ?
We present three patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital generalized lipodystrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low birth weight <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , delayed cognitive development , and progressive bone changes characterized by overtubulation and rarefaction of long bones with dense metaphyseal striations occurring in adolescence .
Abnormalities of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism , hepatosplenomegaly , acanthosis nigricans , and hirsutism were not found .
Comparison of the condition of these patients with known syndromic lipodystrophies suggests that they represent a previously unrecognized genetic disorder .
The occurrence in sibs born to consanguineous parents and a third patient from the same tribal unit suggest <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Recurrent bacterial infections <END> in four siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> eosinophilia <END> , hyperimmunoglobulinemia A , and defective neutrophil chemotaxis .
Four siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent bacterial infections <END> , neutrophil chemotactic defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> eosinophilia <END> were studied .
During periods of infection the peripheral neutrophil count increased to normal , while the <START:PHENOTYPE> eosinophilia <END> disappeared .
In addition , these children had high levels of serum IgA and poor antibody responses to tetanus and polio vaccinations .
A defect in cell-mediated immunity was demonstrated by an absent or weak reactivity to various skin test antigens and by <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal lymph node histology <END> .
Thus these siblings had an unusual combination of defective inflammatory response and immunologic abnormalities .
Lethal multiple pterygium syndrome : three consecutive cases in one family .
We report on three sib fetuses with the lethal multiple pterygium syndrome ( LMPS) , one case occurring in a twin pregnancy .
All three fetuses had a <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic hygroma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops <END> was detected by ultrasound .
The classification scheme for LMPS proposed by Hall [ 1984 ] is examined .
With our present state of knowledge of this syndrome , subdivision on bone-fusion types does not appear to be justified .
Antenatal detection by ultrasound is possible in most pregnancies with a second affected fetus because of <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic hygroma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops <END> .
In the term or near-term infant in which ultrasound has not shown <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic hygroma <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops <END> , a diagnosis of Pena-Shokeir type I syndrome should be considered because pterygia are a component of that syndrome but <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic hygroma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops <END> are not .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> with zonular weakness and childhood lens-related secondary glaucoma - a distinct phenotype caused by recessive LTBP2 mutations .
To clinically and genetically characterize a distinct phenotype of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> ( horizontal corneal diameter â‰¥13 mm ) with secondary glaucoma from spherophakia and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> during childhood in affected Saudi families .
Clinical exam , homozygosity scan , and candidate gene analysis .
From 2005 to 2010 , eight affected individuals from three consanguineous families were identified .
In addition to congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> , affected children presented with secondary glaucoma from spherophakia and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> .
One member from each family developed spontaneous complete crystalline <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> into the anterior chamber with associated acute glaucoma during early childhood .
Older individuals had phenotypes that would have suggested prior uncontrolled primary congenital/infantile glaucoma had past ophthalmic and/or family histories not been available .
Homozygosity mapping performed for the first two families suggested the candidate gene latent transforming growth factor-beta-binding protein 2 ( LTBP2) , which when sequenced revealed a novel homozgyous mutation that segregated with the phenotype in each family ( p.S338PfsX4 [ c.1012delT] , p.Q1619X [ ( c.4855 C >T] ) .
LTBP2 sequencing in the third family revealed a third novel homozygous mutation ( p.C1438 Y [ c.4313G>A] ) .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> with childhood secondary glaucoma from spherophakia and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> is a distinct condition caused by recessive LTBP2 mutations that needs to be distinguished from buphthalmos secondary to primary congenital/infantile glaucoma because typical initial surgical treatment is lens removal in the former and angle surgery in the latter .
Complete dislocation of the crystalline lens into the anterior chamber during early childhood can occur in young children with this unique phenotype .
Congenital non-progressive encephalopathy and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> with intermittent episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> coma <END> and hyperkynureninuria .
Six of nine children born from first-cousin parents presented with the same clinical picture : non-progressive congenital encephalopathy with marked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertonia <END> resembling the stiff-baby syndrome , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed milestones <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deficiency <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital deafness <END> .
Rare , usually reversible , episodes of sudden worsening of the neurological status , with progressive loss of consciousness and increase of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertonia <END> , occurred spontaneously or during febrile illnesses .
During these periods , and sometimes on other occasions , transitory renal dysfunction was observed ( nephrotic syndrome and/or tubular abnormalities ) .
Death occurred before age 2 years in 4 patients ; 2 are still alive (1 0 and 13 years old ) .
Electrophysiological , biological and enzymatic investigations remained negative , particularly those concerning mitochondrial and peroxisomal metabolism .
The only biochemical anomaly was a massive hyperkynureninuria , seen only during the periods of <START:PHENOTYPE> coma <END> ( up to 213 mumol/mmol creatinine ; normal < 10 ) and after an intravenous protein loading test .
This suggests an anomaly of tryptophan metabolism which has not been reported up to now .
Genetic variation in the 22q11 locus and susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
An increased prevalence of microdeletions at the 22q11 locus has been reported in samples of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
22q11 microdeletions represent the highest known genetic risk factor for the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , second only to that of the monozygotic cotwin of an affected individual or the offspring of two schizophrenic parents .
It is therefore clear that a <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> susceptibility locus maps to chromosome 22q11 .
In light of evidence for suggestive linkage for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> in this region , we hypothesized that , whereas deletions of chromosome 22q11 may account for only a small proportion of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> cases in the general population ( up to approximately 2%) , nondeletion variants of individual genes within the 22q11 region may make a larger contribution to susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> in the wider population .
By studying a dense collection of markers ( average one single nucleotide polymorphism20 kb over 1.5 Mb ) in the vicinity of the 22q11 locus , in both family- and population-based samples , we present here results consistent with this assumption .
Moreover , our results are consistent with contribution from more than one gene to the strikingly increased disease risk associated with this locus .
Finer-scale haplotype mapping has identified two subregions within the 1.5- Mb locus that are likely to harbor candidate <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> susceptibility genes .
The DYRK1A gene is a cause of syndromic intellectual disability with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and epilepsy .
DYRK1A plays different functions during development , with an important role in controlling brain growth through neuronal proliferation and neurogenesis .
It is expressed in a gene dosage dependent manner since dyrk1a haploinsufficiency induces a reduced brain size in mice , and DYRK1A overexpression is the candidate gene for intellectual disability ( ID) and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> in Down syndrome .
We have identified a 69 kb deletion including the 5 ' region of the DYRK1A gene in a patient with growth retardation , primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , facial dysmorphism , seizures , ataxic gait , absent speech and ID. Because four patients previously reported with intragenic DYRK1A rearrangements or 21q22 microdeletions including only DYRK1A presented with overlapping phenotypes , we hypothesised that DYRK1A mutations could be responsible for syndromic ID with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and epilepsy .
The DYRK1A gene was studied by direct sequencing and quantitative PCR in a cohort of 105 patients with ID and at least two symptoms from the Angelman syndrome spectrum ( <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> < -2.5 SD , ataxic gait , seizures and speech delay ) .
We identified a de novo frameshift mutation ( c.290_291delCT; p.Ser97Cysfs*98 ) in a patient with growth retardation , primary severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , delayed language , ID , and seizures .
The identification of a truncating mutation in a patient with ID , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , epilepsy , and growth retardation , combined with its dual function in regulating the neural proliferation/neuronal differentiation , adds DYRK1A to the list of genes responsible for such a phenotype .
ID , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , epilepsy , and language delay are the more specific features associated with DYRK1A abnormalities .
DYRK1A studies should be discussed in patients presenting such a phenotype .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> syndrome ( BPES ) associated with interstitial deletion of band 3q22 : review and gene assignment to the interface of band 3q22.3 and 3q23.
We report on a child with <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> ( BPES) , developmental delay and an interstitial deletion of band q22 of chromosome 3 . A review of chromosome 3q anomalies associated with eye abnormalities , specifically <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , strongly suggests that a locus for eyelid development is present at the interface of bands 3q22.3 and 3q23.
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> inherited syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital stapes ankylosis <END> .
A newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> inherited syndrome associated with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperopia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad thumbs <END> , broad first toes , <START:PHENOTYPE> short distal phalanges <END> , and syndactyly is reported .
The conductive loss was the result of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital stapes ankylosis <END> and , in two cases , was associated with ankylosis of the short process of the incus in the fossa incudis .
Stapedectomy improved hearing in these patients .
Fused cervical vertebrate are also an associated feature .
Functional analysis of mutations in SLC7A9 , and genotype-phenotype correlation in non-Type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cystinuria <END> ( OMIM 220100 ) is a common recessive disorder of renal reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids that results in <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> of cystine .
Mutations in SLC3A1 , which encodes rBAT , cause Type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> , and mutations in SLC7A9 , which encodes a putative subunit of rBAT ( b(o ,+ )AT) , cause non-Type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> .
Here we describe the genomic structure of SLC7A9 ( 13 exons ) and 28 new mutations in this gene that , together with the seven previously reported , explain 79 % of the alleles in 61 non-Type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> patients .
These data demonstrate that SLC7A9 is the main non-Type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> gene .
Mutations G105R , V17 0M , A182T and R333W are the most frequent SLC7A9 missense mutations found .
Among heterozygotes carrying these mutations , A182T heterozygotes showed the lowest urinary excretion values of cystine and dibasic amino acids .
Functional analysis of mutation A182T after co-expression with rBAT in HeLa cells revealed significant residual transport activity .
In contrast , mutations G105R , V170M and R333W are associated to a complete or almost complete loss of transport activity , leading to a more severe urinary phenotype in heterozygotes .
SLC7A9 mutations located in the putative transmembrane domains of b(o ,+ )AT and affecting conserved amino acid residues with a small side chain generate a severe phenotype , while mutations in non-conserved residues give rise to a mild phenotype .
These data provide the first genotype-phenotype correlation in non-Type I <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> , and show that a mild urinary phenotype in heterozygotes may associate with mutations with significant residual transport activity .
Two cases of chromosome 4q35-linked early onset facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Two cases of early onset facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ( FSHD ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> are reported .
They were sporadic , unrelated , severely affected females .
In both cases , Southern blot analysis of the EcoRI-digested genomic DNA , using probes p13E-11 and pFR-1 , detected the shortest 10 kb EcoRI fragments reported to date .
Patient 1 showed infantile spasms at the age of 4 months and localization-related <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> at the age of 2.5 years .
Muscular atrophy in the face , shoulder girdle and upper arms was observed from the age of 4 years .
In Patient 2 , lack of facial expression was noticed since the age of 1 year , and at 4 years she was noted to have a loss of bilateral upward gaze .
She developed localization-related <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> at the age of 9 years .
From the age of 10 years , weakness of the lower limbs progressed and she became wheelchair-bound at the age of 14 years and 8 months .
She had moderate sensorineural hearing loss , a loss of bilateral upward gaze and tongue atrophy.
Their IQs were 33 and 45 , respectively .
The two patients suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> may be part of the clinical spectrum of FSHD , especially in very early onset patients with large deletions .
Major histocompatibility complex class I-recognizing receptors are disease risk genes in <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( RA ) is a heterogeneous syndrome of which a subset of patients develops vascular inflammation .
The genetic determinants that confer risk for rheumatoid <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> are not known , but patients with vascular complications are known to have an expansion of CD4( + )CD28( null ) T cells , a cell population potentially involved in endothelial damage .
CD4( + )CD28( null ) T cell clones isolated from RA patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> were found to express killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( KIRs ) with the stimulatory KIR2DS2 often present in the absence of opposing inhibitory receptors with related specificities .
To test the hypothesis that the KIR2DS2 gene is involved in the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> , association studies were performed .
The KIR2DS2 gene was significantly enriched among patients with rheumatoid <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> compared with normal individuals ( odds ratio 5.56 , P = 0.001 ) and patients with RA but no <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> ( odds ratio 7.96 , P = 0.001 ) .
Also , the distribution of human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen ( HLA) -C , the putative ligand for KIRs , was significantly different in patients with rheumatoid <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> in comparison with the control populations .
These data suggest that HLA class I-recognizing receptors and HLA class I genes are genetic risk determinants that modulate the pattern of RA expression .
Specifically , KIR2DS2 in conjunction with the appropriate HLA- C ligand may have a role in vascular damage by regulating CD4( + )CD28( null ) T cells .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Distal arthrogryposis <END> type II: a family with varying congenital abnormalities .
Five family members with <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> in two generations are reported .
Cleft lip and palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , ptosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> webbed neck <END> , kyphoscoliosis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> are seen in one or more affected family members .
All individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> also have trismus .
This family does not fit any of the recently proposed five subcategories of type II <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> , nor does it fit any other recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> condition with distal contractures .
Nonspecific X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> I : a review with information from 24 new families .
Clinical manifestations and other aspects of nonspecific X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> are reviewed using data from the literature and information on affected males in 24 new families ascertained in British Columbia .
A great degree of variability was apparent in the mental abilities of affected males .
Speech defects , other CNS disorders and minor physical changes such as " big " ears or a highly arched palate were not present in many cases .
Evidence for the existence of a clinical entity of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> associated with the fragile site at Xq27 or 28 and macro-orchidism is discussed .
Genetic phenomena of reduced penetrance in males and of partial expression in females with respect of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> genes are examined .
Consideration is given to the question of whether this type of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> is due to <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> or autosomal dominant sex-limited genes .
Most ascertained cases of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> are from families of northern European extraction .
Recommendations are made regarding the diagnosis and counseling of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> cases .
Dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic nerve atrophy <END> with progressive hearing loss and chronic progressive external <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> ( CPEO ) .
This paper describes a family where chronic progressive external <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> is associated with dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
This may be a possible association in the same family of two diseases : progressive external <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> and dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> with progressive hearing loss .
However , we believe that this family represents an unusual manifestation of <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> plus .
XK <START:PHENOTYPE> aprosencephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> anencephaly <END> in sibs .
Recent studies have suggested a causal and pathogenetic relationship between holoprosencephaly and <START:PHENOTYPE> anencephaly <END> .
In support of the proposed relationship we report a sibship that includes anencephalic male twins and a female infant with a severe form of alobar holoprosencephaly , radial aplasia , and oligodactyly .
The upper limb and brain malformations are considered to represent <START:PHENOTYPE> aprosencephaly <END> syndrome .
The coexistence of <START:PHENOTYPE> anencephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> aprosencephaly <END> within a sibship suggests that XK <START:PHENOTYPE> aprosencephaly <END> syndrome may be an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder .
PRPS1 mutations : four distinct syndromes and potential treatment .
Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetases ( PRSs ) catalyze the first step of nucleotide synthesis .
Nucleotides are central to cell function , being the building blocks of nucleic acids and serving as cofactors in cellular signaling and metabolism .
With this in mind , it is remarkable that mutations in phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 1 ( PRPS1 ) , which is the most ubiquitously expressed gene of the three PRS genes , are compatible with life .
Mutations described thus far in PRPS1 are all missense mutations that result in PRS-I superactivity or in variable levels of decreased activity , resulting in X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-5 ( CMTX5 ) , Arts syndrome , and X-linked nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> ( DFN2 ) .
Patients with PRS-I superactivity primarily present with uric acid overproduction , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , hypotonia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> .
Postlingual progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> is found as an isolated feature in DFN2 patients .
Patients with CMTX5 and Arts syndrome have <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral neuropathy <END> , including <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> and optic atrophy.
However , patients with Arts syndrome are more severely affected because they also have central <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> and an impaired immune system .
The neurological phenotype in all four PRPS1- related disorders seems to result primarily from reduced levels of GTP and possibly other purine nucleotides including ATP , suggesting that these disorders belong to the same disease spectrum .
Preliminary results of S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) supplementation in two Arts syndrome patients show improvement of their condition , indicating that SAM supplementation in the diet could alleviate some of the symptoms of patients with PRPS1 spectrum diseases by replenishing purine nucleotides ( J .C. , unpublished data ) .

Mutations in a novel gene , NPHP3 , cause adolescent <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> , tapeto-retinal degeneration and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephronophthisis <END> ( NPHP) , a group of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> cystic kidney disorders , is the most common genetic cause of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> in children and young adults .
NPHP may be associated with Leber <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital amaurosis <END> , tapeto-retinal degeneration , cerebellar ataxia , cone-shaped epiphyses , congenital oculomotor apraxia and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> .
Loci associated with an infantile type of NPHP on 9q22-q31 ( NPHP2) , juvenile types of NPHP on chromosomes 2q12-q13 ( NPHP1 ) and 1p36 ( NPHP4 ) and an adolescent type of NPHP on 3q21-q22 ( NPHP3 ) have been mapped .
NPHP1 and NPHP4 have been identified , and interaction of the respective encoded proteins nephrocystin and nephrocystin-4 has been shown .
Here we report the identification of NPHP3 , encoding a novel 1 ,330-amino acid protein that interacts with nephrocystin .
We describe mutations in NPHP3 in families with isolated NPHP and in families with NPHP with associated <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> or tapeto-retinal degeneration .
We show that the mouse ortholog Nphp3 is expressed in the node , kidney tubules , retina , respiratory epithelium , liver , biliary tract and neural tissues .
In addition , we show that a homozygous missense mutation in Nphp3 is probably responsible for the polycystic kidney disease ( pcy ) mouse phenotype .
Interventional studies in the pcy mouse have shown beneficial effects by modification of protein intake and administration of methylprednisolone , suggesting therapeutic strategies for treating individuals with NPHP3 .
Fine-Lubinsky syndrome : a fourth patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microstomia <END> and mental retardation .
In 1993 , Suthers et al . reported on a child with an undiagnosed syndrome associating <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
They discussed the possibility that this child had the same dysmorphic syndrome as the patient reported by Fine and Lubinsky in 1983 .
Twenty years ago , we examined a very similar patient who has been followed up to now .
When she was a baby , she looked extremely similar to another patient , reported by Preus et al . in 1984 .
We now think that these four patients have in fact the same syndrome , the patient reported by Fine and Lubinsky being an example of a very severe expression of this condition , the other patients expressing different anomalies depending on the age at examination .
FASTKD2 nonsense mutation in an infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy associated with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency .
In two siblings we found a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , characterized by developmental delay , hemiplegia , convulsions , asymmetrical brain atrophy , and low cytochrome c oxidase ( COX ) activity in skeletal muscle .
The disease locus was identified on chromosome 2 by homozygosity mapping ; candidate genes were prioritized for their known or predicted <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> localization and then sequenced in probands and controls .
A homozygous nonsense mutation in the KIAA0971 gene segregated with the disease in the proband family .
The corresponding protein is known as fas activated serine-threonine kinase domain 2 , FASTKD2 .
Confocal immunofluorescence colocalized a tagged recombinant FASTKD2 protein with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> markers , and membrane-potential-dependent in vitro <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> import was demonstrated in isolated mitochondria .
In staurosporine-induced-apoptosis experiments , decreased nuclear fragmentation was detected in treated mutant versus control fibroblasts .
In conclusion , we found a loss-of-function mutation in a gene segregating with a peculiar <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy associated with COX deficiency in skeletal muscle .
The corresponding protein is localized in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> inner compartment .
Preliminary data indicate that FASTKD2 plays a role in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> apoptosis .
A possible major contribution to <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in the general population by the gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
In a study of 13 families with genetic <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , it was found that 11 of 24 parents ( two fathers not ascertained ) and 11 of 33 non-microcephalic siblings were of subnormal intelligence .
In a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition , all parents and two-thirds of unaffected siblings are presumed carriers of the gene .
It so , nearly 5 0 % of all presumed heterozygotes in the present study were mentally retarded .
The proportion agrees well with the other major study of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> in North America , but differs from the Dutch study .
On the basis of pooled data from the three studies and the estimated incidence of 1:40000 for genetic <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , it is postulated that (1 ) about 0.34% of the general population is mentally retarded because it is carrying the gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and (2 ) about one of nine mentally retarded individuals is heterozygous for the gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
Primary familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode of inheritance .
A family with primary isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> transmitted by an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> gene was documented ; the proband was a 38-year-old woman with a history of weakness and carpopedal spasm .
The family study revealed that 6 out of 13 members belonging to 3 generations were affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> without any evidence of an autoimmune disease .
Vertical male-to-male , female-to-female and female-to-male transmission were demonstrated .
Having excluded the recessive form of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> , pseudohypoparathyroidism , primary familial hypomagnesemia and any immunological disorder , the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> seems to be the most important etiology of idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> .
A case of Perlman syndrome : fetal gigantism , renal dysplasia , and severe neurological deficits .
We report on a neonate presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> macrosomia <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> visceromegaly <END> including bilateral nephromegaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> , cardiomegaly ; thymus hyperplasia ; <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> ; generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle hypotonia <END> ; and a distinctive facial appearance .
The clinical course was marked by severe neurodevelopmental deficits combined with progressive respiratory decompensation leading to death at the age 6 months .
Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) disclosed a generalized cerebral atrophy with a marked deficit of the white matter .
Renal ultrasound and MRI showed markedly enlarged kidneys with multiple small cystic lesions , a pattern indistinguishable from polycystic kidney disease .
The postmortem kidney biopsy revealed dysplastic changes , microcysts , and a focal <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrogenic rest <END> , characteristic features of the Perlman syndrome .
In children with fetal gigantism , renal abnormalities , and neurological deficits , Perlman syndrome should be considered and may be confirmed by kidney biopsy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Optic atrophy <END> and sensorineural hearing loss in a family caused by an R445H OPA1 mutation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( ADOA ) is the most common form of inherited optic atrophy.
Four genetic loci have been associated with ADOA : OPA1 , OPA2 , OPA3 , and OPA4 .
Out of these four loci , only one gene has been identified , OPA1 .
We previously described a unique syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> in two unrelated families associated with an R445H mutation in OPA1 .
The R445H mutation is the only OPA1 mutation that has been associated with this syndrome .
In this manuscript , we clinically characterize an unrelated family with four members affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and hearing loss without extraocular motility abnormalities or <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> .
This family also harbors the R445H mutation .
These cases help illustrate the intra- and inter-family variability in phenotype associated with this mutation .
As we continue to learn more about OPA1 and the function of its protein product , we will begin to understand the pathophysiology of optic atrophy.
This understanding will ultimately lead to novel treatments directed toward preventing the visual loss and disability associated with this inherited disease .
New family with paroxysmal exercise-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> and epilepsy .
To date , there are few reports of paroxysmal exercise-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> associated with familial epilepsy .
We describe a family with 4 affected members spanning 3 generations , suggestive of autosomal-dominant inheritance , who exhibited typical exercise-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , different types of epilepsy ( absence and primary generalized seizures) , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> in variable combinations .
Linkage of the disease to loci on chromosome 2 ( paroxysmal nonkinesigenic <START:PHENOTYPE> dyskinesia <END> ) and chromosome 16 ( paroxysmal kinesigenic <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> , infantile convulsions with <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> ) was excluded , suggesting an as yet unidentified underlying genetic basis .
A familial syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
A family is described in which the father and three of his seven children have <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , mild to moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> .
The two affected boys have generalised <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in addition .
A twin study of DSM-III-R <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> disorders .
The prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> disorders was studied in a sample of 20 monozygotic ( MZ ) and 29 dizygotic ( DZ ) co-twins of <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> disorder probands .
A comparison group of co-twins of 12 MZ and 20 DZ twin probands with other non-psychotic mental disorders was also studied .
All subjects were personally interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Axis I ( SCID-I ) .
Panic disorder was significantly more prevalent in co-twins of panic probands .
Generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> disorder ( GAD ) was more prevalent in co-twins of GAD probands with a history of mood disorder ( NS ) .
Post-traumatic stress disorder was significantly more prevalent in co-twins of <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> probands and was more prevalent in MZ than in DZ co-twins .
The prevalences of social and simple phobia were equal in co-twins of <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> and comparison probands .
For both panic disorder and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> disorder the MZ:DZ concordance ratio was more than 2:1 .
The results support the hypothesis of a genetic contribution in the etiology of panic disorder , generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder .
The hypothesis that simple and social phobia are mainly caused by environmental experiences was also supported .
Deletions of muscle <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathies .
In vitro studies of muscle <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> metabolism in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> have identified a variety of functional defects of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> respiratory chain , predominantly affecting complex I ( NADH-CoQ reductase ) or complex III ( ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase ) in adult cases .
These two enzymes consist of approximately 36 subunits , eight of which are encoded by <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( mtDNA ) .
The increased incidence of maternal , as opposed to paternal , transmission in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> suggests that these disorders may be caused by mutations of mtDNA .
Multiple restriction endonuclease analysis of leukocyte mtDNA from patients with the disease , and their relatives , showed no differences in cleavage patterns between affected and unaffected individuals in any single maternal line .
When muscle mtDNA was studied , nine of 25 patients were found to have two populations of muscle mtDNA , one of which had deletions of up to 7 kilobases in length .
These observations demonstrate that mtDNA heteroplasmy can occur in man and that human disease may be associated with defects of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome .
Molecular genetic analysis of the FMR-1 gene in a large collection of autistic patients .
A genetic etiology in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> is now strongly supported by family and twin studies .
A 3:1 ratio of affected males to females suggests the involvement of at least one X-linked locus in the disease .
Several reports have indicated an association of the fragile X chromosomal anomaly at Xq27.3 ( FRAXA ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , whereas others have not supported this finding .
We have so far collected blood from 105 simplex and 18 multiplex families and have assessed 141 patients by using the <START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> Diagnostic Interview-Revised ( ADI-R) , the <START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> Diagnostic Observation Scale , and psychometric tests .
All four ADI-R algorithm criteria were met by 131 patients ( 93% ) , whereas 10 patients ( 7% ) showed a broader phenotype of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Southern blot analysis was performed with three different enzymes , and filters were hybridized to an FMR-1-specific probe to detect amplification of the CCG repeat at FRAXA , to the complete FMR-1 cDNA probe , and to additional probes from the neighborhood of the gene .
No significant changes were found in 139 patients ( 99% ) from 122 families , other than the normal variations in the population .
In the case of one multiplex family with three children showing no dysmorphic features of the fragile X syndrome ( one male meeting 3 out of 4 ADI-algorithm criteria , one normal male with slight learning disability but negative ADI-R testing , and one fully autistic female) , the FRAXA full-mutation-specific CCG-repeat expansion in the genotype was not correlated with the <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> phenotype .
Further analysis revealed a mosaic pattern of methylation at the FMR-1 gene locus in the two sons of the family , indicating at least a partly functional gene .
Therefore , we conclude that the association of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> with fragile X at Xq27.3 is non-existent and exclude this location as a candidate gene region for <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Mutation in the 5 ' alternatively spliced region of the XNP/ATR-X gene causes Chudley-Lowry syndrome .
The Chudley-Lowry syndrome ( ChLS , MIM 309490 ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> condition characterized by moderate to <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , and distinctive facial features characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , inverted-V-shaped upper lip , and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> .
The original Chudley-Lowry family consists of three affected males in two generations .
Linkage analysis had localized the gene to a large interval , Xp21- Xq26 and an obligate carrier was demonstrated to have highly skewed X inactivation .
The combination of the clinical phenotype , consistent with that of the patients with ATR-X syndrome , the skewed X-inactivation pattern in a carrier female , as well as the mapping interval including band Xq13.3 , prompted us to consider the XNP/ATR-X gene being involved in this syndrome .
Using RT- PCR analysis , we screened the entire XNP/ATR-X gene and found a mutation in exon 2 ( c.1 09C > T) giving rise to a stop codon at position 37 ( p.R37X ) .
Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses using a specific monoclonal antibody directed against XNP/ATR-X showed the protein to be present in lymphoblastoid cells from one affected male , despite the premature stop codon .
To explain these discordant results , we further analyzed the 5 ' region of the XNP/ATR-X gene and found three alternative transcripts , which differ in the presence or absence of exon 2 , and the length of exon 1 . Our data suggest that ChLS is allelic to the ATR-X syndrome with its less severe phenotype being due to the presence of some XNP/ATR-X protein .
A case-control family history study of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Family history data on 99 autistic and 36 Down 's syndrome probands are reported .
They confirmed a raised familial loading for both <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and more broadly defined pervasive developmental disorders in siblings ( 2 .9% and 2 .9% , respectively , vs 0% in the Down 's group ) and also evidence for the familial aggregation of a lesser variant of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , comprising more subtle communication/social impairments or stereotypic behaviours , but not <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> alone .
Between 12 .4 and 20.4% of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> siblings and 1.6 % and 3.2% of the Down 's siblings exhibited this lesser variant , depending on the stringency of its definition .
Amongst autistic probands with speech , various features of their disorder ( increased number of autistic symptoms ; reduced verbal and performance ability ) as well as a history of obstetric complications , indexed an elevation in familial loading .
No such association was seen in the probands without speech , even though familial loading for the lesser variant in this subgroup , was significantly higher than in the Down 's controls .
The findings suggest that the <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> phenotype extends beyond <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> as traditionally diagnosed ; that aetiology involves several genes ; that <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> is genetically heterogeneous ; and that obstetric abnormalities in autistic subjects may derive from abnormality in the foetus .
A new form of childhood onset , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> spinocerebellar ataxia and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> is localized at 16q21-q23.
Childhood ataxias are a complex set of inherited disorders .
Ataxias associated with generalized tonic-clonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> are usually included with the progressive myoclonus epilepsies ( PME ) .
Five disease entities , Unverricht-Lundborg disease , Lafora 's disease , neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses , myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with ragged red fibres and sialidoses , account for the majority of PME cases .
Two rare forms of ataxia plus <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , sensory ataxic neuropathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and ophthalmoparesis , and infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia were described recently and found to be caused by defective mitochondrial proteins .
We report here a large consanguineous family from Saudi Arabia with four affected children presenting with generalized tonic-clonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , ataxia and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , but neither myoclonus nor mental deterioration .
MRI and muscle biopsy of one patient revealed , respectively , posterior white matter hyperintensities and vacuolization of the sarcotubular system .
We localized the defective gene by homozygosity mapping to a 19 Mb interval in 16q21-q23 between markers D16S3091 and D16S305 0 .
Linkage studies in this region will allow testing for homogeneity of this novel ataxia-epilepsy entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Short stature <END> , brachydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> small ears <END> , and a pattern of minor anomalies in brother and sister born to consanguineous parents : a hitherto unreported syndrome ?
A 13-year-old boy and his 28-year-old sister had <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , and a pattern of minor anomalies including a sloping , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow forehead <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> small ears <END> ; a <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow nose <END> with prominent bridge and long septum ; short upper lip ; receding mandible ; and short limbs with brachydactyly and clinodactyly of little fingers .
The boy also had hypoplastic external genitalia and elevated FSH .
Both are of normal intelligence .
There is remote consanguinity of the ( normal ) parents .
The 2 sibs probably represent a hitherto un-recognized syndrome of possibly <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Bartter syndrome in Costa Rica : a description of 20 cases .
Bartter syndrome involves an overlapping set of closely related renal tubular disorders which can be subdivided into at least three clinical phenotypes : (1 ) classic Bartter syndrome (2 ) Gitelman syndrome , and (3 ) a neonatal variant of Bartter syndrome .
In contrast to classic Bartter syndrome and Gitelman syndrome , the neonatal variant of Bartter syndrome has both the features of renal tubular hypokalemic alkalosis as well as profound systemic manifestations .
Specifically , neonatal Bartter syndrome is characterized by intrauterine <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> premature delivery <END> , and life-threatening episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dehydration <END> .
Most of these infants also have severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> with associated <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopenia <END> .
Over a 22-year period , 20 Costa Rican patients with a congenital syndrome that resembles neonatal Bartter syndrome have been identified and characterized .
While these patients exhibit some of the clinical characteristics previously described for neonatal Bartter syndrome , this cohort also has a set of distinct features .
They are predominantly female , have a later age of diagnosis , manifest a relatively unique set of physical traits , and appear to have milder clinical disease .
Given these differences , it will be important to apply the emerging molecular tools to determine whether the phenotypic variability indicates <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> in neonatal-onset Bartter syndrome .
Cobblestone-like brain dysgenesis and altered glycosylation in congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , Debre type . To delineate a new syndrome of brain dysgenesis and <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> based on the description of 11 patients belonging to nine unrelated families recruited through an international collaboration effort .
Careful clinical assessment of patients from birth to the age of 23 years with follow-up studies ranging from 3 to 20 years .
Biochemical studies of serum proteins glycosylation by isoelectric focusing and capillary zone electrophoresis were performed in 10 patients .
Brain MRI studies using conventional methods were analyzed in eight patients .
An expanded clinical spectrum of a syndrome comprising facial dysmorphia (enlarged anterior fontanelles , downward slant of palpebral fissures , prominent root of the nose) , a connective tissue disorder ( <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> , hip dislocation , high myopia) , and neurologic impairment was defined .
Early developmental delay was followed by onset of generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> by the end of the first decade and a subsequent neurodegenerative course .
A defect of N- or N- plus O-glycosylation of serum transferrins and ApoCIII was observed in 10 patients .
An unusual cobblestone-like cortical malformation over the frontal and parietal regions was seen in eight patients and cerebellar abnormalities , including two patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> , were observed in three patients .
Our results suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , DebrÃ© type , initially considered a dermatologic syndrome , is a multisystemic disorder with cobblestone-like brain dysgenesis manifesting as developmental delay and an epileptic neurodegenerative syndrome .
It might represent a metabolic cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> .
It is associated with a deficient N- and-O glycosylation of proteins and shares many similarities with muscle-eye-brain syndromes .
A syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and retinal pigmentary abnormalities without <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in a family with coincidental <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> .
We describe two brothers with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , unusual retinal pigmentary anomalies , intellectual function in the average or low average range , and a strong family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> .
The brothers have a previously undescribed syndrome , while the <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> appears to represent a coincidental <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Mendelian trait , perhaps linked to the Kell blood group system .
<START:PHENOTYPE> D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria <END> : a case with an intermediate phenotype and prenatal diagnosis of two affected fetuses .
<START:PHENOTYPE> D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria <END> ( D2HGA ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder with variable clinical expression .
The biochemical defect is unknown at present . Previously reported cases have either followed a severe clinical course characterized by neonatal epileptic encephalopathy , cortical blindness , and profound <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , or a mild course characterized by mild <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , manageable <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and mild hypotonia .
To date there has been a clear distinction between these two groups .
We report the second case of a child with D2HGA who has followed an intermediate course .
She presented in infancy with hypotonia , manageable <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and developed moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and cortical visual impairment .
The proposita had a coarse facial appearance , flat face , broad nasal bridge , up-turned nose , and simple , anteverted ears .
These facial anomalies have been noted in other children with D2HGA and this case strengthens the proposed association between this facial phenotype and D2HGA .
We also report the third and fourth instances of prenatal diagnosis for D2HGA .
At each prenatal diagnosis , an affected fetus was diagnosed on the basis of markedly increased levels of D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in amniotic fluid .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Taurodontism <END> of the mandibular first permanent molar distinguishes between the tricho-dento-osseous ( TDO ) syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> amelogenesis imperfecta <END> .
The diagnosis of tricho-dento-osseous ( TDO ) syndrome is often confused with that of a variant of <START:PHENOTYPE> amelogenesis imperfecta <END> ( AI ) which shows similar dental features of hypomaturation-hypoplastic enamel defects and putative <START:PHENOTYPE> taurodontism <END> .
In this controlled study , an objective , biometric measurement technique was used to determine the prevalence and severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> taurodontism <END> of the mandibular first permanent molar in 23 patients with AI and one patient with TDO syndrome compared with age - and sex-matched controls .
The published radiographs of previous cases of TDO and hypomaturation-hypoplastic AI were also reviewed with regard to the presence and severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> taurodontism <END> .
The results indicate that in all cases of TDO , <START:PHENOTYPE> taurodontism <END> of the molars including mandibular first permanent molars was consistently present and in a severe form .
By contrast , the taurodontic defects present in all cases of AI , including the hypomaturation-hypoplastic variant were not significantly different from matched , healthy controls .
Of significance is the fact that in all the AI cases , none of the taurodontic defects were present on the mandibular first permanent molars .
The results indicate that true <START:PHENOTYPE> taurodontism <END> as indicated by a change in the mandibular first permanent molars occurs only in the TDO syndrome .
This feature may be used to differentiate clearly between TDO and AI .
Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome : clinical and linkage studies on a second family .
We restudied a family with X-linked mental retardation ( XLMR ) originally reported in abstract form by Davis et al . [ 1981 ] .
All 8 living affected males were examined .
Characteristics included <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle wasting <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , broad shallow <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , long face , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> with minor modeling anomalies , foot deformities , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> , and neck drop .
Stature , OFC , testicular volume , high resolution chromosome and fragile X studies , and plasma amino acids were all normal .
Their manifestations closely resemble those of a large family with XLMR originally reported by Allan et al . [ 1944 ] and restudied by Stevenson et al . [ 1990 ] .
This condition has been termed the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome ( AHDS ) .
As AHDS has been mapped to Xq21 , mapping studies were undertaken to determine if this family maps to the same location .
These studies demonstrate tight linkage to Xq21 , with a maximum lod score of 2.88 obtained with probe pX65H7 ( DXS72 ) .
Multipoint analysis located the mutant gene quite close to pX65H7 ( multipoint Z = 4.14 ) , slightly more proximal in Xq21 than was suggested by the data from the original AHDS family .
It appears likely that this family is the second reported family with AHDS .
Neu-Laxova syndrome : prenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis , clinical and pathological studies , and new manifestations .
A diagnosis of the Neu-Laxova syndrome ( NLS ) was made by ultrasonography at 32 wks of gestation .
Ultrasonographic examination showed <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> ( IUGR) , <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker anomaly <END> , choroid plexus cysts , <START:PHENOTYPE> receding forehead <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> without <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent eyes <END> , scalp edema with no <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized edema <END> , retrognathia , curved penis , and flexion deformities of limbs .
The findings in this case are consistent with NLS ; however , they did not fit any of Curry 's [ 1982 ] groups .
Massive swelling of hands and feet were among the main manifestations in classic NLS cases .
In the case presented herein , edema was noted only in the scalp .
This might shed further light on the question of variability vs . heterogeneity in the NLS .
This case shows the existing possibility of an early diagnosis of NLS and adds <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker anomaly <END> and choroid plexus cysts as new findings to this syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcification <END> outside the basal ganglia .
We describe a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> .
The 3 affected individuals had no detectable serum parathyroid hormone on radioimmunoassay .
The propositus presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and on CT scan had bilateral basal ganglion calcification and calcification in the frontal lobes .
His similarly affected mother had even more intracerebral calcification .
The latter manifestation has not been described previously in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> .
Germline E-cadherin mutations in hereditary diffuse gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> : assessment of 42 new families and review of genetic screening criteria .
Mutations in the E-cadherin ( CDH1 ) gene are a well documented cause of hereditary diffuse gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> ( HDGC ) .
Development of evidence based guidelines for CDH1 screening for HDGC have been complicated by its rarity , variable penetrance , and lack of founder mutations .
Forty three new gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> ( GC ) families were ascertained from multiple sources .
In 42 of these families at least one gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> was pathologically confirmed to be a diffuse gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> ( DGC) ; the other family had intestinal type gastric cancers .
Screening of the entire coding region of the CDH1 gene and all intron /exon boundaries was performed by bi-directional sequencing .
Novel mutations were found in 13 of the 42 DGC families ( 31 % overall ) .
Twelve of these mutations occur among the 25 families with multiple cases of gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> and with pathologic confirmation of diffuse gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> phenotype in at least one individual under the age of 50 years .
The mutations found include small insertions and deletions , splice site mutations , and three non-conservative amino acid substitutions ( A298T , W409R , and R732Q ) .
All three missense mutations conferred loss of E-cadherin function in in vitro assays .
Multiple cases of breast cancers including pathologically confirmed lobular breast cancers were observed both in mutation positive and negative families .
Germline truncating CDH1 mutations are found in 48 % of families with multiple cases of gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> and at least one documented case of DGC in an individual under 50 years of age .
We recommend that these criteria be used for selecting families for CDH1 mutational analysis .
Heterozygous MZ alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency in adults with chronic active hepatitis and cryptogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> .
To determine the prevalence of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> or chronic active hepatitis , we performed a five-year prospective study of liver-biopsy specimens from 1055 adults .
Thirty-four patients whose specimens contained hepatocyte inclusions characteristic of the deficiency were phenotyped , and 25 had phenotype MZ ( 2.4 per cent ) .
The distribution of patients with this phenotype among the 185 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> diagnosed histologically was three of 84 patients with alcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> ( 3.5 per cent ) , seven of 34 with non-B chronic active hepatitis (2 0.5 per cent ) , six of 28 with cryptogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> ( 21 per cent ) , and one of 39 with other kinds of <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> ( 2.6 per cent ) .
The increased prevalence of MZ in patients with cryptogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> and with chronic active hepatitis is highly significant ( P < 0.001 ) .
Because serum levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin may be unreliable for identification of the subgroup of patients with chronic active hepatitis or cryptogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> , analysis of serum for the MZ phenotype and meticulous examination of biopsy specimens may be necessary .
Genetic variants of IL-13 signalling and human <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and atopy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> and atopy show epidemiological association and are biologically linked by T-helper type 2 ( T(h)2 ) cytokine-driven inflammatory mechanisms .
IL-4 operates through the IL-4 receptor ( IL-4R , a heterodimer of IL-4Ralpha and either gammac or IL-13Ralpha1 ) and IL-13 operates through IL-13R ( a heterodimer of IL-4Ralpha and IL-13Ralpha1 ) to promote IgE synthesis and IgE-based mucosal inflammation which typify atopy .
Recent animal model data suggest that IL-13 is a central cytokine in promoting <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , through the stimulation of bronchial epithelial mucus secretion and smooth muscle hyper-reactivity .
We investigated the role of common genetic variants of IL-13 and IL-13Ralpha1 in human <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , considering IgE levels .
A novel variant of human IL-13 , Gln11 0Arg , on chromosome 5q31 , associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> rather than IgE levels in case-control populations from Britain and Japan [peak odds ratio ( OR ) = 2.31 , 95 % CI 1.33-4.00] ; the variant also predicted <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and higher serum IL-13 levels in a general , Japanese paediatric population .
Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that both subunits of IL-13R are prominently expressed in bronchial epithelium and smooth muscle from asthmatic subjects .
Detailed molecular modelling analyses indicate that residue 110 of IL-13 , the site of the charge-modifying variants Arg and Gln , is important in the internal constitution of the ligand and crucial in ligand-receptor interaction .
A non-coding variant of IL-13Ralpha1 , A1398G , on chromosome Xq13 , associated primarily with high IgE levels ( OR = 3 . 38 in males , 1 .1 0 in females ) rather than <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Thus , certain variants of IL-13 signalling are likely to be important promoters of human <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ; detailed functional analysis of their actions is needed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> isolated ( 'uncomplicated ' ) <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
A large family ( 13 affected members in three generations ) is reported in which isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> occurred without any other dysmorphic or neurological abnormalities .
The family pedigree confirms the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode of inheritance with incomplete penetrance , including one example of male to male transmission and the occurrence of a non-manifesting heterozygote resulting in a 'skipped generation ' .
There is considerable variation in the phenotypic expression of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
This isolated ( uncomplicated ) type of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> should be distinguished from other well defined , dominantly inherited forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Auditory canal atresia <END> , humeroscapular synostosis , and other skeletal abnormalities : confirmation of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> " SAMS " syndrome .
A second girl with the unique combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> auditory canal atresia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> scapulohumeral synostosis <END> is reported .
This patient also had bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfeet <END> and genital abnormalities .
The other patient reported with this syndrome and the presently reported child both had consanguineous parents .
Mental development was normal in both children .
The acronym SAMS ( <START:PHENOTYPE> Short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Auditory canal atresia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Mandibular hypoplasia <END> , and Skeletal abnormalities ) was suggested to describe the main manifestations in this syndrome .

Adult-onset hereditary ataxia in Scotland .
A systematic search for cases of adult-onset hereditary ataxia was conducted on location in Scotland .
The investigation resulted in the discovery of eight pedigrees with 42 patients of whom 16 were alive in 1975 .
Nine patients were examined by the authors and recent hospital records were available on the remaining seven .
The clinical features were quite variable .
In declining order of frequency , findings were gait and <START:PHENOTYPE> limb ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> , extrapyramidal motor disturbances , <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired vibratory sense <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , defects of extraocular movements and nystagmus , reflex depression , Babinski signs , impaired joint position sense , muscle weakness , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and mental abnormalities .
Foot deformity occurred only once .
Inheritance was compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission , but complicated by consanguinity in two families .
The minimum prevalence was calculated as 0.31/100,000 .
Autopsy in two members in one family revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> olivopontocerebellar degeneration <END> .
Expression profiling of <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> : PDGFRA and the RAS/MAPK pathway as therapeutic targets for metastatic disease .
Little is known about the genetic regulation of <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> dissemination , but metastatic <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> is highly associated with poor outcome .
We obtained expression profiles of 23 primary medulloblastomas clinically designated as either metastatic ( M+ ) or non-metastatic ( M0 ) and identified 85 genes whose expression differed significantly between classes .
Using a class prediction algorithm based on these genes and a leave-one-out approach , we assigned sample class to these tumors ( M+ or M0 ) with 72 % accuracy and to four additional independent tumors with 100% accuracy .
We also assigned the metastatic <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> cell line Daoy to the metastatic class .
Notably , platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRA ) and members of the downstream RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signal transduction pathway are upregulated in M+ tumors .
Immunohistochemical validation on an independent set of tumors shows significant overexpression of PDGFRA in M+ tumors compared to M0 tumors .
Using in vitro assays , we show that platelet-derived growth factor alpha ( PDGFA ) enhances <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> migration and increases downstream MAP2K1 ( MEK1 ) , MAP2K2 ( MEK2) , MAPK1 ( p42 MAPK ) and MAPK3 ( p44 MAPK ) phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner .
Neutralizing antibodies to PDGFRA blocks MAP2K1 , MAP2K2 and MAPK1/3 phosphorylation , whereas U0126 , a highly specific inhibitor of MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 , also blocks MAPK1/3 .
Both inhibit migration and prevent PDGFA-stimulated migration .
These results provide the first insight into the genetic regulation of <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> metastasis and are the first to suggest a role for PDGFRA and the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway in <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> metastasis .
Inhibitors of PDGFRA and RAS proteins should therefore be considered for investigation as possible novel therapeutic strategies against <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> .
Genetic heterogeneity of syndromic X-linked recessive microphthalmia-anophthalmia : is Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> a single disorder ?
Nonsyndromic congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> or anophthalmia is a heterogeneous malformation with autosomal dominant , autosomal recessive , and X-linked modes of inheritance .
Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome comprises <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> with mental retardation , malformed ears , skeletal anomalies , and is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern .
Prior studies have shown linkage of both isolated ( or nonsyndromic ) anophthalmos ( ANOP1 , [ MIM 301590] ) and Lenz syndrome [ MIM 309800] to Xq27-q28 .
Nonsyndromic colobomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> [ MIM 300345 ] has been linked to Xp11 .4-Xq11 .1 .
We describe a five-generation African-American family with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> or anophthalmia , mental retardation , and urogenital anomalies , in an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern , consistent with Lenz syndrome .
Initial linkage analysis with microsatellite markers excluded the region in Xq27-q28 previously reported as a candidate region for ANOP1 [ MIM 301590 ] .
An X-chromosome scan revealed linkage to a 10-cM region between markers DXS228 and DXS992 in Xp11 .4-p21.2 .
Multipoint analysis gave a maximum LOD score of 2.46 at marker DXS993 .
These data show that X-linked recessive syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> exhibits genetic heterogeneity .
In addition , it suggests that Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome , previously thought to be a single disorder , may represent an amalgam of two distinct disorders .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , infantile spasms , spastic quadriplegia , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in three siblings .
A sibship consisting of three siblings , one male and two females with unrelated parents , showed a clinical syndrome including : infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and spastic quadriplegia .
The pneumoencephalogram performed in two sibs showed <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> aqueductal stenosis <END> with tri-ventricular dilatation .
The disorder did not show a progressive course with deterioration of mental and neurologic functions .
No biochemical or cytogenetic defect could be identified .
Complement fixation for cytomegalovirus was negative .
This syndrome complex is probably inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
The clinical and the genetic aspects of the syndrome are discussed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> , DYT2 -like primary <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> : a new family .
The authors report the clinical characteristics of a Sephardic Jewish kindred with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> DYT2 -like primary <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> .
Three siblings had childhood onset of limb <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , and slow progression to generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> with predominant cranio-cervical involvement .
There were no other abnormal signs , apart from <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> and jerky tremor over a 12-year follow-up .
All investigations for other causes of primary and secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> had normal results .
Recessive hypophosphataemic <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> , and possible aetiology of the 'vitamin D-resistant ' syndrome .
Two out of 3 children of a first-cousin marriage presented with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> in infancy and are now adult .
Their disease has shown continued activity , marked resistance to treatment with vitamin D , <START:PHENOTYPE> early fusion of cranial sutures <END> , greatly <START:PHENOTYPE> increased bone density <END> , nerve deafness , and life-long <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> unaffected by treatment .
Both parents and a third sib were normal clinically and biochemically .
Blood grouping supported both stated paternity and parental consanguinity .
Genetics of this unique disease can only be explained satisfactorily on the basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> transmission , a mode not previously reported in primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> .
This homozygous disease resembles an exaggerated form of common X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> , though it is caused by a different gene .
Although rare , it is particularly important because of the information it provides on the pathogenesis of both forms .
We propose that both syndromes may result from multiple target organ unresponsiveness to 1 ,25- dihydroxycholecalciferol in intestine , kidney , bone , and parathyroid gland .
Epidemiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in families in Iceland .
The Icelandic Cancer Registry has collected 989 pedigrees of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> patients since 1972 .
In addition to the probands , the families also include 401 other women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , so family information exists for 1390 women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> out of a total of 2748 diagnosed with the disease from 1910 to 1988 .
Most of the probands have been selected with care to avoid the bias of selecting families with a known history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
After excluding all those who did not conform to the strict selection criteria , 947 pedigrees remained for this analysis .
First , second , and third degree relatives all had a significantly increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> : 2.26 , 1.43 , and 1.49 , respectively .
Male relatives also had a significantly increased risk , whereas females related by marriage had not .
Of the first degree relatives , sisters had the largest increase in risk .
When pedigrees were classified by the age at diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> of the proband , the risk was highest in the relatives of probands who were young at diagnosis .
Bilaterality of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> increased the risk in relatives and the highest risk ( 9.04 ) was found in sisters of probands with bilateral disease and an age at diagnosis of first cancer of less than 45 years ( 95 % confidence limits 4.14 , 17 .18 ) .
Sisters consistently have the highest risk , significantly higher than other first degree relatives .
This points to an important role of shared environmental aetiological factors acting after birth and it can not yet be excluded that most of the increase in risk can be explained by this .( ABSTR ACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans : a family study of seven male cases and six female carriers .
Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans ( KFSD ) is a rare X linked disease which is characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> follicular hyperkeratosis <END> of the skin and corneal dystrophy.
Seven male patients and six female carriers are described .
Special attention has been paid to the dermatological and ophthalmic markers of KFSD in patients and carriers .
The most prominent features present in the male patients were <START:PHENOTYPE> follicular hyperkeratosis <END> , hyperkeratosis of the calcaneal regions of the soles , scarring alopecia of the scalp , absence of eyebrows and eyelashes , and <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal dystrophy <END> accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> .
They also had high cuticles on the fingernails which has not been described before .
Carriers often have <START:PHENOTYPE> dry skin <END> , minimal <START:PHENOTYPE> follicular hyperkeratosis <END> , and mild hyperkeratosis of the calcaneal areas of the soles .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal dystrophy <END> without <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> was observed in one female carrier .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital contractures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip/palate <END> , and developmental impairment : a distinct syndrome .
Brothers were affected with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital contractures <END> , multiple cutaneous manifestations of <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip/palate <END> , and psychomotor and growth impairment .
High resolution prometaphase chromosomes were normal .
Molecular studies of DNA markers , closely flanking the <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> hypohidrotic <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> locus , did not show evidence of a submicroscopic deletion from the Xq12-q13 region .
The parents and a normal sister exhibited none of these findings .
This constellation of anomalies appears to represent a unique AR or XLR syndrome .
Wolcott-Rallison syndrome in two siblings with isolated central <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> .
Two sibs with an <START:PHENOTYPE> infantile onset <END> of hyperglycemia , recurrent hepatitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> renal insufficiency <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and skeletal <START:PHENOTYPE> epiphyseal dysplasia <END> are described .
Clinical presentation and radiological features are suggestive of Wolcott-Rallison syndrome , a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disease .
In both of our cases we found evidence of central <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> , which appears to be an associated feature of this syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypothyroidism <END> should be suspected and screened for in all cases of Wolcott-Rallison syndrome .

Severe neonatal non-dystrophic <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> secondary to a novel mutation of the voltage-gated sodium channel ( SCN4A ) gene .
We report on a patient with a severe , rare neonatal form of non-dystrophic <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> .
The patient presented with facial dysmorphism , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle hypertrophy <END> , severe constipation , psychomotor delay , and frequent cold-induced episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> leading to severe hypoxia and loss of consciousness .
Muscle biopsy was non-specific and electromyography revealed intense generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> .
The myotonic episodes improved after introducing oral mexiletine and maintaining room temperature at 28 degrees C .
The patient died at 20 months of age following a bronchopulmonary infection .
A previously undescribed de novo heterozygous c.3891 C > A change , which predicts p.N1297 K in the SCN4A gene .
Mutations within the voltage-gated sodium channel alpha-subunit gene ( SCN4A ) have been described in association with several phenotypes including paramyotonia congenita , hyperkalemic or hypokalemic periodic paralysis , and potassium-aggravated myotonias .
The cold-sensitive episodes of stiffness followed by <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> suggested the diagnosis of channelopathy in our patient .
However , her neonatal onset , the triggering of severe episodes by exposure to modest decreases in temperature , involvement of respiratory muscles with prolonged apnea , early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle hypertrophy <END> , psychomotor retardation , and fatal outcome are evocative of a distinct clinical subtype .
Our observation expands the phenotypic spectrum of sodium channelopathies .
Femoral hypoplasia-unusual facies syndrome in infants of diabetic mothers .
Three children with the femoral hypoplasia-unusual facies syndrome are described .
Two had the characteristic facial pattern of <START:PHENOTYPE> upslanted palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin upper lip <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic alae nasi <END> .
The other , an infant girl who died within 24 hours after birth , had a cleft lip , which distorted some of the other features .
She also had a <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , as did one of the two older boys .
All three children had ear defects , upper limb involvement , and rib , vertebral , lower extremity , and genitourinary tract abnormalities .
The infant girl died of lung hypoplasia associated with dysplastic kidneys and widely patent ductus arteriosus .
All three were infants of diabetic mothers , one mother having developed overt diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy .
A literature review of 36 reported cases of FH/UFS revealed 12 individuals who were IDMs , establishing a strong relationship of the syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> maternal diabetes <END> .
A multifactorial inheritance model fits with the reported patients , with the relationship to diabetes , and with the similarity of FH/UFS to caudal regression , another condition related to <START:PHENOTYPE> maternal diabetes <END> .
Neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> type II: an X-linked recessive inherited disorder .
A new case of neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> type II is reported .
Neonatal acidosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> , and hyperammonemia were characteristic .
The baby died at four days of age .
Organic acid analysis revealed massive <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> with elevated concentrations of butyric , isobutyric , n-butyric , and isovaleric acid in his urine .
The baby 's pedigree suggested strongly an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance .
Clinically , biochemically , and genetically <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> type II is an heterogeneous disorder .
The neonatal form is an X-linked inherited disorder which presents early in life , and is associated with metabolic acidosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> , and hyperammonemia , and leads to death in the neonatal period .
The mild form is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> inherited disease which may present even in adults , and is associated with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> without ketosis and usually improves .
Nevertheless the same unusual organic acid pattern is observed in both forms .

Wolfram ( DIDMOAD ) syndrome : a complex long-term problem in management .
We describe five patients with Wolfram syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and deafness ) .
Three of the patients appear to have had very gradual onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> at an early age yet all patients when tested for C-peptide response to glucagon were severely deficient .
All patients are registered blind from primary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , two have severe hearing difficulties and three high tone sensorineural hearing loss on audiometry .
Four patients have cranial <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> which in two cases is partial and of gradual onset and was attributed to poor control of the <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> .
In one case treatment of the insipidus relieved enuresis .
All five patients have evidence of dilatation of the urinary tract and one patient is managed in the long-term by self-catheterisation which has resulted in one episode of bacteraemia .
One patient has marked <START:PHENOTYPE> testicular atrophy <END> and investigation reveals this to be due to primary hypogonadism and not to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction .
One female patient had her menarche delayed until the age of 19 years but has subsequently had the only successful pregnancy in a patient with this syndrome of which we are aware .
A three generations family with blepharo-naso-facial malformations suggestive of Pashayan syndrome .
Blepharo-naso-facial syndrome , described by Pashayan et al . (10 ) , is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , lateral displacement and stenosis of lacrimal puncta , bulky nose , <START:PHENOTYPE> mask-like facies <END> , trapezoÃ¯dal upper lip , <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We report on a family with this rare malformation syndrome , confirming the existence of this syndrome and its dominant inheritance .
The proband had a fleshy nose , a prominant nose bridge , an hypoplastic midface , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> with temporal displacement of puncta , lacrimal excretory obstruction .
CNS <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> increased deep tendon reflexes <END> , Babinski reflexes , poor coordination and joint laxity .
The proband 's mother , brother and maternal grandfather also showed manifestations of the syndrome .
The proband and his brother had delayed developmental milestones .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hearing impairment <END> was present in the proband , his mother and his grandfather but was absent in the proband 's brother .
The blepharonasofacial syndrome was described by Pashayan et al . (10 ) in four members of one family , two male and one female sib and their mother .
Two other sibs were unaffected .
Many of the features of the blepharo-facio-nasal syndrome also occur in other well known syndromes i.e . Waardenburg syndrome .
The pedigrees of the family of Pashayan et al . (10 ) and of our family are compatible with Mendelian dominant inheritance , either autosomal or X-linked .
X-linked dominant inheritance cannot be ruled out except by male-to-male transmission , which does not occur in these families .
Pashayan et al . (10 ) suggested that an autosomal gene with variable expressivity appears more likely .
More families are needed for defining the transmission of the condition and for mapping the gene involved in the blepharo-naso-facial syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Periodontal disease <END> in three siblings with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
The periodontal status and treatment of three teenagers in a Finnish family with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is described .
The mother was also diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
At initial examination , the 15 -year-old male and the 10-year-old female had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> periodontitis <END> , whereas the 13-year-old male had oral ulcerations but no significant <START:PHENOTYPE> periodontal disease <END> .
The two siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> periodontitis <END> were treated and followed approximately 5 years .
It was concluded that periodontal therapy including scaling , surgery , and use of antimicrobial agents can be successful in patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , and that such patients are not necessarily candidates for full mouth extraction .
The role of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in which was used in the treatment of these patients remains to be established .
Heterogeneity versus variability in megalocornea-mental retardation ( MMR ) syndromes : report of new cases and delineation of 4 probable types .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Megalocornea <END> ( corneal diameter > or = 13 mm ) is associated with mental and neurological impairment , and minor anomalies in NeuhÃ¤user syndrome ( megalocornea-mental retardation syndrome ) .
Here we report 4 new cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Those unrelated patients have a consistent pattern of anomalies with possible recessive inheritance which clearly differs from that of the original patients of NeuhÃ¤user et al . [ 1975 ] .
We discuss the heterogeneity of the syndromes with <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Based on these cases and on a review of the literature , we suggest a provisional clinically oriented classification in 5 subtypes : (1 ) a recessive form type NeuhÃ¤user ( with <START:PHENOTYPE> iris hypoplasia <END> and minor anomalies) , (2 ) a recessive form type Frank-Temtamy ( with camptodactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> and growth retardation ) , (3 ) a recessive type 3 , including our 4 personal cases ( with normal irides , severe hypotonia , relative or absolute <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and minor anomalies) , (4 ) a possible Frydman type ( with normal irides , megalencephaly and obesity ) , and (5 ) provisionally unclassifiable cases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Craniosynostosis <END> and kidney malformation in a case of Hennekam syndrome .
Hennekam syndrome is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome which was described for the first time in 1989 .
Here , we present a girl with <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal lymphangiectasia <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> of limbs , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and facial anomalies consistent with the diagnosis of Hennekam syndrome .
In addition , she had an <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopic kidney <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> of the coronal suture , 2 manifestations not previously reported in this syndrome .
While the molecular basis of Hennekam syndrome remains , as yet , unknown , this report illustrates its variable clinical expression .
[Does the ataxo-choreic form of DRPLA exist in Europe ?
Search of mutation in 120 families] .
Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy ( DRPLA ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a degeneration of cerebellar and pallidal efferents , more frequent in Japan .
Isolated cases are also encountered .
Patients present with variable combination of signs including <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , with onset from childhood to the seventh decade .
Clinically , DRPLA may be undistinguishable from other genetic disorders , in particular Huntington 's disease or the spinocerebellar ataxias .
The genetic basis of the inherited form of DRPLA is an expansion to more than 49 repeats of an unstable trinucleotide ( CAG ) in the DRPLA gene on the short arm of chromosome 12 .
We determined the frequency of this mutation in patients with the DRPLA phenotype .
One hundred and seventeen patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , from 94 families and 23 isolated cases , as well as 3 patients from families with undiagnosed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> neurodegenerative disorders were investigated for the presence of the expanded sequence .
None of the patients carried this mutation .
This finding suggests that DRPLA is rare in the French population .
The search for the DRPLA mutation is justified in patients with the DRPLA phenotype , however , since genetic counselling is often requested and neither clinical , nor neuropathological examinations permit a definite diagnosis of the underlying disease .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Phocomelia <END> : a worldwide descriptive epidemiologic study in a large series of cases from the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research , and overview of the literature .
Epidemiologic data on <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> are scarce .
This study presents an epidemiologic analysis of the largest series of <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> cases known to date .
Data were provided by 19 birth defect surveillance programs , all members of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research .
Depending on the program , data corresponded to a period from 1968 through 2006 .
A total of 22,74 0 ,933 live births , stillbirths and , for some programs , elective terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly ( ETO PFA ) were monitored .
After a detailed review of clinical data , only true <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> cases were included .
Descriptive data are presented and additional analyses compared isolated cases with those with multiple congenital anomalies ( MCA) , excluding syndromes .
We also briefly compared congenital anomalies associated with nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> with those presented with amelia , another rare severe congenital limb defect .
A total of 141 <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> cases registered gave an overall total prevalence of 0.62 per 100,000 births ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.52-0.73 ) .
Three programs ( Australia Victoria , South America ECLAMC , Italy North East ) had significantly different prevalence estimates .
Most cases ( 53 .2% ) had isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> , while 9.9% had syndromes .
Most nonsyndromic cases were monomelic (55 .9% ) , with an excess of left ( 64 .9% ) and upper limb ( 64 .9% ) involvement .
Most nonsyndromic cases ( 66 .9% ) were live births ; most isolated cases ( 57 .9% ) weighed more than 2 ,499 g ; most MCA (6 0.7% ) weighed less than 2,50 0 g , and were more likely stillbirths (30.8% ) or ETOPFA ( 15 .4% ) than isolated cases .
The most common associated defects were musculoskeletal , cardiac , and intestinal .
Epidemiological differences between <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> and amelia highlighted possible differences in their causes .

Prevalence of endocrine abnormalities in patients with the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> and in their families .
To evalute the frequency of associated and hereditary endocrinopathies in the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> , 10 patients with the syndrome were studied .
In seven of them , coexisting endocrine disease was found .
In six , the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> was probably a feature of multiple endocrine adenomatosis type I , whereas Cushing 's syndrome in the remaining patient may have been caused by the production of an ACTH-like substance by a mixed pancreatic tumor .
A total of 109 family members , including all living first degree relatives over 15 years of age , were screened for endocrine abnormalities .
All six patients with evidence of multiple endocrine adenomatosis type I had relatives with endocrinopathies .
In the families of the four other patients with the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> , no endocrine abnormalities were found .
During this study four new cases of pituitary tumor , 17 of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> , seven of the <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> and one of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulinoma <END> were detected .
Although most of the disorders were asymptomatic , this clearly indicates that patients suffering from <START:PHENOTYPE> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome <END> and also their families should undergo detailed endocrine studies .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> due to dominant goniodysgenesis .
A new concept of the heredity of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Three typical pedigrees with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> are presented , in which dominant goniodysgenesis is shown to be the actual genetic trait .
Because of a marked variation in the expressivity of dysgenesis , the symptoms of the genetic malformation ( elevated intraocular pressure and subsequent <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> ) may appear early or late in life .
Therefore , there is no justification in letting the patient 's age at the onset of the symptoms decide the classification or the mode of inheritance of the <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> ( infantile , juvenile , simple) , when the common etiologic factor is a dominant dysgenic trait .
Consequently , the term " congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> " is inadequate and even misleading for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> caused by an inborn malformation , but which may be manifested only after several years or even decades .
Instead a new term "dysgenic <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> " is suggested as the logical term that also indicates the etiology .
Deletion in the OA1 gene in a family with congenital X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> .
To elucidate the molecular genetic defect of X linked congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> associated with macular hypoplasia in three white males of a three generation family with clear features of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> in only one of them .
A three generation family with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> following X linked inheritance , and associated with macular hypoplasia was clinically examined ( three males and two obligate carriers ) .
Flash VEP was performed to look for albino misrouting .
DNA samples were subjected to PCR and subsequent analysis using SSCP for all exons of the OA1 gene .
RT- PCR was performed on a mRNA preparation from a naevus from one patient .
PCR products presenting divergent banding patterns in SSCP and from the RT- PCR were sequenced directly using cycle sequencing with fluorescent chain termination nucleotides and electrophoresis in a capillary sequencer .
The index case ( patient 1 , IV.1 ) was diagnosed with X linked OA1 at the age of 3 months because of typical clinical features : congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , iris translucency , macular hypoplasia , fundus hypopigmentation , normal pigmentation of skin and hair , and typical carrier signs of OA1 in his mother and maternal grandmother .
Pigmentation of the iris and fundus had increased at the last examination at age 4 years .
Albino misrouting was present at this age .
In the maternal uncle ( III.3 , 51 years ) who also suffered from congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> there was clear macular hypoplasia and stromal focal hypopigmentation of the iris but no iris translucency or fundus hypopigmentation .
Patient 3 ( II.3 , 79 years , maternal uncle of patient III.3 ) had congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> and was highly myopic .
The fundus appearance was typical for excessive <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> including macular changes .
The iris did not show any translucency .
Molecular genetic analysis revealed a novel 14 bp deletion of the OA1 gene at nt816 in exon 6 .
The mutation abolishes four amino acids ( Leu 253-Ile-Ile-Cys ) and covers the splice site .
Nucleotides 814/815 are used as a new splice donor thus producing a frame shift in codon 252 and a new stop codon at codon 259 .
Macular hypoplasia without clinically detectable hypopigmentation as the only sign of X linked OA1 has been reported occasionally in African-American , Japanese , and white patients .
The present family shows absent hypopigmentation in two patients of a white family with a deletion in the OA1 gene .
We propose a model of OA1 that allows increase of pigmentation with age .
We hypothesise that macular hypoplasia in all forms of albinism depends on the extracellular DOPA level during embryogenesis , and that in OA1 postnatal normalisation of the extracellular DOPA level due to delayed distribution and membrane budding/fusion of melanosomes in melanocytes results in increasing pigmentation .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , deafness , and renal disease .
The syndrome of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , deafness , and renal disease was manifest in at least eight members in three generations of a family .
They had a lifelong history of bleeding , usually as <START:PHENOTYPE> epistaxis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral sensorineural deafness <END> starting in late childhood or the teenage years , and persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> with varying degrees of renal dysfunction .
Two members died at a young age , one from central nervous system hemorrhage , the other from <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic renal failure <END> .
Splenectomy and steroid therapy have been of transient benefit .
There was dominant inheritance of the syndrome .
Hematologic studies showed <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , large platelets , and megakaryocytic hyperplasia of the bone marrow .
In contrast to a previous report , our studies showed that affected members had normal in-vitro platelet function and normal ultrastructural platelet morphology .
At autopsy , histologic changes in the kidney of one affected family member were indistinguishable from those reported in classic hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> nephritis <END> with nerve deafness ( Alport 's syndrome ) .
Multiple malformations in a male and maternal osteopathia strata with cranial sclerosis ( OSCS ) .
Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis ( OSCS) , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing impairment <END> and a characteristic facial appearance is the clinical manifestation in carrier women of an X-linked disease .
We report on a family with typical OSCS in the mother , a maternal aunt and the grandmother , and multiple severe malformations in the son .
He was affected by cranial sclerosis with <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing impairment <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , thoracic dysplasia , mesenterium commune with non-rotation of the gut , <START:PHENOTYPE> anal atresia <END> , bilateral cutaneous syndactyly of 3rd and 4th fingers , duplication of the distal phalanx of 2nd and 3rd fingers on the right , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> fibular aplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfeet <END> , developmental retardation , epileptic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , hypothyroidism , and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis .
The X-inactivation pattern in peripheral leucocytes of one informative carrier woman was random .
Our case and several literature reports confirm that males which are hemizygous for the OSCS trait suffer from a dysmorphic syndrome with characteristic multiple malformations as a distinct entity .
There is , at present , no reason to assume genetic heterogeneity with an autosomal dominant OSCS variant .
Further delineation of a syndrome of cerebellar vermis hypo/aplasia , oligophrenia , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> .
Three children are described from two sibships .
They share infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with hypo/aplastic vermis , hepatic fibrocirrhosis , slender-shaped skeleton , peculiar face , and <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate mental retardation <END> .
One of them had a kidney biopsy that showed mild interstitial fibrosis and amyloid deposit , but had no functional impairment .
Another suffered moderate proximal tubular acidosis .
Two children had unilateral or bilateral choroidal <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> .
This pattern of defects is consistent with a syndrome previously reported in two other sibships .
The acronym COACH ( Cerebellar vermis hypo/aplasia , Oligophrenia , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Coloboma <END> , Hepatic fibrocirrhosis ) is suggested .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> syndrome of camptodactyly , clinodactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> , and bifid toes .
We report on a 25-year follow-up of a Pakistani kindred with a unique combination of camptodactyly and clinodactyly of 5th fingers , mesoaxial camptodactyly of toes , and ulnar deviation of 3rd fingers .
The less common anomalies in the affected subjects include <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> involving all digits , and bifid toes .
This condition is grossly bilateral , symmetrical , and affects upper and lower limbs of the 26 affected subjects in the kindred .
The comparable number of affected male and female subjects ( chi(2 ) = 0.154 , P < 0.1 ) , disease allele transmission by mother and father , and the malformation segregation in four consecutive generations are strongly suggestive of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Differential diagnosis considered <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> types II , III , and V . Only type II <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> manifests noticeable phenotypic overlap with the clinical presentation in this family ; however , the typical type II <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> changes are absent .
To the best of our knowledge , this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> limb phenotype has not been reported previously .
A mutation in PEX19 causes a severe clinical phenotype in a patient with peroxisomal biogenesis disorder .
Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders ( PBD ) are groups of inherited neurometabolic disorders caused by defects in PEX genes .
We report on a female infant , born to a consanguineous parents ( first degree cousins ) , who presented with inactivity , poor sucking , and hypotonia early in the neonatal period .
She had subtle dysmorphic features .
Liver function tests were impaired with raised liver enzymes , conjugated and unconjugated <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperbilirubinemia <END> .
CT of the brain showed diffuse bilateral changes .
She developed <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> with an abnormal EEG . Plasma very long chain fatty acid analysis showed high C26: 0 levels and increasedC26: 0/C22:0 and C24: 0/C22:0 ratios , which is consistent with a PBD .
Studies in fibroblasts including plasmalogen biosynthesis , peroxisomal fatty acid alfa and beta oxidation confirmed the diagnosis of PBD . Immunofluoresence microscopy revealed the absence of peroxisomes in fibroblasts .
The patient was assigned to the PEX19 complementation group .
Subsequent mutation analysis of the PEX19 gene revealed homozygosity for a c.320delA frameshift mutation .
The patient had a stormy course with multiple admissions to the pediatric intensive care unit with pneumonia , liver impairment , sepsis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
At 1 year of age she developed metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap , proteinuria , aminoaciduria , and glucosuria consistent with a <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular defect <END> .
Abdominal ultrasound showed multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> gallstones <END> .
Other causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> gallstones <END> like haemoglobinopathy were excluded .
So far , only two siblings had been reported with mutations in the PEX19 gene .
Our patient showed a previously unrecognized association of <START:PHENOTYPE> gallstones <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular defect <END> with a PBD .
The risk of recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> deep venous thrombosis <END> among heterozygous carriers of both factor V Leiden and the G20210A prothrombin mutation .
Point mutations in the factor V gene ( factor V Leiden ) and the prothrombin gene ( the substitution of A for G at position 20210 ) are the most common causes of inherited thrombophilia .
Whether or not factor V Leiden increases the risk of recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> deep venous thrombosis <END> is controversial , and there is no information on the risk of recurrence among carriers of both mutations .
We studied a retrospective cohort of 624 patients who were referred for a first episode of <START:PHENOTYPE> deep venous thrombosis <END> .
After excluding 212 patients with other inherited or acquired causes of thrombophilia , we compared 112 patients who were heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden with 17 patients who were heterozygous for both factor V Leiden and the prothrombin mutation and 283 patients who had neither mutation .
The relative risk of recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> deep venous thrombosis <END> was calculated with use of a proportional-hazards model .
Patients who were heterozygous for factor V Leiden alone had a risk of recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> deep venous thrombosis <END> that was similar to that among patients who had neither mutation ( relative risk , 1 .1 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.7 to 1.6 ; P= 0.76 ) .
In contrast , patients who were heterozygous for both factor V Leiden and the prothrombin mutation had a higher risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent thrombosis <END> than did carriers of factor V Leiden alone ( relative risk , 2.6 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 1.3 to 5 .1 ; P= 0.002 ) .
When the analysis was restricted to patients with spontaneous recurrences ( i .e. , ones that occurred in the absence of transient risk factors for venous thrombosis ) , the risk among carriers of both mutations , as compared with carriers of factor V Leiden alone , remained high ( relative risk , 3.7 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 1.7 to 7.7 ; P< 0.001 ) , particularly if the first event had also been spontaneous ( relative risk , 5.4 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 2.0 to 14 .1 ; P< 0.001 ) .
In contrast , the risk of recurrence in the presence of transient risk factors was similar among carriers of both mutations and carriers of factor V Leiden alone .
The risk of recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> deep venous thrombosis <END> is similar among carriers of factor V Leiden and patients without this mutation .
Carriers of both factor V Leiden and the G20210A prothrombin mutation have an increased risk of recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> deep venous thrombosis <END> after a first episode and are candidates for lifelong anticoagulation .
A case of deletion 14( q22.1-->q22.3 ) associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> and pituitary abnormalities .
An interstitial deletion of the region q22.1-->q22.3 of chromosome 14 is described in a child with bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> , dysmorphic features including <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small tongue <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> , developmental and growth retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> with a <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> .
Interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 14 are extremely rare , but this case seems to confirm that the region q22 is specifically concerned with pituitary and eye development .
Molecular analysis of the Smith-Magenis syndrome : a possible contiguous-gene syndrome associated with del(17 ) ( p11 .2 ) .
We undertook clinical evaluation (32 cases ) and molecular evaluation ( 31 cases ) of unrelated patients affected with Smith-Magenis syndrome ( SMS ) associated with an interstitial deletion of band p11 .2 of chromosome 17 . Patients were evaluated both clinically and electrophysiologically for peripheral neuropathy , since markers showing close linkage to one form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ( CMT1A ) map to this chromosomal region .
The common clinical findings were broad <START:PHENOTYPE> flat midface <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , brachydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> speech delay <END> , and hoarse , deep voice .
Fifty-five percent of the patients showed clinical signs ( e.g. , decreased or <START:PHENOTYPE> absent deep tendon reflexes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes planus <END> or pes cavus , decreased sensitivity to pain , and decreased leg muscle mass ) suggestive of peripheral neuropathy.
However , unlike patients with CMT1 A , these patients demonstrated normal nerve conduction velocities .
Self-destructive behaviors , primarily onychotillomania and polyembolokoilamania , were observed in 67 % of the patients , and significant symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep disturbance <END> were observed in 62 % .
The absence of REM sleep was demonstrated by polysomnography in two patients .
Southern analysis indicated that most patients were deleted for five 17p11 .2 markers--FG1 ( D17S446 ) , 1516 ( D17S258 ) , pYNM67- R5 ( D17S29) , pA1 0-41 ( D17S71 ) , and pS6.1- HB2 ( D17S445 ) --thus defining a region which appears to be critical to SMS .
The deletion was determined to be of paternal origin in nine patients and of maternal origin in six patients .
The apparent random parental origin of deletion documented in 15 patients suggests that genomic imprinting does not play a role in the expression of the SMS clinical phenotype .
Our findings suggest that SMS is likely a contiguous-gene deletion syndrome which comprises characteristic clinical features , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , clinical signs of peripheral neuropathy , abnormal sleep function , and specific behavioral anomalies .
Cold-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> syndrome is caused by mutations in the CRLF1 gene .
In 1978 , Sohar et al . described a strikingly peculiar syndrome in two Israeli sisters .
These young women responded to environmental temperatures of 18 degrees C-7 degrees C with profuse <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> on large segments on their back and chest .
Both had additional abnormalities , including a <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nasal voice <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , inability to fully extend their elbows , and <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> .
We have observed this disorder in two Norwegian brothers .
Genome-wide screening in the two families , followed by saturation marker studies and linkage analysis , identified a 1.4-Mb homozygous candidate region on chromosome 19p12 .
The maximum multipoint LOD score was 4.22 .
In both families , DNA sequencing of 25 genes within the candidate region identified potentially deleterious CRLF1 sequence variants that were not found in unaffected control individuals .
Our findings confirm that the cold-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder that is probably caused by impaired function of the CRLF1 gene , and they suggest important developmental functions for human CRLF1 .
Simultaneous occurrence of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> alveolar cell carcinoma <END> in one family .
The coexistence of interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> alveolar cell carcinoma <END> is well known .
The familial occurrence of a combination of these two entities , however , is very rare .
We present a family of which five members had diffuse interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
Three of them had in addition <START:PHENOTYPE> alveolar cell carcinoma <END> .
In a sixth family member , evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> alveolar cell carcinoma <END> was present without proven interstitial fibrosis .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait is suggested as the mode of inheritance of both interstitial fibrosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> alveolar cell carcinoma <END> in this family .
Glycogen storage disease in adults .
To identify complications amenable to prevention in adults with glycogen storage disease ( GSD ) types Ia , Ib , and III and to determine the effect of the disease on social factors .
Case series and clinical review .
Referral medical centers in the United States and Canada .
All patients with GSD-Ia ( 37 patients) , GSD-Ib ( 5 patients) , and GSD-III ( 9 patients ) who were 18 years of age or older .
Ultrasound or radiographic studies identified liver adenomas , nephrocalcinosis , or <START:PHENOTYPE> kidney stones <END> .
Radiographic studies identified osteopenia .
Reports of the clinical examination , serum chemistry results , and social data were obtained .
For patients with GSD-Ia , problems included <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> (90% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> (100% ) , hepatic adenomas ( 75% ) , anemia ( 81% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> or microalbuminuria ( 67% ) , kidney calcifications ( 65% ) , osteopenia or fractures or both ( 27% ) , increased alkaline phosphatase ( 61% ) and gamma-glutamyltransferase ( 93% ) activities , and increased serum cholesterol ( 76% ) and triglyceride (100% ) levels .
Hyperuricemia was frequent ( 89% ) .
Patients with GSD-Ib had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent bacterial infections <END> and gingivitis .
In patients with GSD-III , 67 % ( 6 of 9 ) had increased creatinine kinase activity .
Four of these patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> and cardiomyopathy.
For GSD-Ia , hyperuricemia and pyelonephritis should be treated to prevent nephrocalcinosis and additional renal damage .
For GSD-Ib , granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor may prevent bacterial infections .
For GSD-III , more data are required to determine whether the <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> can be prevented .
Most of the patients with GSD-I and GSD-III had 12 or more years of education and were either currently in school or employed .
A unique form of mental retardation with a distinctive phenotype maps to Xq26-q27.
We report a novel X-linked mental retardation ( XLMR ) syndrome , with characteristic facial dysmorphic features , segregating in a large North Carolina family .
Only males are affected , over four generations .
Clinical findings in the seven living affected males include a moderate degree of mental retardation ( MR) , <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse facies <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> puffy eyelids <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent supraorbital ridges <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> bulbous nose <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent lower lip <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , and large testicles .
Cephalometric measurements suggest that the affected males have a distinctive craniofacial skeletal structure , when compared with normative measures .
Obligate-carrier females are unaffected with MR , but the results of cephalometric skeletal analysis suggest craniofacial dysmorphisms intermediate between affected males and normative control individuals .
Unaffected male relatives show no clinical or cephalometric resemblance to affected males .
The blood-lymphocyte karyotype and the results of DNA analysis for fragile-X syndrome and of other routine investigations are normal .
Linkage analysis for polymorphic DNA markers spanning the X chromosome established linkage to Xq26-q27.
Maximum LOD scores were obtained at marker DXS1047 ( maximum LOD score = 3.1 at recombination fraction 0 ) . By use of haplotype analysis , we have localized the gene for this condition to an 18-cM genetic interval flanked by ATA59C05 and GATA31E08 .
On the basis of both the clinical phenotype and the mapping data , we were able to exclude other reported XLMR conditions .
Therefore , we believe that a unique recessive XLMR syndrome with a distinctive and recognizable phenotype is represented in this family .
A third novel locus for primary <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> maps to chromosome 9q34 .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion in an individual with a head circumference >/=4 SDs below the expected age-and-sex mean .
There is associated <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate mental retardation <END> , and neuroimaging shows a small but structurally normal cerebral cortex .
The inheritance pattern in the majority of cases is considered to be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
Although genetic heterogeneity for this clinical phenotype had been expected , this has only recently been demonstrated , with the mapping of two loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> : MCPH1 at 8p and MCPH2 at 19q .
We have studied a large multiaffected consanguineous pedigree , using a whole-genome search , and have identified a third locus , MCPH3 at 9q34 .
The minimal critical region is approximately 12 cM , being defined by the markers cen-D9S1872 -D9S159-tel , with a maximum two-point LOD score of 3.76 ( recombination fraction 0 ) observed for the marker D9S290 .
Increased expression in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of CAPON in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and bipolar disorder .
We have previously reported linkage of markers on chromosome 1q22 to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , a finding supported by several independent studies .
Within this linkage region , we have identified significant linkage disequilibrium between <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and markers within the gene for carboxyl-terminal PDZ ligand of neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( CAPON ) .
Prior sequencing of the ten exons of CAPON failed to reveal a coding mutation associated with illness .
We screened a human fetal brain cDNA library and identified a new isoform of CAPON that consists of the terminal two exons of the gene , and verified the expression of the predicted corresponding protein in human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) .
We examined the expression levels of both the ten-exon CAPON transcript and this new isoform in postmortem brain samples from the Stanley Array Collection .
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of RNA from the DLPFC in 105 individuals ( 35 with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , 35 with bipolar disorder , and 35 psychiatrically normal controls ) revealed significantly ( p < 0.005 ) increased expression of the new isoform in both <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and bipolar disorder .
Furthermore , this increased expression was significantly associated ( p < 0.05 ) with genotype at three single-nucleotide polymorphisms previously identified as being in linkage disequilibrium with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Based on the known interactions between CAPON , neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS) , and proteins associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) complex , overexpression of either CAPON isoform would be expected to disrupt the association between nNOS and the NMDAR , leading to changes consistent with the NMDAR hypofunctioning hypothesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
This study adds support to a role of CAPON in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , produces new evidence implicating this gene in the etiology of bipolar disorder , and suggests a possible mechanism of action of CAPON in psychiatric illness .
The Grant syndrome .
Persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> Wormian bones <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular hypoplasia <END> , shallow glenoid fossae and campomelia--an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
A father and daughter with apparently unique clinical findings are described .
The findings include persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> Wormian bones <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular hypoplasia <END> , shallow glenoid fossae and campomelia .
Apparently it is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
Although the disorder is in the osteogenesis imperfecta group , nevertheless it appears to be different and until the basic defect is found we have named it " The Grant Syndrome " .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Holoprosencephaly <END> : a developmental field defect .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Holoprosencephaly <END> refers to a spectrum of craniofacial malformations including <START:PHENOTYPE> cyclopia <END> , ethmocephaly , cebocephaly , and premaxillary agenesis .
Etiologic <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> is well documented .
Chromosomal , genetic , and teratogenic factors have been implicated .
Recognition of <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> as a developmental field defect stresses the importance of close scrutiny of relatives for mild forms such as <START:PHENOTYPE> single median incisor <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid uvula <END> , or pituitary deficiency .
Familial cystic parathyroid adenomatosis .
Although the commonest familial form of primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> is parathyroid hyperplasia , a few families have manifested <START:PHENOTYPE> parathyroid adenomas <END> .
We describe a family in which four members developed cystic <START:PHENOTYPE> parathyroid adenomas <END> .
Although calcium levels returned to normal after resection of the adenoma , a second adenoma would often develop several years later ( we have termed this temporal sequence adenomatosis ) .
Each adenoma had a cystic histologic appearance , and three of four normal-sized parathyroid glands also contained many cysts .
No other endocrine tumors have appeared , but in three patients the <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> was complicated by fibrous maxillary or mandibular tumors that resembled ossifying fibromas rather than the brown tumors generally found in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> .
Each patient with an adenoma was hypercalciuric , but two were obligate carriers of hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
This familial occurrence of the rare cystic <START:PHENOTYPE> parathyroid adenoma <END> suggests the presence of a distinct hereditary syndrome .
The genetic basis may be the simultaneous inheritance of familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> and another trait that may increase the urinary excretion of calcium .
E-cadherin germline mutations define an inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> syndrome dominated by diffuse gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
To extend earlier observations of germline E-cadherin mutations in kindreds with an inherited susceptibility to diffuse gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> , we searched for germline E-cadherin mutations in five further families affected predominantly by diffuse gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> and one family with a history of diffuse gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> and early-onset breast <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Heterozygous inactivating mutations were found in the E-cadherin gene in each of these families .
No mutation hotspots were identified .
These results demonstrate that germline mutation of the E-cadherin gene is a common cause of hereditary diffuse gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> and suggest a role for these mutations in the incidence of breast <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .

Cystic fibrosis and Helicobacter pylori <START:PHENOTYPE> gastritis <END> , megaloblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> , subnormal mentality and minor anomalies in two siblings : a new syndrome ?
Two siblings of consanguineous Arab parents were found to have cystic fibrosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> gastritis <END> associated with Helicobacter pylori , <START:PHENOTYPE> folate deficiency <END> megaloblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> , subnormal mentality and minor anomalies .
The association of H . pylori and megaloblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> has not been described in patients with cystic fibrosis .
H . pylori infection and <START:PHENOTYPE> gastritis <END> is probably more common in patients with cystic fibrosis than appreciated .
We believe that the constellation of features in the two sibs represent a possible new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> cystic fibrosis-like syndrome .
Mutations in phospholipase DDHD2 cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( SPG54 ) .
Hereditary spastic paraplegias ( HSP ) are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a distal axonopathy of the corticospinal tract motor neurons leading to progressive lower limb spasticity and weakness .
Intracellular membrane trafficking , mitochondrial dysfunction and myelin formation are key functions involved in HSP pathogenesis .
Only recently defects in metabolism of complex lipids have been implicated in a number of HSP subtypes .
Mutations in the 23 known <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> HSP genes explain less than half of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> HSP cases . To identify novel <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> HSP disease genes , exome sequencing was performed in 79 index cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> forms of HSP . Resulting variants were filtered and intersected between families to allow identification of new disease genes .
We identified two deleterious mutations in the phospholipase DDHD2 gene in two families with complicated HSP .
The phenotype is characterized by early onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , short stature and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum .
Phospholipase DDHD2 is involved in intracellular membrane trafficking at the golgi/ endoplasmic reticulum interface and has been shown to possess phospholipase A1 activity in vitro .
Discovery of DDHD2 mutations in HSP might therefore provide a link between two key pathogenic themes in HSP : membrane trafficking and lipid metabolism .
Two novel CACNA1A gene mutations associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> type 2 and interictal <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Episodic ataxia <END> type 2 ( EA2 ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> condition that results from mutations in the CACNA1A gene .
It is characterized by episodes of ataxia and nystagmus that typically last hours .
To describe the clinical and genetic features of 2 unrelated patients who developed EA2 in childhood and late-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
Pedigree study .
University academic teaching hospital .
Two unrelated patients with childhood-onset EA2 and adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> were identified through a neurogenetics clinic .
The CACNA1A gene was screened by heteroduplex analysis and sequencing for mutations .
Mutations in the CACNA1A gene .
Novel mutations in the pore-forming subunit of the P/Q-type calcium channels were found in both pedigrees .
None of the family members carried an expansion of the CAG sequence that is found in the carboxy terminus of the CACNA1A gene .
Truncating mutations are the most common mutations to cause EA2 .
We have identified 2 novel truncating mutations that are associated with interictal <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> is a late feature in this disease and may be a manifestation of a degenerative cerebellar process .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Calcification of the basal ganglia <END> : computerized tomography and clinical correlation .
During a 1-year period , 4219 consecutive computerized tomograms ( CT) were reviewed for <START:PHENOTYPE> basal ganglia calcification <END> ; 14 patients with such calcification were identified .
Calcifications on CT scan were bilateral in 12 of these cases and unilateral in 2 .
All bilateral calcifications were symmetric .
The globus pallidus was the site of calcification in 13 of the 14 patients .
Bilateral dentate nucleus calcification was seen in one patient .
Skull radiograms were normal in all but one .
Patients had diverse symptoms that were often explained by other findings , suggesting that calcifications may be coincidental and that <START:PHENOTYPE> basal ganglia calcification <END> may not be a nosologic entity .
Disturbances of calcium metabolism were not found in these patients , minimizing the pathophysiologic significance of altered calcium metabolism and the need for extensive endocrinologic evaluation .
The finding of <START:PHENOTYPE> basal ganglia calcification <END> alone does not justify invasive diagnostic procedures .
Extrapyramidal signs may be associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> basal ganglia calcification <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> basal ganglia calcification <END> differs from idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> in being resistant to levodopa therapy .
Heterogeneity in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ichthyosis .
Clinical and biochemical differentiation of lamellar ichthyosis and nonbullous <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma <END> .
Nonbullous <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma <END> ( CIE) and classic lamellar ichthyosis ( LI ) can be distinguished by clinical , histopathologic , and biochemical findings reported herein .
Whereas all patients with CIE ( n = 12 ) had fine white scales , they were heterogeneous with respect to degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> erythroderma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectropion <END> , and prognosis .
In contrast , all patients with LI ( n = 6 ) had large , dark , platelike scales , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> ectropion <END> that showed no improvement with age , and minimal <START:PHENOTYPE> erythroderma <END> .
Although the stratum corneum of patients with LI was two to three times thicker than that of those with CIE , the latter group demonstrated more acanthosis , parakeratosis , hypergranulosis , and less prominent dermal capillaries .
Studies of scale-lipid content have indicated biochemical correlates of this clinical heterogeneity .
These clinical , histologic , and biochemical findings provide useful guidelines to differentiate CIE from LI and strongly suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> primary ichthyosis comprises two distinct diseases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ablepharon <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> syndrome .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> ablepharon <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> syndrome is a severe congenital condition that includes total absence of the upper and lower eyelids , failure of lip fusion that results in an enlarged , fish-like mouth , <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormally shaped ears <END> and nose , absence of lanugo , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventral hernia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> .
In one such patient we were able to reconstruct the eyelids in a three-stage procedure .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Redundant skin <END> from the retroauricular area was used to create full-thickness grafts .
The child later underwent successful mouth reconstruction .
Although developmentally delayed , the child was eventually able to sit unassisted , to grasp objects , and to follow light with some fixation .
Nystagmus was severe .
The retina was attached in one eye and detached in the other .
Corneal opacities present initially improved in one eye , allowing a view of the pupil and a normal anterior chamber .
Heterozygosity for <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> in premature peripheral and cerebral occlusive arterial disease .
Premature arteriosclerosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> thromboembolic events <END> are well-known complications of homozygous <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> due to cystathionine synthase deficiency .
It is unknown whether heterozygosity for <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> predisposes to premature vascular disease .
We explored the frequency of excessive homocysteine accumulation after standardized methionine loading in 75 patients presenting with clinical signs of ischemic disease before the age of 5 0:25 with occlusive peripheral arterial disease , 25 with occlusive cerebrovascular disease , and 25 with <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> .
In seven patients in each of the first two groups but in none of the patients in the third group , heterozygosity for <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> was established on the basis of pathological homocysteinemia after methionine loading and cystathionine synthase deficiency in skin fibroblast cultures .
Because the frequency of heterozygosity for <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> in the normal population is 1 in 70 at the most , we conclude that this condition predisposes to the development of premature occlusive arterial disease , causing intermittent claudication , renovascular <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , and ischemic cerebrovascular disease .
Functional promoter polymorphism in the TBX21 gene associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> aspirin-induced asthma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder with many etiologic factors and clinical characteristics .
T-bet , a Th1-specific transcription factor of T-box family , has been found to control interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) expression in T cells .
Mice lacking the T-bet gene ( tbx21 ) demonstrate multiple physiological and inflammatory features reminiscent of human <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
In order to examine whether polymorphisms in the candidate gene , TBX21 , located on chromosome 17q21.32 , are related to the risk of human <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> phenotypes , we have searched for genetic variations in the human TBX21 gene and identified 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , including five novel SNPs , by direct sequencing in Japanese subjects .
Among <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> phenotypes , a promoter -1993T- -> C SNP , which is in linkage disequilibrium with a synonymous coding 390A-->G SNP in exon 1 , is significantly associated with a risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> aspirin-induced asthma <END> ( AIA; P = 0.004 , P(c ) = 0.016 ) .
This association has also been confirmed in additional independent samples of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> nasal polyposis <END> ( P = 0.008 ) , regardless of aspirin hypersensitivity .
Furthermore , our data indicate that the -1993T- -> C substitution increases the affinity of a particular nuclear protein to the binding site of TBX21 covering the -1993 position , resulting in increased transcriptional activity of the TBX21 gene .
Thus , in addition to the antigen-driven excess Th2 response , increased T-bet ( and subsequent IFN-gamma ) production in human airways of individuals with the -1993T- -> C polymorphism could contribute to the development of certain asthma-related phenotypes , such as AIA.
The Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch or neonatal progeroid syndrome : report of a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> .
The Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch or neonatal progeroid syndrome : report of a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> : Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome is known as a neonatal progeroid syndrome , with only few published case reports .
The syndrome is characterized by progeroid appearance ( triangular old-looking face with relatively large skull , prominent veins especially of the scalp , <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse scalp hair <END> , and large anterior fontanelle) , <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased subcutaneous fat <END> ( giving the clinical appearance of prominent veins and muscles) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> natal teeth <END> .
We report a new additional patient with a new feature of the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , not previously described , to our knowledge .
Expression profiling of muscles from Fukuyama-type <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> and laminin-alpha 2 deficient <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> ; is <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> a primary fibrotic disease ?
Fukuyama-type <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> ( FCMD ) and laminin-alpha2 deficient <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> ( MDC1A ) are congenital muscular dystrophies ( CMDs ) and they both are categorized into the same clinical entity of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> as Duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> ( DMD ) .
All three disorders share a common etiologic defect in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex , which connects muscle structural proteins with the extracellular basement membrane .
To investigate the pathophysiology of these CMDs , we generated microarray gene expression profiles of skeletal muscle from patients in various clinical stages .
Despite diverse pathological changes , the correlation coefficient of overall gene expression among these samples was considerably high .
We performed a multi-dimensional statistical analysis , the Distillation , to extract determinant genes that distinguish CMD muscle from normal controls .
Up-regulated genes were primarily extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components , whereas down-regulated genes included structural components of mature muscle .
These observations reflect active interstitial fibrosis with less active regeneration of muscle cell components in the CMDs , characteristics that are clearly distinct from those of DMD .
Although the severity of fibrosis varied among the specimens tested , ECM gene expression was consistently high without substantial changes through the clinical course .
Further , in situ hybridization showed more prominent ECM gene expression on muscle cells than on interstitial tissue cells , suggesting that ECM components are induced by regeneration process rather than by 'dystrophy. ' These data imply that the etiology of FCMD and MDC1A differs from that of the chronic phase of classical <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> , and the major pathophysiologic change in CMDs might instead result from primary active fibrosis .
IRAK-M is involved in the pathogenesis of early-onset persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> is a multifactorial disease influenced by genetic and environmental factors .
In the past decade , several loci and >10 0 genes have been found to be associated with the disease in at least one population .
Among these loci , region 12q13-24 has been implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> etiology in multiple populations , suggesting that it harbors one or more <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> susceptibility genes .
We performed linkage and association analyses by transmission/disequilibrium test and case-control analysis in the candidate region 12q13-24 , using the Sardinian founder population , in which limited heterogeneity of pathogenetic alleles for monogenic and complex disorders as well as of environmental conditions should facilitate the study of multifactorial traits .
We analyzed our cohort , using a cutoff age of 13 years at <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> onset , and detected significant linkage to a portion of 12q13-24.
We identified IRAK-M as the gene contributing to the linkage and showed that it is associated with early-onset persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
We defined protective and predisposing SNP haplotypes and replicated associations in an outbred Italian population .
Sequence analysis in patients found mutations , including inactivating lesions , in the IRAK-M coding region .
Immunohistochemistry of lung biopsies showed that IRAK-M is highly expressed in epithelial cells .
We report that IRAK-M is involved in the pathogenesis of early-onset persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
IRAK-M , a negative regulator of the Toll-like receptor/IL-1R pathways , is a master regulator of NF- kappa B and inflammation .
Our data suggest a mechanistic link between hyperactivation of the innate immune system and chronic airway inflammation and indicate IRAK-M as a potential target for therapeutic intervention against <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Evidence for the participation of interstitial collagenase ( matrix metalloproteinase 1 ) in preterm <START:PHENOTYPE> premature rupture of membranes <END> .
Rupture of membranes is thought to result from the effects of physical forces in localized areas of the membranes weakened by the degradation of structural collagens .
Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix components and have been implicated in membrane rupture .
The objective of this study was to determine whether spontaneous rupture of membranes is associated with a change in the amniotic fluid concentration of interstitial collagenase ( matrix metalloproteinase 1 [ MMP-1] ) , a major collagenase .
A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine MMP-1 concentrations in amniotic fluid from 353 women in the following categories : (1 ) term with intact membranes not in labor and in labor , (2 ) preterm labor who delivered at term , (3 ) preterm labor who delivered preterm without microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity , (4 ) preterm labor who delivered preterm with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity , (5 ) preterm <START:PHENOTYPE> premature rupture of membranes <END> with and without microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity , (6 ) term <START:PHENOTYPE> premature rupture of membranes <END> not in labor and in labor , and (7 ) mid trimester of pregnancy .
Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity was determined by an amniotic fluid culture positive for microorganisms .
MMP-1 concentrations in amniotic fluid were determined by means of sensitive and specific immunoassays .
(1 ) MMP-1 was detectable in 81 .3% of amniotic fluid samples ( 287/353 ) , and its concentrations increased with advancing gestational age ( r = 0.4 ; P <.001 ) .
(2 ) Preterm <START:PHENOTYPE> premature rupture of membranes <END> was associated with a significant increase in the median amniotic fluid concentration of MMP-1 ( P =.02 ) .
(3 ) Women with term <START:PHENOTYPE> premature rupture of membranes <END> had a significantly lower amniotic fluid MMP-1 concentration than those with intact membranes at term not in labor ( P <.001 ) .
(4 ) Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in patients in preterm labor with intact membranes and in patients with preterm <START:PHENOTYPE> premature rupture of membranes <END> was also associated with significant increases in the median amniotic fluid MMP-1 concentrations ( P <.05 and P <.01 , respectively ) .
(5 ) Patients with preterm <START:PHENOTYPE> premature rupture of membranes <END> and microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity had a significantly higher median amniotic fluid MMP-1 concentration than those with intact membranes and microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity ( P =.01 ) .
(6 ) Neither term nor preterm parturition was associated with changes in amniotic fluid MMP-1 concentrations ( P =.6 and P =.3 , respectively ) .
(1 ) Collagenase 1 ( MMP-1 ) is a physiologic constituent of amniotic fluid .
(2 ) Preterm <START:PHENOTYPE> premature rupture of membranes <END> ( in both the presence and absence of infection ) was associated with an increase in the amniotic fluid MMP-1 concentrations . (3 ) Neither term nor preterm parturition was associated with a significant increase in the amniotic fluid concentration of MMP-1 .
Valproate-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperammonemia <END> .
A patient with carbamyl phosphate synthetase deficiency had four episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperammonemia <END> , up to 226 microM , associated with valproate ( VPA ) treatment .
These were accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> coma <END> .
A group of epileptic patients receiving VPA remained asymptomatic but had significantly higher mean plasma ammonium levels when compared to epileptic patients receiving other anticonvulsants : 33.6 +/- 1 .9 ( SEM ) versus 23.6 +/- 1.5 microM .
Thus , VPA caused symptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperammonemia <END> in a patient with an impairment in urea synthesis and resulted in mildly elevated ammonium levels in epileptic patients .
These data suggest that ammonium levels should be monitored in patients receiving VPA who exhibit signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> .
Evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> malignant hyperthermia <END> susceptibility .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Malignant hyperthermia <END> susceptibility ( MHS ) is a clinically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> pharmacogenetic disorder characterized by accelerated metabolism , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthermia <END> , and frequently <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle rigidity <END> .
MHS is elicited by all commonly used potent inhalation anesthetics and depolarizing neuromuscular blockers and remains an important cause of death due to anesthesia .
Recent linkage studies suggest a single genetic locus for this disorder on chromosome 19q13.1 .
The results of our linkage analyses exclude several loci on 19q13.1 as a site for the gene(s ) that produces the MHS phenotype in three unrelated families and clearly establish <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> in this disorder .
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the genetic defect that alters thermoregulation may vary in MHS and that clinical variability in the expression of MHS may be explained by <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> .
Further delineation of the <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis , atrichia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> syndrome .
We describe an 18-month-old male infant suffering from the <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis , atrichia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> ( IFAP ) syndrome and further delineate the clinical phenotype .
Severe retardation of growth and psychomotor development , chill-like <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , bronchial asthma , <START:PHENOTYPE> urticaria <END> , a proneness to skin infections and transient <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dystrophy <END> observed in our patient are non-obligatory manifestations of this disorder .
Histological examination of the atrichia revealed poorly developed , shortened hair follicles and a complete absence of sebaceous glands .
The sex ratio of published cases suggests an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive inheritance <END> .
The marked clinical variability of the IFAP syndrome might be the expression of a contiguous gene defect .
Linkage of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> with mental impairment and <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> to chromosome 15 A13-15 .
To date , three loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( ARHSP ) linked to chromosomes 8p12-q13 , 16qter , and 15q13-15 have been characterized .
We have clinically characterized 13 Japanese ARHSP families and performed genetic linkage analyses .
All 13 families were classified as having the " complicated " form , which manifests with mental impairment and <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> .
Linkage to the 8p12-q13 and 16qter loci was excluded , although 10 of the 13 families showed marker data consistent with linkage to the 15q13-15 locus .
The multipoint LOD score of the 10 families linked to chromosome 15 was above 9.00 in the 3-centimorgan segment flanked by D15S994 and D15 S659 , with a maximum multipoint LOD score of 9.68 at a position 1.2 centimorgans telomeric from D15S994 to D15 S659 .
We have shown that ARHSP with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> , a subtype of recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> , maps to chromosome 15q13-15 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> DNA deletions in inherited recurrent myoglobinuria .
We describe two brothers with inherited recurrent exertional myoglobinuria and alcohol intolerance associated with distinct morphological abnormalities of muscle mitochondria and multiple deletions of muscle <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA . Patient 1 ( 26 years old ) and Patient 2 ( 21 years old ) had recurrent episodes of myoglobinuria provoked by strenuous exercise or alcohol intake , from the age of 18 years .
Although their serum lactate and pyruvate levels were normal at rest , they were significantly elevated by aerobic exercise .
Histochemistry of their biopsied limb muscles showed <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers as well as degenerating and regenerating fibers .
Electron microscopy showed pronounced accumulation of abnormal mitochondria containing paracrystalline inclusions and moderate increases of glycogen particles .
The enzyme activities of the electron-transfer complexes in the isolated muscle mitochondria of Patient 2 were within normal ranges .
Southern blot analysis revealed multiple deletions of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA , some of which were common between the patients .
Polymerase chain reaction of their muscle <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA detected multiple abnormal fragments indicating <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA deletions .
We propose that a defect of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> energy-transducing system due to multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA deletions is a novel genetic cause of inherited recurrent myoglobinuria .
Parkin deletions in a family with adult-onset , tremor-dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> : expanding the phenotype .
A gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , PARK2 ( parkin) , has recently been identified on chromosome 6q and shown to be mutated in Japanese and European families , mostly with early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
Here we present a large pedigree from South Tyrol ( a region of northern Italy ) with adult-onset , clinically typical tremor-dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> of apparently autosomal dominant inheritance .
Haplotype analysis excluded linkage to the chromosome 2p , 4p , and 4q regions that harbor genes associated with autosomal dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , but implicated the parkin locus on chromosome 6q . Compound heterozygous deletions in the parkin gene ( one large and one truncating ) were identified in 4 affected male siblings .
The patients were clinically indistinguishable from most patients with idiopathic Parkinson 's disease . None of them displayed any of the clinical hallmarks described in patients with previously reported parkin mutations , including diurnal fluctuations , benefit from sleep , foot <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> , and early susceptibility to levodopa-induced dyskinesias .
Two affected female individuals carried one ( truncating ) of the two deletions in a heterozygous state with an apparently normal allele .
We conclude that the phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations in the parkin gene is broader than previously reported , suggesting that this gene may be important in the etiology of the more frequent late-onset typical Parkinson 's disease .
The Dubowitz syndrome .
The Dubowitz syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition of <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , characteristic facial appearance , high-pitched hoarse voice , and borderline intelligence or mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cleft palate <END> may occur as well as <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> in affected males , and mild limb defects .
The 13 cases reported in the European literature and eight personally examined patients are reviewed .
Autosomal-dominant familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal arteriolar tortuosity <END> and contractures : a novel syndrome .
Autosomal-dominant forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> have been mostly related to mutations in the COL4A3/COL4A4 genes .
Patients with thin basement membrane ( BM ) disease do not have extrarenal manifestations , while those with Alport syndrome often present with hearing loss , anterior lenticonus , and dot-and-fleck retinopathy.
We performed a phenotypic study and a candidate gene approach in a four-generation family presenting with autosomal-dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> associated with extrarenal manifestations .
Renal biopsy was analyzed for determination of BM thickness and expression of chains of type IV collagen .
Linkage to 18 candidate genes/loci was investigated using polymorphic microsatellite markers .
In all affected patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> without proteinuria was associated with muscular contractures and retinal arterial tortuosities responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal hemorrhages <END> .
Cardiac arrhythmia , Raynaud phenomena , and brain MRI abnormalities were also observed .
Despite the presence of red cells in tubule sections , no glomerular abnormalities were found by electron microscopy .
Expression of type IV collagen chains and glomerular BM thickness was normal .
We searched for a molecular defect affecting either BM or angiogenesis .
Linkage analyses of genes encoding BM components ( COL4A3/COL4A4 , COL6A1 , COL6A2 , COL6A3 , FBLN1 ) , and angiogenic factors or their receptors ( VHL , ANPT1 , ANPT2 , TIE , TEK , NOTCH2 , NOTCH3 , NOTCH4 , DLL4 , JAG1 , JAG2 ) and of the facio-sapulo-humeral dystrophy and 3q21 loci failed to show segregation of the disease with those gene loci .
We have identified a new inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> syndrome associated with retinal vessel tortuosities and contractures .
We recommend performing a fundus examination in patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> and episodes of visual impairment , as well as a urinary analysis in patients with retinal arterial tortuosity or congenital muscular contractures .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( mother and son ) with 13q14 deletion .
We present here the first familial cases ( a mother and son ) of dominantly inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> with a 13q14 deletion [46 , XY or XX , del(13 ) ( q14 .1q21.2)] .
Their esterase D activities in red blood cells were as low as 5 0 % of the normal control and the haplotype of esterase D was a type 1- 0 in the mother and a type 2-0 in the son .
They had peculiar facies characterized by a high forehead , low and broad nasal root , a short and <START:PHENOTYPE> bulbous nose <END> , a long philtrum , and open mouth with a <START:PHENOTYPE> thin upper lip <END> , and prominent earlobes .
Chromosome and esterase D analysis should be performed in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> even if <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> seems to be transmitted through an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
This family indicates that one of the causes of dominantly inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> is a chromosome deletion of part of the 13q14 band whether it is detectable by chromosome analysis or not .
Range of genetic mutations associated with severe non-syndromic sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> : an exome sequencing study .
The genetic cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> in most patients is unclear because of the absence of morphological clues , information about the position of such genes , and suitable screening methods .
Our aim was to identify de-novo variants in individuals with sporadic non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> .
In this study , we enrolled children with <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> and their parents from ten centres in Germany and Switzerland .
We compared exome sequences between patients and their parents to identify de-novo variants .
20 children and their parents from the KORA Augsburg Diabetes Family Study were investigated as controls .
We enrolled 51 participants from the German <START:PHENOTYPE> Mental Retardation <END> Network . 45 ( 88% ) participants in the case group and 14 (70% ) in the control group had de-novo variants .
We identified 87 de-novo variants in the case group , with an exomic mutation rate of 1Â·71 per individual per generation .
In the control group we identified 24 de-novo variants , which is 1Â·2 events per individual per generation .
More participants in the case group had loss-of-function variants than in the control group (20/51 vs 2/20; p= 0Â·022) , suggesting their contribution to disease development .
16 patients carried de-novo variants in known <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> genes with three recurrently mutated genes ( STX BP1 , SYNGAP1 , and SCN2A) .
We deemed at least six loss-of-function mutations in six novel genes to be disease causing .
We also identified several missense alterations with potential pathogenicity .
After exclusion of copy-number variants , de-novo point mutations and small indels are associated with severe , sporadic non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , accounting for 45-55 % of patients with high locus heterogeneity .
Autosomal recessive inheritance seems to contribute little in the outbred population investigated .
The large number of de-novo variants in known <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> genes is only partially attributable to known non-specific phenotypes .
Several patients did not meet the expected syndromic manifestation , suggesting a strong bias in present clinical syndrome descriptions .

Syndromal hypothalamic hamartoblastoma with <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> sequence , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , pulmonary malformations , <START:PHENOTYPE> radial hypoplasia <END> and mÃ¼llerian regression : further delineation of a new syndrome ?
A 24-week-old fetus is described here with <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> sequence ( arhinencephaly and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ) associated with brain and meningeal dysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> with an ectopic pigmentary layer , hypothalamic hamartoblastoma , preaxial asymmetric limb reduction , lung hypoplasia , gastric hypoplasia , MÃ¼llerian regression , <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal malrotation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> , and normal chromosomes .
The differential diagnosis includes the Cerebroacrovisceral-Early lethality ( CAVE ) phenotype , and the Pallister-Hall syndrome , but the anomalies best fit the severe form of microgastria-limb reduction syndrome .
Together with a previous case reported by Meinecke , the pattern of anomalies appears to represent a combination of defects , related to but distinct from the microgastria-limb reduction syndrome .
Waardenburg I syndrome : a clinical and genetic study of two large Brazilian kindreds , and literature review .
Two large kindreds with Waardenburg I syndrome are described .
The total number of affected individuals is 73 .
The major manifestations are <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> ( the only constant anomaly in all cases) , prominent nasal root , round or square tip of nose , hypoplastic alae , <START:PHENOTYPE> smooth philtrum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bushy eyebrows <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> , sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , heterochromia or hypoisochromia iridis , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmented ocular fundus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> white forelock <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> premature greying <END> , and hypopigmented skin lesions .
These and other aspects of the syndrome , associated findings , frequency , genetic heterogeneity , pathogenesis , animal models , and gene linkage and mapping are reviewed briefly .
Progressive inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal arteriolar tortuosity <END> with spontaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal hemorrhages <END> .
Tortuosity of the retinal arterioles complicated by spontaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal hemorrhages <END> is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
Even when hemorrhages involve the fovea , spontaneous clearing with recovery of normal vision is the rule .
We have studied members of three families in which arteriolar tortuosity increases with age .
Tortuosity increases most dramatically during adolescence and affects small arterioles in the macular area .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinal hemorrhages <END> in children from two pedigrees led to extensive laboratory investigation because arteriolar tortuosity , later unmistakeable , was not recognized initially .
Inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal arteriolar tortuosity <END> may be overlooked easily , particularly in children .
Patients with spontaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal hemorrhages <END> and their relatives should be examined for <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal arteriolar tortuosity <END> before being subjected to cardiovascular or hematologic studies .
Gastro-cutaneous syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> peptic ulcer <END> /hiatal hernia , multiple lentigines/cafÃ©-au-lait spots , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> .
We report the familial occurrence in a French Canadian family of <START:PHENOTYPE> peptic ulcer <END> /hiatal hernia , multiple lentigines/cafÃ©-au-lait spots , apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> caused by a pleiotropic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> gene with high penetrance and variable expressivity . Other probable but rarer components of the syndrome include ischemic heart disease , congenital heart disease , and maturity onset diabetes .
Symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> peptic ulcer <END> /hiatal hernia usually started in the second or third decade and were associated , as least in some examined individuals , with relatively increased acid secretion and abnormal dermatoglyphics .
Studies in aging of the brain : IV. Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> Alzheimer disease <END> : Relation to transmissible <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , aneuploidy , and microtubular defects .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Alzheimer disease <END> was transmitted in a pattern consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait in three families .
This brings to 50 the number of such families reported .
In one of our families , one patient had histologically confirmed <START:PHENOTYPE> Alzheimer disease <END> , whereas her sister had proved spongiform encephalopathy. Other data suggest a link between familial <START:PHENOTYPE> Alzheimer disease <END> and transmissible <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Alzheimer disease <END> is associated with abnormal neurofibrillary structures , Down syndrome , and abnormal numbers of chromosomes in lymphocytes ( aneuploidy ) .
These observations are consistent with a disorder in the physiology of tubular-filamentous structures involving different cell types .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> ND6 gene is a hot spot for mutations that cause Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy.
Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> ( LHON ) is a common cause of bilateral optic nerve disease .
The majority of LHON patients harbour one of three point mutations of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( mtDNA ) complex I , or NADH :ubiquinone oxidoreductase ( ND ) genes ( G11778 A in ND4 , G3460A in ND1 , T14484C in ND6 ) .
As a consequence , screening for these mutations has become part of the routine clinical investigation of young adults who present with bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> , and the absence of these mutations is interpreted as indicating there is a low likelihood that an <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> is LHON .
However , there are many individuals who develop the clinical features of LHON but who do not harbour one of these primary LHON mutations .
We describe two LHON pedigrees that harbour the same novel point mutation within the mtDNA ND6 gene ( A14495G ) .
This mutation was heteroplasmic in both families , and sequencing of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome confirmed that the mutation arose on two independent occasions .
This is the seventh mutation in the ND6 gene that causes <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> , indicating that this gene is a hot spot for LHON mutations .
Protein modelling studies indicate that all of these pathogenic mutations lie within close proximity to one another in a hydrophobic cleft or pocket .
This is the first evidence for a relationship between a specific disease phenotype and a specific structural domain within a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> respiratory chain subunit .
These findings suggest that the mtDNA ND6 gene should be sequenced in all patients with LHON who do not harbour one of the three common LHON mutations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> maculopathy : geographic atrophy of the macula in the MELAS associated A to G 3243 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA point mutation .
To report ocular findings in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> ( MELAS syndrome ) in a family with the A to G 3243 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> ( mt ) DNA point mutation .
Case reports .
Ocular findings are described from four family members with the MELAS associated A to G 3243 mt DNA point mutation .
Findings included ophthalmoplegia , neurosensory deafness , reduction of photopic and scotopic electroretinogram b-wave amplitudes , and <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , as well as macular retinal pigment epithelial atrophy.
No family members had <START:PHENOTYPE> nyctalopia <END> , attenuation of retinal blood vessels , or retinal bone spicule pigmentation .
The finding of slowly progressive macular retinal pigment epithelial atrophy expands the reported phenotypic diversity of patients with A3243G mt DNA mutations .
Familial aggregation of preeclampsia and <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth restriction <END> in a genetically isolated population in The Netherlands . Preeclampsia and <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth restriction <END> are related , pregnancy-specific disorders with a substantial genetic influence , which may have a joint genetic aetiology .
We investigated familial aggregation , consanguinity and parent-of-origin effects for preeclampsia and IUGR .
Fifty women with previous preeclampsia and 56 with previous pregnancies complicated by <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth restriction <END> were recruited from a recent genetically isolated population in the Netherlands .
Their relationships were estimated by means of a large genealogy database that contains information on more than 110 000 individuals from the isolate over 23 generations .
Relationships were quantified using kinship and inbreeding coefficients .
Parent-of-origin effects were evaluated by comparing parental kinships .
Eighty-six women ( 39 preeclampsia and 47 <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth restriction <END> ) could be linked to one common ancestor within 14 generations .
The proportion of related women with previous preeclampsia ( 95 .6% ) or pregnancies complicated by <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth restriction <END> ( 95 .1% ) was significantly greater than expected by chance ( P< 0.001 ) .
Combined analysis of both disorders did not change the magnitude of familial aggregation .
The proportion of women born from consanguineous marriages was increased in women with previous preeclampsia ( 81 .8% ) and those with <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth restriction <END> ( 78% ) compared to a random sample ( P< 0.001 ) .
Maternal and paternal kinships were not significantly different in both disorders .
We demonstrate cosegregation of preeclampsia and <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth restriction <END> , supporting a common genetic aetiology .
The high proportion of parental consanguineous marriages suggests the possibility of an underlying recessive mutation .
No evidence was found for a parent-of-origin effect either in preeclampsia or in <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth restriction <END> .
Late-onset 21-hydroxylase deficiency mimicking idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> or polycystic ovarian disease .
The importance of late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia as a cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> is controversial .
Two of 35 women with a chief complaint of <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> met the criteria of 21-hydroxylase deficiency .
In one , who presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligomenorrhea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , infertility , and enlarged cystic ovaries , the initial diagnosis was polycystic ovarian syndrome .
Family data showed that her disorder was <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> and linked to the histocompatibility leukocyte antigens ( HLA) , as in the classic form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia .
Carriers were thus detectable by HLA typing .
Thus late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia appears to be an allelic variant of congenital virilizing adrenal hyperplasia with a milder enzymatic defect .
The diagnosis cannot be made clinically because the disease has the same presentation as idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> or polycystic ovarian disease .
Basal plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels , unlike in classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia , can be normal , and an ACTH stimulation test or sequential measurements of plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone throughout the day may be needed to show the abnormality .
The incidence among hirsute women is estimated to be 6% to 12% , and the calculated gene frequency for the allele coding for attenuated expression of 21-hydroxylase deficiency is 0.015 to 0.057 .
Neuroimaging aspects of Aicardi syndrome .
Aicardi syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal lacunae <END> , corpus callosum dysgenesis , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> , cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopias <END> , intracranial cysts , and costovertebral defects .
Cerebellar abnormalities have been described occasionally .
Aicardi syndrome is sporadic and has been observed only in females and 47 , XXY males .
Therefore , it is thought to result from a mutation in an X-linked gene .
Improved definition of the clinical phenotype should focus the selection of functional candidate genes for mutation analysis .
Because central nervous system abnormalities are the most prominent component of the phenotype , we performed a detailed characterization of abnormalities identified on magnetic resonance neuroimaging studies from 23 girls with Aicardi syndrome , the largest cohort to undergo such review by a single group of investigators .
All patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> that was predominantly frontal and perisylvian and often associated with underopercularization .
Periventricular nodular <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopias <END> , present in all patients , were more frequent than previously reported ; 10 had single and 11 had multiple intracranial cysts .
Posterior fossa abnormalities were also more frequent than previously described .
Cerebellar abnormalities were noted in 95 % of studies where they could be evaluated .
As a novel finding , we noted tectal enlargement in 10 patients .
Since mildly affected girls with variable callosal dysgenesis have now been reported , the constellation of frontal-dominant and perisylvian <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> , periventricular nodular <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopias <END> , intracranial cysts , and posterior fossa abnormalities , including tectal enlargement , should prompt consideration of the diagnosis of Aicardi syndrome .
We further propose that improved characterization of the neurological phenotype will benefit the selection of candidate genes for mutation analysis .

A mutation in the Golgi Qb-SNARE gene GOSR2 causes progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> epilepsy with early <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
The progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> epilepsies ( PMEs ) are a group of predominantly recessive disorders that present with action <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , tonic-clonic seizures , and progressive neurological decline .
Many PMEs have similar clinical presentations yet are genetically heterogeneous , making accurate diagnosis difficult .
A locus for PME was mapped in a consanguineous family with a single affected individual to chromosome 17q21 .
An identical-by-descent , homozygous mutation in GOSR2 ( c.430G>T , p.Gly144Trp) , a Golgi vesicle transport gene , was identified in this patient and in four apparently unrelated individuals .
A comparison of the phenotypes in these patients defined a clinically distinct PME syndrome characterized by early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , action <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> by age 6 , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and mildly <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated serum creatine kinase <END> .
This p.Gly144Trp mutation is equivalent to a loss of function and results in failure of GOSR2 protein to localize to the cis-Golgi .

Fryns syndrome : a review of the phenotype and diagnostic guidelines .
Fryns syndrome ( FS ) is the commonest <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital diaphragmatic hernia <END> ( CDH ) and comprises CDH , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> , craniofacial anomalies , distal limb hypoplasia , and internal malformations .
Although there have been more than 50 case reports on probands with FS , the diagnostic guidelines were formulated from a review of eight patients and modifications to the guidelines have only once been suggested .
Recently , several case reports have described new anomalies in FS and other papers have highlighted the variation in expressivity found in FS .
This paper examines the medical literature on FS to define the phenotype and to review the diagnostic guidelines .
We conclude that CDH with brachytelephalangy and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> nail hypoplasia <END> is strongly suggestive of the diagnosis and that <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> , craniofacial dysmorphism , orofacial clefting , and <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> are sufficiently frequent to be diagnostically useful .
Other distinctive malformations that are consistent with FS include ventricular dilatation or hydrocephalus , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , neuronal or cerebellar heterotopias , abnormalities of the aorta , renal cysts , dilatation of the ureters , <START:PHENOTYPE> bicornuate uterus <END> , renal dysplasia , proximal thumbs , and broad clavicles .

Frequency and phenotypic spectrum of ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> 2 : a clinical and genetic study in 18 patients .
Ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 2 ( AOA2 ) is a newly described <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> cerebellar ataxia ( ARCA ) defined by genetic location to 9q34 of three families sharing <START:PHENOTYPE> gait ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> and/or elevated alpha-foetoprotein ( AFP ) levels .
We have evaluated 77 families with progressive non-Friedreich ARCA and have identified six families with a phenotype suggestive of AOA2 .
Linkage was confirmed in all six families , with a maximal lod score of 5 .91 at D9S1830 .
We report the first detailed phenotypic study , including neuropsychological , oculographic and brain imaging investigations , in the largest series of AOA2 patients yet recruited .
The mean age at onset was 15 .1 +/- 3.8 years .
Sensory motor neuropathy (92% ) and choreic or <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonic movements <END> ( 44% ) were frequent .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Oculomotor apraxia <END> was observed in 56 % of patients and characterized by increased horizontal saccade latencies and hypometria .
AFP levels were elevated in 100% of the families , making it a useful biological marker .
This study shows for the first time that AOA2 can be found in Europe , North Africa and the West Indies , and its relative frequency represents approximately 8 % of non-Friedreich ARCA , which is more frequent than ataxia telangiectasia and ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 1 ( AOA1 ) , in our series of adult patients .
In adults , AOA2 may be , therefore , the most frequent cause of ARCA identified so far , after Friedreich 's ataxia .
Effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy in 1028 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease after 2 to 5 years of treatment : a report from the Gaucher Registry .
Gaucher disease is the first lysosomal storage disorder to be treated with macrophage-targeted enzyme replacement therapy .
Previous studies in relatively small numbers of patients demonstrated short-term efficacy of this treatment .
This study describes the effects of 2 to 5 years of treatment on specific manifestations of type 1 Gaucher disease . Physicians reported data from 1028 patients to the Gaucher Registry .
Assessment of response included serial measurements of hemoglobin concentration , platelet count , liver and spleen volumes , and the occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> bone pain <END> and bone crises .
Among anemic patients , hemoglobin concentration increased to normal or near normal within 6 to 12 months , with a sustained response through 5 years .
In thrombocytopenic patients with intact spleens , the most rapid response occurred during the first 2 years , with slower improvement thereafter .
The likelihood of achieving a normal platelet count decreased with increasing severity of baseline <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> .
In patients who had undergone splenectomy , platelet counts returned to normal within 6 to 12 months .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hepatomegaly <END> decreased by 30% to 40% during follow-up ; <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> decreased 5 0 % to 60% , but rarely to volumes below five times normal size .
In patients with pretreatment <START:PHENOTYPE> bone pain <END> or bone crises , 52 % ( 67 /128 ) were pain free after 2 years and 94 % ( 48/51 ) reported no additional crises .
Enzyme replacement therapy prevents progressive manifestations of Gaucher disease , and ameliorates Gaucher disease-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , organomegaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> bone pain <END> , and bone crises .
Mutations in FN1 cause glomerulopathy with fibronectin deposits .
Glomerulopathy with fibronectin ( FN ) deposits ( GFND ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disease with age-related penetrance , characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microscopic hematuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , and massive glomerular deposits of FN that lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal failure <END> .
The genetic abnormality underlying GFND was still unknown .
We hypothesized that mutations in FN1 , which encodes FN , were the cause of GFND .
In a large Italian pedigree with eight affected subjects , we found linkage with GFND at the FN1 locus at 2q32 .
We sequenced the FN1 in 15 unrelated pedigrees and found three heterozygous missense mutations , the W1925R , L1974R , and Y973 C , that cosegregated with the disease in six pedigrees .
The mutations affected two domains of FN ( Hep-II domain for the W1925R and the L1974R , and Hep-III domain for the Y973C ) that play key roles in FN-cell interaction and in FN fibrillogenesis .
Mutant recombinant Hep-II fragments were expressed , and functional studies revealed a lower binding to heparin and to endothelial cells and podocytes compared with wild-type Hep-II and an impaired capability to induce endothelial cell spreading and cytoskeletal reorganization .
Overall dominant mutations in FN1 accounted for 40% of cases of GFND in our study group .
These findings may help understanding the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> and glomerular FN deposits in GFND and possibly in more common renal diseases such as diabetic <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , IgA <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , and lupus nephritis .
To our knowledge no FN1 mutation causing a human disease was previously reported .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , and hypogonadotropism caused by disordered ubiquitination .
The combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and hypogonadism was first described more than a century ago , but its genetic basis has remained elusive .
We performed whole-exome sequencing in a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism , followed by targeted sequencing of candidate genes in similarly affected patients .
Neurologic and reproductive endocrine phenotypes were characterized in detail .
The effects of sequence variants and the presence of an epistatic interaction were tested in a zebrafish model .
Digenic homozygous mutations in RNF216 and OTUD4 , which encode a ubiquitin E3 ligase and a deubiquitinase , respectively , were found in three affected siblings in a consanguineous family .
Additional screening identified compound heterozygous truncating mutations in RNF216 in an unrelated patient and single heterozygous deleterious mutations in four other patients .
Knockdown of rnf216 or otud4 in zebrafish embryos induced defects in the eye , optic tectum , and cerebellum ; combinatorial suppression of both genes exacerbated these phenotypes , which were rescued by nonmutant , but not mutant , human RNF216 or OTUD4 messenger RNA .
All patients had progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Neuronal loss was observed in cerebellar pathways and the hippocampus ; surviving hippocampal neurons contained ubiquitin-immunoreactive intranuclear inclusions .
Defects were detected at the hypothalamic and pituitary levels of the reproductive endocrine axis .
The syndrome of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> can be caused by inactivating mutations in RNF216 or by the combination of mutations in RNF216 and OTUD4 .
These findings link disordered ubiquitination to neurodegeneration and reproductive dysfunction and highlight the power of whole-exome sequencing in combination with functional studies to unveil genetic interactions that cause disease . ( Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others. ) .
HLA- B maternal-fetal genotype matching increases risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Schizophrenia <END> and human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) matching between couples or between mothers and offspring have independently been associated with prenatal/obstetric complications , including preeclampsia and low birth weight .
Here , we report the results of a family-based candidate-gene study that brings together these two disparate lines of research by assessing maternal-fetal genotype matching at HLA-A , -B , and -DRB1 as a risk factor of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
We used a conditional-likelihood modeling approach with a sample of 274 families that had at least one offspring with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> or a related spectrum disorder .
A statistically significant HLA- B maternal-fetal genotype-matching effect on <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> was demonstrated for female offspring ( P=.01 ; parameter estimate 1.7 [95 % confidence interval 1.22-2.49] ) .
Because the matching effect could be associated with pregnancy complications rather than with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> per se , these findings are consistent with the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and with accumulating evidence that the prenatal period is involved in the origins of this disease .
Our approach demonstrates how genetic markers can be used to characterize the biology of prenatal risk factors of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Inflammatory molecules in the tears of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
To determine levels of a panel of inflammatory molecules and matrix metalloproteinases in the tears of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
A prospective , case-control study .
Twenty-eight patients ( 1 eye from each ) diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> at the Instituto Galego de Oftalmoloxia , Santiago de Compostela , Spain , during the period from September 2001 to June 2002 , and 20 normal control subjects ( 1 eye each ) were studied .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> were examined in a routine fashion , and keratometric readings were taken to monitor the degree of ectasia .
Fifteen microliters of tears was collected by capillary flow from each eye .
The concentrations of cytokines ( interleukin-4 [ IL-4] , IL-6 , IL-10 , and tumor necrosis factor alpha [ TN F-alpha] ) , cell adhesion molecules ( intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ) , and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) were measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> initially had significantly higher levels of IL-6 ( 6.7 [4.8-10.8 ] pg/ml vs . 2.2 [1. 0-4.1 ] pg/ml in control subjects [ P< 0.0001] ) , TN F-alpha ( 3.8 [2 .9-14 .4 ] pg/ml vs . 1.8 [1.5-2.3 ] pg/ml in control subjects [ P< 0.0001] ) , and MMP-9 ( 66 .5 [49.2-139.3]ng/ml vs . 6.1 [3 .9-8.3 ] ng/ml in control subjects .
The extent of the increase was found to be associated with the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
Interleukin-6 , TN F-alpha , and MMP-9 are overexpressed in the tears of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> , indicating that the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> may involve chronic inflammatory events .
A previously unrecognised phenotype characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> , and ability to speak in patients with Angelman syndrome caused by an imprinting defect .
The clinical features of Angelman syndrome ( AS ) comprise <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> prognathia <END> , absence of speech , ataxia , and a happy disposition .
We report on seven patients who lack most of these features , but presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> and mild mental retardation .
Based on the latter findings , the patients were initially suspected of having Prader-Willi syndrome .
DNA methylation analysis of SNRPN and D15 S63 , however , revealed an AS pattern , ie the maternal band was faint or absent .
Cytogenetic studies and microsatellite analysis demonstrated apparently normal chromosomes 15 of biparental inheritance .
We conclude that these patients have an imprinting defect and a previously unrecognised form of AS .
The mild phenotype may be explained by an incomplete imprinting defect or by cellular mosaicism .
Family history in patients with transient ischemic attacks .
To determine the influence of family history on vascular disease , we surveyed hospital patients discharged with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack .
Of 117 respondents , 81 knew their family history for myocardial infarction and 81 knew their family history for <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
Of 83 responding 43 reported a personal history of myocardial infarction , and of 85 responding 66 reported a personal history of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
As expected , there was an association between positive family and personal histories of myocardial infarction in younger ( aged less than 70 years ) patients ( Fisher 's two-tailed exact test , p = 0.014 ) .
This association was reversed for <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> ( Fisher 's two-tailed exact test , p = 0.017 ) .
Older ( aged greater than or equal to 70 years ) patients had a stronger association between positive family and personal histories of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> ; 14 ( 74% ) of 19 older patients with a positive personal history of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> had a positive family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
The reason for this reversal in the relation between family and personal histories of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> compared with myocardial infarction may relate to the older age at onset of most strokes , differing <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> subtypes in older age groups , or lower rates of fatal myocardial infarction .
This study suggests that familial factors may be important in some subtypes of cerebrovascular disease .
Familial effects may be different in vascular diseases of the heart and brain .
Citrin deficiency as a cause of chronic liver disorder mimicking non-alcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease .
Citrin deficiency caused by SLC25A13 gene mutations develops into adult-onset type II citrullinemia ( CTLN2 ) and may be accompanied with <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> and steatohepatitis .
As its clinical features remain unclear , we aimed to explore the characteristics of <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease associated with citrin deficiency .
The prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> in 19 CTLN2 patients was examined , and clinical features were compared with those of non-alcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease ( NAFLD ) patients without known SLC25A13 gene mutations .
Seventeen ( 89% ) CTLN2 patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> steatosis <END> , and 4 ( 21% ) had been diagnosed as having NAFLD before appearance of neuropsychological symptoms .
One patient had steatohepatitis .
Citrin deficiency-associated fatty livers showed a considerably lower prevalence of accompanying obesity and metabolic syndrome , higher prevalence of history of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> , and higher serum levels of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor ( PSTI ) than fatty livers without the mutations .
Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses revealed that a body mass index < 20kg/m(2 ) and serum PSTI>29ng/mL were associated with citrin deficiency .
Patients presenting with non-alcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> unrelated to obesity and metabolic syndrome might have citrin deficiency , and serum PSTI may be a useful indicator for distinguishing this from conventional NAFLD .
SLC26A3 mutations in congenital chloride <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> .
Congenital chloride <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> ( CLD ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder of intestinal electrolyte absorption .
It is characterized by persistent secretory <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> and prematurity prenatally , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dehydration <END> , hypoelectrolytemia , hyperbilirubinemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal distention <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> immediately after birth .
CLD is caused by mutations in the solute carrier family 26 , member 3 gene ( SLC26A3 , alias CLD or DRA) , which encodes a Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- ( or OH- ) exchanger .
SLC26A3 is a member of the SLC26 sulfate permease/anion transporter family and it is expressed mainly in the apical brush border of intestinal epithelium .
The only extraintestinal tissues showing SLC26A3 expression are eccrine sweat glands and seminal vesicles .
A wide variety of different mutations in the SLC26A3 gene have been associated with CLD with no apparent evidence of phenotype-genotype correlation .
The clinical course of CLD , however , is variable and may rather depend on environmental factors and compensatory mechanisms than mutations .
In this report , we present a summary of all published and two novel SLC26A3 mutations and polymorphisms , and review them in the context of their functional consequences and clinical implications .

Estimation of prognosis and prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> and Usher syndrome in Norway .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinitis pigmentosa <END> was diagnosed in 101 persons from 53 families .
The prognosis for visual function was most favourable for the autosomal dominant group ( 38 patients from 8 families ) .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> group (4 0 patients from 25 families ) and the 19 solitary cases were very <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> , with prognosis ranging from favourable to very bad .
There was a higher intrafamiliar correlation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> than in the autosomal dominant group .
In 28 patients from 18 families with Usher syndrome , almost all had good visual function until 30 years of age , and few had useful visual function after the age of 5 0 .
The age when the patients were registered varied between the different genetic types of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , reflecting differences in prognosis .
Therefore , ascertainment probability and prevalence were calculated for each genetic group separately .
The prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> in Norway , all genetic groups included , was calculated to be 1/4440 , the autosomal dominant type of the disease being the most frequent .
The prevalence of Usher syndrome was calculated to be 3.6/100,000 .
Both <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> and Usher syndrome were more prevalent in Laps .
Apparently new syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , Down syndrome-like facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We describe a previously unrecognized syndrome in two unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , distinctive facial appearance , skeletal changes , postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
A connexin 26 mutation causes a syndrome of sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar hyperkeratosis <END> ( MIM 148350 ) .
We report a missense mutation in the connexin 26 gene ( GJB2 ) in a family with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> and hyperkeratosis .
The affected family members have high frequency , slowly progressive , bilateral , sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar hyperkeratosis <END> .
The mutation causes an amino acid substitution ( G59A ) , which may disrupt a reverse turn in the first extracellular loop of connexin 26 . Connexin 26 mutations have been reported in syndromes of <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> palmoplantar keratoderma <END> .
These data provide additional evidence for the role of connexin 26 in syndromes of this type .
An HDR ( <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> , deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysplasia <END> ) syndrome locus maps distal to the DiGeorge syndrome region on 10p13/14 .
Partial monosomy 10p is a rare chromosomal condition and a significant proportion of patients show features of DiGeorge syndrome ( DGS ) and velocardiofacial syndrome ( VCFS ) .
A critical haploinsufficiency region for DGS/VCFS was defined on 10p ( DGCR2 ) .
We performed molecular deletion analysis of two further patients with partial monosomy 10p , who showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> , deafness , and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysplasia <END> or renal insufficiency , but no cardiac defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , or reduced T cell levels .
Previously , the combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> , deafness , and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysplasia <END> has been proposed to represent a specific syndrome ( MIM 146255 ) under the acronym HDR .
In addition to the two patients in this report , at least four published cases with partial monosomy 10p show the triad of HDR and 14 other patients present with at least two of the three features .
We therefore conclude that HDR syndrome can be associated with partial monosomy 10p .
Based on molecular deletion analysis and the clinical data , we suggest that the DGS/VCFS phenotype associated with 10p deletion can be considered as a contiguous gene syndrome owing to haploinsufficiency of two different regions .
Hemizygosity of the proximal region , designated DGCR2 , can cause cardiac defect and T cell deficiency .
Hemizygosity of the distal region , designated HDR1 , can cause <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> and in addition sensorineuronal deafness and renal dysplasia/insufficiency or a subset of this triad .
Clinical spectrum of immunodeficiency , centromeric instability and facial dysmorphism ( ICF syndrome ) .
Immunodeficiency , centromeric instability and facial dysmorphism ( ICF syndrome ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disease characterised by facial dysmorphism , <START:PHENOTYPE> immunoglobulin deficiency <END> and branching of chromosomes 1 , 9 and 16 after PHA stimulation of lymphocytes .
Hypomethylation of DNA of a small fraction of the genome is an unusual feature of ICF patients which is explained by mutations in the DNA methyltransferase gene DNMT3B in some , but not all , ICF patients .
To obtain a comprehensive description of the clinical features of this syndrome as well as genotype-phenotype correlations in ICF patients .
Data on ICF patients were obtained by literature search and additional information by means of questionnaires to corresponding authors .
Results and 45 patients all with proven centromeric instability were included in this study .
Facial dysmorphism was found to be a common characteristic ( n = 41/42 ) , especially <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> low set ears <END> .
Hypo- or agammaglobulinaemia was demonstrated in nearly all patients ( n = 39/44 ) .
Opportunistic infections were seen in several patients , pointing to a T cell dysfunction .
Haematological malignancy was documented in two patients .
Life expectancy of ICF patients is poor , especially those with severe infections in infancy or chronic gastrointestinal problems and <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> .
Early diagnosis of ICF is important since early introduction of immunoglobulin supplementation can improve the course of the disease .
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with severe infections or <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> .
Only 19 of 34 patients showed mutations in DNMT3B , suggesting genetic heterogeneity .
No genotype-phenotype correlation was found between patients with and without DNMT3B mutations .
[ Hereditary motor neuron disease : the proximal , adult , sex-linked form ( or Kennedy disease ) .
Clinical and neuroendocrinologic observations ] .
Clinical , electrophysiological , histological and neuroendocrinological findings in a peculiar form of progressive spinal and bulbar <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular atrophy <END> affecting 4 members in two different families are reported .
The clinical hallmarks , which characterize this entity among the group of degenerative motor neuron diseases are : sex-linked recessive inheritance ; onset in the third decade ; <START:PHENOTYPE> slow progression <END> ; involvement of facial and bulbar muscles in addition to wasting of the proximal and , in some cases , the distal musculature ; asymmetry of clinical signs ; consistent and abundant <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> predominantly in the peri-oral muscles ; intention <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> and a well-developed <START:PHENOTYPE> gynaecomastia <END> , which is the first clinical sign .
Electrophysiological and histological findings confirm the neurogenic origin of the <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular atrophy <END> ; in addition , muscle biopsy shows " myopathic-like " changes in one case and serum muscle enzyme levels are elevated in all neurologically affected patients .
It is believed that the clinical entity corresponds to the rare type III proximal hereditary motor <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> ( or " Kennedy 's disease" ) , of which 25 published cases are reviewed .
Neuroendocrinological data in two patients demonstrate an androgenic insufficiency of hypothalamo-hypophyseal origin and high levels of circulating oestrogens , which probably have induced <START:PHENOTYPE> gynaecomastia <END> .
Dynamic neuroendocrinological tests suggest that lesions of certain hypothalamic nuclei may exist , which should be looked for in the forthcoming anatomical studies .
BRCA1 mutations in women attending clinics that evaluate the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
To define the incidence of BRCA1 mutations among patients seen in clinics that evaluate the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , we analyzed DNA samples from women seen in this setting and constructed probability tables to provide estimates of the likelihood of finding a BRCA1 mutation in individual families .
Clinical information , family histories , and blood for DNA analysis were obtained from 263 women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing were used to identify BRCA1 mutations .
BRCA1 mutations were identified in 16 percent of women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Only 7 percent of women from families with a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> but not ovarian cancer had BRCA1 mutations .
The rates were higher among women from families with a history of both breast and ovarian cancer .
Among family members , an average age of less than 55 years at the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , the presence of ovarian cancer , the presence of breast and ovarian cancer in the same woman , and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry were all associated with an increased risk of detecting a BRCA1 mutation .
No association was found between the presence of bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> or the number of breast cancers in a family and the detection of a BRCA1 mutation , or between the position of the mutation in the BRCA1 gene and the presence of ovarian cancer in a family .
Among women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and a family history of the disease , the percentage with BRCA1 coding-region mutations is less than the 45 percent predicted by genetic-linkage analysis .
These results suggest that even in a referral clinic specializing in screening women from high-risk families , the majority of tests for BRCA1 mutations will be negative and therefore uninformative .
Glycogen storage diseases presenting as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy often prompts the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> , a sarcomere-protein gene disorder .
Because mutations in the gene for AMP-activated protein kinase gamma2 ( PRKAG2 ) cause an accumulation of cardiac glycogen and left ventricular hypertrophy that mimics <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> , we hypothesized that <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> might also be clinically misdiagnosed in patients with other mutations in genes regulating glycogen metabolism .
Genetic analyses performed in 75 consecutive unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> detected 40 sarcomere-protein mutations .
In the remaining 35 patients , PRKAG2 , lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 ( LAMP2) , alpha-galactosidase ( GLA) , and acid alpha-1 ,4-glucosidase ( GAA ) genes were studied .
Gene defects causing Fabry 's disease ( GLA ) and Pompe 's disease ( GAA ) were not found , but two LAMP2 and one PRKAG2 mutations were identified in probands with prominent hypertrophy and electrophysiological abnormalities .
These results prompted the study of two additional , independent series of patients .
Genetic analyses of 20 subjects with massive hypertrophy ( left ventricular wall thickness , > or =30 mm ) but without electrophysiological abnormalities revealed mutations in neither LAMP2 nor PRKAG2 .
Genetic analyses of 24 subjects with increased left ventricular wall thickness and electrocardiograms suggesting <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular preexcitation <END> revealed four LAMP2 and seven PRKAG2 mutations .
Clinical features associated with defects in LAMP2 included male sex , severe hypertrophy , early onset ( at 8 to 17 years of age ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular preexcitation <END> , and asymptomatic elevations of two serum proteins .
LAMP2 mutations typically cause multisystem glycogen-storage disease ( Danon 's disease ) but can also present as a primary cardiomyopathy.
The glycogen-storage cardiomyopathy produced by LAMP2 or PRKAG2 mutations resembles <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> but is distinguished by electrophysiological abnormalities , particularly <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular preexcitation <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> syndromes with abnormalities of lateralisation in a sibship .
In the family presented here the first child had <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> syndrome with cor biloculare ' transposition of the great vessels , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary stenosis <END> , and anomalous pulmonary venous drainage .
Another sib had <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> syndrome , including very similar cardiovascular defects and biliary atresia .
The possibility that these two syndromes , namely <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> , are different manifestations of a similar defect in the normal asymmetrical development of internal organs is discussed .
Targeted loss of Arx results in a developmental <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> mouse model and recapitulates the human phenotype in heterozygous females .
Mutations in the <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> aristaless-related homeobox gene ( ARX ) have been linked to structural brain anomalies as well as multiple neurocognitive deficits .
The generation of Arx-deficient mice revealed several morphological anomalies , resembling those observed in patients and an interneuron migration defect but perinatal lethality precluded analyses of later phenotypes .
Interestingly , many of the neurological phenotypes observed in patients with various ARX mutations can be attributed , in part , to interneuron dysfunction .
To directly test this possibility , mice carrying a floxed Arx allele were generated and crossed to Dlx5/6( CRE-IRES-GFP)( Dlx5/6( CIG) ) mice , conditionally deleting Arx from ganglionic eminence derived neurons including cortical interneurons .
We now report that Arx( -/y ) ;Dlx5/6( CIG) ( male ) mice exhibit a variety of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> types beginning in early-life , including <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> that behaviourally and electroencephalographically resembles infantile spasms , and show evolution through development .
Thus , this represents a new genetic model of a malignant form of paediatric <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , with some characteristics resembling infantile spasms , caused by mutations in a known infantile spasms gene .
Unexpectedly , approximately half of the female mice carrying a single mutant Arx allele ( Arx( -/+ ) ;Dlx5/6( CIG) ) also developed <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
We also found that a subset of human female carriers have <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and neurocognitive deficits .
In summary , we have identified a previously unrecognized patient population with neurological deficits attributed to ARX mutations that are recapitulated in our mouse model .
Furthermore , we show that perturbation of interneuron subpopulations is an important mechanism underling the pathogenesis of developmental <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in both hemizygous males and carrier females .
Given the frequency of ARX mutations in patients with infantile spasms and related disorders , our data unveil a new model for further understanding the pathogenesis of these disorders .
Finding twinkle in the eyes of a 71 -year-old lady : a case report and review of the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of TW INKLE-related dominant disease .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> ( PEO ) can be caused by a disorder characterized by multiple mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) deletions due to mutations in the TWINKLE gene , encoding a mtDNA helicase .
We describe a 71 -year-old woman who had developed PEO at age 55 years .
She had <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , diabetes , paresthesias , cognitive defects , memory problems , hearing loss , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory ataxia <END> .
She had muscle weakness with ragged red fibers on biopsy .
MRI showed static white matter changes .
A c.908G>A substitution ( p.R303Q ) in the TWINKLE gene was identified .
Multiple mtDNA deletions were detected in muscle but not blood by a PCR-based method , but not by Southern blot analysis .
MtDNA copy number was maintained in blood and muscle .
A systematic literature search was used to identify the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of dominant TW INKLE-related disease . Patients were adults with PEO and symptoms including myopathy , neuropathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
Diabetes , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , memory loss , hearing loss , and cardiac problems were infrequent .
All reported mutations clustered between amino acids 303 and 508 with no mutations at the N-terminal half of the gene .
The TWINKLE gene should be analyzed in adults with PEO even in the absence of mtDNA deletions in muscle on Southern blot analysis , and of a family history for PEO .
The pathogenic mutations identified 5 ' beyond the linker region suggest a functional role for this part of the protein despite the absence of a primase function in humans .
In our patient , the pathogenesis involved multiple mtDNA deletions without reduction in mtDNA copy number .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ichthyosis <END> in the SjÃ¶gren-Larsson syndrome .
The SjÃ¶gren-Larsson syndrome ( SLS ) is characterized by congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , spastic dior tetraplegia and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The inheritance is <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
All 36 patients with SLS alive in Sweden in 1980 were studied with regard to <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> .
A slight or moderate generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> , less pronounced in the face , was already present at birth . Collodion-like membranes were never seen .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> developed to its full extent during infancy .
It was sometimes slight but most often moderate .
Three types occurred in various combinations .
The skin changes were concentrated in the neck , flexures and lower abdomen , in which regions the scales were often dark .
The non-scaly <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> produced characteristic and easily visible skin markings .
Generalized erythema was rare , especially in adults .
The DNA synthesis of the epidermis and the production of a horny layer were increased .
Hair and nails were normal , as also was the ability to sweat .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Vestibular dysfunction <END> in DFNB1 deafness .
Mutations of GJB2 and GJB6 ( connexin-26 and 30 ) at the DFNB1 locus are the most common cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , nonsyndromic deafness .
Despite their widespread expression throughout the vestibular system , <START:PHENOTYPE> vestibular dysfunction <END> has not been widely recognized as a commonly associated clinical feature .
The observations of vertigo accompanying DFNB1 deafness in several large families prompted our hypothesis that <START:PHENOTYPE> vestibular dysfunction <END> may be an integral , but often overlooked , component of DFNB1 deafness .
Our aim was to define the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> vestibular dysfunction <END> in Cases of DFNB1 deafness and Controls with other forms of deafness .
We developed and used a survey to assess symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> vestibular dysfunction <END> , medical , and family history was distributed to Cases with deafness due to pathogenic GJB2 and/or GJB6 mutations and deaf Controls without DFNB1 deafness .
Our results showed : Surveys were returned by 235/515 Cases ( 46% ) with DFNB1 mutations and 121/321 Controls ( 38% ) without these mutations .
The mean age of Cases ( 41 ) was younger than Controls ( 51 ; P < 0.001 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Vestibular dysfunction <END> was reported by 127 (54% ) of Cases and was present at significantly higher rates in Cases than in deaf Controls without DFNB1 deafness ( P < 0.03 ) .
Most ( 63% ) had to lie down in order for vertigo to subside , and 48 % reported that vertigo interfered with activities of daily living .
Vertigo was reported by significantly more Cases with truncating than non-truncating mutations and was also associated with a family history of dizziness .
We conclude that <START:PHENOTYPE> vestibular dysfunction <END> appears to be more common in DFNB1 deafness than previously recognized and affects activities of daily living in many patients .

An <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> recessive basal ganglia disorder with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We report a previously apparently undescribed , <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> recessive basal ganglia disorder segregating in three generations of one family .
The affected patients were variably mentally retarded , although some showed strengths in oral reading and memory .
Most affected males had <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> increased head circumference <END> with large calvaria in relation to facial bones .
Their height and weight did not differ from that of other relatives ; testicular size was average , chromosomes were normal , and results of laboratory investigations for known metabolic disorders were normal .
All patients examined had neurological impairment , including persistent frontal lobe reflexes , <START:PHENOTYPE> cogwheel rigidity <END> , postural changes , and Parkinsonian-type tremors .
Some had <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> ; several had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Although carriers of the condition were not consistently abnormal , two had suggestive signs .
No definitive indication of the disorder was documented in infancy in any affected male , and it is possible that this could be due to lack of careful prospective clinical evaluation rather than to the absence of symptoms in early life .
Clinical , biochemical , and genetic characterization of a novel estrogen-dependent inherited form of <START:PHENOTYPE> angioedema <END> .
Two genetic forms of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> angioedema <END> ( HAE ) are currently recognized .
Both are transmitted in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> manner and are characterized by recurrent episodes of localized <START:PHENOTYPE> angioedema <END> .
Involvement of the gut leads to episodes of severe abdominal pain , and laryngeal involvement can lead to airway obstruction and even death .
One type results from heterozygosity for a nonexpressed C1 inhibitor allele , and the other results from heterozygosity for a nonfunctional C1 inhibitor allele .
This report identifies a third type of HAE , with a unique estrogen-dependent phenotype .
Detailed medical histories were obtained from family members , and a pedigree was constructed to ascertain the mode of inheritance .
Determination of serum complement factors , C1 inhibitor protein , C1 inhibitor function , coagulation factor XII , plasma prekallikrein , high molecular weight kininogen , and selected DNA sequences were performed in affected members by using standard assays .
Episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> angioedema <END> were clinically indistinguishable from those associated with previously described forms of HAE ; however , these occurred only during pregnancy or the use of exogenous estrogens .
Patients were otherwise asymptomatic , except for one patient who had acetyl salicylic acid/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-related <START:PHENOTYPE> angioedema <END> later in life .
History was available for members spanning 4 generations , and affected individuals were identified in 3 generations .
Of 46 family members , phenotype could be determined in 13 members .
Seven were affected , and 6 were not .
One male of undetermined phenotype was an obligate carrier .
The unique estrogen-dependent nature of the phenotype means that the status of several members in the third and fourth generation remains unknown .
The disorder appears to be transmitted in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion , although other modes of inheritance cannot be excluded entirely .
C1 inhibitor protein , C1 inhibitor function , C2 , C4 , C1q , coagulation factor XII , prekallikrein , and high molecular kininogen were normal in 3 affected family members during asymptomatic periods .
DNA sequencing revealed no abnormality in 3 patients in the coding region of the gene encoding C1 inhibitor or in the 5 ' flanking regions of the genes encoding C1 inhibitor and factor XII.
This family appears to have a novel form of inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> angioedema <END> that does not result from C1 inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction .
The phenotype is uniquely estrogen dependent .
Implications for diagnosis and treatment are discussed .
Further studies are required to define the exact nature of the genetic abnormality involved .
Welander distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> is not linked to other defined distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> gene loci .
Welander distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder with late onset that affects extensor muscles of the hands and the feet .
The disorder is considered as the most prevalent of the distal myopathies and is almost only seen in Sweden and in some parts of Finland .
On clinical , morphological and genetical grounds the disorder is clearly separated from other distal myopathies .
We have performed linkage analysis with the MLINK program in a total of six families with microsatellite markers dispersed throughout the genome and report exclusion for the localisation of the gene of 64 % of the human genome .
These studies have clearly separated Welander distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> from previously mapped forms of distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> such as the Miyoshi <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> by excluding linkage to chromosome 2 .
The region on 14q that has been suggested to house the gene of the distal <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> described by Laing et al . ( Am J Hum Genet 1995 ;56 :422-7) , has as well been excluded by several markers .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> pure <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
Neurological and genetic study .
A family with late-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pure <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> was studied both neurologically and genetically .
Neuroimaging and electrophysiological results were in agreement with the clinical evidence showing involvement of the cerebellar system only , even many years after onset .
No atrophy of inferior olives was observed by magnetic resonance imaging , while <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> was extremely marked .
A very slow disease progression was observed in all patients .
The disease can be differentiated from <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophies , and in particular from spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 1 mapping on chromosome 6p , which shows an early multisystemic involvement and a more rapid progression toward inability .
A genetic study of the family with the 6p DNA marker D6S89 closely linked to the spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 1 locus was performed .
Results showed significant exclusion of a linkage between the disease and the marker within a distance of 8.5 % recombination , indicating that genetic heterogeneity underlies phenotypic differences .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital hypotrichosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> milia <END> : report of a large family suggesting <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant inheritance <END> .
We report on a large family of four generations in which individuals have <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypotrichosis <END> and multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> milia <END> disappearing by adolescence .
The propositus a 30-month-old boy , has coarse , sparse hair and multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> milia <END> on face , chest , axillae and pubic region .
At 16 years , his sister has apparently normal hair and few <START:PHENOTYPE> milia <END> persisting on the forehead .
The same symptoms were present in the mother from birth and disappeared at 40 years .
There are no abnormalities of teeth and nails .
Polarizing light microscopy shows an increased diameter of the hair shaft .
The pedigree is compatible with an autosomal or an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> mode of inheritance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Megalencephaly <END> and leukodystrophy with mild clinical course : a report on 12 new cases .
Twelve patients with early infancy onset <START:PHENOTYPE> megalencephaly <END> and leukodystrophy with a mild clinical course are reported .
The neuroradiological , clinical , and genetic aspects of this recently recognized familial leukodystrophy syndrome were reviewed .
Five were affected siblings , and all patients had consanguineous parents .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Macrocephaly <END> , a slowly progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> delay in motor development <END> and mild mental deterioration constitute the clinical triad of the disease , showing characteristic age-related onset .
The clinical findings outlined remarkably slight functional deterioration despite severe lesions on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) , especially in the initial period .
Characteristically , mental function is preserved for years after onset of the motor deficit .
The MRI lesions do not reflect the progress of disease .
The disease probably has an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance even though no metabolic defect has been detected to date .
In a more severe variant of the mentioned disease , there is more progressive and severe neurological dysfunction , including <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and spastic quadriparesis , leading to an inability to walk independently after 10 years of age .
In mild variants , however , disease severity varies from <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> with near-normal pyschomotor development to mild motor and/or mental dysfunction .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> were observed in both types but response to drugs was good .
The 12 patients reported here confirm the specific and distinguishing clinical and radiological features of the previously reported 51 cases with this new syndrome , while adding some information regarding identification of the disease .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital nephrotic syndrome <END> : evolution of medical management and results of renal transplantation .
We analyzed the clinical course , pathologic findings , and results of aggressive medical management and renal transplantation in 41 infants with onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> in the first 3 months of life .
All but one infant with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital onset <END> failed to thrive and had progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> renal insufficiency <END> ; 17 were given steroids or cytotoxic drugs or both , without benefit .
Severe bacterial infections occurred in 85 % of the infants , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> in 12% , <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroesophageal reflux <END> in 8% , and thrombotic events in 10% .
All children prior to the era of renal transplantation died before 4 years of age .
The last 24 infants received aggressive medical management , which allowed renal transplantation in 17 . Two-year patient and graft survival rates were 82 % and 71 % , respectively .
There was no recurrence of the <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> in the children who underwent transplantation .
All but one surviving infants has had normal or accelerated growth , although mean height for the group is 3.1 SD below the mean .
School and social performance has been normal in 80% .
Thus intensive medical therapy combined with renal transplantation offers a very good opportunity for survival with an acceptable quality of life for infants with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Deficiency of the iron-sulfur clusters of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-ubiquinone oxidoreductase ( complex I ) in an infant with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> .
We report the case of an infant with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , an increased serum lactate/pyruvate ratio , and elevated plasma alanine , who had a moderate to profound decrease in the ability of mitochondria from four organs to oxidize pyruvate , malate plus glutamate , citrate , and other NAD+-linked respiratory substrates .
The capacity to oxidize the flavin adenine dinucleotide-linked substrate , succinate , was normal .
The most pronounced deficiency was in skeletal muscle , the least in kidney mitochondria .
Enzymatic assays on isolated mitochondria ruled out defects in complexes II , III , and IV of the respiratory chain .
Further studies showed that the defect was localized in the inner membrane <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase ( complex I ) . When ferricyanide was used as an artificial electron acceptor , complex I activity was normal , indicating that electrons from NADH could reduce the flavin mononucleotide cofactor .
However , electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy performed on liver submitochondrial particles showed an almost total loss of the iron-sulfur clusters characteristic of complex I , whereas normal signals were noted for other <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> iron-sulfur clusters .
This infant is presented as the first reported case of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> caused by a deficiency of the iron-sulfur clusters of complex I of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> electron transport chain .
Deletion analysis maps <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> proximal to the steroid sulphatase locus .
We describe a pedigree in which four male members are affected by a contiguous gene abnormality involving the short arm of the X chromosome ( Xp22.32 ) .
Bivariate flow cytometry of lymphoblastoid cell lines from two of these individuals and a normal male showed a 6-7 megabase deletion in affected males , and high resolution chromosomal G-banding of an obligate heterozygote showed the deletion to reside in the Xp22.32 region .
Affected members had <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> ichthyosis due to steroid sulphatase deficiency , Kallmann 's syndrome , but no <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> .
In two out of four affected individuals studied , there was unilateral renal agenesis .
Deletion analysis using the Xp22.32 markers MIC2 , DXS31 , DXS 89 , GMGX9 , DXS278 , DXS143 , and DXS9 showed that the deletion extended from DXS31 to DXS143 ( inclusive ) .
The absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> in this pedigree shows conclusively that the <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> gene resides proximal to the DXS143 locus .
Further , the inconstant association of unilateral renal agenesis with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> Kallmann 's syndrome , even when the latter is caused by a complete deletion of the gene , suggests that the absence of the <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> Kallmann gene can be compensated in renal development .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Primary pulmonary hypertension <END> , congenital heart defect , central nervous system malformations , hypo- and aplastic toes : another case of Yunis-VarÃ³n syndrome or report of a new entity .
Here we describe a patient with a new malformation syndrome which shows similarities with Yunis-Varon syndrome ( YVS ) .
Prenatal presentation included <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> , increased nuchal translucency , and bilateral hydrothoraces requiring pigtail insertion .
Postnatal presentation revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> ( PPH) , persistent hydrothoraces , one atrial and two <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defects <END> , hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and cerebellar vermis , dilated interhemispheric ventricles , severe developmental delay with general <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> , retinal anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse scalp hair <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse eyebrows <END> and eyelashes , hypo- and <START:PHENOTYPE> aplastic nails <END> , low-set dysplastic ears , loose nuchal skin , hypo- and aplastic distal phalanges of the toes as well as postnatal failure to thrive .
High resolution molecular karyotyping in the patient did not reveal any causative chromosomal aberration .
Since one patient with YVS and PPH has been previously reported , we assume a similar pathogenic pathway .
However , molecular confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is not yet possible .
It remains uncertain if the presented syndrome can be classified as YVS with PPH or if it constitutes a new YVS like entity .

Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , eclabion , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectropion <END> and mental retardation--a new genetic syndrome .
A syndrome with severe generalized congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , eclabion , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectropion <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> without neurological symptoms or macular changes in the eyes was seen in two sibs and in two aunts and uncles in an inbred North-Swedish family .
The clinical picture of the patients in the present family strongly deviated from that seen in the SjÃ¶gren-Larsson syndrome found in the same area .
This could be a new syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Familial aggregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , and Parkinson 's disease : evidence of shared genetic susceptibility .
Clinicians have long suspected an association of classic <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> ( ALS ) with Parkinson 's disease ( PD) , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , or both .
If proven , this would raise the possibility of a shared genetic susceptibility to the three disorders .
To investigate this hypothesis , we compared 151 newly diagnosed ALS patients ( seven familial ) with 140 controls in terms of cumulative incidence of ALS , PD , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> in parents , siblings , and grandparents .
We used Cox proportional hazards analysis to compute rate ratios ( RRs ) for ALS , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , and PD in relatives of ALS patients versus relatives of controls .
The risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> was significantly higher in relatives of ALS patients than in those of controls ( RR = 1 .9 ; 95 % CI 1 .1-3.1 ) and was similar for relatives of patients with sporadic and familial AL S .
The risk of PD was higher in relatives of patients with familial ALS ( RR = 5.6 ; 95 % CI 0.6-5 0.3 ) than in relatives of patients with sporadic ALS ( RR = 1.8 ; 95 % CI 0.5-6.0) , but these differences were not statistically significant , probably due to insufficient statistical power with the available sample size .
These findings indicate that ALS and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , and perhaps also PD , co-occur within families more often than expected by chance , suggesting that there may be a shared genetic susceptibility to these disorders .
Radiographic findings and Gs-alpha bioactivity studies and mutation screening in acrodysostosis indicate a different etiology from pseudohypoparathyroidism .
Acrodysostosis is an uncommon skeletal dysplasia associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> nasal hypoplasia <END> , midface deficiency , severe brachydactyly , and varying degrees of <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Previous publications have suggested that it may be difficult to distinguish acrodystostosis from pseudohypoparathyroidism on clinical grounds , but acrodysostosis does appear to have distinct clinical and radiologic findings .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spinal stenosis <END> is an underappreciated risk in acrodysostosis , despite the reported loss of normal caudal widening of the lumbar interpediculate distance on AP spine radiographs in the original report of this disorder by Robinow et al. , with confirmation of these radiographic findings by Butler et al .
We report two sporadic cases of acrodysostosis , one of which required decompressive laminectomy for symptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal stenosis <END> , and review 11 cases of acrodysostosis from 9 families that were submitted to the International Skeletal Dysplasia Registry .
The objective of this report is to determine the frequency and severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal stenosis <END> in patients with acrodysostosis and to summarize the clinical and radiographic findings of acrodysostosis in an effort to distinguish acrodysostosis clearly from pseudohypoparathyroidism .
The pattern of brachydactyly differs between these two conditions , and varying degrees of <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal stenosis <END> are characteristic of acrodysostosis .
Both our index patients with acrodysostosis had normal bioactivity of the alpha subunit of the Gs protein , therefore indicating that acrodysostosis has a different pathogenesis from pseudohypoparathyroidism .
Furthermore , single-strand confirmational polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis failed to demonstrate any confirmational alterations in the coding exons of the Gs alpha gene .
These radiographic and laboratory findings substantiate that acrodysostosis is clinically different from pseudohypoparathyroidism and that it is necessary to follow patients with acrodysostosis for signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal stenosis <END> .
Asymmetrical skull , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> , clefting , umbilical anomalies , and skeletal anomalies in sibs : is Carnevale syndrome a separate entity ?
A group of syndromes , consisting of Malpuech syndrome , Michels syndrome , Carnevale syndrome , OSA syndrome , and Mingarelli syndrome share the combination of symptoms of highly <START:PHENOTYPE> arched eyebrows <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and vary in other symptoms such as asymmetry of the skull , eyelid , and <START:PHENOTYPE> anterior chamber anomalies <END> , clefting of lip and palate , umbilical anomalies , and growth and cognitive development .
It has been suggested that they are in fact part of the same entity .
Here , we describe a brother and sister with the same constellation of symptoms , and compare these with the various entities .
We conclude that the present patients resemble most patients with Carnevale and Mingarelli syndrome , and the case reported by Guion-Almeida , and that these patients form together most probably the same entity .
We suggest the name Carnevale syndrome as this author described this combination of symptoms for the first time .
Malpuech and Michels syndromes are probably separate entities , although they may still be allelic .
Pattern of inheritance of Carnevale syndrome is most likely <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .

Association study of the polymorphisms on chromosome 12p13 with atherothrombotic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> in the Japanese population .
Recent genome-wide association study using four prospective population-based cohorts identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) on chromosome 12p13 , rs12425791 and rs11833579 , to be significantly associated with the incidence of atherothrombotic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
To examine the association of these SNPs with atherothrombotic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> in the Japanese population , we carried out a case-control association study using a total of 3784 cases and 3102 controls .
We also examined the effect of these SNPs on the subtypes of ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
Association analysis was carried out using logistic regression model after adjustment of age , sex and cardiovascular risk factors .
Rs12425791 was significantly associated with atherothrombotic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> ( P= 0.0084 , odds ratio ( OR ) =1 .15 ) .
When we analyzed effects of rs12425791 on ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> subtypes , rs12425791 was significantly associated with both small-artery occlusion ( P= 0.015 , OR=1 .15 ) and large-artery atherosclerosis ( P= 0.024 , OR=1 .19 ) .
Rs11833579 showed no association with atherothrombotic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> or its subtypes in our population .
Our data suggest that rs12425791 on chromosome 12p13 is a genetic marker for atherothrombotic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> in multiethnic population .
Novel POLG splice site mutation and optic atrophy.
To investigate the molecular etiology of 2 unrelated patients with a multisystem mitochondrial disorder accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> in one of them .
Clinical examination and neurophysiological , radiological , morphological , and molecular analyses .
Tertiary care neuromuscular clinic and molecular genetics laboratory .
A 65 -year-old man ( patient 1 ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> dyschromatopsia <END> and vision loss since childhood developed <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and myopathy in the seventh decade of life and was found to have optic atrophy.
A 63-year-old man ( patient 2 ) with a similar phenotype , without visual symptoms , experienced also hearing loss and <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
Description of the clinical and molecular findings .
A muscle biopsy specimen showed ragged-red , ragged-blue , and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers in both patients .
Because <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> in patient 1 suggested an autosomal dominant OPA1- related disorder , the OPA1 gene was first sequenced , the results of which did not detect any mutations .
Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction analyses of muscle mitochondrial DNA revealed multiple deletions .
Sequencing of POLG detected a novel variant , c.3104 + 3A>T , in both patients .
Patient 1 was compound heterozygous for a known p.F749S mutation ; patient 2 had p.G848 S as the second mutation .
Analysis of POLG complementary DNA showed that c.3104 + 3A> T results in skipping of exon 18 . Early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dyschromatopsia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> can occur not only in OPA1- related but also in POLG-related disorders with significant impact on genetic counseling .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> caused by mosaic variegated aneuploidy with premature centromere division ( PCD ) : report of a new case and review of the literature .
We report a male infant with multiple congenital anomalies and mosaic variegated aneuploidy ; a rare cytogenetic abnormality characterized by mosaicism for several different aneuploidies involving many different chromosomes .
He had <START:PHENOTYPE> prenatal-onset growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , dysmorphic face , seizures , hypotonia , feeding difficulty , and developmental delay .
In addition , he developed bilateral Wilms tumors .
Neuroradiological examination revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> and hypoplasia of the cerebral hemisphere and pons .
Cytogenetic analysis revealed various multiple numerical aneuploidies in blood lymphocytes , fibroblasts , and bone marrow cells , together with premature centromere division ( PCD ) .
Peripheral blood chromosome analysis from his parents also showed PCD , but no aneuploid cells .
The clinical phenotype and multiple aneuploidies of the patient may be a consequence of the homozygous PCD trait inherited from his parents .
Comparison with previously reported cases of multiple aneuploidy suggests that mosaic variegated aneuploidy with PCD may be a clinically recognizable syndrome with major phenotypes being mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , structural brain anomalies ( including <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> ) , and possible cancer predisposition .
Genetic heterogeneity in osteogenesis imperfecta .
An epidemiological and genetical study of osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) in Victoria , Australia confirmed that there are at least four distinct syndromes at present called OI .
The largest group of patients showed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> leading to fractures and distinctly <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> .
A large proportion of adults had presenile <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> or a family history of presenile conductive <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> .
A second group , who comprised the majority of newborns with neonatal fractures , all died before or soon after birth .
These had characteristic broad , crumpled femora and <START:PHENOTYPE> beaded ribs <END> in skeletal x-rays .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> was likely for some , if not all , of these cases .
A third group , two thirds of whom had fractures at birth , showed severe progressive deformity of limbs and spine .
The density of scleral blueness appeared less than that seen in the first group of patients and approximated that seen in normal children and adults .
Moreover , the blueness appeared to decrease with age .
All patients in this group were sporadic cases .
The mode of inheritance was not resolved by the study , but it is likely that the group is heterogeneous with both dominant and recessive genotypes responsible for the syndrome .
The fourth group of patients showed dominant inheritance of <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> leading to fractures , with variable deformity of long bones , but normal sclerae .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Optic neuropathy <END> induced by reductions in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> superoxide dismutase .
Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are suspected to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> ( LHON) , caused by mutated complex I subunit genes .
It seems surprising that <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> has not been described in animals with a knockout of genes encoding critical anti-ROS defenses .
If ROS have a role in the optic nerve injury of LHON , then increasing <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> levels of ROS should induce optic neuropathy.
To develop an animal model system for study of oxidative injury to the optic nerve , <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> defenses were decreased against ROS by designing hammerhead ribozymes to degrade SOD2 mRNA .
Several potential ribozymes were analyzed in vitro .
The one with the best kinetic characteristics was cloned into a recombinant adeno-associated virus ( rAAV ) vector for delivery and testing in cells and animals .
The effects of the AAV-expressing ribozyme on murine cell growth , SOD2 mRNA and protein , cellular ROS levels , and apoptosis were evaluated by RNase protection assay , immunoblot analysis , and ROS- and apoptosis-activated fluorescent probes .
The rAAV-ribozyme was then injected into the eyes of DBA/1J mice , and the effect on the optic nerve was evaluated by ocular histopathologic examination .
The AAV-expressing ribozyme decreased SOD2 mRNA and protein levels by as much as 85% , increased cellular superoxide , reduced <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> membrane potential , and culminated in the death of infected cell lines by apoptosis without significantly altering complex I and III activity , somewhat spared in the most common LHON mutation ( G11778A) , although adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) synthesis is markedly reduced .
When inoculated into the eyes of mice , the AAV-expressing ribozyme led to loss of axons and myelin in the optic nerve and ganglion cells in the retina , the hallmarks of optic nerves examined at autopsy of patients with LHON .
The striking similarity of the <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> to the histopathology of LHON is powerful evidence supporting ROS as a key factor in the pathogenesis of LHON .
Skeletal responsiveness in <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoparathyroidism <END> .
A spectrum of clinical disease .
Three cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoparathyroidism <END> with roentgenographic evidence of hyperparathyroid bone disease are described .
Renal resistance to exogenous parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , the hallmark of <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoparathyroidism <END> , was documented by markedly blunted or absent urinary phosphate and cyclic AMP responses to parathyroid extract .
At the time of diagnosis all patients were hypocalcemic and hyperphosphatemic with elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels and subperiosteal resorption noted on skeletal films .
Bone biopsy in one patient revealed a histologic appearance consistent with hyperparathyroidism .
Serum PTH levels , measured in two patients while they were hypocalcemic , were elevated .
None of the patients had short stature , brachydactyly , subcutaneous calcification or mental deficiency .
These cases are compared to the 15 well-documented cases previously reported .
The presently available information on <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoparathyroidism <END> indicates a variable skeletal response to PTH mediated by several factors extrinsic to bone and suggests that <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoparathyroidism <END> with hyperparathyroid bone disease is one extreme of a clinical spectrum of skeletal responsiveness to PTH .
This disorder is part of an expanding clinical picture which makes <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoparathyroidism <END> a diagnostic consideration in any patient with unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphosphatemia <END> , elevated alkaline phosphatase levels or metabolic bone disease .
A new form of mandibulofacial dysostosis with macroblepharon and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> .
We report on a girl aged 7 years with normal mental development but an unusual form of mandibulofacial dysostosis .
The hallmarks of the syndrome are a round , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> extending to the temples , a broad nasal base , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , small , <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated ears <END> , a long , <START:PHENOTYPE> smooth philtrum <END> , a thin upper lip , striking <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> , retrognathism with reduced height of the mandible , and irregularly placed teeth , some to them missing .
New syndrome : brain malformation , growth retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokinesia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> in two brothers .
We report two brothers who were born after pregnancies characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokinesia <END> .
Both had brain malformation ( <START:PHENOTYPE> absence of corpus callosum <END> in one ; arhinencephaly in the other ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow palpebral fissures <END> .
This family and several similar phenotypes reported only in affected brothers could reflect <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked inheritance <END> .
Comprehensive evaluation of the association between <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> and genotypes/haplotypes in CYP17A1 , CYP3A4 , and SRD5A2 .
Genes involved in the testosterone biosynthetic pathway - such as CYP17A1 , CYP3A4 , and SRD5A2 - represent strong candidates for affecting <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
Previous work has detected associations between individual variants in these three genes and <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> risk and aggressiveness .
To more comprehensively evaluate CYP17A1 , CYP3A4 , and SRD5A2 , we undertook a two-phase study of the relationship between their genotypes/haplotypes and <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
Phase I of the study first searched for single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in these genes by resequencing 24 individuals from the Coriell Polymorphism Discovery Resource , 92-11 0 men from <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> case-control sibships , and by leveraging public databases .
In all , 87 SNPs were discovered and genotyped in 276 men from case-control sibships .
Those SNPs exhibiting preliminary case-control allele frequency differences , or distinguishing ( ie , 'tagging ' ) common haplotypes across the genes , were identified for further study ( 24 SNPs in total ) .
In Phase II of the study , the 24 SNPs were genotyped in an additional 841 men from case-control sibships .
Finally , associations between genotypes/haplotypes in CYP17A1 , CYP3A4 , and SRD5A2 and <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> were evaluated in the total case-control sample of 1117 brothers from 506 sibships .
Family-based analyses detected associations between <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> risk or aggressiveness and a number of CYP3A4 SNPs ( P-values between 0.006 and 0.05 ) , a CYP3A4 haplotype ( P-values 0.05 and 0.009 in nonstratified and stratified analysis , respectively) , and two SRD5A2 SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium ( P= 0.02 ) .
Undertaking a two-phase study comprising SNP discovery , haplotype tagging , and association analyses allowed us to more fully decipher the relation between CYP17A1 , CYP3A4 , and SRD5A2 and <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
Two anonymous DNA segments distinguish the Wilms ' tumor and <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> loci .
The association of Wilms ' tumor with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> ( the WAGR complex ) in children with 11p13 chromosomal abnormalities has been established , but the paucity of molecular probes in 11p13 has hampered identification of the responsible genes .
Two new anonymous DNA segments have been identified that map to the WAGR region of 11p13 .
Both DNA probes identify a cytologically undetectable deletion associated with a balanced chromosome translocation inherited by a patient with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , but not Wilms ' tumor .
The same two DNA segments are also included in the distal p13-p14 .1 deletion of another patient , who has <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , Wilms ' tumor , and hypogonadism , but they are not included in the p12-p13 deletion of a third patient , who does not have <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> but has had a Wilms ' tumor .
The discovery of this <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> deletion and these two DNA segments that physically separate the Wilms ' tumor and <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> loci should facilitate identification of the genes in the WAGR locus , beginning with the <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> gene .
Congenital hypothalamic hamartoblastoma , hypopituitarism , <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> and postaxial polydactyly--a new syndrome ?
Part I : clinical , causal , and pathogenetic considerations .
We report on six infants with a neonatally lethal malformation syndrome of hypothalamic hamartoblastoma , postaxial polydactyly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> .
Some , but not all , patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> laryngeal cleft <END> , abnormal lung lobulation , renal agenesis and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short 4th metacarpals <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dysplasia <END> , multiple buccal frenula , hypoadrenalism , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphallus <END> , congenital heart defect , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> .
The infants also had hypopituitarism and hypoadrenalism .
All were sporadic cases , parents were not consanguineous , chromosomes were apparently normal .
Family histories were unremarkable .
There was insecticide and/or herbicide exposure in several of the cases , but no exposures were common to all 6 mothers .
Five of the patients were born within an 8-month period , but all in different geographic locations .
It is postulated that this is a previously apparently unreported syndrome of presently unknown cause .
Nonspecific X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> II: the frequency in British Columbia .
Data on nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in two or more sibs ascertained from the British Columbia Health Surveillance Registry are utilized to calculate the frequency of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in the population of British Columbia ( B.C. ) .
In the 195 0-1969 birth cohort there are 107 sibships with only males affected and 35 sibships with only females affected giving an excess of 72 male-affected sibships .
Family histories of the sibships with two more more mentally retarded males provide evidence that the mothers of the excess of male-affected sibships are carriers of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Thus , a frequency of 1.83 per 1,000 males for X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and carrier frequency of 2.44 per 1,000 females are calculated .
This frequency can account for all the excess of males in the population who are affected with nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We estimate that seven to 19 X-linked genes exist to cause nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and that the frequency of the marker-X chromosome , associated with X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in some families , may be 0.92 per 1,000 male births .
Functional analysis of a novel potassium channel ( KCNA1 ) mutation in hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> myokymia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myokymia <END> is characterized by spontaneous , involuntary muscle fiber group contraction visible as vermiform movement of the overlying skin .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myokymia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait caused by mutations in KCNA1 , encoding a voltage-gated potassium channel .
In the present study , we report a family with four members affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> myokymia <END> .
Additional clinical features included motor delay initially diagnosed as cerebral palsy , worsening with febrile illness , persistent extensor plantar reflex , and absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> .
Mutation analysis revealed a novel c.676 C> A substitution in the potassium channel gene KCNA1 , resulting in a T226K nonconservative missense mutation in the Kv1 .1 subunit in all affected individuals .
Electrophysiological studies of the mutant channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes indicated a loss of function .
Co-expression of WT and mutant cRNAs significantly reduced whole-oocyte current compared to expression of WT Kv1 .1 alone .
Localization of a gene ( CMT2A) for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 to chromosome 1p and evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> .
Charcot-Marie-Tooth ( CMT) disease type 2 ( CMT2 ) is an inherited peripheral neuropathy characterized by variable <START:PHENOTYPE> age of onset <END> and normal or slightly diminished nerve conduction velocity .
CMT2 is pathologically and genetically distinct from CMT type 1 ( CMT1 ) .
While CMT1 has been shown to be genetically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> , no chromosomal localization has been established for CMT2 .
We have performed pedigree linkage analysis in six large <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> CMT2 families and have demonstrated linkage and <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> to a series of microsatellites ( D1S16 0 , D1S170 , D1S244 , D1S228 and D1S199 ) in the distal region of the short arm of chromosome 1 . Significant evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> was found using admixture analysis and the two-point lod scores .
Admixture analyses using the multipoint results for the markers D1S244 , D1S228 , and D1S199 supported the two-point findings .
Three families , DUK662 , DUK1241 , and 1523 gave posterior probabilities of 1.0 , 0.98 , and 0.88 of being of the linked type .
Multipoint analysis examining the " linked " families showed that the most favored location for the CMT2A gene is within the interval flanked by D1S244 and D1S228 ( odds approximately 70 :1 of lying within versus outside that interval ) .
These findings suggest that the CMT2 phenotype is secondary to at least two different genes and demonstrate further <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> in the CMT phenotype .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> syndrome : delineation of two types .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> syndrome ( BPES ) is rare and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> .
A family is presented and analyzed together with 38 kindreds with BPES reported in the literature .
The results demonstrate the existence of two types of the syndrome : type I with infertility in affected females , and type II which is transmitted by females and males .
The two entities are further differentiated by incomplete penetrance only in type II and by differences in the sex ratios of the affected children .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Female infertility <END> in type I is a predominant symptom , and the distinction between the two types is of importance for genetic counseling .
Retinal degeneration with <START:PHENOTYPE> nanophthalmos <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic macular degeneration <END> , and angle closure <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
A new recessive syndrome .
Seven related patients had a progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinal degeneration <END> , characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> nyctalopia <END> , visual field restriction , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic macular degeneration <END> in younger patients and a macula of nonspecific atrophic appearance in older patients .
In addition , each patient had high hyperopia ( +9.5 0 to +16.00 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> nanophthalmos <END> ( axial lengths , less than 20 mm) , with diffuse choroidal thickening on ultrasound .
Younger patients had slitlike anterior chamber angles ; older patients developed progressive synechial angle closure and eventual <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Chromosomes were normal .
On electroretinographic testing , younger patients had absent rod signals , with normal cone wave form and near-normal b-wave amplitudes but markedly delayed cone b-wave implicit times ; older patients had severely diminished or extinguished electroretinograms .
This family appears to represent a newly recognized autosomal-recessive syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> telangiectasia in the British Isles : the clinical and laboratory features of 70 affected individuals .
Seventy individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> telangiectasia were studied : 29 females and 41 males with an age range of 2 to 42 years .
The majority ( 43/68 ) presented by 3 years of age with truncal <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
All had progressive , handicapping neurological symptoms exhibiting <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> (70/70 ) , ocular motor apraxia (70/70 ) , an impassive face (70/70 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> (70/70 ) , chorea ( 68 /70 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> (55 /70 ) and peripheral neuropathy (5 0/70 ) .
Clinical immune deficiency was present in 43 of 70 patients .
Ocular telangiectasia were seen in all but one case and excessive thinness in 54 of 70 .
The mean age of loss of walking was 10 years and of writing 8 years .
All 60 tested showed increased sensitivity to ionizing irradiation , 43 of 48 had an <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated alpha-fetoprotein <END> level and 14 of 21 had an immunoglobulin deficiency .
Although there was a marked variation in disease findings sibs were always similar .
The heterogeneity seen seems at odds with the unilocus linkage of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> telangiectasia to 11q23.
Shprintzen-Goldberg marfanoid syndrome : a case followed up for 24 years .
A patient with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome was followed up for 24 years .
The patient 's parents were unrelated and unaffected .
Walking and speech were delayed .
Facial dysmorphism was obvious as well as <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , bilateral dislocation of the radial heads , hammer toes and hallux valgus , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes planus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , and camptodactyly .
Skin was thin and fragile .
CT scan showed ventricular enlargement .
He had a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> .
He was operated on twice for bilateral inguinal and crural hernia and several times for his foot deformities .
Puberty was delayed until 18 years .
At 24 years of age he was still thin , dolichocephalic , and the facial dysmorphic features were still obvious .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pectus excavatum <END> was still severe but the thoracolumbar <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> was mild .
His foot deformities had improved and his joints were less hypermobile .
Psychomotor development was quite normal .
His main concern was the <START:PHENOTYPE> minimal subcutaneous fat <END> and fragility of skin .
Echocardiography was now normal .
Crisponi syndrome is caused by mutations in the CRLF1 gene and is allelic to cold-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> syndrome type 1 . Crisponi syndrome is a severe <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition that is phenotypically characterized by abnormal , paroxysmal muscular contractions resembling neonatal tetanus , <START:PHENOTYPE> large face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , hyperthermia , and sudden death in most cases .
We performed homozygosity mapping in five Sardinian and three Turkish families with Crisponi syndrome , using high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays , and identified a critical region on chromosome 19p12-13.1 .
The most prominent candidate gene was CRLF1 , recently found to be involved in the pathogenesis of cold-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> syndrome type 1 ( CISS1 ) .
CISS1 belongs to a group of conditions with overlapping phenotypes , also including cold-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> syndrome type 2 and Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome .
All these syndromes are caused by mutations of genes of the ciliary neurotrophic factor ( CNTF )-receptor pathway .
Here , we describe the identification of four different CRLF1 mutations in eight different Crisponi-affected families , including a missense mutation , a single-nucleotide insertion , and a nonsense and an insertion/deletion ( indel ) mutation , all segregating with the disease trait in the families .
Comparison of the mutation spectra of Crisponi syndrome and CISS1 suggests that neither the type nor the location of the CRLF1 mutations points to a phenotype/genotype correlation that would account for the most severe phenotype in Crisponi syndrome .
Other , still-unknown molecular factors may be responsible for the variable phenotypic expression of the CRLF1 mutations .
We suggest that the syndromes can comprise a family of " CNTF-receptor-related disorders , " of which Crisponi syndrome would be the newest member and allelic to CISS1 .
Nine novel mutations in <START:PHENOTYPE> maturity-onset diabetes of the young <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> ) candidate genes in 22 Spanish families .
The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of major <START:PHENOTYPE> maturity-onset diabetes of the young <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> ) subtypes in Spanish <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> families and to analyze genotype-phenotype correlations .
Twenty-two unrelated pediatric <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> patients and 97 relatives were screened for mutations in the coding region of the glucokinase ( GCK) , hepatic nuclear factor- HNF-1alpha and HNF4alpha genes using PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism and/or direct sequencing .
In families carrying GCK mutations , the influence of genetic defects on fetal growth was investigated by comparing the birth weights of 32 offspring discordant for the mutations .
Mutations in <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> genes were identified in 64 % of the families .
GCK/MODY2 mutations were the most frequently found , in 41 % : seven novel ( R369P , S411F , M298K , C252Y , Y108C , A188E , and S383L ) and 2 already described mutations .
Four pedigrees ( 18% ) harbored mutations in the HNF-1alpha/MODY3 gene , including a previously unreported change ( R271G ) .
One family ( 4% ) carried a novel mutation in the HNF-4alpha gene ( IVS5-2delA) , representing the first report of a MODY1 pedigree in the Spanish population .
The age at diagnosis was prepubertal in MODY2 index patients and pubertal in MODY3 patients .
Overt diabetes was rare in MODY2 and was invariably present in MODY3 index patients .
Chronic complications of diabetes were absent in the MODY2 population and were present in more than 40% of all relatives of MODY3 .
Birth weight was lower in the presence of a GCK fetal mutation when the mutation was of paternal origin .
The MODY1 patient was diagnosed at 15 yr of age .
She developed intermittent microalbuminuria despite good metabolic control , and severe late-onset complications were common within her family .
Mutations in the GCK/MODY2 gene are the most common cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> in our population as recruited from pediatric and adolescent index patients .
The inheritance of GCK defects by the fetus results in a reduction of birth weight .
Clinical expression of MODY3 and MODY1 mutations , the second and third groups of defects found , was more severe , including the frequent development of chronic complications .
Anticipation in hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy.
Anticipation refers to the progressively earlier onset and increase in disease severity in successive generations .
We studied four families with hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy ( DRPLA) , a neurodegenerative disease , and anticipation was present in the mode of inheritance .
In subsequent generations DRPLA shows an earlier onset and more severe as well as additional symptoms .
Older onset patients suffer from <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , whereas younger onset patients present as progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome , which consists of mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> as well as <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> .
Anticipation with paternal transmission was significantly greater than with maternal transmission .
Multiple deletions of mtDNA in two brothers with sideroblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy and in their asymptomatic mother .
Two brothers presented with a clinical picture characterized by sideroblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic insufficiency <END> and progressive muscle weakness .
The presence of an associated permanent basal <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidemia <END> raised the suspicion of a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disease .
A muscle biopsy performed in both siblings proved the presence of a significant number of ragged-red fibers , and respiratory chain enzymatic determinations demonstrated a reduced activity of complexes I , III and IV. <START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> DNA studies disclosed the presence of multiple deletions both in skeletal muscle and , to a lesser extent , in leukocytes .
Similar , but not identical deletions were also present in the leukocytes and muscle from their mother .
Deletions were flanked by short direct repeats .
We conclude that such patients suffer from a familial form of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disease clinically resembling Pearson 's syndrome , with a probably autosomal dominant inheritance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Arthrogryposis <END> , perthes disease , and upward gaze palsy : a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndromic form of <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> .
In this article , the unusual combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> , upward gaze palsy , and Perthes disease in two sisters and their cousin who are all part of an extended consanguineous Saudi family is reported .
All patients had difficult to control <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchial asthma <END> and subtle facial dysmorphism .
Two of the three had <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> , two were intellectually normal , and one had academic problems but had a history of birth hypoxia .
Pedigree is consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance .
Lack of previous reports suggests this represents a novel syndromic form of <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> .

Defects in succinate dehydrogenase in <START:PHENOTYPE> gastrointestinal stromal tumors <END> lacking KIT and PDGFRA mutations .
Carney-Stratakis syndrome , an inherited condition predisposing affected individuals to <START:PHENOTYPE> gastrointestinal stromal tumor <END> ( GIST) and paraganglioma , is caused by germline mutations in succinate dehydrogenase ( SDH ) subunits B , C , or D , leading to dysfunction of complex II of the electron transport chain .
We evaluated the role of defective cellular respiration in <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> GIST <END> lacking mutations in KIT or PDGFRA ( WT) .
Thirty-four patients with WT <START:PHENOTYPE> GIST <END> without a personal or family history of paraganglioma were tested for SDH germline mutations .
WT GISTs lacking demonstrable SDH genetic inactivation were evaluated for SDHB expression by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting and for complex II activity .
For comparison , SDHB expression was also determined in KIT mutant and neurofibromatosis-1-associated GIST, and complex II activity was also measured in SDH-deficient paraganglioma and KIT mutant GIST; 4 of 34 patients ( 12% ) with WT <START:PHENOTYPE> GIST <END> without a personal or family history of paraganglioma had germline mutations in SDHB or SDHC .
WT GISTs lacking somatic mutations or deletions in SDH subunits had either complete loss of or substantial reduction in SDHB protein expression , whereas most KIT mutant GISTs had strong SDHB expression .
Complex II activity was substantially decreased in WT GISTs . WT GISTs , particularly those in younger patients , have defects in SDH mitochondrial complex II , and in a subset of these patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> GIST <END> seems to arise from germline-inactivating SDH mutations .
Testing for germline mutations in SDH is recommended in patients with WT GIST. These findings highlight a potential central role of SDH dysregulation in WT <START:PHENOTYPE> GIST <END> oncogenesis .
Ashkenazi Jewish population frequencies for common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 .
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two major identified causes of inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , with mutations in either gene conferring up to 80-90 % lifetime risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in carrier females .
Mutations in BRCA1 account for approximately 45 % of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and 90 % of inherited breast/ovarian cancer , whereas mutations in BRCA2 account for a comparable percentage of inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> cases .
Over 85 distinct BRCA1 mutations and a growing list of BRCA2 mutations have been identified , with the majority resulting in protein truncation .
A specific BRCA1 mutation , 185delAG , has a reported increased carrier frequency of approximately 0.9% in the Ashkenazi Jewish population , but is also found in rare non-Jewish patients with a different haplotype .
The 6174delT mutation in BRCA2 was recently identified as a frequent mutation in 8 out of 107 Ashkenazi Jewish women diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> by age 50 ( ref . 8 ) , as well as in three Ashkenazi male <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> patients .
We have conducted a large-scale population study to investigate the prevalence of specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals who were unselected for <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
BRCA1 mutation screening on approximately 3,000 Ashkenazi Jewish samples determined a carrier frequency of 1. 09% for the 185delAG mutation and 0.13% for the 5382insC mutation .
BRCA2 analysis on 3,085 individuals from the same population showed a carrier frequency of 1.52 % for the 6174delT mutation .
This expanded population-based study confirms that the BRCA1 185delAG mutation and the BRCA2 6174delT mutation constitute the two most frequent mutation alleles predisposing to hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> among the Ashkenazim , and suggests a relatively lower penetrance for the 6174delT mutation in BRCA2 .
The secretion of fluid by renal cysts from patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
The mechanism by which fluid accumulates in renal cysts of adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> is not known .
This study was designed to determine whether transepithelial secretion of fluid may account for this accumulation .
We studied in vitro intact cysts that were excised from kidneys removed from three patients with end-stage <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
The cysts were loaded with natural cyst fluid or with a combination of Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium and Ham 's F12 medium ( DME-F12 ) and incubated in DME-F12 for 24 hours .
Fluid secretion , determined by the change in the weight of the cysts , was expressed as the rate of fluid secretion per square centimeter of surface area per 24 hours , to correct for the wide variation in the sizes of the cysts .
To test for endogenous secretagogues , cyst fluid was added to confluent monolayer cultures of canine- and human-kidney cells .
During the first 24 hours of incubation , the mean ( + /- SE ) rate of fluid secretion in nine cysts containing natural cyst fluid was 20.8 +/- 5.6 microliters per square centimeter of surface area per 24 hours , as compared with 2.3 +/- 3.6 microliters per square centimeter per 24 hours in nine cysts containing incubation medium .
Each group of cysts was then incubated with forskolin , a nonspecific stimulator of adenylate cyclase activity , for an additional 24 hours .
During this period the fluid-secretion rate of cysts containing natural cyst fluid did not change ; however , the secretion rate of those containing incubation medium increased to 9.1 +/- 4.4 microliters per square centimeter per 24 hours ( mean change , 6.8 +/- 1 .1 ; P < 0.001 ) .
Cyst fluid stimulated fluid secretion by polarized monolayers of canine- and human-kidney cells .
Renal cysts from patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> can secrete fluid , and net fluid secretion can be increased by unidentified secretagogues in the cyst fluid .
These results suggest that the process of cyst enlargement may be susceptible to pharmacologic intervention .
Definition of the <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> syndrome critical region at chromosome 3q23 based on the analysis of chromosomal anomalies .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Blepharophimosis <END> syndrome ( BPES ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder of craniofacial development , the features of which are small palpebral fissures ( <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> ) , drooping eyelids ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> ) and a skin fold arising from the lower eyelid ( <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> ) .
The chromosomal localization and identity of the BPES locus is not known with certainty .
In the current paper , DNA samples from three individuals with a clinical history of BPES , two with interstitial deletions ( cases 1 and 2 ) and one with a balanced translocation ( case 3 ) all involving chromosome 3q23 , were analyzed .
Allele loss studies using short tandem repeat markers in cases 1 and 2 suggested that the region between the markers D3S1292 and D3S1306 was deleted in both cases .
Subsequently , the derived chromosomes resulting from the translocation in case 3 were segregated in interspecific somatic cell hybrids .
Analysis of the resultant hybrids showed that D3S1615 was retained in the derived chromosome 3 , whereas D3S1316 was retained in the derived chromosome 4 . In neither case was the marker present in the reciprocal hybrid .
These results indicate that the BPES critical region lies in the D3S1615 -D3S1316 interval .
Mulibrey nanism : clinical features and diagnostic criteria .
Mulibrey nanism ( MUL ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disease caused by mutations in the TRIM37 gene encoding the peroxisomal TRIM37 protein of unknown function .
In this work , we analysed the clinical characteristics of 85 Finnish patients with MUL , most of whom were homozygous for the Finn major mutation of TR IM37 .
The patients ' hospital records from birth to the time of the diagnosis at age 0.02-52 years ( median 2.1 years ) were retrospectively analysed .
All except four of the patients ( 95% ) had a prenatal onset growth failure without postnatal catch up growth .
The mean length standard deviation score ( SDS ) was -3.1 and -4. 0 at birth and at diagnosis , respectively .
In infancy , feeding difficulties , and respiratory tract infections were the most common problems .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congestive heart failure <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pericardial constriction <END> were diagnosed during infancy in 12 % and 6% of the patients , respectively .
At the time of the diagnosis , characteristic craniofacial features of <START:PHENOTYPE> scaphocephaly <END> , facial triangularity , high and broad forehead , and <START:PHENOTYPE> low nasal bridge <END> were evident in over 90 % of the patients .
In addition , practically all patients were gracile and had thin extremities .
Other findings included a peculiar <START:PHENOTYPE> high-pitched voice <END> ( 96% ) , yellowish dots in ocular fundi ( 79% ) , cutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> naevi <END> flammei ( 65% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> ( 45% ) , and fibrous dysplasia of long bones ( 25% ) .
Mild muscular hypotonicity ( 68% ) was the only neurological abnormality .
The clinical features of the Finnish patients with MUL formed a distinct entity .
The most consistent findings were growth failure and characteristic craniofacial features .
However , organ manifestations varied considerably in early childhood .
Based on these findings , we propose new diagnostic criteria for MUL .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Achalasia <END> in siblings .
Clinical and genetic aspects .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Achalasia <END> is rare in children ; less than 2% of all patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> are less than 6 years old . Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> is extraordinarily rare , for an exhaustive search of the world literature yielded only 31 cases .
Two additional cases are reported here .
Based on an analysis of the reported cases in the literature coupled with our two cases , we have observed that familial <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> is likely transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
We recommend that all siblings of children with confirmed <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> should either be studied by contrast roentgenography or be monitored closely for clinical signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> , especially if they are products of consanguineous parents .
Spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> 3 and Machado-Joseph disease : clinical , molecular , and neuropathological features .
Patients with spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> 3 ( SCA3 ) and Machado-Joseph disease ( MJD ) carry an expanded CAG repeat in the MJD1 gene .
One hundred twenty families of different geographic origin with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> ( ADCA ) type I were tested .
Thirty-four families ( 126 patients ) carried an expanded CAG repeat .
The expanded and the normal allele did not overlap and the repeat was unstable during transmission , with variation in the size of the CAG length ranging from -8 to +5 and a mean expansion of 0.86 repeats without differences according to the parental sex .
There was a combined effect of the number of CAG repeats of the expanded and normal allele on the age at onset , which accounted for 70 % of its variability .
The length of the CAG repeat influenced the frequency of clinical signs associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , such as abnormal tendon reflexes or <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased vibration sense <END> , whereas the interindividual variation of <START:PHENOTYPE> supranuclear ophthalmoplegia <END> , sphincter and <START:PHENOTYPE> swallowing difficulties <END> , and amyotrophy was mostly determined by different disease durations .
We compared the clinical profile of 91 SCA3/MJD patients with 51 SCA1 and 32 SCA2 patients .
There were striking differences between the SCA3/MJD and SCA2 but not with SCA1 groups of patients .
Despite their clinical similarities , distinct neuropathological features were observed in 2 SCA3/MJD and 2 SCA1 patients .
Spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> and severe , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> .
1 . Spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia with progressive , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> and gross <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> is a distinctive entity .
The clinical and radiographic manifestations of seven affected children are presented and it is concluded that this disorder is probably more common than previously suspected .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> transmission is likely . 2 . Skeletal survey is indicated in all patients with infantile idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphosis <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> .
In this context , radiographic studies of the pelvis may be of great diagnostic value .
3 . Referal for expert orthopaedic management is essential for all patients with this disorder , as profound disability with pulmonary and spinal complications may be expected .
Two siblings with early onset fetal akinesia deformation sequence and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydranencephaly <END> : further evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> hydranencephaly <END> , fowler type .
We report a 13-week-old female fetus with early onset fetal akinesia deformation sequence ( FADS ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydranencephaly <END> .
In a previous pregnancy , the same ultrasonographic findings were noted at 13 weeks .
Fetopathological examination of both female fetuses confirmed FADS with severe arthogryposis , multiple pterygia , and muscular hypoplasia .
Neuropathological examination showed massive cystic dilatation of the cerebral ventricles ( <START:PHENOTYPE> hydranencephaly <END> ) with calcification of the basal ganglion and brain stem and a proliferative vasculopathy throughout the central nervous system .
The findings in the two female siblings document the earliest echographic diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> hydranencephaly <END> , Fowler type , and this observation further supports <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> of this distinct type of <START:PHENOTYPE> hydranencephaly <END> .

CASK aberrations in male patients with Ohtahara syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
Ohtahara syndrome ( OS ) is one of the most severe and earliest forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
STXBP1 and ARX mutations have been reported in patients with OS .
In this study , we aimed to identify new genes involved in OS by copy number analysis and whole exome sequencing .
Copy number analysis and whole exome sequencing were performed in 34 and 12 patients with OS , respectively .
Fluorescence in situ hybridization , quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) , and breakpoint-specific and reverse-transcriptase PCR analyses were performed to characterize a deletion .
Immunoblotting using lymphoblastoid cells was done to examine expression of CASK protein .
Genomic microarray analysis revealed a 111-kb deletion involving exon 2 of CASK at Xp11 .4 in a male patient .
The deletion was inherited from his mother , who was somatic mosaic for the deletion .
Sequencing of the mutant transcript expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the patient confirmed the deletion of exon 2 in the mutant transcript with a premature stop codon .
Whole exome sequencing identified another male patient who was harboring a c.1A> G mutation in CASK , which occurred de novo .
Both patients showed severe <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> along with other congenital anomalies such as <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , a high arched palate , and finger anomalies .
No CASK protein was detected by immunoblotting in lymphoblastoid cells derived from two patients .
The detected mutations are highly likely to cause the loss of function of the CASK protein in male individuals .
CASK mutations have been reported in patients with intellectual disability with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and pontocerebellar hypoplasia or congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , and those with FG syndrome .
Our data expand the clinical spectrum of CASK mutations to include OS with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> and congenital anomalies at the most severe end .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypopigmentation <END> in the Prader-Willi syndrome .
Cutaneous and ocular pigmentation were evaluated in 29 individuals with the Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) .
Criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> included the presence of type I or II skin , the lightest skin type in the family by history , and iris translucency on globe transillumination .
On the basis of these criteria , 48 % of the PWS individuals were hypopigmented .
The presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> correlated with a small interstitial deletion on the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 ; however , this deletion was also found in individuals who did not meet the full criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> .
Hairbulb tyrosinase activity and glutathione content , as well as urine cysteinyldopa excretion , were low in PWS individuals with and without <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> and did not separate these two groups .
We conclude that <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> is found in a significant proportion of individuals with PWS and that the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> may be associated with a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15 .
The mechanism for the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> is unknown .
Del(14 ) (q22.1q23.2 ) in a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> and pituitary hypoplasia .
Only few cases with an interstitial deletion of chromosome 14 have been described so far .
We report on a 21-month-old girl with an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 14 , del(14 ) (q22.1q23.2 ) .
She presented with bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> , absent left external auditory canal , <START:PHENOTYPE> facial asymmetry <END> , microretrognathia , hypotonia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> .
Skeletal X-rays showed <START:PHENOTYPE> lambdoid craniosynostosis <END> , a very <START:PHENOTYPE> small sella turcica <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical vertebral anomalies <END> .
Brain MRI showed the absence of the optic chiasm , an hypoplastic pituitary gland , and cortical atrophy.
No cardiac or abdominal malformations were found .
Two other patients with a similar deletion , (del(14 ) (q22.1q23) and del(14 ) (q22.1q22.3) ) , are described .
Both presented with bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> and absent pituitary or hypogonadism .
These three cases suggest that the region 14q22 is important for eye and pituitary development .
Interestingly , the human BMP-4 gene , a member of the TG F-beta superfamily , maps to 14q22-q23 and may play a role in pituitary and eye development .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> linked to the chromosome 11p13 markers catalase and D11S151 in a large Dutch family .
In a large pedigree with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , we found close linkage between the <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> locus AN2 and the markers catalase ( CAT ) ( zeta = 7.27 at theta = 0.00 ) and D11S151 ( zeta = 3.86 at theta = 0.10 ) flanking the AN2 locus on 11p13 .
Positive lod scores were also obtained for the 11p13----11p14 markers D11S16 and FSHB with the linkage group CAT/ AN2/D11 S151 .
We conclude that the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> in this family is due to a mutation at the AN2 locus on 11p13 .
We have excluded linkage ( zeta less than -2 at theta less than 0.18 ) between the <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> and the chromosome 2p25 marker D2S1 ( linked to ACP1 ) .
[ Centronuclear myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> inheritance( author 's transl) ] .
For the first time in Germany cases of a " centronuclear myopathy " are described in a 14-year-old boy and his 18-year-old sister .
First symptoms in both patients appeared at 4 to 5 years of age with a "sleepy facial expression " , clumsy gait and rapid fatigue .
Within few years the disease progressed to generalized muscle weakness and atrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia externa <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> .
Weakness and atrophy were most pronounced in the distal muscles of the lower extremities .
Both patients were free of epilepsy and the EEG recordings were normal .
Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities were normal .
Repetitive stimulation of nerves revealed a normal transmission from nerve to muscle .
Muscle biopsy showed a type I muscle fiber hypotrophy and a type II muscle fibre hypertrophy in addition to a predominance of type I fibres .
Both fibre types showed <START:PHENOTYPE> central nuclei <END> , sometimes appearing as chains in longitudinal sections .
In most cells with <START:PHENOTYPE> central nuclei <END> there persists a very small pericentral zone free of myofibrils but with increased activity of oxidative enzymes and phosphorylase .
2--3% of muscle fibres in cross sections showed a decreased of absent enzyme activity in the most peripheral fibre zone .
Electron microscopy showed evidence of a centrally distinct myofibrillar disintegration .
The father of both children had a <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> at least from the 20th year of age . 5 years later generalized progressive muscle atrophy was recorded .
Aged 51 years he died of pneumonia .
Though not proved most probably the father suffered from the same disease as the children , pointing to an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> in this family .
The disease , according to the literature , seems to be genetically heterogeneous .
The clinical picture seems to be independent of the mode of inheritance .
Our patients showed a relatively rapid progression of symptoms .
Pathogenetically the " centronuclear myopathy " may result from a disturbance of correlated nerve-muscle structures starting during early fetal life .
Snyder-Robinson syndrome : a novel nonsense mutation in spermine synthase and expansion of the phenotype .
Snyder-Robinson syndrome is a rare form of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> caused by mutations in the spermine synthase ( SMS ) gene , and characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , thin habitus with diminished muscle mass , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , facial dysmorphism ( asymmetry , full lower lip) , long great toes , and nasal or <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthric speech <END> .
Physical signs seem to evolve from childhood to adulthood .
We describe the first Italian patient with Snyder-Robinson syndrome and a novel nonsense mutation in SMS ( c.200G>A ; p.G67X ) .
Apart from the typical features of the syndrome , the index patient presented with an ectopic right kidney and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> from the first year of age that was characterized by focal motor <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and negative myoclonus .
The clinical and molecular evaluation of this family and the review of the literature expand the phenotype of Snyder-Robinson syndrome to include myoclonic or myoclonic-like <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( starting even in the first years of life ) and renal abnormalities in affected males .

Genetic analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in the cancer and steroid hormone study .
The familial risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> is investigated in a large population-based , case-control study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control .
The data set is based on 4,73 0 histologically confirmed <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> cases aged 20 to 54 years and on 4,688 controls who were frequency matched to cases on the basis of both geographic region and 5-year categories of age , and it includes family histories , obtained through interviews of cases and controls , of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in mothers and sisters .
Segregation analysis and goodness-of-fit tests of genetic models provide evidence for the existence of a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> allele ( q = .0033 ) leading to increased susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
The effect of genotype on the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> is shown to be a function of a woman 's age .
Although , compared with noncarriers , carriers of the allele appear to be at greater risk at all ages , the ratio of age-specific risks is greatest at young ages and declines steadily thereafter .
The proportion of cases predicted to carry the allele is highest ( 36% ) among cases aged 20-29 years .
This proportion gradually decreases to 1 % among cases aged 80 years or older .
The cumulative lifetime risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> for women who carry the susceptibility allele is predicted to be high , approximately 92% , while the cumulative lifetime risk for noncarriers is estimated to be approximately 10% .
Targeted inactivation of Npt2 in mice leads to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> , and skeletal abnormalities .
Npt2 encodes a renal-specific , brush-border membrane Na+-phosphate ( Pi ) cotransporter that is expressed in the proximal tubule where the bulk of filtered Pi is reabsorbed .
Mice deficient in the Npt2 gene were generated by targeted mutagenesis to define the role of Npt2 in the overall maintenance of Pi homeostasis , determine its impact on skeletal development , and clarify its relationship to autosomal disorders of renal Pi reabsorption in humans .
Homozygous mutants ( Npt2(-/-) ) exhibit increased urinary Pi excretion , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , an appropriate elevation in the serum concentration of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D with attendant hypercalcemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and decreased serum parathyroid hormone levels , and <START:PHENOTYPE> increased serum alkaline phosphatase <END> activity .
These biochemical features are typical of patients with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> ( HHRH) , a Mendelian disorder of renal Pi reabsorption . However , unlike HHRH patients , Npt2(-/- ) mice do not have <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> or osteomalacia .
At weaning , Npt2(-/- ) mice have poorly developed trabecular bone and retarded secondary ossification , but , with increasing age , there is a dramatic reversal and eventual overcompensation of the skeletal phenotype .
Our findings demonstrate that Npt2 is a major regulator of Pi homeostasis and necessary for normal skeletal development .
Mandibuloacral dysplasia is caused by a mutation in LMNA-encoding lamin A/ C . Mandibuloacral dysplasia ( MAD ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder , characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> , craniofacial anomalies , skeletal malformations , and mottled cutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> .
The LMNA gene encoding two nuclear envelope proteins ( lamins A and C [lamin A/C] ) maps to chromosome 1q21 and has been associated with five distinct pathologies , including Dunnigan-type familial partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> , a condition that is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> subcutaneous fat loss <END> and is invariably associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and diabetes .
Since patients with MAD frequently have partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , we hypothesized that the disease may be caused by mutations in the LMNA gene .
We analyzed five consanguineous Italian families and demonstrated linkage of MAD to chromosome 1q21 , by use of homozygosity mapping .
We then sequenced the LMNA gene and identified a homozygous missense mutation ( R527H ) that was shared by all affected patients .
Patient skin fibroblasts showed nuclei that presented abnormal lamin A/ C distribution and a dysmorphic envelope , thus demonstrating the pathogenic effect of the R527H LMNA mutation .
CRASH syndrome : clinical spectrum of corpus callosum hypoplasia , retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> , spastic paraparesis and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> due to mutations in one single gene , L1 . L1 is a neuronal cell adhesion molecule with important functions in the development of the nervous system .
The gene encoding L1 is located near the telomere of the long arm of the X chromosome in Xq28 .
We review here the evidence that several X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndromes including X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( HSAS ) , MASA syndrome , X-linked complicated spastic paraparesis ( SP1 ) and X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> corpus callosum agenesis <END> ( ACC ) are all due to mutations in the L1 gene .
The inter- and intrafamilial variability in families with an L1 mutation is very wide , and patients with HSAS , MASA , SP1 and ACC can be present within the same family .
Therefore , we propose here to refer to this clinical syndrome with the acronym CRASH , for Corpus callosum hypoplasia , Retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> Adducted thumbs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Spastic paraplegia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Hydrocephalus <END> .
Clinical , genetic , and expression studies of mutations in the potassium channel gene KCNA1 reveal new phenotypic variability .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Episodic ataxia <END> type 1 ( EA1 ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> central nervous system potassium channelopathy characterized by brief attacks of cerebellar ataxia and continuous interictal <START:PHENOTYPE> myokymia <END> .
Point mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel gene KCNA1 on chromosome 12p associate with EA1 .
We have studied 4 families and identified three new and one previously reported heterozygous point mutations in this gene .
Affected members in Family A ( KCNA1 G724C ) exhibit partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> myokymia <END> but no ataxic episodes , supporting the suggestion that there is an association between mutations of KCNA1 and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Affected members in Family B ( KCNA1 C731A ) exhibit <START:PHENOTYPE> myokymia <END> alone , suggesting a new phenotype of isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> myokymia <END> .
Family C harbors the first truncation to be reported in KCNA1 ( C1249T ) and exhibits remarkably drug-resistant EA1 . Affected members in Family D ( KCNA1 G1210A ) exhibit attacks typical of EA1 .
This mutation has recently been reported in an apparently unrelated family , although no functional studies were attempted .
Heterologous expression of the proteins encoded by the mutant KCNA1 genes suggest that the four point mutations impair delayed-rectifier type potassium currents by different mechanisms .
Increased neuronal excitability is likely to be the common pathophysiological basis for the disease in these families .
The degree and nature of the potassium channel dysfunction may be relevant to the new phenotypic observations reported in this study .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlysinemia <END> : enzyme studies , diagnostic methods , comments on terminology .
Enzyme assays of skin fibroblasts from five children with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlysinemia <END> from unrelated families are added to the previous report of three children from two unrelated families .
In all instances there was a deficiency in lysine-ketoglutarate reductase , saccharopine dehydrogenase , and saccharopine oxidoreductase activities .
To complete the studies on the enzymes associated with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlysinemia <END> , saccharopine oxidoreductase was partially purified from human liver and characterized .
The activity did not separate from that of lysine-ketoglutarate reductase or saccharopine dehydrogenase .
A simple screening test for familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlysinemia <END> is described based on the evolution of 14CO2 from lysine-14 C by skin fibroblasts .
The test differentiated , without overlap , seven patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlysinemia <END> from control subjects .
The relation of the two genetic entities involving lysine degradation , familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlysinemia <END> and saccharopinuria , is discussed .
It is suggested that familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlysinemia <END> , type I , be applied to patients with major defects in lysine-ketoglutarate reductase and saccharopine dehydrogenase , and that familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlysinemia <END> , type II , to be used to designate patients in whom significant amounts of lysine-ketoglutarate reductase are retained .
The nomenclature would be consistent with that of an analogous disease , orotic aciduria .
Multiple coagulation defects and the Cohen syndrome .
A 13-year-old male presented with new onset <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , sagittal sinus thrombosis with cerebral hemorrhage , and extensive venous thrombosis of the lower limbs .
Laboratory investigation demonstrated combined deficiency of protein C , protein S , and antithrombin III.
He and his 17-year-old sister had a mental retardation-multiple anomaly syndrome associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , unusual facies , and lax connective tissue .
Their dysmorphology included elongated faces with narrow forehead , arched eyebrows , large mouth with down-turned corners , malformed teeth , and furrowed tongue .
Both had Marfanoid habitus with lax joints , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , kyphoscoliosis , and flat narrow feet .
The most likely diagnosis for these siblings is the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Cohen syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , congenital hypotonia with Marfanoid habitus , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , pleasant affect , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> open mouth <END> with prominent incisors .
The sagittal sinus thrombosis , left frontal intracranial hemorrhage , carotid aneurysm , tortuous descending aorta , and deep venous thrombosis suffered by the male sibling adds the Cohen syndrome to genetic vasculopathies that may be associated with stroke .
Thyroid iodine organification defects : a case with lack of thyroglobulin iodination and a case without any peroxidase activity .
Two patients ( G2 , G3 ) with iodine organification defect were studied .
The first patient ( G2) , a 25-year-old women with no clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> , had had her <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> for 10 years ; 62 % of the thyroidal iodine was released by perchlorate indicating iodine organification defect .
The thyroid tissue obtained at thyroidectomy contained a normal concentration of thyroid peroxidase ( I2 formation from I- ) when tested after solubilization of the enzyme by trypsin and digitonin treatment of the particulate material .
1 .
The enzymatic activity ( G2-TPO ) behaved on DEAE cellulose chromatography very differently from those of hog ( P-TPO ) or another human <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> peroxidase ( G1- TPO ) ( Pommier , et al. , J Clin Endocrinol Metab 39 : 69 , 1974 ) : the molarity of elution was 2M NaCl instead of 0.15 mM . 2 . Both P-TP O and G2-TP O catalyzed iodide peroxidation ( I- leads to I2 ) but the Km ( iodide ) value for G2-TP O was much lower ( 2.3 x 10( -2 ) M ) when compared with that of P-TP O ( 3.7 x 10( -3 ) M ) or G1- TP O ( 3.5 x 10( -3 ) M ) .
In addition , the optimum pH for this reaction differed markedly ( pH 6.1 instead of 7.9 ) . 3 . G2-TP O was poorly efficient in catalyzing the oxidation of gaiacol to tetragaiacol . 4 . G2-TP O was unable to perform the iodination of non-iodinated <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> thyroglobulin whatever the pH and the iodide concentration .
5 . Thyroglobulin from this <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> ( G2 ) was almost not iodinated ( 0.0014% ) , i.e. , 0.07 atoms iodine/mole thyroglobulin) , and its total content in the gland was very low ( 0.3-4 g/1000 g wet tissue instead of 25 g ) .
A clear discrepancy was thus shown between the euthyroid state of this patient and the total lack of iodinating activity of the isolated peroxidase .
The second patient ( G3) , a 17-year-old man with clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> , had had his <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> for 5 years .
100% of the thyroidal iodine was released by perchlorate indicating a complete iodine organification defect .
The thyroid tissue obtained at thyroidectomy contained no peroxidase activity when tested before and after treatment of the particulate material by trypsin and digitonin and even in the presence of hematin .
Thyroglobulin from this <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> , which was almost non-iodinated ( 0.0014% ) , was present in normal amounts in the gland ( congruent to 25 g/1000 g ) .
Mutations in LTBP4 cause a syndrome of impaired pulmonary , gastrointestinal , genitourinary , musculoskeletal , and dermal development .
We report recessive mutations in the gene for the latent transforming growth factor-beta binding protein 4 ( LTBP4 ) in four unrelated patients with a human syndrome disrupting pulmonary , gastrointestinal , urinary , musculoskeletal , craniofacial , and dermal development .
All patients had severe respiratory distress , with cystic and atelectatic changes in the lungs complicated by <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheomalacia <END> and diaphragmatic hernia .
Three of the four patients died of respiratory failure .
Cardiovascular lesions were mild , limited to <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary artery stenosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> .
Gastrointestinal malformations included diverticulosis , enlargement , tortuosity , and stenosis at various levels of the intestinal tract .
The urinary tract was affected by diverticulosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Joint laxity <END> and low muscle tone contributed to musculoskeletal problems compounded by postnatal growth delay .
Craniofacial features included microretrognathia , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat midface <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> receding forehead <END> , and wide fontanelles .
All patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> .
Four of the five identified LTBP4 mutations led to premature termination of translation and destabilization of the LTBP4 mRNA .
Impaired synthesis and lack of deposition of LTBP4 into the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) caused increased transforming growth factor-beta ( TG F-beta ) activity in cultured fibroblasts and defective elastic fiber assembly in all tissues affected by the disease .
These molecular defects were associated with blocked alveolarization and airway collapse in the lung .
Our results show that coupling of TG F-beta signaling and ECM assembly is essential for proper development and is achieved in multiple human organ systems by multifunctional proteins such as LTBP4 .
Chromosomal assignment of the second locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> ( SCA2 ) to chromosome 12q23-24.1 .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxias ( ADCA ) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by onset with gait <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysmetria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysdiadochokinesia <END> .
We have demonstrated previously genetic heterogeneity within these disorders by excluding the disease locus from the documented spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> locus ( SCA1 ) on chromosome 6p in a large Cuban founder population .
We now report the assignment of a second locus for ADCA ( SCA2 ) to chromosome 12q23-24.1 following linkage analyses carried out for the Cuban pedigrees , with probable flanking markers D12S58 and phospholipase A2 . Investigation of linkage to the interval containing SCA2 for seven French ADCA families , previously excluded from linkage to SCA1 , provides preliminary data suggesting the existence of a third ADCA locus ( SCA3 ) .
Mutation analysis of SLC7A9 in <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> patients in Sweden .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cystinuria <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by increased urinary excretion of cystine and dibasic amino acids , which cause recurrent stone formation in affected individuals .
Three subtypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> have been described ( type I , II , and III) : type I is caused by mutations in the SLC3A1 gene , whereas nontype I ( II and III) has been associated with SLC7A9 mutations .
Of the 53 patients reported in our previous work , patients that showed SLC7A9 mutations in single-strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) screening and/or either lacked or showed heterozygosity for SLC3A1 mutations were included in the present study .
The entire coding region and the exon/intron boundaries of the SLC7A9 gene were analyzed by means of both SSCP and DNA sequencing in 16 patients , all but one of which were clinically diagnosed as homozygous cystinurics .
Three novel SLC7A9 mutations were identified in the patient group : two missense mutations ( P261 L and V330M) , and one single base-pair deletion (1009 delA ) .
We also detected the previously reported A182T and nine novel polymorphisms in the patients .
Mutations V330M and 1009delA occurred on different alleles in one individual , and we suggest that these mutations cause <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> in this patient .
One patient that was homozygously mutated in the SLC3A1 gene carried the third novel mutation ( P261L ) .
We conclude that SLC3A1 is still the major disease gene among Swedish <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> patients , with only a minor contribution of SLC7A9 mutations as the genetic basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> .
The absence of SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 mutations in a substantial proportion of the patients implies that mutations in parts of the genes that were not analyzed may be present , as well as large deletions that escape detection by the methods used .
However , our results raise the question of whether other , as yet unknown genes , may also be involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> .
Floating-Harbor syndrome : description of a further patient , review of the literature , and suggestion of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
The Floating-Harbor syndrome is a growth retardation syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> , speech development , and typical facial features .
The face is triangular with <START:PHENOTYPE> deep-set eyes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long eyelashes <END> , bulbous nose , wide columella , <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> thin lips <END> .
We present an additional patient and review 16 cases from the literature .
The possible phenotype in the patient 's mother suggests a dominant mode of inheritance for the syndrome .
The Floating Harbor syndrome is a growth deficiency syndrome characterized by proportionate <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , characteristic face and delayed speech development .
Inheritance is possibly <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> .
Familial idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
Three cases from two families with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> are described .
Cases 1 and 2 were siblings .
Case 3 was one of four siblings from another family .
All of them had both idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> and progressive sensorineural hearing loss .
There was no evidence to suggest involvement of autoimmune mechanism in these cases except for the associated Graves ' hyperthyroidism in case 3 . Human leukocyte antigen A9 and A11 were positive in both families .
The sensorineural hearing loss was progressive even after the treatment for <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> .
As the familial idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoparathyroidism <END> is a very rare entity , it is unlikely that this disease is associated with familial progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> by chance .
The combination of these two diseases may compose a new syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> caused by a mutation in TI NF2 .
The syndrome of ataxia-pancytopenia is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , peripheral neuropathies , <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> and a predilection to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia .
The genetic basis of this condition is unknown .
We describe a child who presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> and was found to have a heterozygous mutation , c.845 G >A ( Arg282His ) in TI NF2 , a gene recently reported to be mutated in a subset of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> dyskeratosis congenita .
We propose that some cases of ataxia-pancytopenia may be affected by DC .
Psoriasis-like skin disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> caused by inducible epidermal deletion of Jun proteins .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Psoriasis <END> is a frequent , inflammatory disease of skin and joints with considerable morbidity .
Here we report that in psoriatic lesions , epidermal keratinocytes have decreased expression of JunB , a gene localized in the <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> susceptibility region PSORS6 .
Likewise , inducible epidermal deletion of JunB and its functional companion c-Jun in adult mice leads ( within two weeks ) to a phenotype resembling the histological and molecular hallmarks of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> , including arthritic lesions .
In contrast to the skin phenotype , the development of arthritic lesions requires T and B cells and signalling through tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 ( TN FR1 ) .
Prior to the disease onset , two chemotactic proteins ( S100A8 and S100A9 ) previously mapped to the <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> susceptibility region PSORS4 , are strongly induced in mutant keratinocytes in vivo and in vitro .
We propose that the abrogation of JunB/activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) in keratinocytes triggers chemokine/cytokine expression , which recruits neutrophils and macrophages to the epidermis thereby contributing to the phenotypic changes observed in <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
Thus , these data support the hypothesis that epidermal alterations are sufficient to initiate both skin lesions and <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
Mutations and allelic loss of the NF2 gene in neurofibromatosis 2-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> skin tumors <END> .
Schwannomas in the skin are frequently observed in neurofibromatosis 2 patients .
In about one-quarter of the cases , <START:PHENOTYPE> skin tumors <END> are the first clinical symptoms of this disease . Recognizing neurofibromatosis-2-related <START:PHENOTYPE> skin tumors <END> is therefore important for early diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 2 , especially in pediatric patients .
In this study , we examined 40 <START:PHENOTYPE> skin tumors <END> ( 36 schwannomas and four neurofibromas ) from 20 neurofibromatosis 2 patients for NF2 mutations and allelic loss .
NF2 mutations have been identified in blood from 15 ( 75% ) of the 20 patients .
We found NF2 mutations in five ( 13% ) and NF2 allelic loss in 18 ( 45% ) of the 40 analyzed tumors .
Genetic alterations ( allelic loss or mutation ) were thus found in 50 ( 63% ) out of the total of 80 examined alleles .
In 17 ( 43% ) tumors , alterations were found on both NF2 alleles .
These results suggest that , as in the case of vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas , loss of functional NF2 gene product is also the critical event in the development of skin schwannomas .
Identification of genetic alterations of the NF2 gene in <START:PHENOTYPE> skin tumors <END> may help to identify neurofibromatosis-2-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> skin tumors <END> , thus assisting in the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 2 in ambiguous cases , and excluding neurofibromatosis 1 in unclear cases .
We also report that the detection rate of constitutional mutations was higher in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> skin tumors <END> ( 65% ) than in patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> skin tumors <END> (40% ) .
Clinical features in 27 patients with Angelman syndrome resulting from DNA deletion .
We report the clinical features in 27 Australasian patients with Angelman syndrome ( AS ) , all with a DNA deletion involving chromosome 15 ( q11 -13) , spanning markers from D15S9 to D15 S12 , about 3 center dot 5 Mb of DNA .
There were nine males and 18 females .
All cases were <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> .
The mean age at last review (end of 1994 ) was 11 center dot 2 years ( range 3 to 34 years ) .
All patients were ataxic , severely retarded , and lacking recognisable speech .
In all patients , head circumference ( HC ) at birth was normal but skewed in distribution , with 62 center dot 5 % at the 10th centile .
At last review HC was around the 50th centile in three patients ( 12 center dot 5% ) while 15 had poor postnatal head growth .
Short stature was not invariable , 5/26 ( 19% ) were on or above the 50th centile .
Hypotonia at birth was recorded in 15 /24 ( 63% ) and neonatal feeding difficulties were recorded in 20/26 ( 77% ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> was present in 26/27 ( 96% ) with onset by the third year of life in 20 patients ( 83% ) .
Improvement in <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> was reported in 11 /16 patients ( 69% ) with age .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal EEG <END> was reported in 25/25 patients .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypopigmentation <END> was present in 19/26 ( 73% ) .
One patient had oculocutaneous albinism .
Five patients could not walk independently .
Of the remaining 22 who could walk , age of onset of walking ranged from 2 to 8 years .
Disrupted sleep patterns were present in 18/21 patients ( 86% ) , with improvement in 9/12 patients ( 75% ) over 10 years of age .
The clinical features in this group of deletional AS patients were similar to previous reports , but these have not separated patients into subgroups based on DNA studies .
In our group of deletional cases , 100% showed <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , ataxic movements , absent language , <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal EEG <END> , happy disposition ( noted in infancy in 95% ) , normal birth weight and head circumference at birth , and a large , <START:PHENOTYPE> wide mouth <END> .
These features occurred with a higher frequency than in AS patients as a whole .
Our study also provided information on the evolution of the phenotype .
The data can act as a benchmark for comparisons of AS resulting from other genetic mechanisms .
Mineralocorticoid-resistant renal <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> without salt wasting ( type II <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> ) : role of increased renal chloride reabsorption .
A rare syndrome has been described in which mineralocorticoid-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> of renal origin occurs in the absence of glomerular insufficiency and renal sodium wasting and in which <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperchloremic acidosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , and hyporeninemia coexist .
The primary abnormality has been postulated to be a defect of the potassium secretory mechanism of the distal nephron .
The present studies were carried out to investigate the mechanism of impaired renal potassium secretion in a patient with this syndrome .
When dietary intake of sodium chloride was normal , renal clearance of potassium was subnormal ( CK/GFR = 3.6 +/- 0.2% ; normal subjects , 9. 0 +/- 0.9% , N = 4 ) despite high normal or supernormal levels of plasma and urinary aldosterone .
The fractional clearance of potassium remained subnormal ( CK/GFR = 5 .1 +/- 0.2% ) during superimposed chronic administration of superphysiologic doses of mineralocorticoid hormone .
Little increase in renal potassium clearance occurred when the delivery of sodium to distal nephron segments was increased further by the i.v . infusion of sodium chloride , despite experimentally sustained hypermineralocorticoidism .
But potassium clearance increased greatly when delivery of sodium to the distal nephron was increased by infusion of nonchloride anions : sulfate ( sodium sulfate infusion , low sodium chloride diet ; CK/GFR = 63 .7 +/- 0.4% ) or bicarbonate ( sodium bicarbonate plus acetazolamide infusion ; CK/GFR = 81.7 +/- 1.7% ) . These findings indicate that mineralocorticoid-resistant renal <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> in this patient cannot be attributed to the absence of a renal potassium secretory capability or to diminished delivery of sodium to distal nephron segments ; instead it may be dependent on chloride delivery to the distal nephron .
We suggest that the primary abnormality in this syndrome increases the reabsorptive avidity of the distal nephron for chloride , which (1 ) limits the sodium and mineralocorticoid-dependent voltage driving force for potassium and hydrogen ion secretion , resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> and acidosis and (2 ) augments distal sodium chloride reabsorption resulting in hyperchloremia , volume expansion , hyporeninemia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
Scope and heterogeneous nature of <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> .
This review summarizes aspects of the phenotypic expression , natural history , recognition , pathogenesis , and heterogeneous nature of <START:PHENOTYPE> maturity-onset diabetes of the young <END> ( MODY) , which is inherited in an autosomal-dominant pattern .
There are differences in metabolic , hormonal , and vascular abnormalities in different ethnic groups and even among White pedigrees .
In <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> patients with low insulin responses , there are delayed and decreased insulin and C-peptide secretory responses to glucose from childhood or adolescence even before glucose intolerance appears , which may represent the basic genetic defect .
When followed for decades , nondiabetic siblings have normal insulin responses .
The fasting hyperglycemia of some <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> patients has been treated successfully with sulfonylureas for up to 30 yr .
In a few patients , after years or decades of diabetes , the insulin and C-peptide responses to glucose are so low that they resemble those of early insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus .
The progression of the insulin secretory defect over time distinguishes between these two types of diabetes .
In contrast are patients from families who have very high insulin responses to glucose , despite glucose intolerance and fasting hyperglycemia similar to that seen in patients with low insulin responses .
In many of these patients , there is in vivo and in vitro evidence of insulin resistance .
Whatever its mechanism , the compensatory insulin responses to nutrients must be insufficient to maintain normal carbohydrate tolerance .
This suggests that diabetes occurs only in those patients who have an additional islet cell defect , i.e. , insufficient beta-cell reserve and secretory capacity .
In a few <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> pedigrees with high insulin responses to glucose and lack of evidence of insulin resistance , a structurally abnormal mutant insulin molecule that is biologically ineffective is secreted .
No associations have been found between specific HLA antigens and <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> in White , Black , and Asian pedigrees .
Linkage studies of the insulin gene , insulin-receptor gene , erythrocyte/HepG2 glucose-transporter locus , and apolipoprotein B locus have shown no association with <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> .
Vascular disease may be as prevalent as in conventional non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus .
Because of autosomal-dominant transmission and penetrance at a young age , <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> is a good model for further investigations of etiologic and pathogenetic factors in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , including the use of genetic linkage strategies to identify diabetogenic genes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> associated with a familial t(2 ;16 ) translocation .
We describe a family in which <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> were segregating together with a reciprocal translocation t(2 ;16 ) ( p22.3;p13.3 ) through three generations .
This family included four individuals with balanced translocations , three with partial trisomy 2p derived from this translocation , and two with a normal karyotype .
All of the subjects with balanced and unbalanced translocations had congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , whereas the two individuals with normal karyotypes did not show any ocular anomalies .
These observations suggest that the altered function of a gene that lies on the 16p13.3 band and that has an important role in the development of the eye is responsible for this disorder .
Inherited metabolic disorders and stroke part 1 : Fabry disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> .
Inherited metabolic disorders are single-gene genetic diseases associated with multiorgan damage .
Some of these conditions increase the risk of stroke through a variety of mechanisms , and there is evidence that early recognition and initiation of appropriate treatment may improve prognosis .
In this 2-part review we provide an update of the genetics , stroke pathophysiology , clinical manifestations , diagnosis , and treatment of metabolic disorders associated with stroke .
In part 1 , we concentrate on Fabry disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> .
In part 2 we will review homocystinuria , organic acidurias , and urea cycle disorders .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Choanal atresia <END> and associated multiple anomalies .
Seventeen unrelated patients with multiple anomalies of unknown etiology were identified by the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> .
A regularly recurring pattern of associated features involving <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth deficiency <END> , hypogenitalism ( males) , <START:PHENOTYPE> small ears <END> , cardiac defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and ocular coloboma was identified .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Choanal atresia <END> when accompanied by multiple anomalies of unknown etiology has a serious prognosis with a predictable pattern of associated defects .
Genotype-phenotype correlations for EPM2A mutations in Lafora 's progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> epilepsy : exon 1 mutations associate with an early-onset cognitive deficit subphenotype .
Mutations in the EPM2A gene encoding a dual-specificity phosphatase ( laforin ) cause an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> fatal disorder called Lafora 's disease ( LD ) classically described as an adolescent-onset stimulus-sensitive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , epilepsy and <START:PHENOTYPE> neurologic deterioration <END> .
Here we related mutations in EPM2A with phenotypes of 22 patients ( 14 families ) and identified two subsyndromes : (i ) classical LD with adolescent-onset stimulus-sensitive grand mal , absence and <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonic seizures <END> followed by <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> neurologic deterioration <END> , and associated mainly with mutations in exon 4 ( P = 0.0007 ) ; ( ii ) atypical LD with childhood-onset dyslexia and learning disorder followed by epilepsy and <START:PHENOTYPE> neurologic deterioration <END> , and associated mainly with mutations in exon 1 ( P = 0.0015 ) .
To understand the two subsyndromes better , we investigated the effect of five missense mutations in the carbohydrate-binding domain ( CBD-4 ; coded by exon 1 ) and three missense mutations in the dual phosphatase domain ( DSPD ; coded by exons 3 and 4 ) on laforin 's intracellular localization in HeLa cells .
Expression of three mutant proteins ( T194I , G279S and Y294N ) in DSPD formed ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic aggregates , suggesting that they were folding mutants set for degradation .
In contrast , none of the three CBD-4 mutants showed cytoplasmic clumping .
However , CBD-4 mutants W32G and R108C targeted both cytoplasm and nucleus , suggesting that laforin had diminished its usual affinity for polysomes .
Our data , thus , represent the first report of a novel childhood syndrome for LD .
Our results also provide clues for distinct roles for the CBD-4 and DSP domains of laforin in the etiology of two subsyndromes of LD .
Chromosome 12q harbors multiple genetic loci related to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and asthma-related phenotypes .
Chromosome 12q13-24 is among the regions most frequently identified in genome-wide surveys for <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> susceptibility loci , with reports of two distinct clusters of positive linkage signals : one near the interferon gamma locus , the other near the nitric oxide synthase 1 locus .
These results suggest that 12q harbors several <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> susceptibility loci .
We evaluated this possibility in a subset of families ascertained through the Childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> Management Program ( CAMP ) Genetics Ancillary Study . Fifty-five nuclear families with at least two asthmatic siblings ( 212 individuals ) were genotyped using 32 microsatellite markers .
Non-parametric linkage analysis was performed for the <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> phenotype ( qualitative ) .
Multipoint variance component-based linkage analysis was performed for five quantitative asthma-related traits : (i ) percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV(1) ) ; ( ii ) dose of methacholine resulting in 20% fall in FEV(1 ) from baseline ( PC(20) ) ; ( iii ) post-bronchodilator percent change in FEV(1 ) ( BDPR) ; ( iv ) serum eosinophil levels ( EOS) ; and (v ) total serum IgE levels ( IgE ) .
Three separate and distinct loci demonstrated evidence suggestive of linkage : <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> at 68 cM ( exact P-value= 0.05 ) , airways responsiveness ( PC(20) ) at 147 cM ( P= 0.01 ) , and indices of pulmonary function ( FEV1 , BDPR ) at 134 cM ( P= 0.05 and P< 0.01 , respectively ) .
No linkage was observed for the atopy-related phenotypes .
We provide further evidence supporting the presence of an <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> susceptibility locus at the proximal end of chromosome 12q , as well as new evidence for additional loci more distally that account for unique features of the <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> phenotype .
Fine mapping efforts for these loci are warranted .
Phenotypic features and genetic findings in sacsin-related <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ataxia in Tunisia .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic ataxia <END> of Charlevoix-Saguenay ( ARSACS ) is a clinically homogenous disorder reported in Quebec caused by mutations in the SACS gene ( chromosome 13q12 ) .
Recently , we identified a Tunisian kindred demonstrating linkage to the ARSACS locus . To report clinical , neurophysiological , and nerve biopsy findings in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> cerebellar ataxia related to the SACS gene in Tunisia .
Genetic linkage analysis of patients with early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> cerebellar ataxia allowed the identification of 4 families from which 18 patients demonstrated linkage to the ARSACS locus .
The patients were evaluated according to the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale . Peripheral nerve conduction , sensory evoked potentials , and nerve biopsy were performed in most patients .
The mean age at onset was 4.5 years .
The clinical phenotype was stereotyped and associated with a progressive cerebellar syndrome , a pyramidal syndrome with brisk knee reflexes , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Babinski sign <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> absent ankle reflexes <END> .
The course of the disease varied among patients .
Sensory evoked potentials showed severe posterior column involvement .
Peripheral nerve investigations demonstrated axonal and demyelinating neuropathy.
Four mutations , 2 missense and 2 nonsense , were found .
In Tunisia , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> cerebellar ataxia related to the SACS gene demonstrated a homogenous phenotype and heterogeneous allelic mutations .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> : considerations in genetic counseling .
Nonsyndromal <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> is generally regarded as a sporadic malformation .
Recurrence risk is considered negligible .
We report on a patient in whom 5 consecutive pregnancies ( by 2 separate nonconsanguineous partners ) were complicated by <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> as an isolated defect .
Neither the patient nor her partners had history of relatives with <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , although the patient 's brother and his son had large umbilical hernias requiring repair in infancy .
Some familial cases of nonsyndromal <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> have been previously reported ; most such pedigrees suggest vertical transmission , although there are a few cases with only a single generation involved .
In our case , the multigenerational finding of ventral wall hernias makes an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mechanism with variable expressivity a tenable explanation .
The collected instances of familial nonsyndromal <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> emphasize <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> heterogeneity and caution in counseling recurrence risks .
Possible relationship between ulnar-mammary syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> split hand <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> aplasia of the ulna <END> syndrome .
We describe a 3-generation family in which mother , maternal grandfather , and 2 ( male and female ) children have variably manifestations of the ulnar-mammary syndrome , including ulnar ray defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , hypogenitalism , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed puberty <END> , hypoplasia of nipples and apocrine glands , and a previously undescribed ectopia of upper canines .
The index patient also had <START:PHENOTYPE> split-hand <END> appearance on the right due to complete absence of the 4th ray . To our knowledge this is the first documented example of <START:PHENOTYPE> split hand <END> in the ulnar-mammary syndrome .
The hand anomaly raises the question of a possible causal relationship between ulnar-mammary syndrome and the <START:PHENOTYPE> split hand <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> aplasia of the ulna <END> syndrome , as already hypothesized by Lenz [ 1980] .
Single central maxillary incisor and <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> .
A holoprosencephalic child was born to a mother with a single central maxillary incisor .
The infant had a median <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> , a flat nose with a single nostril , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> , and normal chromosomes .
The head was brachycephalic and small , and computed tomography ( CT) of the brain showed semilobar <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> .
The mother had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> but no <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> , and her brain CT was normal .
She was of normal intelligence and stature . Other relatives did not have single central maxillary incisors , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> , or oral clefts .
Whether the mother 's anomaly was a new mutation or had been inherited is unknown .
We show the significance of a single central maxillary incisor as an indicator or potential <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> in the next generation , even if other relatives are apparently normal .
Androgen-dependent hereditary mouse <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> : linkage to an MHC region .
To better understand the pathogenesis of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> , an inbred line of spontaneous mutant mice with keratoconus-affected corneas ( SKC mice ) was established and studied with a multidisciplinary approach .
Using a mutant mouse with corneas having a keratoconical appearance as the progenitor , an inbred line of SKC mouse was established by repeated sibling mating .
Morphology , cell growth , apoptosis and protein expression of SKC mouse corneas were examined .
Castration of males and androgen treatment for females were conducted to determine any androgen dependency of the phenotype .
Linkage analysis was conducted to reveal the responsible or predisposing gene of SKC mouse <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
Corneas of the SKC mouse resemble those of human eyes with <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> .
Both are conical and show similar corneal changes , including apoptosis of keratocytes and increased expression of c-fos protein .
The SKC mouse phenotype was transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner , although it was observed almost exclusively in males .
Intriguingly , female mice showed the phenotype when injected with testosterone , whereas male incidence of the phenotype diminished drastically when mice were castrated .
Linkage analysis localized a predisposition locus to an MHC region on mouse chromosome 17 , which includes a locus for the gene for sex-limited protein ( Slp ) .
SKC mouse <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> is a potential model for a subset of human <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> , which is a disease entity with <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> pathogeneses .
Alternatively , SKC mouse <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> could be a model for other human or mouse-specific keratopathies .
Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> : a predictor for metastatic disease and a potential therapeutic target .
To investigate the expression of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) with special focus on its role in cell growth in <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
Paraffin material from 36 clinicopathologically well characterized cases of primary uveal melanomas ( 18 of which had metastasized to the liver ) with more than 15 years ' follow-up was used for immunohistochemical analysis .
In the experimental studies , three <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> cell lines ( OCM-1 , OCM-3 , and 92-1 ) were used .
The expression level of IGF-1R in the cell lines was modulated by glycosylation inhibitors , and the IGF-1R was neutralized with the antibody alphaIR-3 .
Expression of IGF-1R was assayed by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry .
Cell growth and survival were analyzed by cell counting , thymidine incorporation , and viability assays .
Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry confirmed that IGF-1R is expressed in <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
Although 10 of 18 patients who died of metastasizing disease showed high IGF-1R expression , only 5 of 18 tumors from patients who survived for 15 years or more after enucleation exhibited a high IGF-1R expression .
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant association ( P = 0.035 ) between a high IGF-1R expression and death due to metastatic <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
Using in vitro experimental models , we found that inhibition of the IGF-1R activity ( tyrosine phosphorylation ) was associated with a drastic decrease in <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> cell viability .
These data suggest an important role of IGF-1R in <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> .
The significant association between high IGF-1R expression and death due to metastatic disease may be explained by the fact that IGF-1 is mainly produced in the liver , which is the preferential site for <START:PHENOTYPE> uveal melanoma <END> metastases .
These data also point to the possibility of therapeutically interfering with IGF-1R , which appears to be expressed preferentially in uveal melanomas that appear to follow an aggressive clinical course .
Radial ray defect and <START:PHENOTYPE> Duane anomaly <END> : report of a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission .
We report on a family in which a mother and her 2 offspring presented with bilateral radial defects and <START:PHENOTYPE> absent thumbs <END> .
In addition , <START:PHENOTYPE> Duane anomaly <END> was present in both offspring , one of whom also had <START:PHENOTYPE> anal stenosis <END> .
Clinical investigation showed no skeletal , cardiac , or urogenital abnormalities .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> transmission of radial defects is suggested , with <START:PHENOTYPE> Duane anomaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> anal stenosis <END> representing manifestations of the same gene .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> keratitis <END> : a possible aniridia variant .
To describe the findings in a family with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> keratitis <END> .
Case series .
Eye genetics clinic at a university-affiliated hospital in Edmonton .
Fifteen affected members , nine female and six male , of a four-generation family with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> keratitis <END> .
The pattern of transmission was consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
The disorder was characterized by the presence of a circumferential band of opacification and vascularization at the level of Bowman 's membrane adjacent to the limbus .
Progression toward the central cornea occurred in some instances .
Penetrating keratoplasty was performed in certain cases when the visual axis was involved and the acuity deteriorated .
Histopathological studies confirmed the inflammatory nature and the anterior stromal localization of the <START:PHENOTYPE> keratitis <END> .
Thirteen of the affected members in whom a detailed fundus examination was possible had macular hypoplasia .
Several had abnormalities of the iris , including iris stromal defects and ectropion uveae .
The presence of macular hypoplasia in association with the iris and corneal changes suggests that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> keratitis <END> is likely a variant of aniridia .
Clinical spectrum of Niemann-Pick disease type C . Analysis of the neurologic symptomatology in 22 patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C revealed 3 phenotypes : (1 ) an early-onset , rapidly progressive form associated with severe hepatic dysfunction and <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor delay <END> during infancy and later with supranuclear vertical gaze paresis , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ; (2 ) a delayed-onset , slowly progressive form heralded by the appearance , usually in early childhood , of mild intellectual impairment , supranuclear vertical gaze paresis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and later associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and , variably , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and extrapyramidal deficits ; (3 ) a late-onset slowly progressive form distinguished from the 2nd pattern by later age of <START:PHENOTYPE> onset <END> ( adolescence or adulthood ) and a much slower rate of progression .
The existence of the 1st and 2nd phenotypes within the same sibship suggests that they are variant expressions of the same clinicopathologic disorder .
Niemann-Pick disease type C should be considered not only in infants and children who present with organomegaly and a progressive neurodegenerative course , but also in adolescents and adults who have insidiously progressive neurologic dysfunction and only slight organomegaly .
Associated with the disease is a marked deficiency in the ability of cultured fibroblasts to esterify exogenously supplied cholesterol .
Assay of this deficiency is particularly useful for confirming the diagnosis in patients with atypical presentation .
The genetics of primary <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> is an idiopathic movement disorder presumably caused by abnormal function of the basal ganglia .
The disorder may be inherited either as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> , autosomal recessive , or X-linked recessive trait .
At least six forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> can be distinguished clinically .
Linkage analysis in one form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> permits the assignment of a " <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> locus " to the long arm of chromosome 9 .
Genomic duplications mediate overexpression of lamin B1 in adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> leukodystrophy <END> ( ADLD ) with autonomic symptoms .
Adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> leukodystrophy <END> ( ADLD ) with autonomic symptoms features micturition urgency , <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> erectile dysfunction <END> , and orthostatic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> , usually followed by pyramidal signs and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
Peripheral nerve conduction is normal .
The disease is often mistaken for multiple sclerosis in the initial phase .
There is a characteristic pattern of white matter changes in the brain and spinal cord on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) , mild atrophy of the brain , and a more marked atrophy of the spinal cord .
ADLD is associated with duplications of the lamin B1 ( LMNB1 ) gene but the mechanism by which the rearrangement conveys the phenotype is not fully defined .
We analyzed four unrelated families segregating ADLD with autonomic symptoms for duplications of the LMNB1 gene .
A single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) array analysis revealed novel duplications spanning the entire LMNB1 gene in probands from each of the four families .
We then analyzed the expression of lamin B1 in peripheral leukocytes by Western blot analysis in five patients from two available families .
The protein levels of lamin B1 were found significantly increased .
These results indicate that the ADLD phenotype associated with LMNB1 duplications is mediated by increased levels of the lamin B1 protein .
Furthermore , we show that a molecular diagnosis for ADLD with autonomic symptoms can be obtained by a direct analysis of lamin B1 in peripheral leukocytes .
Molecular and clinical study of 61 Angelman syndrome patients .
We analyzed 61 Angelman syndrome ( AS ) patients by cytogenetic and molecular techniques .
On the basis of molecular findings , the patients were classified into the following 4 groups : familial cases without deletion , familial cases with submicroscopic deletion , <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases with deletion , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases without deletion .
Among 53 <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases , 37 (70% ) had molecular deletion , which commonly extended from D15S9 to D15 S12 , although not all deletions were identical .
Of 8 familial cases , 3 sibs from one family had a molecular deletion involving only 2 loci , D15S10 and GABRB3 , which define the critical region for AS phenotypes .
The parental origin of deletion , both in <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> and familial cases , was exclusively maternal and consistent with a genomic imprinting hypothesis .
Among <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> and familial cases without deletion , no uniparental disomy was found and most of them were shown to inherit chromosomes 15 from both parents ( biparental inheritance ) .
A discrepancy between cytogenetic and molecular deletion was observed in 14 ( 26% ) of 53 patients in whom cytogenetic analysis could be performed .
Ten ( 43% ) of 23 patients with a normal karyotype showed a molecular deletion , and 4 ( 13% ) of 30 patients with cytogenetic deletion , del(15 ) ( q11q13) , showed no molecular deletion .
Most clinical manifestations , including neurological signs and facial characteristics , were not distinct in each group except for <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> of skin or hair .
Familial cases with submicroscopic deletion were not associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> .
These findings suggested that a gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> is located outside the critical region of AS and is not imprinted .
Lenz-Majewski syndrome .
Lenz-Majewski syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology .
The condition is characterized by a <START:PHENOTYPE> disproportionately large head <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> large fontanels <END> and widely separated sutures that close late .
The head appears large relative to the reduced size of the trunk and limbs .
The skin is loose , wrinkled , and atrophic with prominent veins , especially in the scalp .
The ears are large and floppy , and frequently there is <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> or stenosis , nasolacrimal duct obstruction , and , in boys , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> .
The disorder is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
In contrast to craniometaphyseal and craniodiaphyseal dysplasias , the conditions most likely to be mistaken for this disorder , there does not appear to be any impingement on cranial nerves .
The skeletal alterations are striking .
The radiographic features include progressive sclerosis of the skull , facial bones , and vertebrae ; <START:PHENOTYPE> broad clavicles <END> and ribs ; short or absent middle phalanges ; diaphyseal undermodeling and midshaft cortical thickening ; metaphyseal and epiphyseal hypostosis ; and retarded skeletal maturation .
Tooth enamel is also defective .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> with mental impairment and <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> .
We described four patients in two families of unique familial <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( FSP ) which was thought to be possibly <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
All four patients had quite similar manifestations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Gait disturbance <END> started at their second decade , then spastic paraparesis and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deterioration <END> progressed slowly .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebellar ataxia <END> and sensory loss in the distal parts of four extremities were also slightly presented .
In all patients , cranial MRI revealed marked <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> with mild changes in the region of periventricular white matter and in the gray matter .
Biopsied sural nerves of all patients showed chronic axonal degeneration with mild decrease of both large and small myelinated fibers .
Electron microscopic study demonstrated crystalline-like inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of Schwann cells in all patients .
Despite extensive investigation for metabolic disorder , we could not find any abnormality .
However an etiology have not established at the time presented , the combination of these clinical features suggested that the disorder could represent a specific clinical entity .
A familial case of X chromosome deletion ascertained by cytogenetic screening of women with <START:PHENOTYPE> premature ovarian failure <END> .
The association between X chromosome deletions and <START:PHENOTYPE> premature ovarian failure <END> is well established .
Previous anecdotal reports however , have not documented the prevalence of X deletions in women with <START:PHENOTYPE> premature ovarian failure <END> .
We therefore performed cytogenetic analyses on 79 women with primary or secondary amenorrhoea to assess the utility of screening for a genetic marker for familial <START:PHENOTYPE> premature ovarian failure <END> .
A normal karyotype was found in 77 women .
One woman with primary amenorrhoea had an XY karyotype and a woman with secondary amenorrhoea had a deletion at Xq 26.1 .
This second case had a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> premature ovarian failure <END> , and her mother who underwent <START:PHENOTYPE> premature ovarian failure <END> at 28 years shared this deletion .
The early diagnosis of familial X deletions causing <START:PHENOTYPE> premature ovarian failure <END> allowed for the prediction of impending menopause and the implementation of manoeuvres to advance conception .
Although cytogenetic aberrations are rare in secondary amenorrhoea , the ability to predict <START:PHENOTYPE> premature ovarian failure <END> can be vital .
Evidence for diabetes mellitus and genetic forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> as independent entities .
Among 91 index cases whose diagnosis of a genetic type of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> was based on family studies , 27% had diabetes .
To determine whether the familial forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> and genetic diabetes mellitus are inherited together or independently , the adult first degree relatives of these propositi were investigated for the presence of diabetes .
Frequency of diabetes in first degree relatives of the 25 diabetic patients with a familial form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> was identical whether such relatives were hyperlipidemic or not ( 13% versus 14 .7% ) .
The frequency of diabetes in both the hyperlipidemic and normolipidemic relatives of the 66 nondiabetic hypertriglyceridemic index cases also was not significantly different from each other ( 6.2% versus 4. 0% ) .
These results indicate that while diabetes is frequently associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , genetic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , per se , does not carry an increased risk of diabetes .
Following treatment of diabetes , elevated triglyceride levels in index cases with both familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> and untreated diabetes returned to lower but still elevated levels resembling those of affected ( hypertriglyceridemic ) relatives .
Thus , the interaction of untreated diabetes and a familial form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> determines the level of plasma triglyceride in a patient with both disorders .
Geleophysic dysplasia : a storage disorder affecting the skin , bone , liver , heart , and trachea .
Geleophysic dysplasia is characterized by typical facies ( " happy natured " ) , small hands and feet , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> , and progressive cardiac disease .
We describe five patients ( two of whom are siblings ) with this disorder and document its variable expressivity .
The facies were strikingly similar with <START:PHENOTYPE> small nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nostrils <END> , broad nasal bridge , and long thin upper lip with flat and <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> .
Behavior , development , and intelligence were normal .
Growth delay was noticed during infancy , and the two patients who completed normal puberty had marked <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> ( 14 0 and 150 cm) , with relatively lean body habitus .
The hands and feet were small , with short , plump tubular bones and broad proximal phalanges , associated with marked limitation in motion of fingers and wrists .
The liver was enlarged after the age of 3 years .
Two patients had mild mitral and tricuspid valve stenosis and one had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic stenosis <END> .
The most severely affected child died at 3 1/2 years of age of airway obstruction as a result of progressive tracheal narrowing .
Lysosomal storage vacuoles were found in skin epithelial cells from three patients whose skin was examined , and in the tracheal mucosa , liver , cartilage and macrophages of the child who died .
The basic defect of this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> lysosomal storage disease remains to be determined .
Familial benign recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> intrahepatic cholestasis <END> .
Interrelation with <START:PHENOTYPE> intrahepatic cholestasis <END> of pregnancy and from oral contraceptives ?
A family study was prompted by the presence of benign recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> intrahepatic cholestasis <END> in three members and probably in a fourth .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pruritus <END> and/or jaundice occurred during pregnancy in nine members .
Two additional members suffered from <START:PHENOTYPE> pruritus <END> while using oral contraceptives .
The literature on benign recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> intrahepatic cholestasis <END> since 1959 describes at least 57 cases .
A familial form of this condition proved to be fairly common .
There seems to be a relation to the <START:PHENOTYPE> intrahepatic cholestasis <END> sometimes seen during pregnancy and during oral contraceptive use .
The data of the family study are suggestive for an interrelation of the three types of <START:PHENOTYPE> intrahepatic cholestasis <END> , although a common denominator remains obscure .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Amelogenesis imperfecta <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> taurodontism <END> .
Reports of families having a combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> amelogenesis imperfecta <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> taurodontism <END> are limited .
This study of members of three families shows that the combination is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
In each of the patients examined , neither condition was seen without the other .
The enamel was rough and dysplastic and varied in color from white to yellow .
Radiographically , <START:PHENOTYPE> taurodontism <END> was present in the deciduous and permanent dentitions .
The pulp chambers of the incisor teeth were larger than is usually seen at all ages .
All patients had normal-appearing hair , fingernails , and bones .
The distinction between <START:PHENOTYPE> amelogenesis imperfecta <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> taurodontism <END> and the tricho-dento-osseous syndrome is discussed .
The natural history of Machado-Joseph disease .
An analysis of 138 personally examined cases .
We have examined 138 cases of a disorder previously described in people of Portuguese origin and which has received many names .
By computer analysis of 46 different items of a standardized neurological examination carried out in each patient , we have been able to delineate the main components of the clinical presentation , to conclude that the marked variability in clinical expressions does not negate the homogeneity of the disorder , and to describe the natural history of this entity which should be called , for historical reasons , " Machado-Joseph Disease " .
This hereditary disease has an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern of inheritance , presenting as a <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> external ophthalmoplegia <END> , and should be classified within the group of " Ataxic multisystem degenerations " .
When the disease starts before the age of 20 , it may present with marked <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , of a non progressive nature but often so severe that it can be accompanied by " Gegenhalten " countermovements and dystonic postures but little frank <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
There are few true extrapyramidal symptoms except akinesia .
When the disease starts after the age of 50 , the clinical spectrum is mostly that of an amyotrophic polyneuropathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> accompanying the <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
For all the other cases the clinical picture is a continuum between these two extremes , the main determinant of the clinical phenotype being the age of onset and a secondary factor , the place of origin of the given kindred .
The ataxic and amyotrophic components are clearly progressive with time in contrast to the <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> component .
Although the majority of known cases are of Portuguese origin , this is not obligatory .
The next research endeavour should be a search for the chromosomal site of the gene , using molecular biology technology such as those for recombinant DNA .
Evolution of a patient with Bohring-Opitz syndrome .
We detailed the story from birth to the age of 5 years 9 months , of the oldest patient reported with a Bohring-Opitz syndrome with the three main diagnostic criteria : characteristic facial appearance , fixed contractures of the upper limbs and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> feeding difficulties <END> .
The facial anomalies described in our patient were <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bitemporal narrowing <END> , " puffy " cheeks , forehead naevus flammeus , hypoplastic orbital ridges , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent eyes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , high arched palate , buccal-alveola frenula and retrognathism .
The magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of the brain showed a <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic corpus callosum <END> and a narrowed upper cervical canal; and the cervical MRI showed a malformation of the atlas consisting in an agenesis of the anterior arch and an anterior slip of the posterior arch .
We focused on her neurological and nutritional evolution .
Despite the gastrostomy and a Nissen fundoplication at age 7 months , she still had developmental growth delays overall ( <3rd centile ) .
At 3 years 9 months of age , she began to put on weight quickly , which seemed to be atypical .
Meanwhile she developed <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , which was controlled with specific drugs .
Currently , she is 5 years 9 months old and has significant <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , although this disease is often fatal in early childhood , due to obstructive apnea and unexplained bradycardia .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Aniridia <END> , male pseudohermaphroditism , <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadoblastoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and del 11p13 .
A 20-month-old male patient was referred because of severe growth and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , bilateral glaucoma , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> .
Karyotyping revealed a de novo complex three-chromosome rearrangement as well as deletion of band 11p13:46 , XY ,t(4;7;15 ) (q212 ;p14 ;q26)del( 11 ) ( p13p14 ) .
Trabeculectomia revealed bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
Surgery on the genitalia revealed male pseudohermaphroditism and bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> gonadoblastoma <END> .
The kidneys were normal .
A deficiency in catalase ( CAT ) activity allowed the regional assignment of the CAT gene to band 11p13 .
Natal and <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal teeth <END> in relation to environmental toxicants .
Infants born to mothers heavily exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) have earlier been reported to have increased prevalences of natal and <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal teeth <END> .
Some tendency toward higher prevalence figures of natal and <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal teeth <END> can be seen in the literature in normal child populations during the last 40 y .
We therefore decided to determine the present prevalence of these teeth in a Finnish population and to evaluate whether infants with natal and <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal teeth <END> are more exposed to PCBs , PCDFs , and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) than infants on average .
A total of 34 ,457 infants born in 1997-2000 in four hospitals in southern Finland were examined for natal and <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal teeth <END> .
The exposure of the infant to PCBs and PCDD/Fs was evaluated by measuring the levels of 17 most toxic PCDD/F and 36 PCB congeners in his or her mother 's milk sample when the child was 4-8 wk old .
A total of 34 infants had one or two natal ( 29 infants ) or <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal teeth <END> ( five infants ) .
The milk analyses showed that the median level of PCDD/Fs as toxic equivalent ( World Health Organization-recommended 2 ,3 ,7 , 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalent quantity for PCDD/Fs in fat ) was 11 .9 pg/g in fat , and that of PCBs ( World Health Organization-recommended 2 ,3 ,7 , 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalent quantity for PCBs ) was 7.24 pg/g in fat .
These levels corresponded to the prevailing levels .
The results showed that the prevalence of natal and <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal teeth <END> was 1 :1000 .
No association was found between pollutant levels and occurrence of natal and <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal teeth <END> , indicating that the prevailing levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs are likely to be below the threshold to cause perinatal eruption of teeth .
CEP89 is required for <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> metabolism and neuronal function in man and fly .
It is estimated that the human <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> proteome consists of 1000-150 0 distinct proteins .
The majority of these support the various biochemical pathways that are active in these organelles .
Individuals with an oxidative phosphorylation disorder of unknown cause provide a unique opportunity to identify novel genes implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> biology .
We identified a homozygous deletion of CEP89 in a patient with isolated complex IV deficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> and multisystemic problems .
CEP89 is a ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved gene of unknown function .
Immunocytochemistry and cellular fractionation experiments showed that CEP89 is present both in the cytosol and in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> intermembrane space .
Furthermore , we ascertained in vitro that downregulation of CEP89 resulted in a severe decrease in complex IV in-gel activity and altered mobility , suggesting that the complex is aberrantly formed .
Two-dimensional BN-SDS gel analysis revealed that CEP89 associates with a high-molecular weight complex .
Together , these data confirm a role for CEP89 in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> metabolism .
In addition , we modeled CEP89 loss of function in Drosophila .
Ubiquitous knockdown of fly Cep89 decreased complex IV activity and resulted in complete lethality .
Furthermore , Cep89 is required for <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> integrity , membrane depolarization and synaptic transmission of photoreceptor neurons , and for ( sub)synaptic organization of the larval neuromuscular junction .
Finally , we tested neuronal Cep89 knockdown flies in the light-off jump reflex habituation assay , which revealed its role in learning .
We conclude that CEP89 proteins play an important role in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> metabolism , especially complex IV activity , and are required for neuronal and cognitive function across evolution .
Multiple small hyperintense lesions in the subcortical white matter on cranial MR images in two Turkish brothers with cold-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> syndrome caused by a novel missense mutation in the CRLF1 gene .
Cold-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> syndrome ( CISS ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by excess <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> induced by cold exposure , <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> .
CISS is genetically heterogeneous .
Deficiency of the CRLF1 or the CLCF1 gene function results in one of two clinically indistuinguishable disorders called CISS1 and CISS2 , respectively .
We present two Turkish brothers ( 22 and 13 years old ) who had excess <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> induced by cold exposure , severe dorsal scoliosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , reduced pain sensitivity and marfanoid habitus .
The patients were homozygous and their parents heterozygous for a novel missense mutation c.413C> T ( p.Pro138Leu ) in CRLF1 gene .
The cranial magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of two patients also showed multiple small hyperintense lesions in the subcortical white matter .
Similar MRI finding has also been reported in a Japanese woman with CISS1 and marfanoid habitus .
The lesions found in the present cases showed no characteristic features .
However , multiple small hyperintense lesions in subcortical white matter on T2 weighted and fluid attenuation inversion recovery ( FLAIR) images may support the clinical diagnosis of CISS .

A PHEX gene mutation is responsible for adult-onset vitamin D-resistant hypophosphatemic <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> : evidence that the disorder is not a distinct entity from X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> .
Previous investigators described a kindred with an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> form of phosphate wasting in which affected children did not have radiographic evidence of rickets , whereas older individuals were progressively disabled by severe bowing .
They proposed that this kindred suffered from a distinct disorder that they referred to as adult-onset vitamin D-resistant hypophosphatemic <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> ( AVDRR ) .
We recently identified a gene , PHEX , that is responsible for the disorder X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> .
To determine whether AVDRR is a distinct form of phosphate wasting , we searched for PHEX mutations in affected members of the original AVDRR kindred .
We found that affected individuals have a missense mutation in PHEX exon 16 that results in an amino acid change from leucine to proline in residue 555 .
Clinical evaluation of individuals from this family indicates that some of these individuals display classic features of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> , and we were unable to verify progressive bowing in adults .
In light of the variability in the clinical spectrum of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> and the presence of a PHEX mutation in affected members of this kindred , we conclude that there is only one form of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> phosphate wasting .
Dermatoglyphics in the identification of women either with or at risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Fingerprints and palm prints were studied in 78 <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> patients , 391 patients at increased risk for developing <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , and 64 control patients for the purpose of finding a pattern that would identify those women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> or those who are predisposed to its development .
A pattern of 6 or more digital whorls was identified more frequently in women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> than in those without the disease ( P less than 0.01 ) .
This finding was independent of known risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and was present in 28% of the cancer patients .
No correlation was noticed between palm prints and <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
The positive predictive value of 6 or more digital whorls was comparable to that of mammography and that of breast biopsy .
With increasing age there was an increase in the positive predictive value associated with 6 or more digital whorls .
It is concluded that digital dermatoglyphics may have a future role in identifying women either with or at increased risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> such that either risk reduction measures or earlier therapy may be instituted .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> striatonigral degeneration .
A clinical , pathologic , and biochemical study of a new genetic disorder .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> striatonigral degeneration is present in a family of Portuguese ancestry numbering in excess of 329 persons in eight generations .
The illness begins in the second , third , or fourth decade , and progresses for about 15 years with parkinsonian <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , and abnormalities of eye movement .
Neuropathologic findings are severe neuronal loss and astrocytic <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> in the corpus striatum and substantia nigra , with a moderate neuronal loss in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum and nucleus ruber of the midbrain .
This is a new genetic entity , distinct from other <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> neurologic disorders such as nigrospinodentatal degeneration , olivopontocerebellar degeneration , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> musculorum deformans , Machado 's disease , and Huntington 's disease .
Clinical , cytogenetic , and pedigree findings in 18 cases of Aicardi syndrome .
Eighteen girls with Aicardi syndrome were identified through a survey of neurologists , geneticists , and ophthalmologists .
All had infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , developmental delay , agenesis of the corpus callosum ( complete : 72 % , partial: 28% ) , and characteristic chorioretinal lacunar lesions .
Costovertebral defects including <START:PHENOTYPE> hemivertebrae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and absent or malformed ribs were present in 39% , cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopias <END> were present in 5 0% , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> was identified in a third .
Cytogenetic investigation was carried out in all families .
An unbalanced X;3 translocation , 46 ,X ,der(X )t( X;3 ) (p22.3;p23)mat , was discovered in a girl with chorioretinal lacunar lesions characteristic of Aicardi syndrome , developmental delay , and infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
However , this child had a normal appearing corpus callosum on CT and magnetic resonance imaging scans and therefore did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the study .
Chromosomes of all other patients and parents were normal .
Findings at birth , age of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> onset , treatment , and prognosis are discussed .
The pedigree data from these 18 families demonstrated an unaffected male:female sib ratio of 1 :1.7 and a 14 % spontaneous abortion rate .
The findings of this study support the contention that Aicardi syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> disorder with early embryonic lethality in hemizygous males and that all cases represent new mutations .
A detailed analysis of chromosomal changes in heritable and non-heritable <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Full cytogenetic analysis of 27 different <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumors is presented .
Gross aneuploidy of chromosome arms 6p and 1q were very common , being observed in 15 /27 and 21/27 tumors , respectively .
However , we found that chromosome 13 was rarely missing : only 3/27 had a detectable monosomy affecting 13q14 .
Monosomy of chromosome 13 by small deletion or rearrangement was also not observed in any of 12 <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor lines analyzed detail at the 300-400 chromosome band level .
A novel observation in <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> was the discovery of non-random translocations at three specific breakpoints , 14q32 ( 4/12 ) , 17p12 ( 5 /12 ) , and 10q25 ( 3/12 ) .
Genomic rearrangements similar to those described involving C-myc in Burkitt <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> 14q + cells could not be demonstrated in the four 14q + <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> lines using molecular techniques , and a probe mapping to the site implicated to have an activating role in <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> .
These data suggest that there is a target for rearrangement at 14q32 but it is not the same sequence used in some Burkitt lymphomas .
Two other breakpoints ( 2p24 and 8q24) coincided with the mapped position of cellular oncogenes , but also failed to show a molecular rearrangement with the oncogene probes .
The breakpoints , 10q25 and 17p12 , are constitutional fragile sites which may predispose these regions to act as acceptors of translocations in malignant cells .
One line had double minute chromosomes , and was the only one of 16 ( 6% ) tested with the N-myc probe which had an amplification .
Different tumors from single patients with multifocal heritable <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> showed independent karyotype evolution .
Unilateral non-heritable tumors exhibited a high level of karyotype stability throughout both in vivo and in vitro growth .
The various common patterns of aneuploidy and translocations probably confer an early selective advantage to malignant cells , rather than induce malignant transformation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Schizophrenia <END> and affective disorders--cosegregation with a translocation at chromosome 1q42 that directly disrupts brain-expressed genes : clinical and P300 findings in a family .
A family with a ( 1 ;11 ) (q42 ;q14 .3 ) translocation significantly linked to a clinical phenotype that includes <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and affective disorders is described .
This translocation generates a LOD score of 3.6 when the disease phenotype is restricted to <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , of 4.5 when the disease phenotype is restricted to affective disorders , of 7. 1 when relatives with recurrent major depression , with bipolar disorder , or with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> are all classed as affected .
This evidence for linkage is among the strongest reported for a psychiatric disorder .
Family members showed no distinctive features by which the psychiatric phenotype could be distinguished from unrelated cases of either <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> or affective disorders , and no physical , neurological , or dysmorphic conditions co-occurred with psychiatric symptoms .
Translocation carriers and noncarriers had the same mean intelligence quotient .
Translocation carriers were similar to subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and different from noncarriers and controls , in showing a significant reduction in the amplitude of the P300 event-related potential ( ERP ) .
Furthermore , P300 amplitude reduction and latency prolongation were measured in some carriers of the translocation who had no psychiatric symptoms-a pattern found in other families with multiple members with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , in which amplitude of and latency of P300 appear to be trait markers of risk .
The results of karyotypic , clinical , and ERP investigations of this family suggest that the recently described genes DISC1 and DISC2 , which are directly disrupted by the breakpoint on chromosome 1 , may have a role in the development of a disease phenotype that includes <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> as well as unipolar and bipolar affective disorders .
An unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> .
We report on a mother and her dizygotic twin fetuses who were affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> .
In addition the mother has cervical vertebral anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , nuchal and axillary pterygia , and unusual facial appearance .
The fetuses had a <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pterygium colli <END> , retrognathia , and mild apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
We think that these three individuals have a previously undescribed type of <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> .
Shprintzen-Goldberg <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> syndrome : a new patient with an expanded phenotype .
Shprintzen and Goldberg [ 1979 ] described a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , pharyngeal and <START:PHENOTYPE> laryngeal hypoplasia <END> , mild dysmorphic face , and learning disabilities .
This condition was described in a father and three daughters , one of whom died in infancy , probably of airway narrowing .
Here , we report on a second observation of this syndrome in a 6-year-old patient .
In our case , <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , and feeding impairment were the main clinical problems in the neonatal period .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Scoliosis <END> appeared during the fourth year of age .
The facial appearance is similar to the original patients and additional clinical findings are described which expand the phenotypic spectrum .

A novel missense mutation in human TTF-2 ( FKHL15 ) gene associated with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> but not athyreosis .
Thyroid dysgenesis is the most frequent cause of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> ( CH) , and its genetic basis is largely unknown .
Hitherto , two mutations in the human thyroid transcription factor 2 ( TTF-2 ) gene have been described in unrelated cases of CH with <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , spiky hair , variable <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> , and complete <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid agenesis <END> .
Here , we describe a novel TTF-2 mutation in a female child resulting in syndromic CH in the absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid agenesis <END> .
The index case is homozygous for an arginine to cysteine mutation ( R102C) of a highly conserved residue within the forkhead , DNA binding domain of TTF-2 .
Her consanguineous , heterozygous parents are unaffected , and the mutation was not detected in 100 control chromosomes .
Consonant with its location , the R102C mutant TTF-2 protein showed loss of DNA binding and was transcriptionally inactive .
CH in the proposita was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , spiky hair , and bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> .
However , radiological studies showed the presence of thyroid tissue in a eutopic location .
Our findings indicate that human thyroid development can occur despite loss of TTF-2 function and suggest that TTF-2 gene defects should also be considered in cases of syndromic CH without total athyreosis .
Rare structural variants in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> : one disorder , multiple mutations ; one mutation , multiple disorders .
Recent studies have established an important role for rare genomic deletions and duplications in the etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
This research suggests that the genetic architecture of neuropsychiatric disorders includes a constellation of rare mutations in many different genes .
Mutations that confer substantial risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> have been identified at several loci , most of which have also been implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders , including autism .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Genetic heterogeneity <END> is a characteristic of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ; conversely , phenotypic <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> is a characteristic of all schizophrenia-associated mutations .
Both kinds of <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> probably reflect the complexity of neurodevelopment .
Research strategies must account for both genetic and clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> to identify the genes and pathways crucial for the development of neuropsychiatric disorders .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection <END> and a constellation of craniofacial , skeletal , and urogenital anomalies in a newborn and similar features in his 36-year-old father .
We report on a newborn male born to non-consanguineous parents with <START:PHENOTYPE> total anomalous pulmonary venous connection <END> ( TAPVC ) and additional findings of malformed ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , brachyphalangy in the hands , pterygium of the elbows , knees , and wrists , complex lower limb pre-axial polydactyly , tibial shortening , <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfeet <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> horseshoe kidney <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> .
He had a 46 , XY karyotype .
His 36-year-old father had similar craniofacial and limb anomalies suggesting an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome with variable expression .
Our patients may represent the 3rd and 4th examples of a newly-described syndrome by Baraitser et al . [ ( 1997 ) Clin Dysmorphol 6 :111 -121] which is distinguished by malformed ears , complex pre-axial polydactyly and tibial aplasia in the lower limbs , severe brachyphalangy in the hands , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> .
Two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , progressive cerebral atrophy and abnormal white matter , <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , and Lennox-Gastaut spectrum type epilepsy : an inherited encephalopathy of childhood ?
Two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> of unknown origin were found to share several physical anomalies , including large round head , small concave nose , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanted palpebral fissures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> .
In addition to relative <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) showed severe cerebral atrophy , especially fronto-temporally .
The brothers also had a <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> and atrophic caudate nuclei .
The reduced white matter showed patchy periventricular signal intensity changes .
The lateral and third ventricles were large , but the fourth ventricle was of normal size .
The boys had <START:PHENOTYPE> large cisterna magna <END> , communicating widely with the fourth ventricle , but no vermian hypoplasia .
Both boys had Lennox-Gastaut spectrum type epilepsy .
No chromosomal anomalies were found , despite the suggestive clinical picture .
Some of the clinical findings resembled fetal alcohol effects/fetal alcohol syndrome ( FAE/FAS ) , which was also suggested by history .
Current diagnostic criteria for FAE/FAS , however , excluded full-blown FAS in these cases and failed to explain the entire clinical picture in the boys .
We argue that these boys had an unidentified inherited syndrome , possibly modified by fetal alcohol exposure .

Chromosomal linkage associated with disease severity in the hydrocephalic H-Tx rat . Infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> results in neurological deficits despite surgical treatment .
Fetal-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> in humans can be caused by developmental abnormalities that are genetic in origin .
The H-Tx rat has <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> with 40% penetrance and a polygenic inheritance .
A backcross with Fisher F344 inbred strain produced a total of 1500 progeny with 17.5 % <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> .
Of these , only 12 .3% had overt disease and the remaining 5.2% had mild disease seen only after fixation of the brain .
Disease severity was measured for all affected rats using the ratio of ventricle to brain width .
The severity measure confirmed that there are two populations , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( M ; ratio , < 0.4 ) and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( S ; ratio , > 0.4) , with a small overlap.
For genotyping , the two populations were each subdivided based on the ratio measure to give a total of four groups of increasing severity .
After an initial genome scan with microsatellite markers , all hydrocephalic rats and a subset of 128 normal progeny were genotyped on chromosomes 4 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 17 and 19 . Rats in the mildest group had association with a locus on chromosome 4 ( LOD 2.4) , whereas those in the severest group were associated with a locus on chromosome 17 ( LOD 3.2 ) .
All except the least affected group were associated with a heterozygous genotype on chromosomes 10 and 11 ( LOD 4.5 and 3.5 , respectively ) .
Chromosomes 9 and 19 had weak linkage to <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> .
The number of hydrocephalus-associated loci carried by each rat correlated with the severity of disease .
It is concluded that the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> in H-Tx is influenced by different genetic loci .
Onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> in early infancy associated with a 32G--> C transition in the iron responsive element of L-ferritin .
We describe the onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> in early infancy in a family with hereditary hyperferritinaemia-cataract syndrome .
The two probands presented with isolated hyperferritinaemia and had developed <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> at the age of 18 months .
Two members of their family with high ferritin levels ( 1270-145 0 microg/l ) had suffered from <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> since childhood .
The mutation responsible was a 32G--> C change in the lateral bulge of the stem structure of the iron responsive element of the L-ferritin subunit gene .
Mutations at this level cause particularly high ferritin levels , whereas the age of <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> onset and its severity are controversial subjects .
In our family , early ophthalmic examination ruled out the possibility that <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> was due to age-related persistence of high ferritin levels in the lens and suggested that other factors may modulate the phenotype .
<START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> may appear early in hereditary hyperferritinaemia-cataract syndrome and this syndrome should be suspected and ferritin levels measured in all cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> in children , even when the onset is in early infancy .
Syndromes of <START:PHENOTYPE> neurodegeneration <END> with brain iron accumulation .
In parallel to recent developments of genetic techniques , understanding of the syndromes of <START:PHENOTYPE> neurodegeneration <END> with brain iron accumulation has grown considerably .
The acknowledged clinical spectrum continues to broaden , with age-dependent presentations being recognized .
Postmortem brain examination of genetically confirmed cases has demonstrated Lewy bodies and/or tangles in some forms , bridging the gap to more common neurodegenerative disorders , including Parkinson disease .
In this review , the major forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> neurodegeneration <END> with brain iron accumulation ( NBIA) are summarized , concentrating on clinical findings and molecular insights .
In addition to pantothenate kinase-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> neurodegeneration <END> ( PKAN ) and phospholipase A2-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> neurodegeneration <END> ( PLAN ) , fatty acid hydroxylase-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> neurodegeneration <END> ( FAHN ) NBIA , mitochondrial protein-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> neurodegeneration <END> , Kufor-Rakeb disease , aceruloplasminemia , neuroferritinopathy , and SENDA syndrome ( static encephalopathy of childhood with <START:PHENOTYPE> neurodegeneration <END> in adulthood ) are discussed .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with multiple dislocations , leptodactylic type : report of a new patient and review of the literature .
A 6-year-old boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hip dislocation <END> , developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , low set ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , and hyperlaxity of the wrists and fingers is described .
Radiographs disclosed mainly the presence of thoracic <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , narrow interpedicular distances , metaphyseal vertical striations , very small <START:PHENOTYPE> irregular epiphyses <END> , right hip dislocation , luxation of both elbows , and severe delay of ossification of the epiphyses and the carpal bones .
These features are very close to the newly described entity : <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> and multiple dislocations .
This patient brings to light the differential diagnosis and confirms the specificity of the radiological findings of this new entity .

Geroderma osteodysplasticum hereditaria and wrinkly skin syndrome in 22 patients from Oman .
Excessive skin wrinkling and <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> are seen in many genetic conditions and overlapping features can make a clinical diagnosis difficult .
Here we report on 22 Omani patients from 11 consanguineous families with the diagnosis of wrinkly skin syndrome ( WSS , OMIM 278250 ) or geroderma osteodysplasticum hereditaria ( GO , OMIM 231070 ) .
The WSS phenotype evolves during early childhood and includes a generalized and excessive skin wrinkling , dental problems , herniae , foot deformities , hip dislocations , growth retardation , and a large anterior fontanelle .
The facial gestalt is characterized by a broad nasal bridge , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> .
We were unable to differentiate between WSS and <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> with growth and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> ( CLGDD , OMIM 219200 ) suggesting that both can be considered as one entity .
Distinct hallmarks of GO were skin wrinkling limited to the dorsum of hands and feet and to the abdomen , normal fontanelles , maxillary hypoplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> bowed long bones <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopenia <END> with frequent fractures .
In contrast to the attenuation of the skin phenotype with age in WSS , adult patients with GO appeared prematurely aged .
A serum sialotransferrin type 2 pattern was found in all four WSS patients tested .
Apolipoprotein CIII ( a marker for O-glycosylation ) was normal suggesting that WSS is frequently associated with a N-protein glycosylation defect , probably at the level of processing ( CDG-II ) .
All four investigated GO patients showed normal sialotransferrin patterns .
The known loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> and WSS on 2q31 , 5q23-q31 , 7q11 , 11q13 , and 14q32 were excluded .
We suggest that WSS and GO are distinct entities with overlapping features .

Wolfram syndrome : evidence of a diffuse neurodegenerative disease by magnetic resonance imaging .
Wolfram syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder beginning in childhood that consists of four cardinal features : <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , and neurosensory hearing loss .
Aside from these features , the clinical picture is highly variable and may include other neurologic abnormalities such as <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
We present two unrelated patients with Wolfram syndrome , both of whom had the four cardinal features and several other neurologic abnormalities .
MRIs showed widespread atrophic changes throughout the brain , some of which correlated with the major neurologic features of the syndrome .
A novel <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> malformation syndrome associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and distinctive facies maps to 16ptel in the Hutterite population .
The Hutterites are a genetically isolated Anabaptist group living on the North American prairies ; their population numbers over 40,000 , the majority of whom are descendants of 89 founders .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> developmental disorder was identified in four patients from two consanguineous Hutterite families .
To our knowledge the clinical presentation is unique and undescribed .
The patients have distinctive facial features , congenital malformations of the heart and genitourinary system , head circumference at the 2nd centile and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
The facial features include tall forehead with <START:PHENOTYPE> high anterior hairline <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deep-set eyes <END> with short , <START:PHENOTYPE> upslanted palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long nose <END> with low-hanging columella , and thick vermilion of the upper and lower lip .
Karyotype and baseline metabolic studies were normal .
An identity-by-descent mapping approach was used to localize the gene for this disorder .
The patients were genotyped using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 10 K ( Xba 2.0 ) and 50 K ( Xba 240 ) Arrays which identified a single 5.5 Mb homozygous region at chromosome 16p13.3 . To confirm and refine the boundaries of this region , microsatellite markers were used to genotype the patients , their parents , and the available unaffected siblings .
The disease locus was refined to a region of 5 .1 Mb containing 173 known or predicted genes .
No other recessive disorders with similar clinical features are currently mapped to this region .
The coding regions of over fifteen genes , prioritized by microarray expression analysis and information available in public databases , have been sequenced , but no potential pathogenic mutations have been identified .
The identification of the gene for this syndrome will provide new insights into development and learning .

Early-onset familial <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> due to POLG mutations .
To define the molecular etiology of early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and peripheral neuropathy.
Two sisters had early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> (dystonic toe curling , action tremor , masked face , <START:PHENOTYPE> bradykinesia <END> , stooped posture , and <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> ) , together with clinical and electrophysiological signs of sensorimotor axonal peripheral neuropathy.
No mutations were found in the genes for parkin or PINK1 .
Muscle biopsies showed ragged-red and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers , and biochemistry showed decreased activities of respiratory chain complexes containing mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions <END> were seen by long polymerase chain reaction , and sequencing of the POLG gene showed that the patients were compound heterozygous for two patogenic mutations .
POLG mutations can cause early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> in the absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myopathy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> is linked to chromosome 12q23.3-24.11 and caused by an intron mutation in the ISCU gene resulting in a splicing defect .
We describe the mapping and identification of the gene for hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> ( HML ) .
HML is characterized by low physical performance , resulting in physical exertion that causes early exhaustion , dyspnoea and <START:PHENOTYPE> palpitations <END> .
Using an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance , we mapped the trait to chromosome 12q23.3-24.11 , with a maximum lod score of 5.26 .
The 1.6-Mb disease-critical region contained one obvious candidate gene-ISCU-specifying a protein involved in iron-sulphur cluster assembly .
IscU is produced in two isoforms ; one cytosolic and one mitochondrial , coded for by different splice variants of the ISCU gene .
Mutational analysis of all exon and intron sequences as well as 1000 bp of the promoter of the ISCU gene revealed one intron mutation that was specific for the disease haplotype .
The mutation is located in a region with homology to the interferon-stimulated response element ( ISRE) , but we could not see any effect of the mutation on expression levels in vitro or in vivo .
We did , however , observe a drastic difference in the splicing pattern between patients and controls .
In controls the mRNA was , as expected , mainly in the mitochondrial form , while in the patients a larger mRNA transcript was predominant .
Sequencing of the product revealed that the mutation activates cryptic splice sites in intron 5 resulting in aberrant mRNA containing 100 bp of the intron .
To conclude , our data strongly suggest that an intron mutation in the ISCU gene , leading to incorrectly spliced mRNA , is the cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> in this family .
Genetics of <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testis <END> .
We present our study of the genetics of <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> .
The occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> could be confirmed in 1.5 to 4. 0 per cent of the fathers and in 6.2 per cent of the brothers of index patients with true <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> .
The pattern of the familial cluster fits into the gaussian-additive-multifactorial-threshold program .
The value of heritability for the first degree male relatives is 0.67 plus or minus 0.16 .
In siblings of index patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> other congenital abnormalities do not occur more often .
Bilateral ( more severe ) <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> are associated with a higher recurrence risk for siblings .
The nosological identity of unilateral and bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> have shorter menses and a delay of menarche .
Thus , the pituitary hypogonadism of mothers seems to be a predisposing factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> in their sons .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> .
Two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia <END> were found to have <START:PHENOTYPE> urticaria <END> pigmentosa-like skin <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> with increased mast cells and melanin depositions in the dermis .
Structural ciliary abnormalities of the respiratory tract were seen , and these may contribute to their severe recurrent chest infections .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Primary hypothyroidism <END> occurred in both by 3 years of age and responded to replacement therapy .
The abnormalities seen appear to be the result of a common genetic aberration causing a particular sequence of maldevelopments during embryogenesis .
This form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> gives a unique insight into the potential extent of structural defects of ectodermal dysplasias .
Sensitivity to cerebral ischaemic insult in a rat model of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> is determined by a single genetic locus .
Ischaemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> is a complex disorder caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors .
Clinical and epidemiological studies have provided strong evidence for genetic influences in the development of human <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> and several mendelian traits featuring <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> have been described .
The genetic analysis of the non-mendelian , common ischaemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> in humans is hindered by the late onset of the disease and the mode of inheritance , which is complex , polygenic and multifactorial .
An important approach to the study of such polygenic diseases is the use of appropriate animal models in which individual contributing factors can be recognized and analysed .
The spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat ( SHRSP ) is an experimental model of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> characterized by a high frequency of spontaneous strokes as well as an increased sensitivity to experimentally induced focal cerebral ischaemia .
Rubattu et al . performed a genomewide screen in an F2 cross obtained by mating SHRSP and SHR , in which latency to <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> on Japanese rat diet was used as a phenotype .
This study identified three major quantitative trait loci ( QTLs ) , STR-1-3 .
Of these , STR-2 and 3 conferred a protective effect against <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> in the presence of SHRSP alleles and STR-2 co-localized with the genes encoding for atrial natriuretic and brain natriuretic factors .
Our investigation was designed to identify the genetic component responsible for large infarct volumes in the SHRSP in response to a focal ischaemic insult by performance of a genome scan in an F2 cross derived from the SHRSP and the normotensive reference strain , WKY rat .
We identified a highly significant QTL on rat chromosome 5 with a lod score of 16 .6 which accounts for 67 % of the total variance , co-localizes with the genes encoding atrial and brain natriuretic factor and is blood pressure independent .
Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome and cervical instability .
Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome is a recently delineated <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition comprising short stature with <START:PHENOTYPE> short trunk <END> , failure of normal spine segmentation resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> block vertebrae <END> and fusion of posterior elements , carpal and/or tarsal coalition , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lordosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes planus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dental enamel hypoplasia <END> , decreased range of motion or dislocation of the elbow , renal anomalies , and hearing loss .
The vertebral segmentation defects may involve noncontiguous areas of the cervical , thoracic , and lumbar spine .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Odontoid hypoplasia <END> was noted in two cases .
We report on a sporadic case of spondylocarpotarsal synostosis in a 5-year-old girl with hypoplasia of C1 and odontoid and subluxation of C2 upon C3 .
This brings the number of well-documented cases of spondylocar- potarsal synostosis to 19 , and is the first documenting cervical spine instability .
Careful evaluation for this complication should be considered in other cases .

Corticosterone methyl oxidase type II deficiency : a cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> and recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> dehydration <END> in early infancy .
Corticosterone methyl oxidase type II ( CMO II) deficiency is an uncommon cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> salt-wasting <END> in infancy .
We describe a boy who presented with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> dehydration <END> and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> in the first 3 months of life , associated with mild hyponatraemia ( serum Na+ 127-132 mEq/l ) and hyperkalaemia ( serum K+ 5.3-5 .9 mEq/l ) .
The diagnosis was suggested by an <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated plasma renin <END> activity ( PRA ) : serum aldosterone ratio , and subsequently confirmed by an elevated serum 18 -hydroxycorticosterone : aldosterone ratio .
Treatment with 9 alpha-fluorohydroxycortisone normalized growth parameters and PRA levels .
CMO II deficiency should be considered in infants with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> dehydration <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , even when serum sodium and potassium levels are not strikingly abnormal .
3q29 Microdeletion : a <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> disorder unassociated with a recognizable phenotype in two mother-daughter pairs .
The 3q29 microdeletion syndrome (del 3q29) is a novel genomic disorder identified after the introduction of microarray-based technology .
The phenotype of the reported patients is variable , including <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and subtle facial anomalies .
We report on two mother-daughter pairs , heterozygous for 3q29 , and review clinical features of all known affected individuals .
Del 3q29 syndrome is associated with nonspecific clinical features , including mild-to-moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and mild facial dysmorphisms such as <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> .
Facial anomalies were nonoverlapping and nondistinct , also within each mother-daughter pair .
Parental transmission of del 3q29 could be more frequent than previously considered .
Malformations are rare , occurring only in single subjects .
The phenotypic diversity of affected patients and the lack of distinct dysmorphisms suggest that this disorder cannot be recognized on clinical ground alone .
Del 3q29 should be searched in subjects with unexplained mild/moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and minor nonspecific facial anomalies .

Clinical variability in KBG syndrome : report of three unrelated families .
The KBG syndrome is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrodontia <END> , a specific combination of minor anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We reported on four patients from three unrelated families .
The most frequent clinical findings were : atypical face , long/flat philtrum , thin upper lip , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrodontia <END> , dental malposition , enamel hypoplasia , and cleft teeth .
Skeletal anomalies such as <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical ribs <END> and vertebral abnormalities were also noted .
Hand anomalies were observed in three patients .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> were present in three of the four patients .
There is wide clinical variability in the expression of this syndrome .
The males are usually more severely affected then the females , suggesting possible X-linked inheritance in some cases .
Two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> , peculiar facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , short stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> , retentio testis , and normal intelligence : a new type of <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> ?
We report on two brothers , a 22-month-old boy and a 7-month-old boy , with multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> ( DA) , peculiar facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , short stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> , retentio testis , and normal intelligence and karyotypes .
The parents were cousins once removed .
The combination of the clinical manifestations in the patients and the lack of involvement in their parents are incompatible with any known types of DA , and suggest a new type of DA .
The parental consanguinity in the family suggests that the disorder is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition , although X-linked inheritance is not ruled out .

Familial congenital pulmonary lymphangectasia , non-immune <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops fetalis <END> , facial and lower limb lymphedema : confirmation of Njolstad 's report .
We report on four cases , three familial and one sporadic , with congenital pulmonary lymphangectasia and facial and lower limb lymphedema .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hydrops fetalis <END> was observed in three cases and death occurred in one of those .
This is the third report describing inherited pulmonary lymphangectasia with a clinical phenotype very similar to that described by Njolstad et al . [ 1998 : Eur J Pediatr 15 7 : 498-501] , who reported three sibs with non-immune <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops fetalis <END> ( NIHF) , <START:PHENOTYPE> chylothorax <END> , pulmonary lymphangectasia , distal lymphedema , and swelling of the face .
We think that the present report and that of Njolstad et al . describe a new condition very similar to Hennekam syndrome , which is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> , intestinal lymphangiectasia , lymphedema of the lower limbs and facial anomalies ( <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , flat , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , lymphedema , tooth anomalies , and ear defects ) .
Similarity with our cases and Hennekam syndrome will be discussed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperornithinemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperammonemia <END> , and homocitrullinuria associated with decreased carbamyl phosphate synthetase I activity .
Six subjects from three sibships with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperornithinemia <END> , homocitrullinuria , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperammonemia <END> are described .
Assays of liver biopsy in one showed decreased CPS I and leukocyte assays indicate a similar defect in all six .
Loading studies with ornithine and citrulline are consistent with a block early in the urea cycle between ornithine and citrulline .
They thus support the results of the enzymatic assays .
Similar studies with lysine and homocitrulline indicate there is excessive homocitrulline biosynthesis that is related to lysine intake , but there is no evidence of a block in the main lysine catabolic pathway .
The younger more severely affected patients require protein restriction to 1.2 and 1.5 g/kg/24 hr to control <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperammonemia <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperornithinemia <END> remains unaffected .
Adult subjects avoid large protein meals but tolerate a diet that is almost normal .
The mode of inheritance of this disorder appears to be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
The fine structure of liver shows the presence of large and abnormally configurated mitochondria .
There is a peculiar periodic structure situated closely to the inner mitochondrial membrane , and it is possible that the presence of this may be related to the impairment of transport of ornithine into the mitochondria ; this in turn may give rise to <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperornithinemia <END> .
This disorder adds to the metabolic errors that suggest that there are close links of lysine metabolism to the urea cycle but the details are yet to be defined .
Genetics of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndromes starting in the first year of life .
Incidence rates of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in children are highest during the first year of life .
Most frequently , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> results from a metabolic or structural defect in the brain .
However , some infants have clearly delineated <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndromes for which no underlying etiology can be identified except for a genetic predisposition .
We reviewed the current knowledge on the genetics of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndromes starting in the first year of life .
We focus on those <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndromes without a clear structural or metabolic etiology .
Recent molecular studies have led to the identification of the responsible gene defects for several of the monogenetic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndromes with onset in the first year of life .
This knowledge has consequences for clinical practice as it opens new perspectives for genetic testing , improving early diagnosis , and facilitating genetic counseling .
This overview of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndromes and associated gene defects might serve as a basis for the selection of patients in whom genetic testing can be helpful .
Kabuki make-up ( Niikawa-Kuroki ) syndrome : a study of 62 patients .
These 62 patients with the Kabuki make-up syndrome ( KMS ) were collected in a collaborative study among 33 institutions and analyzed clinically , cytogenetically , and epidemiologically to delineate the phenotypic spectrum of KMS and to learn about its cause .
Among various manifestations observed , most patients had the following five cardinal manifestations : 1 ) a peculiar face (100% ) characterized by eversion of the lower lateral eyelid ; <START:PHENOTYPE> arched eyebrows <END> , with sparse or dispersed lateral one-third ; a <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal tip <END> ; and prominent ears ; 2 ) skeletal anomalies (92%) , including brachydactyly V and a deformed spinal column , with or without sagittal cleft vertebrae ; 3 ) dermatoglyphic abnormalities ( 93% ) , including increased digital ulnar loop and hypothenar loop patterns , absence of the digital triradius c and/or d , and presence of fingertip pads ; 4 ) mild to moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> (92%) ; and 5 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth deficiency <END> ( 83% ) .
Thus the core of the phenotypic spectrum of KMS is rather narrow and clearly defined .
Many other inconsistent anomalies were observed .
Important among them were early breast development in infant girls ( 23% ) , and congenital heart defects ( 31% ) , such as a single ventricle with a common atrium , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> , tetralogy of Fallot , <START:PHENOTYPE> coarctation of aorta <END> , patent ductus arteriosus , aneurysm of aorta , transposition of great vessels , and right bundle branch block .
Of the 62 KMS patients , 58 were Japanese , an indication that the syndrome is fairly common in Japan .
It was estimated that its prevalence in Japanese newborn infants is 1/32,000 .
All the KMS cases in this study were sporadic , the sex ratio was even , there was no correlation with birth order , the consanguinity rate among the parents was not high , and no incriminated agent was found that was taken by the mothers during early pregnancy .
Three of the 62 patients had a Y chromosome abnormality involving a possible common breakpoint ( Yp11 .2 ) .
This could indicate another possibility , i.e. , that the KMS gene is on Yp11 .2 and that the disease is pseudoautosomal dominant .
These findings are compatible with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder in which every patient represents a fresh mutation .
The mutation rate was calculated at 15 .6 X 10(6 ) .
A locus for an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> at chromosome 1q21 .
Linkage studies were performed in a large family with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> phenotype characterized by nephropathy and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
In this family of Iraqi Jewish origin , the nephropathy develops into progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> .
By performing a genomewide linkage search , we localized the disease gene to chromosome 1q21 ; the highest LOD score was obtained for the marker at locus D1S305 , which yielded a maximum LOD score of 4.71 at a recombination fraction of 0 . Recombination mapping defined an interval of approximately 11 .6 cM , between the markers at loci D1S2696 and D1S2635 , that contains the disease gene .
Localization of the disease-causing gene in this family represents a necessary step toward isolation of the defective gene and toward a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertrichosis <END> cubiti ( hairy elbows ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> : a recognisable association .
We report four patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> cubiti who were referred for investigation of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
Two males , whose height was on and just below the 3rd centile respectively , were sporadic cases and two females with disproportionate <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> were mother and daughter .
Radiological changes present in the familial cases were non-specific and biochemical investigations were normal .
Of the four other published cases , two were sporadic and of normal height .
The other two were sibs with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and their parents were heterozygous for the Weill-Marchesani syndrome .
We were unable to ascertain whether <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> cubiti cosegregates with the same type of skeletal dysplasia or elucidate the type of genetic transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> cubiti alone .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , and hypogonadism in sibs : Martsolf 's syndrome .
The association of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , and hypogonadism is described in sibs ( brother and sister ) of consanguineous parents .
These features are consistent with a diagnosis of Martsolf 's syndrome .
In addition , one sib had a <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> while the other had <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac failure <END> .
Multiple acyl-Co A dehydrogenation deficiency ( MADD ) in a boy with nonketotic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle hypotonia <END> and cardiomyopathy.
Detection of N-isovalerylglutamic acid and its monoamide .
A boy , aged 7 months , of consanguineous parents presented with an acute onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , fever , nonketotic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> and acidosis and died from cardiac arrest after ventricular fibrillation .
He had <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> and echocardiographically a non-obstructive cardiomyopathy.
Autopsy was not allowed .
After birth the child had suffered from a severe <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory distress <END> syndrome , transient metabolic acidosis and had a sweaty feet odour .
Later on , development was retarded with a severe <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> .
Post mortem , numerous unusual organic acids were found in high concentrations in urine , e.g . dicarbonic acids , 2-hydroxyisobutyric , isovaleric , 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid , N-acyl glycines , isovalerylglutamic acid and sarcosine .
This pattern indicated deficiencies of several acyl-Co A dehydrogenases in the metabolism of leucine , isoleucine , valine , lysine , short-chain fatty acids and sarcosine .
This could be confirmed using cultured skin fibroblasts which were shown to degrade the corresponding labeled substrates insufficiently to 14CO2 .
It is assumed that the functional multiple acyl-Co A dehydrogenation deficiency is caused by a deficiency of a common link in the electron transfer system of these dehydrogenases which is inherited autosomal recessively in this family .
Among the 12 patients reported , 7 died within the first 5 days of age .
High incidence of progressive postnatal cerebellar enlargement in Costello syndrome : brain <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> associated with HRAS mutations as the likely cause of structural brain and spinal cord abnormalities .
Costello syndrome is a rasopathy caused by germline mutations in the proto-oncogene HRAS .
Its presentation includes failure-to-thrive with <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , characteristic facial features , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> , papillomata , malignant tumors , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> .
In a systematic review we found absolute or relative <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> (100% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventriculomegaly <END> (5 0% ) , and other abnormalities on brain and spinal cord imaging studies in 27/28 individuals .
Posterior fossa crowding with cerebellar tonsillar herniation ( CBTH ) was noted in 27/28 ( 96% ) , and in 10/17 ( 59% ) with serial studies posterior fossa crowding progressed .
Sequelae of posterior fossa crowding and CBTH included <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> requiring shunt or ventriculostomy ( 25% ) , Chiari 1 malformation (32%) , and syrinx formation ( 25% ) .
Our data reveal <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> with progressive frontal bossing and CBTH , documenting an ongoing process rather than a static congenital anomaly .
Comparison of images obtained in young infants to subsequent studies demonstrated postnatal development of posterior fossa crowding .
This process of evolving megalencephaly and cerebellar enlargement is in keeping with mouse model data , delineating abnormal genesis of neurons and glia , resulting in an increased number of astrocytes and enlarged brain volume .
In Costello syndrome and macrocephaly-capillary malformation syndrome disproportionate brain growth is the main factor resulting in postnatal CBTH and Chiari 1 malformation . Copyright 2010 Wiley-Liss , Inc .
A syndrome of severe midface retraction , multiple skull anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfeet <END> , and cardiac and renal malformations in sibs .
A brother and sister presented with an uncommon malformation syndrome consisting of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfeet <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , hypoplasia of dermal ridges , and radiographic skeletal anomalies in the skull , hands and feet .
The boy died shortly after birth ; the girl lived for 16 months and exhibited severe <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , diminished growth , and profound motor and intellectual retardation .
Additional observations include postaxial hexadactyly in the girl , and mesomelic brachymelia and peculiar , narrow fingernails in the boy .
The occurrence of the syndrome in two sibs of different sex suggests autosomal-recessive inheritance .
The new mutation , E46K , of alpha-synuclein causes Parkinson and Lewy body <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> with cortical and subcortical Lewy bodies is uncommon , and no genetic defect has been reported in the previously described sibships .
We present a Spanish family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> visual hallucinations <END> of variable severity .
The postmortem examination showed atrophy of the substantia nigra , lack of Alzheimer pathology , and numerous Lewy bodies which were immunoreactive to alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin in cortical and subcortical areas .
Sequencing of the alpha-synuclein gene showed a novel , nonconservative E46K mutation in heterozygosis .
The E46K mutation was present in all affected family members and in three young asymptomatic subjects , but it was absent in healthy and pathological controls .
The novel mutation , that substitutes a dicarboxylic amino acid , glutamic acid , with a basic amino acid such as lysine in a much conserved area of the protein , is likely to produce severe disturbance of protein function .
Our data show that , in addition to the previously described hereditary alpha-synucleinopathies , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> with Lewy bodies is related to mutation of alpha-synuclein .
" Mowat-Wilson " syndrome with and without <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> is a distinct , recognizable multiple congenital anomalies-mental retardation syndrome caused by mutations in the zinc finger homeo box 1B gene .
Recently mutations in the gene ZFHX1B ( SIP1 ) were shown in patients with "syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> " with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MR ) and multiple congenital anomalies ( MCA) , but it was unclear if <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> is an obligate symptom of these mutations and if the distinct facial phenotype delineated by Mowat et al . [ 1998 : J Med Genet 35 : 617-623] is specific for ZFHX1B mutations .
In order to address these open questions we analyzed the ZFHX1B gene in five patients , three of whom had "syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> " two with and one without the facial phenotype described by Mowat et al . [ 1998 ] , and two of whom had the distinct facial gestalt without <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> . Analyses of microsatellite markers and newly identified SNPs , and/or FISH with BACs from the ZFHX1B region excluded large deletions in all five patients .
Direct sequencing demonstrated truncating ZFHX1B mutations in all four patients with the characteristic facial phenotype , but not in the patient with syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> without the distinct facial appearance .
We demonstrate that there is a specific clinical entity with a recognizable facial gestalt , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and variable MCAs which we propose be called the " Mowat-Wilson syndrome. "
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia <END> Omani type : a new recessive type of SED with progressive spinal involvement .
We report a large inbred kindred from Oman with a distinct type of <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia <END> ( SED ) .
We evaluated eight individuals from two consanguineous sibships , one male and seven females between the ages of 2 and 22 .
The pedigrees strongly suggest <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> and both families are likely to be related through distant consanguineous loops .
The clinical features include near to normal length at birth , short stature with final height of 11 0-130 cm , shortening of the upper segment due to severe progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , severe arthritic changes with joint dislocations , rhizomelic limbs , <START:PHENOTYPE> genu valgum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cubitus valgus <END> , mild brachydactyly , camptodactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> microdontia <END> , and normal intelligence .
Minor radiographic metaphyseal changes were found , but major manifestations were in the spine and the epiphyses .
During the first year of life the vertebral bodies are of normal height but the endplates are irregular and intervertebral space is narrow .
With age , the vertebral endplates become increasingly irregular , the intervertebral space diminishes further and individual vertebrae start to fuse resulting in a severe short trunk dwarfism with <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> .
The epiphysis are small and precocious osteoarthropathy was observed involving small and large joints .
The elbow , wrist , and hip joints were affected starting in infancy and showed restricted movement .
Osteoarthropathy and spinal involvement resulted in physical handicap in early adulthood .
Comparison of these patients with other skeletal dysplasias suggests that they represent a previously undescribed variant of SED . Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss , Inc .
Prospective analysis and classification of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> identified in a newborn screening program .
Patients who inherit mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> genes excrete high concentrations of cystine , ornithine , arginine , and lysine in the urine .
At least three variants of <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> can be distinguished in heterozygotes .
To determine whether certain combinations of mutant genes are more disadvantageous than others , we analyzed amino acid excretion in families of 17 probands with <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> identified by the Quebec neonatal screening program .
Parents of the probands were classified into the three known phenotypes by calculating the sum of cystine , ornithine , arginine , and lysine excretion .
Although parents of type I/I homozygotes excreted amounts of cystine in the normal range , their offspring excreted significantly greater amounts of urinary cystine than did children who have type I/III genetic compounds .
This observation suggests that types I and III <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> mutations might involve two distinct genetic loci .
Children with type I/I homozygous <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> often excrete cystine at levels greater than the theoretic solubility limit and may be at greatest risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> .
We outline an approach to monitoring children with <START:PHENOTYPE> cystinuria <END> who come to medical attention before formation of cystine stones .
Familial Mediterranean fever in Arab children : the high prevalence and gene frequency .
Over a period of 3 years , 192 children with familial Mediterranean fever were prospectively studied .
Of these , 106 (55% ) were girls and 86 ( 45% ) were boys .
The prevalence was 1:260 0 children with a gene frequency of 1:5 0 .
The age at onset ranged between 4 months and 16 years .
Of these patients 24% started their illness below the age of 2 years and 88 % were symptomatic before the age of 10 years : 82 % had recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> , 43 % had <START:PHENOTYPE> pleurisy <END> , 37% had <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , 15 % had cutaneous manifestations , 12 % had <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> and 4% had <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> .
The presenting symptoms were <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> in 51 % , unilateral chest pain in 23% and <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> in 26% .
The family history was positive in 62 % .
Of 12 affected families 19 members had/have <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> and amyloidosis was confirmed in 7 patients .
Conclusions : Our data show a high prevalence of familial Mediterranean fever and a high gene frequency in Arab children similar to that reported in Jews and Americans .
The clinical spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma <END> and lamellar ichthyosis .
Until about 20 years ago , the term lamellar ichthyosis ( LI ) represented all nonbullous <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ichthyoses except for harlequin ichthyosis and ichthyosis syndromes .
Since the 198 0s , nonbullous <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ichthyoses have been divided into two major clinical entities , <START:PHENOTYPE> nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma <END> ( NBCIE) and LI .
The nature of scaling and intensity of <START:PHENOTYPE> erythroderma <END> are important clinical features that distinguish between NBCIE and LI . However , a considerable number of cases show an intermediate phenotype between the two classic clinical features .
Histologically , <START:PHENOTYPE> parakeratosis <END> and inflammatory cell infiltration are seen more frequently in NBCIE than in LI and the stratum corneum is usually thicker in LI than in NBCIE.
However , neither histopathological findings nor ultrastructural features seem to help clearly distinguish between NBCIE and LI . Mutations in any of the three known causative genes , TG M1 , ALOXE3 or ALOX12B , can lead either to NBCIE or LI . Candidate genes specific to either NBCIE or LI alone have not been identified .
Based on these facts , it might be better to consider NBCIE and LI as variations of a single keratinization disorder , although the classification of these <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital ichthyosis <END> patients into NBCIE or LI depending on their clinical features is still useful for practical patient management .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , eye anomalies , and cleft lip/palate .
The syndrome : We describe 3 Brazilian brothers presenting a cluster of signs strongly suggesting a " new " MCA/MR syndrome .
The main clinical signs include <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , microbrachycephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , palpebral <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma of iris <END> and retina , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , and cleft lip/palate .
This is either an autosomal or X-linked recessive trait .
Mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene are associated with recurrent acute and chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
We recently identified a single R117H mutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene in several kindreds with an inherited form of acute and chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> ( HP1 ) , providing strong evidence that trypsin plays a central role in premature zymogen activation and <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
However , not all families studied have this mutation .
The aim of this study was to determine the disease-causing mutation in kindreds with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> that lack the previously identified mutation .
Clinical features of the HP1 kindreds were compared with those of the new kindreds ( HP2) , and genetic linkage analysis , screening for mutations through DNA sequencing , and screening an unaffected population were performed .
The onset of symptoms was delayed and hospitalizations were fewer in HP2 compared with HP1 ( P < 0.05 ) .
Linkage of the disease gene to chromosome 7q35 was established ( logarithm of the odds , 3.73 ) .
Mutational screening identified a single A to T mutation resulting in an asparagine to isoleucine transition mutation at position 21 ( N21I ) in cationic trypsinogen .
The mutation was absent in 94 unrelated individuals , representing 188 unique chromosomes .
The identification of a second mutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene ( HP2 ) suggests a dominant role of trypsin in premature protease activation-mediated forms of acute <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
The pathogenesis of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> also suggests that chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> may result from recurrent acute <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .

At least 22 members of a large kindred have a <START:PHENOTYPE> bleeding tendency <END> resulting from an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder of platelet production and function .
Phenotypic manifestations include mild to moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , bleeding time prolongation , and <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal platelet aggregation <END> .
Platelet survival time is normal .
The platelet disorder in this family appears to differ from known hereditary thrombocytopenic or thrombocytopathic syndromes and may represent a new genetic disease .
Six family members reportedly developed hematologic neoplasms : <START:PHENOTYPE> acute monocytic leukemia <END> nine years after treatment for congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> ; lymphosarcoma at age 10 years ; myeloid leukemia at age 23 years ; <START:PHENOTYPE> acute myelocytic leukemia <END> at age 62 years ; leukemia of unknown type at age 48 years ; and lymphocytic <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> at age 52 years .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Frontotemporal dementia <END> in a Brazilian kindred with the c9orf72 mutation .
To describe the clinical features of a Brazilian kindred with C9orf72 frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and compare them with other described families with C9orf72 and frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-causing mutations .
Report of a kindred .
Dementia center at a university hospital .
One kindred encompassing 3 generations .
The presence of a hexanucleotide ( GGGGCC ) expansion in C9orf72 was confirmed by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot .
The observed phenotypes were behavioral variant <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> with dementia , with significant variability in age at onset and duration of disease .
Parkinsonian features with focal dystonia , visual <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> , and more posterior atrophy on neuroimaging than is typical for <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> were seen .
Behavioral variant <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> due to C9orf72 expansion displays some phenotypic heterogeneity and may be associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , focal dystonia , and posterior brain atrophy.
Personality changes may precede the diagnosis of dementia by many years and may be a distinguishing feature of this mutation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Renal tubular acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> : an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
This is the first known reported case of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> in the otorhinolaryngological literature .
Ten cases in six families have been reported in the pediatric literature .
Most cases manifested at birth or soon after with vomiting , dehydration , polydipsia , polyuria , hyposthenuria , and failure to thrive .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Renal tubular acidosis <END> is a clinical syndrome of disordered acidification out of proportion to the impairment of glomerular filtration , and is associated with alkaline urine .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Sensorineural deafness <END> is variable and , in most cases , present in early childhood .
Evidence for complex nuclear inheritance in a pedigree with nonsyndromic deafness due to a homoplasmic <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutation .
The relationship between <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genotype and clinical phenotype is complicated in most instances by the heteroplasmic nature of pathogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutations .
We have previously shown that maternally inherited hearing loss in a large Arab-Israeli kindred is due to the homoplasmic A1555G mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> 12S ribosomal RNA gene [ Prezant et al. , 1993 : Nat Genet 4:289-294 ] .
Family members with this mutation have phenotypes ranging from profound hearing loss to completely normal hearing , and we have shown that there is genetic and biochemical evidence for nuclear gene involvement in this family [ Bu et al. , 1993 : Genet Epidemiol 9:27-44 ; Guan et al. , 1996 : Hum Mol Genet 5 :963-971 ] .
To identify such a nuclear locus , two candidate genes were excluded through linkage analysis and sequencing , and a genome-wide linkage search in family members who all have the identical homoplasmic <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutation , but differ in their hearing status , was performed .
In two stages a total of 560 polymorphic genetic markers was genotyped , and the data were analyzed under model-dependent and model-free assumptions .
No chromosomal region was identified as a major contributor to the phenotypic expression of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutation .
Thus , in this simplified paradigm of a homoplasmic <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutation in a single kindred who all live in the similar environment of a small village , the penetrance of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutation appears to depend on the interaction of multiple nuclear genes .
Familial defective apolipoprotein B-10 0 : a single mutation that causes <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> and premature <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> .
Familial defective apolipoprotein B-10 0 is a recently identified , dominantly inherited genetic disorder caused by a G to A mutation in exon 26 of the apolipoprotein B gene .
This creates a substitution of glutamine for arginine in the codon for amino acid 3500 and results in reduced affinity of low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) to the LDL receptor .
We have integrated already published data with hitherto unpublished data from 8 countries and a total of 135 affected individuals from 56 families , in an attempt to focus on the range of expression of this mutation on lipid and lipoprotein levels and on <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> .
The frequency of this mutation may be as high as 1 in 500 to 1 in 700 in Europe and in North America .
The vast majority of affected heterozygotes have total and LDL cholesterol levels well above the 95th centile for age and gender ; in contrast , high density lipoprotein cholesterol , very low density lipoprotein cholesterol and plasma triglycerides are not affected by the mutation .
The risk of premature <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> in the carriers of the mutation is increased to levels as high as those seen in patients with clinical familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> ; at age 50 , about 40% of males and 20% of females heterozygous for the mutation have developed <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> .
Familial defective apolipoprotein B-10 0 is thus a significant cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> and premature <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> in Western societies .
Transient neonatal hyperkalemia in the antenatal ( ROMK defective ) Bartter syndrome .
Identification of neonatal hyperkalemia as a complication of Bartter syndrome ( BS) , a disorder usually characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis <END> .
Study design Case-series description of a group of 12 infants with mutations in the renal potassium channel ROMK , causing one of the antenatal variants of BS . Prematurity , postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> polyuria <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dehydration <END> were seen in all cases .
Plasma potassium was as high as 9. 0 +/- 1.2 mmol/L and sodium as low as 124 +/- 3.5 mmol/L , appearing usually at day 3 of life and normalizing by the end of the first postnatal week .
No hyperkalemia was found in 12 neonates with the variant of BS and deafness .
The mean plasma potassium level during the first week of life among a group of very low-birth-weight infants with similar relative azotemia was 4.9 +/- 1 mmol/L ( P <.001 ) .
The postneonatal period in the ROMK-defective children with BS was characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , and minimal-to-no <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemia <END> .
Early postnatal hyperkalemia , sometimes severe , may complicate antenatal BS associated with ROMK mutations .
Its association with hyponatremia and hyperreninemic <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperaldosteronism <END> may erroneously suggest the diagnosis of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 .
The expression of ROMK in both the thick ascending limb and cortical collecting duct may explain this apparently tubular maturation phenomenon .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> cubitus valgus <END> with mental retardation and typical face .
In 1973 , Jones and Smith described two maternal male first cousins with a similar pattern of malformation , including mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> cubitus valgus <END> , and unusual facies .
The purpose of this report is to describe three additional cases , a 10-year-old male and his 30-year-old maternal uncle and an unrelated 15 -year-old boy , bringing to five the total number of individuals with this disorder .
The principal features include <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate mental retardation <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , deep-set , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , multiple nevi , and striking <START:PHENOTYPE> cubitus valgus <END> .
Documentation of this disorder in two maternal male first cousins as well as in a male and his maternal uncle support an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> mode of inheritance for this condition .

Genetic and physical mapping of the progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( EPMR ) locus on chromosome 8p . Progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( EPMR ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder discovered recently from an isolated region in Finland .
The disorder is characterized by normal early development , <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized tonic-clonic seizures <END> with onset at 5-1 0 years of age , and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> beginning 2-5 years after the onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
We recently mapped the EPMR locus to a 7- cM region on chromosome 8p between markers AFM185xb2 and D8S262 .
A recombination detected with a new microsatellite marker AFMa054td9 narrows the region to 4 cM .
A yeast artificial chromosome ( YAC ) contig containing 22 YACs was constructed across the disease gene region .
The YAC contig is characterized by a collection of 19 YAC-end sequence-tag sites together with seven microsatellite markers .
The entire YAC contig spans a minimum of 3 Mb . Moreover , the distal end of the contig contains a subtelomeric YAC yRM2205 that anchors the contig to the telomere .
Construction of a YAC contig across the disease gene region is an essential step toward the isolation of the EPMR gene .
Progressive neuronal degeneration of childhood with liver disease ( Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome ) : a personal review .
Thirty-two autopsied cases of progressive neuronal degeneration of childhood with liver disease are reviewed .
The typical clinical course is intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> liver failure <END> following a period of <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> in early infancy , but some children first present with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Characteristic changes on the electroencephalogram , loss of visual-evoked potentials , occipital atrophy on computed tomographic scan , and particular changes on liver biopsy may assist diagnosis .
Most patients succumb in less than 3 years , but some have a protracted survival into their teens , and very rarely they may present in early adulthood .
Liver pathology comprises fatty change , hepatocyte loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> bile duct proliferation <END> , fibrosis , and often cirrhosis .
Gradual progression can be followed in sequential biopsies .
Macroscopically , the cerebral cortex is variably involved , but usually there is patchy thinning and discoloration , with a striking predilection for the striate cortex .
Microscopic changes include spongiosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> astrocytosis <END> , which progresses down through the cortical layers .
All areas may be affected but the calcarine cortex is usually most affected .
Etiology is still obscure , though mitochondrial and slow viral disorders have been postulated .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Diabetes mellitus <END> , thiamine-dependent megaloblastic anemia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> associated with deficient alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity .
Three brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> are reported .
Two had , in addition , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital septal defects <END> .
The activities of thiamine-dependent enzymes were determined in one patient , revealing low alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity , which could have caused a <START:PHENOTYPE> sideroblastic anemia <END> with secondary megaloblastic changes .
The anemia was thiamine dependent .
The cause of the <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> was not known , but it was not type 1 .
Early-onset benign <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> limb-girdle <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> with contractures ( Bethlem <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> ) .
We report a large French-Canadian kindred with 33 affected members in six generations showing early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> limb-girdle <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> and contractures .
This <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> is unique because of its benign course , with many members only minimally impaired even in old age .
Examination of affected members revealed mild to moderate proximal weakness and wasting .
Contractures were observed at the elbows and ankles in all , while in some they were more widespread .
Serum CK was either normal or slightly raised , and electrodiagnostic studies suggested a primary myopathy.
Muscle biopsy revealed nonspecific features of a <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> without fiber necrosis or regeneration .
Cardiac involvement was absent clinically in all patients and at autopsy in two affected individuals .
The similarities between four previously reported families and our own establishes this <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> as a distinct clinicogenetic entity , for which we propose the name " Bethlem myopathy. "
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> renal hypophosphatemia <END> , minor facial anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> intracerebral calcifications <END> , and non-rachitic bone changes : apparently new syndrome ?
We report on two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal hypophosphatemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> intracerebral calcifications <END> , minor facial anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short distal phalanges <END> .
The children presented with recurrent dental abscesses ; one had premature closure of the anterior fontanelle .
Biochemical findings included hypophosphatemia and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase with normocalcemia .
Blood levels of parathyroid hormone , 1 ,25( OH)2 and 25( OH ) vitamin D levels were normal; TRP ( the fractional tubular reabsorption of PO4 ) and Tm P/GFR ( the tubular maximum rate of PO4 reabsorption in relation to GFR ) were low .
Both parents had a normal serum phosphate and brain CT scan without evidence of calcifications .
This apparently new syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> renal hypophosphatemia <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> intracerebral calcifications <END> appears to be inherited as either an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> or an X-linked trait .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic ataxia <END> of Charlevoix-Saguenay .
A new syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic ataxia <END> has been isolated in the Charlevoix-Saguenay region of Quebec .
This syndrome is remarkably homogeneous and includes : <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> distal muscle wasting <END> , foot deformities , truncal ataxia , absence of sensory evoked potentials in the lower limbs , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal striation <END> reminiscent of early Leber 's atrophy and the frequent presence ( 57% ) of a prolapse of the mitral valve .
Biochemically , many cases show impaired pyruvate oxidation , others have hyperbilirubinaemia and some have low serum beta-lipoproteins and HDL apoproteins .
These features are similar to those found in typical Friedreich 's ataxia .
A 1-Mb critical region in six patients with 9q34.3 terminal deletion syndrome .
Patients with 9q34.3 terminal deletion usually show a clinically recognizable phenotype characterized by specific facial features ( <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arched eyebrows <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nostrils <END> , carp mouth and <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding tongue <END> ) in combination with <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , hypotonia , and other anomalies .
We analyzed six unrelated patients with a various 9q34.3 terminal deletion .
While having different-sized 9q34.3 deletions , all of these patients shared several distinctive anomalies .
These anomalies are likely to arise from a commonly deleted region at distal 9q34.3 .
Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) analysis using a dozen BAC clones mapped at the 9q34.13-q34.3 region defined the shortest region of deletion overlap ( SRO ) as a 1-Mb segment proximal to 9qter containing eight known genes .
Possible candidate genes delineating specific phenotypes of the 9q34.3 terminal deletion syndrome are discussed .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidemia <END> , a De Toni-Fanconi-DebrÃ© syndrome , and a defective respiratory chain in voluntary striated muscles .
A patient suffering froma <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy leading to severe insufficiency of the voluntary muscles is described .
Severe cerebral damage was present .
Major biochemical symptoms were extreme <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidemia <END> , hypophosphatemia and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphosphaturia <END> , and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> aminoaciduria <END> , renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> , and polyuria .
Muscular insufficiency resulted in lethal asphyxiz .
All therapeutic trials were insufficient .
The patient and two other children of the same family with a similar clinical picture all died before the 4th month of life .
The condition is probably inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> way .
A defective respiratory chain in the mitochondria of the striated muscles is proposed as the underlying mechanism .
Cytochromes aa3 were absent , b was nearly absent , but cc1 was present .
In heart muscle cytochromes aa3 and b were at the level of the controls .
Distinct craniofacial syndrome of lagophthalmia and bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate .
We report on several individuals with bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate , lagophthalmia , megaloblepharon , <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> , and ectropion of the lower eyelids , representing in total a distinct craniofacial syndrome .
Eight cases ( 3 from 1 family ) in ages ranging from 1-45 years were identified over a 7-year period in the Cleft Palate and Craniofacial Clinic at our center .
All cases ( 3 male , 5 female ) presented with bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate and lagophthalmia .
Birth weight , growth , and development were normal in all cases , except for one who probably has familial small stature .
Five of the 8 cases have <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> , and 5 have ectropion in varying degrees ; dental findings consisted of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypodontia <END> in 5 and delayed dentition in 1 patient .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypoplastic nails <END> and clinodactyly were confined to 3 members of 1 family .
Clinical evidence in these cases and a review of the literature regarding <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> and lagophthalmia , either alone or in combination with ectropion , suggest that this craniofacial syndrome is most likely an autosomal-dominant trait .
The 5 non-familial cases probably represent new mutations .
Clinical heterogeneity and prognosis in combined <START:PHENOTYPE> methylmalonic aciduria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> ( cblC ) .
The clbC form of methylmalonic acidaemia is a rare and poorly understood condition which results from impaired biosynthesis of methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin .
The consequent functional deficiencies of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase produce both <START:PHENOTYPE> methylmalonic aciduria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> .
Systemic symptoms and neurological decompensation comprise the clinical phenotype .
In an effort to clarify the phenotype and prognosis , we obtained clinical information on 50 patients with methylmalonic acidaemia whose cells had been assigned to the cblC complementation group .
We identified two distinct phenotypes ; they differed in age of onset , presence of systemic symptoms , type of neurological symptoms , and outcome after diagnosis and treatment .
Forty-four patients presented in the first year of life .
Feeding difficulties , neurological dysfunction ( hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> ) , and ophthalmological and haematological abnormalities characterized their clinical picture .
About one-quarter of those patients died .
Survival was associated with neurological impairment ; only one infant was neurologically intact at follow-up .
Onset in childhood , in contrast , was associated with less severe haematological abnormalities , largely involving the red cell series .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Extrapyramidal signs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , delirium or psychosis characterized the neurological findings .
Survival , with mild to moderate disability in some , was typical in patients with later onset .
Treatment in both groups included hydroxycobalamin , betaine and carnitine ; complete normalization of biochemical parameters was rare .
Two craniosynostotic patients with 11q deletions , and review of 48 cases .
Many chromosomal abnormalities have craniofacial manifestations .
One such abnormality , partial monosomy of chromosome 11q , is associated with metopic synostosis and resultant <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> .
We reviewed 48 published cases of 11q deletions and translocations .
Eighty percent were associated with abnormal head shape .
Also commonly found were <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> of the eyelids , wide or <START:PHENOTYPE> low nasal bridge <END> , apparently low-set malformed ears , down-turned mouth , micro/ retrognathia , digital and cardiac anomalies , and psychomotor retardation .
We report on two patients referred for abnormal head shape .
The first case had brachycephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat occiput <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and maxillary hypoplasia .
Karyotype was 46 , XY,del( 11 ) (q24.1-->qter ) .
The second patient had <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> , hypotelorism , posteriorly angulated ears , horizontal crease below his lower lip , syndactyly , shawl scrotum , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and inguinal hernias .
Karyotype showed partial trisomy of chromosome 4q as well as partial monosomy of 11q [46 , XY ,11 , +der( 11 ) t(4 ;11 ) ( q31 .3;q25) ] , a combination not previously reported .
Deletions of 11q appear to produce a wide spectrum of abnormalities .
Dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> , dystaxia , and myopathy.
A new syndrome .
Twenty-three members of a 96-member family exhibited an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder which has not previously been described .
This disorder involves progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , abnormal electroretinography without retinal pigment changes , and progressive sensorineural hearing loss usually evident in the first or second decade of life .
In midlife , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> , dystaxia , and a nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> occur .
Secondary acute myelogenous <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> : is chemotherapy a factor ?
To describe a series of patients with secondary acute myelogenous <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> ( sAML ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( RB ) .
Retrospective observational cases series .
Ocular and pediatric oncologists at referral centers in Europe and the Americas and the RB databases at the National Institutes of Health and the Ophthalmic Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center . Physician survey , retrospective database review , and literature search .
History of RB and development of sAML , management of RB ( surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy) , age at diagnosis of RB and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> , French-American-British ( FAB ) subtype , and current status of patient ( alive or dead ) .
Fifteen patients with sAML were identified ; 13 occurred in childhood .
Mean latent period from RB to AML diagnosis was 9.8 years ( median , 42 months ) .
Nine cases were of the M2 or M5 FAB subtypes .
Twelve patients ( 79 % ) had received chemotherapy with a topoisomerase II inhibitor , 8 ( 43% ) had received chemotherapy with an epipodophyllotoxin .
Ten children died of their <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> .
Acute myelogenous <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> is a rare secondary malignancy among <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> patients , many of whom were treated with primary or adjuvant chemotherapy .
Additional studies are needed to assess potential risk factors contributing to sAML development in this cohort .
AHI1 mutations cause both <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> and renal cystic disease in Joubert syndrome .
Joubert syndrome ( JS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterised by hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , altered respiratory pattern , abnormal eye movements , and a brain malformation known as the <START:PHENOTYPE> molar tooth sign <END> ( MTS ) on cranial MRI .
Four genetic loci have been mapped , with two genes identified ( AHI1 and NPHP1 ) .
We screened a cohort of 117 JS subjects for AHI1 mutations by a combination of haplotype analysis and sequencing of the gene , and for the homozygous NPHP1 deletion by sequencing and marker analysis .
We identified a total of 15 novel AHI1 mutations in 13 families , including nonsense , missense , splice site , and insertion mutations , with some clustering in the WD40 domains .
Eight families were consanguineous , but no single founder mutation was apparent .
In addition to the MTS , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> was present in 11 of 12 informative families ; however , no subjects exhibited variable features of JS such as polydactyly , encephalocele , colobomas , or liver fibrosis .
In contrast to previous reports , we identified two families with affected siblings who developed renal disease consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> ( NPH ) in their 20s .
In addition , two individuals with classic NPH were found to have homozygous NPHP1 deletions .
Overall , 11 % of subjects had AHI1 mutations , while approximately 2% had the NPHP1 deletion , representing a total of less than 15 % in a large JS cohort .
Some preliminary genotype-phenotype correlations are possible , notably the association of renal impairment , specifically NPH , in those with NPHP1 deletions .
Subjects with AHI1 mutations may be at risk of developing both <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> and progressive kidney disease .
Familial hemiplegic migraine with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> and paroxysmal <START:PHENOTYPE> psychosis <END> .
Familial hemiplegic migraine is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder associated with stereotypic neurologic aura phenomena including <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiparesis <END> .
So far two chromosomal loci have been identified .
Families linked to the chromosome 19 locus display missense mutations within the CACNL1A4 gene .
Here we report on a family with familial hemiplegic migraine and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> with recurrent episodes of acute paranoid <START:PHENOTYPE> psychosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> visual hallucinations <END> associated with migraine attacks .
Based on the clinical and haplotype evidence indicating linkage to chromosome 19 in this family , we hypothesize that a dysfunction of the mutated calcium channel may be involved not only in the development of hemiplegic migraine but also in the acute psychotic episodes observed in these patients .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal dysplasia <END> : confirmation of the Gurrieri syndrome .
We report on a male with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal dysplasia <END> .
The syndrome was first delineated by Gurrieri et al . in 1992 [Am J Med Genet 44:315-320] .
This case seems to confirm the existence of the Gurrieri syndrome .
Mitral and <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic regurgitation <END> in 84 patients with mucopolysaccharidoses .
In echocardiographic and necropsy studies nodular thickening of the mitral valve and , less frequently , of the aortic valve has been found in 60%-90 % of patients with mucopolysaccharidoses ( MPS ) .
Little is known about the haemodynamic consequences of these morphological changes .
In this study 84 unselected patients with different enzymatically proven MPS and 84 age and sex matched , healthy persons were studied prospectively by colour Doppler flow mapping .
The patients ' age ranged from 1 to 47 years ( median 8 .1 years ) .
Mitral and <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic regurgitation <END> were defined as a holosystolic or holodiastolic jet originating from the valve into the left atrium or the left ventricular outflow tract , respectively , with peak velocities exceeding 2.5 m/s .
Of the 84 patients with satisfactory studies , <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral regurgitation <END> was detected in 64 .3% and <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic regurgitation <END> in 40.5% , respectively .
Regurgitation was severe in 4.8 % of mitral valves and 8.3% of aortic valves .
The frequency of aortic and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral regurgitation <END> was 75 % in all patients , 89% in MPS I , 94 % in MPS II , 66 % in MPS III , 33% in MPS IV , and 100% in MPS VI . Combined mitral and <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic regurgitation <END> was present in 29% of our patients .
None of the control persons showed mitral or <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic regurgitation <END> .
Aortic and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral regurgitation <END> are more frequent in patients with MPS than previously thought and that therefore these patients should have regular colour Doppler flow mapping and antibiotic prophylaxis when required .
Interstitial deletion of 11 ( p11 .2p12 ) : a newly described contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving the gene for hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple exostoses <END> ( EXT2 ) .
Individuals with deletions of the proximal portion of the short arm of chromosome 11 share many manifestations including <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , biparietal foramina , minor facial anomalies , and multiple cartilaginous <START:PHENOTYPE> exostoses <END> .
The finding of <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple exostoses <END> in these patients is remarkable as the disorder hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple exostoses <END> , which is inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> manner , has recently been mapped by linkage to three regions , including proximal 11p .
We report the clinical and molecular findings in an additional patient with an 11 ( p11 .2p12 ) deletion .
Cytogenetic and molecular analysis demonstrated a de novo , paternally derived deletion for markers which have been shown to be tightly linked to the 11p locus ( EXT2 ) .
These data support the location of EXT2 within this region and also provide information regarding the ordering of polymorphic markers on 11p .
Deletion 11 ( p11 .2p12 ) is a rare , yet specific , deletion syndrome involving the EXT2 locus , a gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> locus , and therefore can be classified as a contiguous gene deletion syndrome .
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome-type II: multiple congenital anomalies with <START:PHENOTYPE> male pseudohermaphroditism <END> and frequent early lethality .
In 1964 , Smith et al described a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , growth and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , unusual facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly of toes <END> 2 and 3 , and genital abnormalities .
Major structural malformations and early death have been uncommon in the many subsequent literature reports .
We report on 19 infants with a phenotype we propose to call Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome ( SLOS)-Type II , in which major structural abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> male pseudohermaphroditism <END> , and early lethality are common .
Of these 19 patients , 18 had postaxial hexadactyly , 16 had congenital heart defect , 13 had <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and 10 had <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
Unusual findings seen in these patients at autopsy included Hirschsprung " disease " in five patients , unilobated lungs in six , large adrenals in four , and pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia in three .
Comparison of our cases to 19 similar literature cases suggests the existence of a distinct phenotype that may be separate from SLOS as originally described .
It is also inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , as documented by occurrence in one pair of sibs in this study and recurrence in three reported families .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> : a new syndrome ?
Four males , the sons of 2 sisters , apparently have a new syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
Due to the relationship between the affected males we propose the inheritance to be <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> recessive although cosegregation of two separate disorders may be occurring .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Psoriasis <END> has never been reported as a monogenic disorder .
Results of cytogenetic studies , including fra ( X ) and high-resolution prometaphase analysis , were negative .
Steroid sulfatase activities of cultured fibroblasts from 2 surviving affected males were normal .
The results of HLA typing of all available relatives did not indicate a strong association between the skin disorder and certain HLA antigens .
A healthy sister , who may be heterozygous carrier of the mutant X chromosome , decided on termination of 3 successive pregnancies after prenatal male sex determinations .
Her fourth pregnancy with a female fetus is ongoing .
A Bedouin kindred with infantile nephronophthisis demonstrates linkage to chromosome 9 by homozygosity mapping .
A novel type of infantile nephronophthisis was identified in an extended Bedouin family from Israel .
This disease has an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance , with the phenotypic presentation ranging from a Potter-like syndrome to <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperechogenic kidneys <END> , renal insufficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> .
Affected individuals show rapid deterioration of kidney function , leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal failure <END> within 3 years .
Histopathologic examination of renal tissue revealed variable findings , ranging from infantile polycystic kidneys to <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis <END> , fibrosis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical microcysts <END> .
A known familial juvenile nephronophthisis locus on chromosome 2q13 and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> polycystic kidney disease on chromosome 6p21.1-p12 were excluded by genetic linkage analysis .
A genomewide screen for linkage was conducted by searching for a locus inherited by descent in all affected individuals .
Pooled DNA samples from parents and unaffected siblings and individual DNA samples from four affected individuals were used as PCR templates with trinucleotide- and tetranucleotide-repeat polymorphic markers .
Using this approach , we identified linkage to infantile nephronophthisis for markers on chromosome 9q22-31 .
The disorder maps to a 12 .9-cM region flanked by markers D9S280 and GGAT3G09 .
A common X-linked inborn error of carnitine biosynthesis may be a risk factor for nondysmorphic <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
We recently reported a deletion of exon 2 of the trimethyllysine hydroxylase epsilon ( TMLHE ) gene in a proband with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
TMLHE maps to the X chromosome and encodes the first enzyme in carnitine biosynthesis , 6- N-trimethyllysine dioxygenase .
Deletion of exon 2 of TMLHE causes enzyme deficiency , resulting in increased substrate concentration ( 6- N-trimethyllysine ) and decreased product levels ( 3-hydroxy-6- N-trimethyllysine and Î³-butyrobetaine ) in plasma and urine .
TMLHE deficiency is common in control males ( 24 in 8 ,78 7 or 1 in 366 ) and was not significantly increased in frequency in probands from simplex <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> families ( 9 in 2 ,904 or 1 in 323 ) .
However , it was 2.82-fold more frequent in probands from male-male multiplex <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> families compared with controls ( 7 in 909 or 1 in 130 ; P = 0.023 ) .
Additionally , six of seven autistic male siblings of probands in male-male multiplex families had the deletion , suggesting that TMLHE deficiency is a risk factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> ( metaanalysis Z-score = 2 .90 and P = 0.0037) , although with low penetrance ( 2-4% ) .
These data suggest that dysregulation of carnitine metabolism may be important in nondysmorphic <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> ; that abnormalities of carnitine intake , loss , transport , or synthesis may be important in a larger fraction of nondysmorphic <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> cases ; and that the carnitine pathway may provide a novel target for therapy or prevention of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Recurrent rearrangements of chromosome 1q21.1 and variable pediatric phenotypes .
Duplications and deletions in the human genome can cause disease or predispose persons to disease . Advances in technologies to detect these changes allow for the routine identification of submicroscopic imbalances in large numbers of patients .
We tested for the presence of microdeletions and microduplications at a specific region of chromosome 1q21.1 in two groups of patients with unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> , or congenital anomalies and in unaffected persons .
We identified 25 persons with a recurrent 1.35- Mb deletion within 1q21.1 from screening 5218 patients .
The microdeletions had arisen de novo in eight patients , were inherited from a mildly affected parent in three patients , were inherited from an apparently unaffected parent in six patients , and were of unknown inheritance in eight patients .
The deletion was absent in a series of 4737 control persons ( P=1 .1x10( -7) ) .
We found considerable variability in the level of phenotypic expression of the microdeletion ; phenotypes included mild-to-moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , cardiac abnormalities , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
The reciprocal duplication was enriched in nine children with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorder and other variable features ( P= 0.02 ) .
We identified three deletions and three duplications of the 1q21.1 region in an independent sample of 788 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and congenital anomalies .
We have identified recurrent molecular lesions that elude syndromic classification and whose disease manifestations must be considered in a broader context of development as opposed to being assigned to a specific disease .
Clinical diagnosis in patients with these lesions may be most readily achieved on the basis of genotype rather than phenotype .

Unstable expansion of CAG repeat in hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy ( DRPLA ) .
Hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy ( DRPLA ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> neurologic disorder characterized by variable combinations of <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
By specifically searching published brain cDNA sequences for the presence of CAG repeats we identified unstable expansion of a CAG in a gene on chromosome 12 in all the 22 DRPLA patients examined .
A good correlation between the size of the CAG repeat expansion and the ages of disease onset is found in this group .
Patients with earlier onset tended to have a phenotype of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and larger expansions .
We propose that the wide variety of clinical manifestations of DRPLA can now be explained by the variable unstable expansion of the CAG repeat .
Functional methionine synthase deficiency ( cblE and cblG ) : clinical and biochemical heterogeneity .
Functional methionine synthase deficiency is generally characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomethioninemia <END> in the absence of methylmalonic aciduria .
Patients are divided into two classes , cblE and cblG , on the basis of complementation analysis .
Presentation has usually been in the first 2 years of life , but one patient came to medical attention at age 21 years with symptoms initially diagnosed as multiple sclerosis .
Common findings among 11 patients ( 4 with cblE and 7 with cblG ) have included <START:PHENOTYPE> megaloblastic anemia <END> ( all patients ) and various neurological deficits including <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental retardation <END> (1 0 patients) , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral atrophy <END> ( 8 patients) , hypotonia ( 7 patients) , EEG abnormalities ( 6 patients) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> ( 5 patients ) .
Hypertonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> , and ataxia were less frequent .
All patients have responded to therapy with cobalamin with resolution of anemia and biochemical abnormalities ; neurological deficits resolved more slowly and in some cases incompletely .
Hydroxycobalamin has been more effective than cyanocobalamin .
Fibroblasts from patients with cblE ( 5 patients ) and cblG ( 6 patients ) all showed decreased intracellular levels of methylcobalamin ( MeCbl ) and decreased incorporation of label from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate into macromolecules , suggesting decreased activity of the MeCbl-dependent enzyme methionine synthase .
Methionine synthase specific activity in extracts of all cblE fibroblasts was normal or near-normal under standard reducing conditions ; synthase specific activity in extracts of 5 cblG patients was low but was high in a 6th patient measured in another laboratory .
Thus , there is heterogeneity among patients with functional methionine synthase deficiency both in clinical presentation and in the results of biochemical studies of cultured cells .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Megalocornea <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome : two new cases .
We report on 2 patients with the NeuhÃ¤user megalocornea-mental retardation syndrome , a recessively inherited clinical entity of relatively recent description ( McKusick 24931 ) .
A review of the few previous reported patients and our 2 patients shows that <START:PHENOTYPE> megalocornea <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> are the 2 minimal diagnostic criteria .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , neurological symptoms , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , and minor anomalies are all additional nonobligatory manifestations .
The small number of published cases may be due to the fact that the association of these two signs has often escaped attention until now .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Craniosynostosis <END> , Philadelphia type : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> sagittal craniosynostosis <END> and syndactyly of the fingers and toes .
The acrocephalosyndactyly syndromes ( ACS ) are a group of clinically similar disorders that share the manifestations of <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> and a variety of hand and foot anomalies .
Here we report on a 5-generation kindred segregating <START:PHENOTYPE> sagittal craniosynostosis <END> and syndactyly of the fingers and the toes in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> manner .
The anomalies seen in this kindred comprise a syndrome distinct from other <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> syndromes .
For this novel syndrome , we propose the name <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , Philadelphia type .
PPARG F388L , a transactivation-deficient mutant , in familial partial lipodystrophy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> familial partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> ( FPLD ) due to mutant LMNA encoding nuclear lamin A/ C is characterized by adipose tissue repartitioning together with multiple metabolic disturbances , including <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslipidemia <END> .
There is emerging evidence that some rare mutations in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPAR-gamma) , encoded by PPARG , might be associated with human lipodystrophy.
We report a three-generation Canadian kindred ascertained based upon partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> , with a normal LMNA gene sequence .
Candidate gene sequencing showed that all four affected subjects were heterozygous for a novel T- ->A mutation at PPARG nucleotide 1164 in exon 5 that predicted substitution of phenylalanine at codon 388 by leucine ( F388L ) .
The mutation was absent from normal family members and normal unrelated subjects , and altered a highly conserved residue within helix 8 of the predicted ligand-binding pocket of PPAR-gamma .
The mutant receptor had significantly decreased basal transcriptional activity and impaired stimulation by a synthetic ligand .
The germline transmission of a transactivation-deficient mutation in PPARG suggests that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> is genetically heterogeneous .
Our findings are consistent with the idea that mutant PPARG can underlie the partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> phenotype .
Ruvalcaba syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
A kinship is described in which nine individuals in four generations were affected with the Ruvalcaba syndrome including postnatal growth retardation , an oval face with a <START:PHENOTYPE> high forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> antimongoloid slant of palpebral fissures <END> , small beaked nose with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nasal alae <END> , small downturned mouth with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin vermilion borders <END> , pointed chin , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short fingers <END> and toes .
Less frequently seen were osteochondritis of the lumbar vertebral bodies , <START:PHENOTYPE> cone-shaped epiphyses <END> of the phalanges , and narrow diaphyses of the metacarpals and metatarsals .
None of the affected individuals was mentally retarded .
The propositus , a 3-year-old boy , and his mother were typically affected , while his 8-month-old sister , the 55 -year-old maternal grandfather , and his 46-year-old younger sister had several of these manifestations .
Information on the remaining four affected relatives was incomplete .
The syndrome was transmitted in a dominant fashion with variable expressivity .
There were two instances of male-to-male transmission .
This effectively ruled out X-linked inheritance .
The transmission of the syndrome in three other reported pedigrees was also compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance .
Treatment of cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor .
Six patients with cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> were treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) for 3 to 15 months .
All had a history of recurrent aphthous stomatitis , pharyngitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphadenopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , and numerous infections during periods of <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Serial blood-cell counts , findings on bone marrow examination , and signs and symptoms were evaluated before and during the daily administration of G-CSF ( 3 to 10 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day ) , either intravenously or subcutaneously .
The kinetics of labeled autologous blood neutrophils and the migration of neutrophils to skin chambers were also measured .
Recombinant human G-CSF increased the mean ( + /- SEM ) neutrophil counts from 717 +/- 171 per microliter to 9814 +/- 2198 per microliter ( P = 0.009 ) .
In five of the six patients , the cycling of blood-cell counts continued , but the length of the period decreased from 21 to 14 days .
The number of days of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> was reduced ( P = 0.002 ) .
Neutrophil turnover increased almost four-fold ( P = 0.005 ) , whereas neutrophil migration to a skin chamber was normal .
G-CSF therapy reduced the frequency of oropharyngeal inflammation , <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , and infections in these patients .
During the first 40 months of treatment , no typical mouth ulcers or bacterial infections occurred ; recurrent gingivitis improved .
We conclude that G-CSF is effective for the treatment of cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> in humans .
Marshall-Smith syndrome : natural history and evidence of an osteochondrodysplasia with connective tissue abnormalities .
The Marshall-Smith syndrome ( MSS ) is a distinct malformation syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> accelerated skeletal maturation <END> , relative <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , respiratory difficulties , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and unusual facies , including <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> shallow orbits <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
At least 33 cases have been reported in the literature , mostly as single case reports or small series .
The purpose of the present study is to report on the clinical findings and natural history of MSS in five children and to review the features of three others previously reported , with particular attention to the skeletal and connective tissue findings .
Our study demonstrates an increased rate of nontraumatic fractures and other bony and connective tissue abnormalities that support the hypothesis that MSS should be considered an osteochondrodysplasia .
In addition , long-term survival beyond infancy is possible if respiratory problems are expectantly and aggressively managed .

Inactivating mutations in the gene for thyroid oxidase 2 ( THOX2 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> .
Several genetic defects are associated with permanent <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> .
Immunologic , environmental , and iatrogenic ( but not genetic ) factors are known to induce transient <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> , which spontaneously resolves within the first months of life .
We hypothesized that molecular defects in the thyroid oxidase system , which is composed of at least two proteins , might be involved in the pathogenesis of permanent or transient <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> in babies with defects in iodide organification , for which the oxidase system is required .
Nine patients were recruited who had idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> ( one with permanent and eight with transient hypothyroidism ) and an iodide-organification defect and who had been identified by the screening program for <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> .
The DNA of the patients and their relatives was analyzed for mutations in the genes for thyroid oxidase 1 ( THOX1 ) and 2 ( THOX2 ) .
The one patient with permanent and severe thyroid hormone deficiency and a complete iodide-organification defect had a homozygous nonsense mutation in the THOX2 gene that eliminates all functional domains of the protein .
Three of the eight patients with mild transient <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> and a partial iodide-organification defect had heterozygous mutations in the THOX2 gene that prematurely truncate the protein , thus abolishing its functional domains .
Biallelic inactivating mutations in the THOX2 gene result in complete disruption of thyroid -hormone synthesis and are associated with severe and permanent <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> .
Monoallelic mutations are associated with milder , transient hypothyroidism caused by insufficient thyroidal production of hydrogen peroxide , which prevents the synthesis of sufficient quantities of thyroid hormones to meet the large requirement for thyroid hormones at the beginning of life .
