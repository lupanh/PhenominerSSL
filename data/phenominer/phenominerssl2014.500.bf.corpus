Ritscher-Schinzel cranio-cerebello-cardiac ( 3C ) syndrome : report of four new cases and review .
Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome , also known as the 3C syndrome , is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome characterized by craniofacial , cerebellar , and cardiac anomalies .
Cardiac manifestations include <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> double outlet right ventricle <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic left heart <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic stenosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonic stenosis <END> and other valvular anomalies .
Central nervous system anomalies include <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> , cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and enlargement of the cisterna magna .
Craniofacial abnormalities seen are <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular coloboma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent occiput <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> posterior fossa cyst <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> and congenital heart defect are common malformations that may occur in isolation or as a part of many syndromes .
Accurate genetic diagnosis and counseling require detailed analysis of the external as well as the internal anatomy and knowledge of the relative frequencies of various malformations in syndromes that may have overlapping clinical signs .
We have had the opportunity recently to study four cases of the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome .
A review of all reported cases is presented and an attempt made to define the minimum diagnostic criteria for the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome .
Of the nine craniofacial anomalies commonly reported as a part of the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome , we consider two i.e. , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular coloboma <END> , to be readily and objectively ascertainable .
The other seven craniofacial traits , however , are somewhat subjective , require expert interpretation and are sometimes difficult to ascertain in a newborn or stillborn fetus .
These are prominent forehead , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent occiput <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
At least four of these were present in all cases that had a secure diagnosis of the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome .
Thus , the criteria we propose to establish the diagnosis of the Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome in a chromosomally normal sporadic case are the presence of cardiac malformation other than isolated patent ductus arteriosus , cerebellar malformation , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular coloboma <END> or four of the following seven findings : prominent forehead , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent occiput <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .

Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> and the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> .
International Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> Pancreatitis <END> Study Group . Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> is an autosomal-dominant disease , with a variable expression and an estimated penetrance of 80% .
The gene for this disease has recently been mapped to chromosome 7q35 , and the defect is believed to be caused by a mutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene .
Acute attacks of <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> begin early in life and the disease often progresses to chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
Although the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> is thought to be increased in more common types of chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> , the frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> in the inherited type of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> is uncertain .
The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> and other tumors in patients with hereditary form of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
To determine the natural history of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> , we invited all members of the American Pancreatic Association and the International Association of Pancreatology to participate in a longitudinal study of this rare form of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
The initial criteria for patient eligibility were as follows : early age ( < or = 30 years ) at onset of symptoms , positive family history , and absence of other causes .
From April 1995 through February 1996 , 37 physicians from 10 countries contributed medical records of 246 ( 125 males and 121 females ) patients thought to have hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> as the most likely diagnosis .
This group included 218 patients where the diagnosis appeared to be highly probable and 28 additional patients where the diagnosis of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> was less certain : 25 patients who had relatively late onset of disease and a positive family history and three patients with onset of disease before age 30 years but with an uncertain family history .
We reviewed all causes of death and compared the observed to the expected frequency of cancer in this historical cohort of patients with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
The strength of the association between <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> was estimated by the standardized incidence ratio ( SIR) , which is the ratio of observed <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cases in the cohort to the expected pancreatic cancers in the background population , adjusted for age , sex , and country .
The mean age ( + /- standard deviation [ SD] ) at onset of symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> was 13 .9 +/- 12 .2 years .
Compared with an expected number of 0.15 0 , eight pancreatic adenocarcinomas developed ( mean age +/- SD at diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> : 56 .9 +/- 11 .2 years ) during 8531 person-years of follow-up , yielding an SIR of 53 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 23-105 ) .
The frequency of other tumors was not increased : SIR = 0.7 ( 95 % CI = 0.3-1.6 ) .
Eight of 20 reported deaths in the cohort were from <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> .
Thirty members of the cohort have already been tested for the defective hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> gene : all 30 carry a mutated copy of the trypsinogen gene .
The transmission pattern of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> was known for 168 of 238 patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> and six of eight with <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> .
Ninety-nine of the 238 patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> and six of the patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> inherited the disease through the paternal side of the family .
The estimated cumulative risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> to age 70 years in patients with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> approaches 40% .
For patients with a paternal inheritance pattern , the cumulative risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> is approximately 75 % .
Patients with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> have a high risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> several decades after the initial onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> .
A paternal inheritance pattern increases the probability of developing <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> .
Johnson-McMillin syndrome , a neuroectodermal syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> : report of a new case .
In 1983 , Johnson et al . described 16 related individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> or hyposmia , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> atresia of the external auditory canal <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism <END> inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern . Other less constant manifestations included <START:PHENOTYPE> facial asymmetry <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and choanal stenosis .
An isolated case was reported later ( Johnston et al . [ 1987 : Am J Med Genet 26 : 925-927] ) and thereafter an affected mother and son ( Hennekam and Holtus [ 1993 : Am J Med Genet 47 : 71 4-716] ) .
We describe an additional unrelated female patient with features resembling those of the previously reported cases .
She presented with intrauterine <START:PHENOTYPE> growth deficiency <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral microtia <END> with canal atresia , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> , partial left <START:PHENOTYPE> facial palsy <END> , posterior <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , left choanal stenosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> , developmental delay , and right <START:PHENOTYPE> thumb polydactyly <END> .
Because the phenotypic abnormalities in this syndrome affect the brain , facial structures , ectoderm and its derivatives , outflow tract of the heart , and Rathke 's pouch derivatives , this has suggested to previous authors etiologic involvement of the ectoderm and neuroectoderm of the first and second branchial arches , Rathke 's pouch , and the diencephalon .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microtia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> differentiates the condition from other ectodermal dysplasias .
In the initial report , females appeared somewhat less affected than males , and there was male-to-male transmission .
The mother of our patient manifests subtle features , which suggest she may be a mildly affected female .
Additionally , there is a family history of early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> in the maternal grandfather 's relatives .

Japanese family with <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> central hypoventilation <END> .
The authors describe the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the Fukuoka 1 family , the first Japanese family recognized to have hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> , and central <START:PHENOTYPE> alveolar hypoventilation <END> .
The pedigree contains 14 family members spanning four generations , with five affected individuals .
All available medical records were collected for affected members , including autopsy results .
The inheritance pattern was <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> .
The average age at onset of symptoms was 41 years .
All patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bradykinesia <END> , and resting and postural <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Bradykinesia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> developed in the proband at age 43 years .
He responded to levodopa in the initial stage only .
A year later , he had <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> central hypoventilation <END> leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> .
Symptoms developed in his cousin at age 38 years .
The proband 's father developed a resting <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> at age 43 years .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> was initially responsive to levodopa therapy , but the disease was relentlessly progressive , leading to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> bradykinesia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rigidity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> , and respiratory distress .
He died of <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> at age 49 years .
Autopsy showed marked neuronal loss and gliosis in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus .
Lewy bodies , neurofibrillary tangles , senile plaques , and other abnormal structures were not seen in the cortical and subcortical regions .
The Fukuoka 1 family shares many clinical and pathologic features with five previously reported kindreds from North America and Europe , suggesting that this syndrome has a worldwide distribution and can occur in different ethnic populations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> in patients with angelman syndrome caused by deletion of the chromosome 15q11 -13 .
Angelman syndrome ( AS ) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> speech disorder <END> , stereotyped jerky movements , and a peculiar behavioral profile , with a happy disposition and outbursts of laughter .
Most patients with AS present with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and suggestive electroencephalographic patterns , which may be used as diagnostic criteria .
To study <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and response to treatment in a series of patients with AS determined by deletion .
Parent and caregiver interview and medical record review .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> Center at the University of SÃ£o Paulo . Nineteen patients with AS determined by deletion of chromosome 15q11 -13 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> severity , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> evolution , and response to antiepileptic drug treatment .
All patients with AS in this group had generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and 10 ( 53% ) also had partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Main <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> types were atypical absences and myoclonic and tonic-clonic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Mean age at onset was 1 year 1 month .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> aggravated by fever occurred in 10 patients ( 53% ) and status epilepticus in 16 ( 84% ) .
Eighteen patients ( 95% ) had previous or current history of daily <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , of which 14 ( 64% ) had disabling <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> types were observed in 13 patients ( 53% ) .
History of refractory <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> was reported in 16 patients ( 84% ) .
Parents reported improvement , characterized by decrease in <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> frequency or <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> control , at the mean age of 5.3 years .
Therefore , most of these patients had a period of refractory <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ; however , improvement occurred during late childhood and puberty .
The best therapeutic response was obtained with valproic acid alone or in association with phenobarbital or clonazepam .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> was aggravated by carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , and vigabatrin .
Patients with AS with deletion have <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with early onset and stereotyped electroclinical profile regarding <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> type , severity , and response to antiepileptic drug treatment .
Another feature of AS is the age-related improvement , even in refractory cases , during late childhood and puberty .
These characteristics are not specific to this syndrome but , when inserted in the proper clinical context , may anticipate diagnosis .
We believe that AS should be considered a differential diagnosis in developmentally delayed infants with severe , generalized , cryptogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ; however , a proper electroclinical delineation of each genetic group is mandatory .
Epidemiological , clinical , paraclinical and molecular study of a cohort of 102 patients affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> from Alsace , Eastern France : implications for clinical management .
While Friedreich 's <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( FRDA ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> telangiectasia ( AT ) are known to be the two most frequent forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> ( ARCA) , knowledge on the other forms of ARCA has been obtained only recently , and they appear to be rarer .
Little is known about the epidemiological features and the relative frequency of the ARCAs and only few data are available about the comparative features of ARCAs .
We prospectively studied 102 suspected ARCA cases from Eastern France ( including 95 from the Alsace region ) between 2002 and 2008 .
The diagnostic procedure was based on a sequential strategic scheme .
We examined the clinical , paraclinical and molecular features of the large cohort of patients and compared features and epidemiology according to molecular diagnosis .
A molecular diagnosis could be established for 57 patients ; 36 were affected with FRDA , seven with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> plus <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 2 ( AOA2 ) , four with AT , three with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> plus <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 1 ( AOA1 ) , three with Marinesco-SjÃ¶gren syndrome , two with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> of Charlevoix-Saguenay ( ARSACS) , one with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with vitamin E deficiency ( AVED ) and one with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> type 2 ( ARCA2 ) .
The group of patients with no identified mutation had a significantly lower spinocerebellar degeneration functional score corrected for disease duration ( SDFS/DD ratio ; p = 0.002 ) and comprised a significantly higher proportion of cases with onset after 20 years ( p < 0.01 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Extensor plantar reflexes <END> were rarer and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> was more frequent in the group of patients with a known non-Friedreich ARCA compared to all other patients ( p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0003 , respectively ) .
Lower limb <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> and electroneuromyographic evidences of <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral neuropathy <END> were more frequent in the Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> group than in the group with a known non-Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and were more frequent in the later group than in the group with no identified mutation ( p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01 , respectively ) .
The overall prevalence of ARCA in Alsace is 1/ 19,000 .
We can infer the prevalence of FRDA in Alsace to be 1/50 ,000 and infer that AT is approximately eight times less frequent than FRDA .
MSS , AOA2 and ARSACS appear only slightly less frequent than AT. Despite the broad variability of severity , Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> patients are clinically distinct from the other forms of ARCA .
Patients with no identified mutation have more often a pure cerebellar degenerative disease or a spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> phenotype .
It appears that ARCA cases can be divided into two major groups of different prognosis , an early-onset group with a highly probable genetic cause and an adult-onset group with better prognosis for which a genetic cause is more difficult to prove but not excluded .
ARCAs are rare , early-disabling and genetically heterogeneous diseases dominated by FRDA .
Several of the recently identified ARCAs , such as AVED , ARSACS , AOA1 , AOA2 and MSS , have a prevalence close to AT and should be searched for extensively irrespective of ethnic origins .
The strategic scheme is a useful tool for the diagnosis of ARCAs in clinical practice .
The Perlman familial <START:PHENOTYPE> nephroblastomatosis <END> syndrome .
In 1973 , Perlman et al described a familial syndrome of bilateral renal hamartomas with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> nephroblastomatosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrosomia <END> , islet cell hypertrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> unusual facies <END> , and early lethality .
Two additional sibs were recently reported by Neri et al [ 1984 ] .
We report on two sibs with <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> , fetal <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal muscular hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> visceromegaly <END> , and subsequent development of <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> in one of them .
Delineated features of this syndrome include <START:PHENOTYPE> visceromegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrosomia <END> , renal hamartomas , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephroblastomatosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> in males , <START:PHENOTYPE> unusual facial appearance <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> , fetal <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> but do not include hemihypertrophy , omphalocele or umbilical abnormalities , aniridia , or other conditions known to be associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> .
This condition should be considered primarily in the differential diagnosis of fetal <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> without <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops <END> and possibly in the differential diagnosis of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> , or nephromegaly .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> ( XLAG ) : clinical , magnetic resonance imaging , and neuropathological findings .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> is a newly recognized syndrome responsible for a severe neurological disorder of neonatal onset in boys .
Based on the observations of 3 new cases , we confirm the phenotype in affected boys , describe additional MRI findings , report the neuropathological data , and show that carrier females may exhibit neurological and magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities .
In affected boys , consistent clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> are intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> of neonatal onset , severe hypotonia , poor responsiveness , genital abnormalities , and early death .
On magnetic resonance imaging , a gyration defect consisting of anterior <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> and posterior <START:PHENOTYPE> agyria <END> with a moderately thickened brain cortex , dysplastic basal ganglia and complete <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> are consistently found .
Neuropathological examination of the brain shows a trilayered cortex containing exclusively pyramidal neurons , a neuronal migration defect , a disorganization of the basal ganglia , and gliotic and spongy white matter .
Finally , females related to affected boys may have mental retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and they often display <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> .
These findings expand the phenotype of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> , may help in the detection of carrier females in affected families , and give arguments for a semidominant <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> mode of inheritance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Omphalocele <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> in Europe : a survey of 3 million births 198 0-199 0 .
EUROCAT Working Group .
A total of 732 cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> and 274 cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> was registered in 21 regional registers in Europe ( EUROCAT registers ) during the period 198 0-199 0 .
The total prevalence rates were 2.52 per 10,000 for <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> and 0.94 per 10,000 for <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> .
There was significant heterogeneity in total prevalence rates among regions for <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> .
Consistently higher than average total prevalence rates of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> were found in the five centers of the British Isles .
This was in large part linked to the association between <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> and neural tube defects .
A significant female excess among the cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> associated with neural tube defects , in comparison with an insignificant male excess for other cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , was observed .
Geographical differences in the total prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> are partly explained by differences in maternal age distributions in the populations surveyed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Omphalocele <END> was an isolated malformation in 46 % of cases ; <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> was isolated in 79 % of cases .
The average birthweight and gestational age of both isolated and multiply malformed cases of both <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> were low , especially for multiply malformed cases , and to a greater extent for isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> than for isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> .
Prenatal diagnosis leading to termination of pregnancy was reported in 33.2% of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> and in 26.5 % of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> cases , demonstrating the considerable impact of current prenatal screening programs .
On the basis of clinical manifestations , epidemiologic characteristics , and the presence and type of additional malformations , <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroschisis <END> can be considered heterogeneous conditions .
New <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , acquired micrencephaly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> .
We report on 4 generations in a family with 3 living males , 3 males who died in infancy , and 3 females with neurologic impairment and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ( ACC ) .
Manifestations in the surviving males include severe acquired micrencephaly , mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> limb contractures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , tapered digits with hyperconvex nails , a characteristic face with <START:PHENOTYPE> large eyes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent supraorbital ridges <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophris <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad alveolar ridges <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Urologic anomalies include <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> .
Two affected females were less severely impaired and continued to be socially responsive as adults , but had <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic quadriplegia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
One obligate heterozygote was retarded with emotional problems while another obligate carrier female and her daughter were clinically normal .
Pedigree analysis suggested <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked inheritance <END> with variable expression in females .
These findings are inconsistent with the well-described <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> conditions with ACC including FG syndrome and Aicairdi syndrome .
ACC has not been described in Coffin-Lowry syndrome , a condition with similar clinical findings , which also demonstrates marked variability of expression in carrier females .
In order to assist in carrier determination , brain imaging studies and DNA linkage analysis of the affected relatives was performed .
We found a spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> with the most severe manifestations in the most severely affected males .
DNA analysis using a series of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> probes suggests linkage with a LOD score of 1.26 at theta = 0 to a region between p 11 .3 and p 21.3 .
HLA DQB1* 0602 is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> in 509 narcoleptic patients .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Narcolepsy <END> is a sleep disorder associated with HLA DR15 ( DR2 ) and DQB1* 0602 .
We HLA typed 509 patients enrolled in a clinical trial for the drug modafinil and analyzed the results in relation to <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> , a symptom of <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> characterized by muscle weakness triggered by emotions .
The patients were either subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> who had a mean sleep latency ( SL ) of less than 8 minutes and two or more sleep onset rapid eye movement ( REM ) periods ( SOREMPs ) during a multiple sleep latency test , or narcoleptic patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> but with a mean SL shorter than 5 minutes and two or more SOREMPs .
The respective values of DRB1*15 ( DR2 ) and DQB1* 0602 as markers for <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> were first compared in different ethnic groups and in patients with and without <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> .
DQB1* 0602 was found to be a more sensitive marker for <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> than DRB1*15 across all ethnic groups .
DQB1* 0602 frequency was strikingly higher in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> versus patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> ( 76 .1 % in 421 patients versus 40 .9% in 88 patients ) .
Positivity was highest in patients with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> ( 94.8% ) and progressively decreased to 54 .2% in patients with the mildest <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> .
A voluntary 5 0-item questionnaire focusing on <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> was also analyzed in 212 of the 509 HLA-typed patients .
Subjects with definite <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> as observed by an experienced clinician were more frequently HLA DQB1* 0602-positive than those with doubtful <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> , and the manifestations of <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> were clinically more typical in DQB1* 0602-positive patients .
These results show that the HLA association is as tight as previously reported ( 85-95% ) when <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> is clinically typical or severe .
We also found that patients with mild , atypical , or no <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> have a significantly increased DQB1* 0602 frequency (40-60% ) in comparison with ethnically matched controls ( 24% ) .
These results could be explained by increased disease <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> in the noncataplexy group or by a direct effect of the HLA DQB1* 0602 genotype on the clinical expression of <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> .
Genitopatellar syndrome : a new condition comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> absent patellae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scrotal hypoplasia <END> , renal anomalies , facial dysmorphism , and mental retardation .
We report on the association of <START:PHENOTYPE> absent patellae <END> , genital and renal anomalies , dysmorphic features , and mental retardation in seven children (six boys and one girl ) belonging to five unrelated families .
Flexion deformities of the knees and hips with <START:PHENOTYPE> club feet <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> absent patellae <END> were consistently observed and <START:PHENOTYPE> scrotal hypoplasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> were present in all boys ( 6/6 ) .
Dysmorphic features included a <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse face <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> large nose <END> with a <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> . Other features included renal anomalies ( <START:PHENOTYPE> multicystic kidneys <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> , 7/7) , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ( 4/7) , <START:PHENOTYPE> swallowing difficulties <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> ( 4/7) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> ( 3/7 ) .
Bilateral hypoplasia of the ischia and brachydactyly were also consistently observed ( 5/5 ) .
In two out of seven cases , prenatal ultrasound detection of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and renal anomalies led to termination of the pregnancy at 27 weeks .
Three children died during the first years of life and the remaining two who survived exhibit severe <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
High resolution cytogenetic studies performed on lymphocytes or fibroblasts or both were normal in all cases .
Recurrence in two families suggests an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance .
We propose that this unusual association , similar to that observed in a 4 year old boy by Goldblatt et al , represents a new syndrome distinct from previously reported hypoplastic patella syndromes .
Clinical manifestations in 105 persons with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome .
Nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome ( NBCC ; Gorlin syndrome ) , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder linked to 9q22.3-q31 , and caused by mutations in PTC , the human homologue of the Drosophila patched gene , comprises multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> keratocysts of the jaw <END> , palmar/plantar pits , spine and rib anomalies and calcification of the falx cerebri .
We reviewed the findings on 105 affected individuals examined at the NIH since 1985 .
The data included 48 males and 57 females ranging in age from 4 months to 87 years .
Eighty percent of whites ( 71 /90 ) and 38 % ( 5 /13 ) of African-Americans had at least one <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> ( BCC) , with the first tumor occurring at a mean age of 23 ( median 20) years and 21 ( median 20) years , respectively .
Excluding individuals exposed to radiation therapy , the number of BCCs ranged from 1 to > 1,000 ( median 8 ) and 1 to 3 ( median 2) , respectively , in the 2 groups .
Jaw cysts occurred in 78 /105 ( 74% ) with the first tumor occurring in 80% by the age of 20 years .
The number of total jaw cysts ranged from 1 to 28 ( median 3 ) . <START:PHENOTYPE> Palmar pits <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> plantar pits <END> were seen in 87% .
Ovarian fibromas were diagnosed by ultrasound in 9/52 ( 17% ) at a mean age of 30 years .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Medulloblastoma <END> occurred in 4 patients at a mean age of 2.3 years .
Three patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> or palate .
Physical findings include " <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse face <END> " in 54% , relative <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> in 5 0% , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> in 42% , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> in 27% , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus deformity <END> in 13% , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel deformity <END> in 11 % .
Important radiological signs included calcification of the falx cerebri in 65 % , of the tentorium cerebelli in 20% , bridged sella in 68 % , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid ribs <END> in 26% , <START:PHENOTYPE> hemivertebrae <END> in 15 % , fusion of the vertebral bodies in 10% , and flame shaped lucencies of the phalanges , metacarpal , and carpal bones of the hands in 30% .
Several traits previously considered components of the syndrome ( including short fourth metacarpal , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , cervical ribs and <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida <END> occulta ) were not found to be significantly increased in the affected individuals .
This study delineates the frequency of the clinical and radiological anomalies in NBCC in a large population of US patients and discusses guidelines for diagnosis and management .
The clinical features and classification of the <START:PHENOTYPE> late onset <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxias .
A study of 11 families , including descendants of the 'the Drew family of Walworth ' .
The clinical features of 11 families containing 73 individuals with dominantly inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> late onset <END> are described .
Many of the patients had physical signs in addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , which included <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> supranuclear ophthalmoplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal dysfunction <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinal degeneration <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and deafness .
These associated features were generally very variable within members of the same family .
Intrafamilial correlation of age of onset and an analysis of clustering of clinical features within families using X2 tests suggested that there was little evidence of genetic heterogeneity in the eight kindreds where <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal signs <END> were found in affected individuals .
One of these families contained descendants of the ' Drew family of Walworth ' described by Ferguson and Critchley in 1929.
The three other families contained patients with clinically distinct syndromes which were : <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinal degeneration <END> ; a later onset ( over 60 years ) ' pure ' cerebellar syndrome ; and an <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> disorder associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and deafness .
A simple classification of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxias is proposed and discussed in relation to previous attempts to classify these disorders on clinical and pathological grounds .
Mutations affecting G-protein subunit Î±11 in <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> .
Familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with three variants : types 1 , 2 , and 3 . Type 1 is due to loss-of-function mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor , a guanine nucleotide-binding protein ( G-protein )-coupled receptor that signals through the G-protein subunit Î±11 ( GÎ±11 ) .
Type 3 is associated with adaptor-related protein complex 2 , sigma 1 subunit ( AP2S1 ) mutations , which result in altered calcium-sensing receptor endocytosis .
We hypothesized that type 2 is due to mutations effecting GÎ±11 loss of function , since GÎ±11 is involved in calcium-sensing receptor signaling , and its gene ( GNA11 ) and the type 2 locus are colocalized on chromosome 19p13.3 .
We also postulated that mutations effecting GÎ±11 gain of function , like the mutations effecting calcium-sensing receptor gain of function that cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> type 1 , may lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> .
We performed GNA11 mutational analysis in a kindred with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> type 2 and in nine unrelated patients with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> who did not have mutations in the gene encoding the calcium-sensing receptor ( CASR ) or AP2S1 .
We also performed this analysis in eight unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> who did not have CASR mutations .
In addition , we studied the effects of GNA11 mutations on GÎ±11 protein structure and calcium-sensing receptor signaling in human embryonic kidney 293 ( HEK293 ) cells .
The kindred with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> type 2 had an in-frame deletion of a conserved GÎ±11 isoleucine ( Ile200del) , and one of the nine unrelated patients with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> had a missense GNA11 mutation ( Leu135Gln ) .
Missense GNA11 mutations ( Arg181Gln and Phe341 Leu ) were detected in two unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> ; they were therefore identified as having <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> type 2 . All four GNA11 mutations predicted disrupted protein structures , and assessment on the basis of in vitro expression showed that familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> type 2-associated mutations decreased the sensitivity of cells expressing calcium-sensing receptors to changes in extracellular calcium concentrations , whereas <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> type 2-associated mutations increased cell sensitivity .
GÎ±11 mutants with loss of function cause familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> type 2 , and GÎ±11 mutants with gain of function cause a clinical disorder designated as <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> type 2 .

Benign <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome of neuronal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
We present a kindred with a previously undescribed combination of neuronal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
The propositus , a 72 -year-old man , had <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , peripheral neuropathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> orthostatic hypotension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> central hypoventilation <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Peripheral electrophysiologic studies showed features of an axonal neuropathy.
The electroencephalogram showed intermittent 2 to 4 Hz activity symmetrically in the hemispheres .
Several family members in 3 generations had <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , neuropathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> although not all of the features were consistently present .
Survival past the 7th decade was common .
Autopsy in 2 affected members revealed the neuropathy to be axonal in type and showed mild to moderate loss of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and pigmentary loss with <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> in the substantia nigra .
This is a unique , benign , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome which shows complete penetrance , variable expression , and both central and peripheral nervous system involvement .
Early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular motor apraxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> : the aprataxin gene mutations .
Early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> is regarded as a variant form of Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> in Japan .
Early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular motor apraxia <END> have been considered as the same clinical entity because of the recent identification of a common mutation in the aprataxin gene .
A new clinical entity named early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular motor apraxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> ( EAOH ) has been proposed to explain these two diseases .
To disclose the clinical features of EAOH and to identify the mutations in the aprataxin gene in six patients in four Japanese families with EAOH .
The clinical features , laboratory findings , sural nerve biopsy results , and brain MRI or CT findings for these patients were evaluated , and molecular analysis was performed , which involved sequencing of the aprataxin gene directly or use of the subcloning method .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebellar ataxia <END> and peripheral neuropathy were noted in all six patients . <START:PHENOTYPE> Ocular motor apraxia <END> was observed in five patients ; two of these patients had obvious head thrust .
Choreiform movements of the limbs and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deterioration <END> were observed in five patients .
Although foot deformity was noted in five patients , kyphoscoliosis was noted only in one patient .
In all patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> were evident , and brain MRI or CT showed marked cerebellar atrophy.
Nerve biopsy revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> depletion of large myelinated fibers <END> in three of the five patients examined .
Molecular analysis of the aprataxin gene revealed an insertion mutation ( ins T at nt167 ) and two missense mutations ( A-to-G transition at nt80 and C-to-T transition at nt95 , the former being novel ) .
We found clinical heterogeneity in the patients with EAOH in this study .
With the disease course , the choreiform movements tended to reduce in degree , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> became evident .
Molecular analysis identified one insertion and two missense mutations including a novel missense one , which was located at a highly conserved amino acid residue in the aprataxin gene product .
Hereditary endotheliopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> ( HERNS ) .
We describe a Chinese American family with a hereditary syndrome consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> , affecting 11 members spanning three generations .
Ophthalmologic evaluations revealed macular <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> with capillary dropout and perifoveal microangiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> telangiectases <END> .
Several members had renal abnormalities with <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Initial manifestations were <START:PHENOTYPE> visual impairment <END> and renal dysfunction ; neurologic deficits occurred in the third or fourth decade of life .
Symptoms included migraine-like headache , psychiatric disturbance , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiparesis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> apraxia <END> .
Neuroimaging consistently demonstrated contrast-enhancing subcortical lesions with surrounding <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> .
Ultrastructural studies showed distinctive multilaminated vascular basement membranes in the brain and in other tissues , including the kidney , stomach , appendix , omentum , and skin .
Genetic analysis ruled out linkage to the CADASIL locus on chromosome 19 . Distinct from CADASIL , hereditary endotheliopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> ( HERNS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> multi-infarct syndrome with systemic involvement .
Limb pterygium syndromes : a review and report of eleven patients .
Conditions with limb pterygia and congenital contractures were reviewed as part of a study of over 350 infants with <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> .
Emphasis was placed on inheritance and variability of distinct pterygium conditions .
Eleven patients with limb pterygia were recognized in our study and are described here .
Seven of the 350 patients with congenital contractures had the autosomal recessively inherited multiple pterygium syndrome ( Patients 1-7 ) .
Three of the seven are sibs , a fourth was born to consanguineous parents , and three were chance isolated cases .
These seven had multiple joint webs , unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> finger contractures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rocker bottom feet <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> antimongoloid slant of palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthal folds <END> , highly arched palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
There is intrafamilial variability .
Three patients from one family had a lethal multiple pterygium syndrome .
Two were monozygotic twins .
They had webbing and contractures of the elbows , knees , neck , and fingers , calcaneovalgus deformity of the feet , and an unusual facial appearance : <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , flat nose , <START:PHENOTYPE> antimongoloid slant of palpebral fissures <END> , apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> .
One had a <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
Internal malformations included : bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> , small heart , absence of the appendix , and attenuation of the ascending and transverse colon .
One sporadic case of lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> popliteal pterygium <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> facial clefts <END> was studied .
Multiple anomalies included : <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum <END> , upslanting palpebral fissures , hypoplasia of nasal cartilages , frenula , clefts into the oropharynx lateral to the mouth , apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> with slit-like canals , large popliteal pterygia , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> with fusion of all digits in hands and feet , and hypoplastic labia .
Meckel syndrome in the Hutterite population is actually a Joubert-related cerebello-oculo-renal syndrome .
Meckel syndrome ( MKS ) is a rare lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by the presence of occipital <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalocele <END> , cystic kidneys , fibrotic changes of the liver and polydactyly .
Joubert syndrome ( JS)-related disorders ( JSRDs ) or cerebello-oculo-renal syndromes ( CORS ) are a group of recessively inherited conditions characterized by a molar tooth sign ( MTS ) on cranial MRI , a set of core clinical features (developmental delay/mental retardation , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , episodic breathing abnormalities , abnormal eye movements ) and variable involvement of other systems including renal , ocular , central nervous system , craniofacial , hepatic , and skeletal .
A significant clinical overlap between MKS and JSRD/CORS has been recognized in the literature .
We describe a group of 10 Hutterite patients , of which 7 had been previously diagnosed with MKS , with a JSRD .
Clinical features include variable early mortality , cognitive handicap , a characteristic dysmorphic facial appearance , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , abnormal breathing pattern , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , and MTS on MRI . Additional features include occipital <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalocele <END> , posterior fossa fluid collections resembling <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , and renal disease .
This JSRD is a recognizable dysmorphic syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deep-set eyes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arched eyebrows <END> with medial sparseness , square nasal tip , <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> with tented upper lip , <START:PHENOTYPE> open mouth <END> with down-turned corners , and <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> .
Renal disease is present in 70 % of patients and is characterized by cystic kidneys , abnormalities in renal function and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
Homozygous deletions of NPHP1 and the known loci for JS/JSRD and MKS were excluded by identity-by-descent mapping studies suggesting that this condition in the Hutterites represents yet another locus for a JSRD .

Familial Del(18p ) syndrome .
We report on sibs and their mother , all with del(18p ) .
The propositus , an 11-month-old , had <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> round face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , upturned nostrils , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> , redundant skin around the neck , <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> .
The elder sister , a two and 7/12-year-old , had <START:PHENOTYPE> round face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , narrow and <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> , redundant skin around the neck , short fingers , and hypoplastic genitalia .
Their mother had <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , prominent columella , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , wide mouth , <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malaligned teeth <END> , and clinodactyly of the fifth fingers .
Serial photographs of the mother showed that the characteristic <START:PHENOTYPE> round face <END> in infancy changed to long face with age .
The present report suggests that the mother with del(18p ) may be fertile , and proper genetic counseling and long follow-up is necessary for the patient with del(18p ) syndrome .

Clinical and genetic comparisons of patients with cystic fibrosis , with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> .
We set out to determine if the clinical course or genetic profiles of patients with cystic fibrosis who had <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> differed from those of other patients with cystic fibrosis .
Since 1950 we have followed 158 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> among 1175 patients with cystic fibrosis ( 13.4% ) .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> had lower birth weight (3026 +/- 610 gm ) than patients with no <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> ( 3169 +/- 534 gm ; p less than 0.008 ) ; the deficit was especially evident in female patients .
Survival in the first year of life increased from 55 % in those born between 1958 and 1972 to 96 % in those born between 1973 and 1987 .
Since 1973 the median survival of male and female patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> was similar to that in female patients with no <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> ( 21 years ) , whereas 78 % of males with no <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> survived to this age ( p less than 0.0001 ) .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> born before 1972 had lower weight and height percentiles at age 13 years compared with patients with no <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> , but this difference was not as apparent in patients born after 1973 .
There were no differences between the two groups in forced vital capacity , forced expiratory volume in 1 second , or forced expiratory flow in the middle half of forced vital capacity .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a younger age than did patients with no <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> ( 4.2 0 +/- 4.67 vs 7.18 +/- 5 .19 years ) , but there was no difference in age of acquisition of P . cepacia .
In families in which the first child had <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> , 29% of subsequent siblings with cystic fibrosis had <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> , compared with 6% of siblings born to families in which the first child did not have <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> .
Allelic frequencies and haplotypic variants for cystic fibrosis chromosomes with respect to DNA markers closely linked to the cystic fibrosis locus were similar in families with cystic fibrosis with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> and those with no <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> .
These findings suggest that patients with cystic fibrosis and those without <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> do not have major intrinsic differences and that the previously poor outlook in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> meconium ileus <END> has improved greatly .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spastic paraplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( SPAR ) : a novel genetic disorder .
To describe a kindred with a dominantly inherited neurologic disorder manifested either as uncomplicated <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Neurologic examinations and molecular genetic analysis ( exclusion of known SCA and HSP genes and loci ; and trinucleotide repeat expansion detection [ RED] ) were performed in six affected and four unaffected subjects in this family .
MRI , electromyography ( EMG) , and nerve conduction studies were performed in three affected subjects .
The phenotype of this dominantly inherited syndrome varied in succeeding generations .
Pure <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> was present in the earliest generation ; subsequent generations had <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
MRI showed marked atrophy of the spinal cord in all patients and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> in those with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
Laboratory analysis showed that the disorder was not caused by mutations in genes that cause SCA-1 , SCA-2 , SCA-3 , SCA-6 , SCA-7 , SCA-8 , and SCA-12 ; not linked to other known loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( SCA-4 , SCA-5 , SCA-10 , SCA-11 , SCA-13 , SCA-14 , and SCA-16 ) ; and not linked to known loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( HSP ) ( SPG-3 , SPG-4 , SPG-6 , SPG-8 , SPG-9 , SPG-10 , SPG-12 , and SPG-13 ) or autosomal recessive HSP SPG-7 . Analysis of intergenerational differences in age at onset of symptoms suggests genetic anticipation .
Using RED , the authors did not detect expanded CAG , CCT , TGG , or CGT repeats that segregate with the disease .
The authors describe an unusual , dominantly inherited neurologic disorder in which the phenotype ( pure <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> or spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with variable <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ) differed in subsequent generations .
The molecular explanation for apparent genetic anticipation does not appear to involve trinucleotide repeat expansion .
X-linked myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> : mutation in the homeobox gene ARX . To describe a new syndrome of X-linked myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> ( XMESID) and identify the gene defect underlying this disorder .
The authors studied a family in which six boys over two generations had intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> using a validated <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> questionnaire , clinical examination , and EEG studies .
Previous records and investigations were obtained .
Information on <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> disorders was obtained on 271 members of the extended family .
Molecular genetic analysis included linkage studies and mutational analysis using a positional candidate gene approach .
All six affected boys had <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonic seizures <END> and TC S ; two had infantile spasms , but only one had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypsarrhythmia <END> .
EEG studies show diffuse background slowing with slow generalized spike wave activity .
All affected boys had moderate to profound <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperreflexia <END> was observed in obligate carrier women .
A late-onset progressive spastic ataxia in the matriarch raises the possibility of late clinical manifestations in obligate carriers .
The disorder was mapped to Xp11 .2-22.2 with a maximum lod score of 1.8 . As recently reported , a missense mutation (1058 C>T/ P353L ) was identified within the homeodomain of the novel human Aristaless related homeobox gene ( ARX ) .
XMESID is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> in boys .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperreflexia <END> is found in carrier women .
XMESID is associated with a missense mutation in ARX .
This disorder is allelic with X-linked infantile spasms ( ISSX ; MIM 308350 ) where polyalanine tract expansions are the commonly observed molecular defect .
Mutations of ARX are associated with a wide range of phenotypes ; functional studies in the future may lend insights to the neurobiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonic seizures <END> and infantile spasms .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> associated with adrenocortical insufficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> , and neurological abnormalities .
We report on two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> , adrenocortical insufficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
The parents and three sibs are unaffected .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Achalasia <END> , adrenocortical insufficiency , and <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> comprise a recently characterized familial multisystem disorder of unknown cause .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Achalasia <END> has also been described in association with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in one family and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in another .
The above reports and these sibs may represent variants of a single pleiotropic recessive gene .
We suggest that abnormalities of the central nervous system are a manifestation of the <START:PHENOTYPE> achalasia <END> , adrenocortical insufficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> alacrima <END> syndrome .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder of pyogenic sterile <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> gangrenosum , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acne <END> : PAPA syndrome .
To describe a multigenerational family with transmission of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterized by pyogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> gangrenosum , and severe cystic <START:PHENOTYPE> acne <END> .
We present a detailed case report of a 39-year-old man with arthritic changes in several joints , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> gangrenosum , and cystic <START:PHENOTYPE> acne <END> .
Several relatives from three generations of his family underwent clinical and genetic investigations .
The findings in this kindred are reported .
Ten affected family members in three generations manifested variable expression of a pauciarticular , nonaxial , destructive , corticosteroid-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> that began in childhood ; <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> gangrenosum ; and severe cystic <START:PHENOTYPE> acne <END> in adolescence and beyond .
Other less commonly associated features included adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , abscess formation at the site of parenteral injections , and cytopenias attributable to sulfonamide medications .
Laboratory evaluation was nondiagnostic .
Genetic studies excluded linkage to the major histocompatibility locus .
The acronym of PAPA syndrome ( pyogenic sterile <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> gangrenosum , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acne <END> ) is suggested for this newly recognized pleiotropic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder .
The nature of the genetic alteration in PAPA syndrome is unknown .
Parental age in <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Of 104 children with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> born between 1945 and 1970 , we studied the age of their parents at the birth and compared this age with the mean age of parents at the birth of their children during the same period in The Netherlands .
The mean age of fathers at the birth of their children with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( 33.7 years ) was significantly higher than the mean age of fathers at the birth of their children in the general population (32.5 years ) ( P less than .05 , one sided ) .
Similarly , the mean age of mothers at the birth of their children with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( 31.2 years ) was significantly higher than the mean age of mothers at the birth of their children in the general population ( 29.5 years ) ( P less than .05 , one sided ) .
We further analyzed this parental age factor by measuring the relative risk of age groups and comparing the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> in the various parental age groups with the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> in the total population .
Mothers 35 years of age or older had a relative risk of 1.7 to have a child with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> compared with mothers in the population in general ( P = .006 , one sided ) .
Similarly , fathers 50 years of age or older had a relative risk of 5. 0 to have a child with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> compared with fathers in the population in general ( P = .04 , one sided ) .
No parental age effect was found in children with nonhereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
We conclude that a high paternal and a high maternal age are significant risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Basal cell carcinoma <END> of the eyelid associated with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome .
To describe the ophthalmic and systemic features in a series of patients initially seen with eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> associated with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome .
Retrospective noncomparative case series .
Of 105 consecutive patients with eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> managed at an Ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> Oncology <END> Center between January 1973 and December 1999 , four patients with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome were identified .
The ophthalmic and systemic features , management , and outcome of patients with eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> associated with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome were analyzed .
The published literature on Gorlin-Goltz syndrome , specifically related to genetics , systemic features , ophthalmic associations , and prophylactic management strategies , was reviewed .
Response of the eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> to treatment and the final systemic condition were the main outcome measures .
All four patients had a family history of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome .
The systemic manifestations included multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> in all the patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> or increased occipitofrontal circumference in three patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> palmar pits <END> in two patients , odontogenic keratocyst in one patient , ectopic calcification in one patient , and bifid rib in one patient .
The mean age at the detection of the first <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> was 30 years ( range , 16-38 years ) .
All four patients had multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> on the face and elsewhere .
The eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> was advanced with orbital infiltration in three patients , one of whom opted for palliative radiotherapy , whereas the other two underwent orbital exenteration .
The fourth patient , who had localized recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> in the upper eyelid , was treated with excision and eyelid reconstruction .
At the final follow-up ( mean , 41 months) , eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> was cured in three patients and stable in one patient .
No patient had life-threatening sequelae of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome .
Gorlin-Goltz syndrome is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> predisposition syndrome that may be associated with eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> .
The associated systemic findings may be a clue to the diagnosis of this condition .
It is important to recognize Gorlin-Goltz syndrome when a patient has multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> or when a young patient with eyelid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> is seen by an ophthalmologist , because lifelong monitoring is essential for patient management .
van den Ende-Gupta syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , and congenital contractures : clinical delineation and recurrence in brothers .
We describe two Hispanic brothers born to unrelated parents with van den Ende-Gupta syndrome ( VDEGS) , a distinctive combination of characteristic dysmorphic features , skeletal abnormalities , and cerebellar hyperplasia .
This syndrome was previously delineated by van den Ende et al . [ 1992 : Am J Med Genet 42:467-469 ] and Gupta et al . [ 1995 : J Med Genet 32:8 09-812 ] , with additional reports by Phadke et al . [ 1998 : Am J Med Genet 77 :16-18 ] and Bistritzer et al . [ 1993 : Clin Genet 44 :15 - 19 ] .
This is the fifth report of VDEGS , which is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic alae nasi <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic maxilla <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> everted lower lip <END> , slender and elongated hands and feet , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , self-limiting joint contractures , and distinctive skeletal findings .
This report of affected siblings , and a previous report of double second cousins born to consanguineous parents [Bistritzer et al . [ 1993 : Clin Genet 44 :15 - 19] ] , suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
This brings to eight , the total number of reported cases , derived from six families , three of which are consanguineous .
It is important to distinguish VDEGS from Marden-Walker syndrome ( MWS ) since both syndromes include <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , and congenital contractures .
Both syndromes are inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> fashion , but VDEGS lacks severe mental retardation , serious brain malformations , microcephaly , failure to thrive , and severe joint limitation , which are consistently present in MWS .
Of particular importance , MWS may be associated with cerebellar malformations such as Dandy-Walker malformation , while the brothers reported herein with VDEGS both demonstrated distinctive cerebellar enlargement , a new finding for this disorder .
While , congenital contractures with <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> are features commonly seen in several other delineated syndromes , such as congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> ( CCA ) syndrome , characteristic facial features ( <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent ears <END> , and everted lower lip) , distinguish VDEGS from other syndromes associated with CCA , including CCA .

Probable exclusion of GLC1A as a candidate <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> gene in a family with middle-age-onset primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
To determine whether an adult-onset variety of primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in family UM:POAG1 is linked to the previously mapped GLC1A juvenile-onset primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> locus on chromosome 1q or whether linkage can be excluded .
Microsatellite repeat markers from the 9 cM D1S196 to D1S218 interval containing the GLC1A gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from DNA samples collected from 11 members of one sibship in family UM:POAG1 .
Haplotype analysis was carried out , including calculation of the probability that the observed data would have been obtained if the underlying cause of primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in this family were a defect in a gene located in the tested interval .
Linkage analysis was carried out under an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model for GLC1A <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
In family UM:POAG1 , primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> was diagnosed in six surviving and one deceased member of a sibship of 13 individuals during the fifth or sixth decade of life .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Glaucoma <END> in this family has a later average age at diagnosis and significantly less elevation in intraocular pressure than GLC1A <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> so far described .
Haplotype analysis , using a population prevalence up to 0.9% , shows that it is unlikely that the reported data would have been observed if primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in this pedigree were due to the GLC1A locus on chromosome 1q21-q31 .
Linkage analysis under the juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model allowed exclusion of linkage across the entire GLC1A genetic inclusion interval , with a maximum lod score in the interval of -3.28 .
The most likely interpretation of these observations is that a defect in the GLC1A <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> gene is not responsible for adult-onset primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in family UM:POAG1 .
This suggests the existence of at least two primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> genes , the previously reported GLC1A gene on chromosome 1q and another gene located elsewhere in the genome .
Diagnosis of UM:POAG1 <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> between 42 and 57 years of age also raises questions regarding the relation of the <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> present in this family to the common later-age-onset form of the disease .
MBTPS2 mutation causes BRESEK/BRESHECK syndrome .
BRESEK/BRESHECK syndrome is a multiple congenital malformation characterized by brain anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> , skeletal deformities , ear or eye anomalies , and renal anomalies or small kidneys , with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> .
This syndrome has only been reported in three male patients .
Here , we report on the fourth male patient presenting with brain anomaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , growth retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> , vertebral ( skeletal ) anomaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> , low-set and <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and small kidneys .
These manifestations fulfill the clinical diagnostic criteria of BRESHECK syndrome .
Since all patients with BRESEK/BRESHECK syndrome are male , and X-linked syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis with atrichia and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> is sometimes associated with several features of BRESEK/BRESHECK syndrome such as <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> , vertebral and renal anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> , we analyzed the causal gene of <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis with atrichia and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> syndrome , MBTPS2 , in the present patient and identified an p.Arg429His mutation .
This mutation has been reported to cause the most severe type of <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis with atrichia and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> syndrome , including neonatal and infantile death .
These results demonstrate that the p.Arg429His mutation in MBTPS2 causes BRESEK/BRESHECK syndrome .

New <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> syndrome with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> severely impaired vision <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing defect <END> , epileptic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , restricted joint mobility , and early death .
A family with an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome involving seven children in two generations is reported .
The syndrome includes <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> severely impaired vision <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> , a severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , epileptic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , restricted movement of the large joints , and death in infancy or early childhood .
We conclude that this is a distinct , previously unrecognized <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome .
Michels syndrome , Carnevale syndrome , OSA syndrome , and Malpuech syndrome : variable expression of a single disorder ( 3MC syndrome ) ?
We report on a 3-year-old girl with Michels syndrome , a rare condition characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> , cleft lip/palate , abnormal supra-umbilical abdominal wall , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deficiency <END> .
The phenotypic findings are compared with the six previously reported Michels cases , and with patients referred to as Carnevale , OSA , and Malpuech syndromes .
Michels syndrome is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> anterior chamber anomalies <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> .
Carnevale syndrome shows <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> synophrys , large and fleshy ears , and lozenge-shaped diastasis around the umbilicus .
OSA syndrome resembles Carnevale , with humeroradial synostoses , and spinal anomalies as extra features .
Malpuech syndrome shows IUGR , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> , hypospadias , renal anomalies , and caudal appendage .
All are <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
Despite the presence of apparently distinctive key features , it appears that these four entities share multiple similarities in the facial Gestalt and the pattern of MCA . Those similarities lead us to postulate that they belong to the same spectrum , which could be referred to as " 3MC syndrome " ( Malpuech-Michels-Mingarelli-Carnevale syndrome ) .

An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of joint contractures , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcytic anemia <END> , and panniculitis-associated lipodystrophy.
Genetic lipodystrophies are rare disorders characterized by partial or complete loss of adipose tissue and predisposition to insulin resistance and its complications such as diabetes mellitus , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , hepatic steatosis , acanthosis nigricans , and polycystic ovarian syndrome .
The objective of the study was to report a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> syndrome .
We report the detailed phenotype of two males and one female patient , 26-34 yr old , belonging to two pedigrees with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome presenting with childhood-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> , severe joint contractures , erythematous skin lesions , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcytic anemia <END> .
Other variable clinical features include <START:PHENOTYPE> hypergammaglobulinemia <END> , hepatosplenomegaly , generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> basal ganglia calcification <END> .
None of the patients had diabetes mellitus or acanthosis nigricans .
Two had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> and all had low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol .
Skin biopsy of an erythematous nodular skin lesion from one of the patients revealed evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> panniculitis <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> initially affected the upper body but later became generalized involving abdomen and lower extremities as well .
We conclude that these patients represent a novel autoinflammatory syndrome resulting in joint contractures , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcytic anemia <END> , and panniculitis-induced lipodystrophy.
The molecular genetic basis of this disorder remains to be elucidated .
Vitrectomy in eyes with unsuspected <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
To analyze patient management and prognosis after vitrectomy in eyes with unsuspected <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Retrospective , noncomparative case series .
Eleven consecutive patients who had undergone vitrectomy on an eye with unsuspected <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
The two main outcome measures were ultimate patient management and the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> metastasis .
Of more than 900 consecutive patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> managed on the Ocular Oncology Service at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia , 11 ( 1% ) had prior vitrectomy in an eye with viable tumor before referral to us for suspected <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
The main preoperative diagnoses included <START:PHENOTYPE> vitreous hemorrhage <END> in seven patients ( 64% ) , toxocariasis in two patients ( 18% ) , toxoplasmosis in one patient ( 9% ) , and endophthalmitis in one patient ( 9% ) .
In no case was <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> suspected before vitrectomy .
The mean patient age at vitrectomy was 6 years .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinoblastoma <END> was later suspected during vitrectomy in two patients ( 18% ) , on cytologic examination of the vitrectomy specimen in eight patients ( 73% ) , and after referral in one patient ( 9% ) .
The mean interval between vitrectomy and referral to us was 23 days .
On examination , the globe was classified as Reese-Ellsworth group Vb in all 11 patients (100% ) .
Anterior chamber tumor cells were clinically visible in four eyes ( 36% ) , hyphema in two eyes ( 18% ) , and iris neovascularization in two eyes ( 18% ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinoblastoma <END> cells were visualized in the vitreous in seven eyes ( 64% ) and not visualized in four eyes ( 36% ) that had vitreous blood .
Enucleation was necessary in all 11 patients (100% ) .
Adjuvant treatment was delivered in 10 patients ( 91% ) , using orbital radiotherapy in nine patients ( 82% ) and chemotherapy in nine patients ( 82% ) .
Histopathologic evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> invasion was documented in the episclera ( two eyes ; 18% ) , anterior chamber ( seven eyes ; 64% ) , iris ( five eyes ; 45% ) , ciliary body ( five eyes ; 45% ) , choroid ( three eyes ; 27% ) , and optic nerve ( four eyes ; 36% ; prelaminar , two eyes ; postlaminar , two eyes ) .
The vitrectomy ports , Tenon 's fascia , cut end of the optic nerve , and orbit were free of tumor .
Of the 10 patients who received prophylactic chemotherapy , radiotherapy , or both in addition to enucleation for prevention of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> metastasis , none ( 0% ) experienced metastasis or orbital recurrence during the mean follow-up of 7 years ( range , 0.2-24 years ) from the time of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> diagnosis .
However , one patient was referred to us after the development of metastatic <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , and despite aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy after enucleation , died 24 months later .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinoblastoma <END> may present with atypical features such as <START:PHENOTYPE> vitreous hemorrhage <END> or signs of vitreous inflammation , particularly in older children .
Vitrectomy should be avoided in these cases until the possibility of underlying <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> is excluded .
If vitrectomy is performed in an eye with unsuspected <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , enucleation combined with adjuvant chemotherapy , radiotherapy , or both without delay is advised to prevent systemic tumor dissemination .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> ( SEMDJL ) : clinical and radiological findings in a Guatemalan patient .
We report on a patient of Guatemalan descent whose physical and radiological findings are consistent with a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> ( SEMDJL ) .
This is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal dysplasia <END> with short limbs , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , high dorsal <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> .
Most described patients with SEMDJL are from the Afrikaans-speaking communities of South Africa .
Patients with SEMDJL have an <START:PHENOTYPE> oval face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent eyes <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> .
Our patient 's height and weight were below the fifth centile .
She had <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent eyes <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , a narrow , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , pectus carinatum , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and hyperextensibility and instability of most joints , with limited extension and supination of her elbows .
A review of her roentgenograms showed severe <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , poorly developed ischial , iliac , and pubic bones , a " bat-like " appearance of the iliac bones , "dysplastic " acetabulum , minimal metaphyseal and epiphyseal abnormalities at the knees , deformation of the proximal femoral metaphyses , and generalized brachydactyly of the hands and feet .
This disorder may be more common than previously thought , and the diagnosis should be considered in any child with a dwarfing condition and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogenitalism <END> : report and review of Micro syndrome .
We report on a 7-month-old boy with Micro syndrome who was referred for assessment of mental-motor retardation and reduced vision with cataract .
The characteristics of Micro syndrome are <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , agenesis /hypoplasia of the corpus callosum , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogenitalism <END> .
The differential diagnosis includes cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome ( COFS) ; a syndrome involving cataract , arthrogryposis , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> ( CAMAK ) ; a syndrome with cataract , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> ( CAMFAK ) ; Martsolf syndrome ; Neu-Laxova syndrome ; Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome ; and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome .
Till date , no renal malformations have been reported in Micro syndrome .
Our patient had fusion of the lower poles of the kidneys and his left kidney was ectopic .
Ocular findings are the most reliable neonatal diagnostic signs of Micro syndrome .
MinÃ¶r anomalies in Micro syndrome may be subtle and therefore not of significant diagnostic value .
Micro syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
Till date , most reported cases have been in individuals of Muslim origin .
In countries with high rates of consanguineous marriage , such as Turkey , it is important that physicians be able to recognize this syndrome .
Micro syndrome should be considered in any infant with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Intractable diarrhea <END> of infancy with facial dysmorphism , <START:PHENOTYPE> trichorrhexis nodosa <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> .
A 3-year-old girl had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> intractable diarrhea <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> trichorrhexis nodosa <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> .
This patient was referred to the pediatric dermatology clinic for lifelong <START:PHENOTYPE> brittle hair <END> .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> brittle hair <END> microscopically demonstrated <START:PHENOTYPE> trichorrhexis nodosa <END> .
The girl also had facial dysmorphism , with a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> and cheeks , broad <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nose <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> .
She had a history of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> intractable diarrhea <END> since 2 weeks of age and <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> requiring lifelong total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hepatomegaly <END> was noted and prompted liver biopsy which demonstrated <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> .
Mental retardation and developmental delay was also found upon examination .
This child may be included in the syndrome of intractable infant <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , an entity known in the gastroenterology literature but yet not reported in the dermatologic literature .
Dermatologists should be aware of this syndrome in which <START:PHENOTYPE> trichorrhexis nodosa <END> is commonly seen .
Child with manifestations of dermotrichic syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis-alopecia-photophobia ( IFAP ) syndrome .
We report on a boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , follicular <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , hypohydrosis , enamel dysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> aganglionic megacolon <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> , vertebral , renal and other anomalies , and a normal chromosome constitution .
The clinical findings include all the features that dermotrichic and <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis-alopecia-photophobia ( IFAP ) syndrome have in common and in addition those that characterize IFAP syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent respiratory infections <END> , etc.) , those that are present only in dermotrichic syndrome ( nail anomalies , hypohydrosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> megacolon <END> , vertebral defects , etc. ) and additional ones (enamel dysplasia , renal anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> , etc. ) . Two maternal uncles were referred as being affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> suggesting <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> transmission .
Various hypotheses concerning the relationship between the 2 syndromes and the present case are discussed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> preauricular tags <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> in three unrelated patients : a <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibulofacial dysostosis <END> distinct from Treacher Collins syndrome .
Treacher Collins syndrome ( TCS , OMIM 154500 ) is a well-defined <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibulofacial dysostosis <END> characterized by symmetric facial anomalies consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> malar hypoplasia <END> , coloboma of the lower eyelid , dysplastic ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and deafness .
Other mandibulofacial dysostoses ( MDs ) such as Toriello ( OMIM 301950 ) , Bauru ( OMIM 604830) , Hedera-Toriello-Petty ( OMIM 608257 ) , and Guion-Almeida ( OMIM 61 0536 ) syndromes are less well characterized and much rarer .
Here we describe three unrelated patients showing clinical features overlapping with TCS , but who in addition have <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and a distinct facial gestalt .
Because of the distinct ear anomalies and the hearing loss a HOXA2 mutation was taken into account .
CHARGE syndrome was discussed because of ear anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> in our patients .
But mutational analyses including sequencing of the TCOF1 , the HOXA2 , and the CHD7 genes , deletion screening of the TCOF1 gene as well as genomewide array analyses revealed normal results .
We suggest that these three patients have a new type of <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibulofacial dysostosis <END> .
As all three cases are sporadic and both sexes are affected the pattern of inheritance might be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
Identification of additional patients will allow to further delineate the phenotype , to assign the inheritance pattern and to identify the molecular basis .
A new acro-cranio-facial dysostosis syndrome in sisters .
Two sisters born to consanguineous parents had a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> acrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , high nose bridge and <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , abnormal external ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> preauricular pits <END> , sensorineural and <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive deafness <END> , proximally placed first toes and digitalized thumbs , bulbous digits , <START:PHENOTYPE> metatarsus adductus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> .
Radiological abnormalities included <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , increased mandibular angle and antegonial notching of mandible ; hypoplastic first metacarpals and metatarsals ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic distal phalanges <END> ; partial duplication of the distal phalanx of the thumb ; malformed malleus and incus ; tall lumbar vertebrae , increased interpedicular distance , and posterior scalloping ; flared iliac wings , narrow supraacetabular regions , acetabular "dysplasia, " and coxa valga .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> is suggested .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistant diabetes <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovaries <END> , hypogonadism , <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinopathy <END> , labyrinthine deafness , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Two sibs , whose parents are first cousins , had diabetes mellitus with hyperinsulinism , insensitive insulin receptors , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> .
Both patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinopathy <END> , secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , labyrinthine deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and cerebral atrophy.
They were disproportionately short with relatively broad hands and feet and slightly <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse face <END> .
The young woman had <START:PHENOTYPE> secondary amenorrhea <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovaries <END> and the boy <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism <END> .
This appears to be the second family with a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder differing from AlstrÃ¶m syndrome by the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and absence of renal insufficiency .
Impaired insulin receptor binding and <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovaries <END> are described as part of this syndrome .
Atlastin1 mutations are frequent in young-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> paraplegia <END> .
Hereditary spastic paraplegias are disorders that are very <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> , both clinically and genetically .
The atlastin1 gene has recently been implicated in SPG3A , a form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pure spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> paraplegia <END> .
Atlastin1 mutations have been identified in 8 families so far . To determine the relative frequency , phenotype , and mutation spectrum of SPG3A in patients with pure <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> paraplegia <END> and onset before age 20 years .
We sequenced the atlastin1 gene in a large series of patients ( 31 families ) in which mutations in the spastin gene , corresponding to the frequent SPG4 locus , had previously been excluded .
The phenotype was compared with 126 SPG4 patients .
We identified 12 families ( 39% ) including 34 patients with 9 different missense atlastin1 mutations , 7 of which are newly described .
The main clinical characteristic of these SPG3A patients was pure spasticity with very young onset of symptoms ( mean age , 4.6 +/- 3.9 years ) and slow progression .
However , additional signs such as decreased vibration sense and wasting in lower limbs , <START:PHENOTYPE> sphincter disturbances <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> were found in a minority of patients .
In addition , several gene carriers were clinically affected but still asymptomatic ( n = 5 ) or had no clinical signs ( n = 2) , indicating <START:PHENOTYPE> incomplete penetrance <END> .
Compared with patients from other families meeting the same diagnostic criteria ( 43 patients ) and families with SPG4 ( 126 patients) , the major form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> paraplegia <END> , SPG3A patients had earlier symptom onset , less frequently <START:PHENOTYPE> increased reflexes <END> in the upper limbs , decreased vibration sense in the lower limbs , and fewer <START:PHENOTYPE> sphincter disturbances <END> , but more frequently observed wasting in the lower limbs and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
These particularities , as well as frequent abnormal motor evoked potentials , could help identify patients to be screened for atlastin1 gene mutations .
This study enables us to estimate the frequency of the SPG3A mutations in France at 39% in families with young-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> paraplegia <END> after exclusion of SPG4 cases .
So far , most mutations have been private , although they were all found in exons 7 , 8 , 12 , and 13 . These exons should be given priority when performing molecular diagnoses for SPG3A .
Recessive inheritance of diabetes : the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and deafness .
A few rare syndromes have been delineated in which <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> is inherited in association with other conditions .
This paper describes five patients , including four siblings in one family , who have <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and deafness ( the DIDMOAD syndrome ) .
The parents of both families are normal but are first cousins .
All the patients have insulin-dependent <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> with a typical juvenile-onset .
The onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> was insidious and the symptoms could easily have been ascribed to poor control of <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> .
The importance of diagnosing <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> is that all these patients had dilatation of the urinary tract varying from mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hydroureter <END> to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> and this improved with treatment of the <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> .
It is suggested that patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> should have regular screening tests for <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> since it is likely that they represent cases of the full syndrome with incomplete clinical expression .
The occurrence of this rare syndrome in four siblings of unaffected parents indicates that the syndrome is due to a recessive gene , but the pathogenesis is unknown .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular prognathism <END> with eye and skin anomalies ( MOMES syndrome ) : a newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
We report two daughters of a Thai family affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , delayed speech , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , craniofacial manifestations , and ocular anomalies .
Craniofacial manifestations included <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , maxillary hypoplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular prognathism <END> , and crowding of teeth .
Ocular anomalies consisted of <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharoptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased visual acuity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> abducens palsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperopic astigmatism <END> , and accommodative <START:PHENOTYPE> esotropia <END> .
Chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> , lateral deviation of the great toes , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cone-shaped epiphyses <END> of the toes were observed .
The disorder is suggested to be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
The combination of findings found in our patients has not hitherto been described .

Visual acuity in children with coloboma : clinical features and a new phenotypic classification system .
The aims of this study were to describe the clinical features and biometric findings in the eyes of children with coloboma and to develop a classification of coloboma that correlates with visual function .
Retrospective observational case series .
One hundred thirteen children and young adults ( 48 female , 65 male ) aged 0 to 20 years with 196 eyes having coloboma .
Children with coloboma were recruited from schools for the blind , integrated education programs , schools for the mentally handicapped , community-based rehabilitation services , and hospital clinics in Andhra Pradesh , India , between January 1998 and January 1999 .
Visual function was assessed , including distance and near visual acuity ( VA) , and navigational vision .
The corneal diameter and axial length of eyes were measured wherever possible .
Anatomic site of coloboma , association with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> , VA , presence of navigational vision and reading vision .
Of 196 eyes with colobomatous malformations , 11 had <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> with cyst , and 185 eyes had coloboma ( associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> in 155 eyes and with a normal corneal diameter in 30 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microphthalmos <END> was present in 72 of the 185 eyes with coloboma , of which 71 of 72 also had <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> .
The prognosis for vision depended on the phenotype of the better eye .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microphthalmos <END> with cyst had the worst prognosis ( VA < 3/60 , 100% ; reading and navigational vision , 0% ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcornea <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> had a worse prognosis than <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> without <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> ( VA < 3/6 0 : 66 .7% vs . 23.3% ; unable to read N1 0 : 66 .7% vs . 34.1 % ; no navigational vision : 30.6 % vs . 6.73% ) .
Simple coloboma ( no <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> ) had the best prognosis ( VA < 3/6 0 : 6.7% ; able to read N1 0 : 93.3% ; navigational vision : 100% ) .
A corneal diameter <6 mm had a poor visual prognosis , whereas a corneal diameter >1 0 mm had a good prognosis .
A phenotypic classification of coloboma is proposed , which in this study showed a good correlation with visual acuity , reading , and navigational vision .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microphthalmos <END> with cyst had the worst prognosis , coloboma with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> a poor prognosis , coloboma with only <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> had an intermediate prognosis , and simple coloboma had the best prognosis .
A syndrome of primary combined <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , growth failure and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> .
A male infant with primary combined <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with marked <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , and growth failure of prenatal onset is presented .
He developed progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> in the 3rd year of life and died at 42 months from disseminated aspergillosis .
Laboratory studies and post mortem examination failed to reveal any known aetiology for his disorder .
Hreidarsson et al . [3 ] previously described a syndrome of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> and growth failure in three boys , with similar clinical and laboratory findings .
Although extensive immunological investigations were not performed in those previous patients , recurrent infections in two of them are suggestive of <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> .
In the light of the immunological findings in our patient , we propose that the condition of the four patients belongs to the same syndrome , which has to be considered as a primary combined <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> syndrome .
This syndrome can be distinguished from the other known <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> syndromes by its associated characteristic features , namely <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , growth failure of prenatal onset and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> .
Missense mutations in ITPR1 cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
Congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> is characterized by early gross <START:PHENOTYPE> motor delay <END> , hypotonia , gait <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysmetria <END> .
The clinical presentation remains fairly stable and may be associated with cerebellar atrophy.
To date , only a few families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> have been reported .
Linkage to 3pter was demonstrated in one large Australian family and this locus was designated spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 29.
The objective of this study is to describe an unreported Canadian family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and to identify the underlying genetic causes in this family and the original Australian family .
Exome sequencing was performed for the Australian family , resulting in the identification of a heterozygous mutation in the ITPR1 gene .
For the Canadian family , genotyping with microsatellite markers and Sanger sequencing of ITPR1 gene were performed ; a heterozygous missense mutation in ITPR1 was identified .
ITPR1 encodes inositol 1 ,4,5-trisphosphate receptor , type 1 , a ligand-gated ion channel that mediates calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum .
Deletions of ITPR1 are known to cause spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 15 , a distinct and very slowly progressive form of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> with onset in adulthood .
Our study demonstrates for the first time that , in addition to spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 15 , alteration of ITPR1 function can cause a distinct congenital nonprogressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ; highlighting important <START:PHENOTYPE> clinical heterogeneity <END> associated with the ITPR1 gene and a significant role of the ITP R1- related pathway in the development and maintenance of the normal functions of the cerebellum .
Dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> : a syndrome caused by a missense mutation in OPA1 .
To describe the clinical features of and identify the disease-causing mutation in a large Utah family segregating a dominantly inherited syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> .
Observational case series .
Thirty individuals at risk for a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> in a single family underwent clinical examinations and venipuncture .
Linkage analysis and mutation screening of the <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> 1 gene ( OPA1 ) were performed .
Eighteen individuals demonstrated characteristics of the syndrome .
Genetic analysis identified a G-->A substitution at nucleotide position 1334 in exon 14 of OPA1 causing an arginine-to-histidine change ( R445H ) in all affected members of the family .
This change segregated with the disease phenotype in the study family with a LOD score of 7. 02 at theta ; = 0 and was not found in 200 normal control subjects .
Analysis of an unrelated Belgian family with a similar phenotype revealed the same R445H mutation segregating with the disease phenotype .
This study describes a mutation in OPA1 causing a unique syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> .
These results expand the spectrum of human disease associated with mutations of OPA1 and indicate that ophthalmologists caring for patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> should inquire about possible associated hearing loss .
Although OPA1 is a nuclear gene , the gene product localizes to mitochondria , suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction may be the final common pathway for many forms of syndromic and nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , hearing loss , and external <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> .
Very few patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> have been described .
Information about clinical course , familial studies or evolution after renal transplantation is very scant .
We have studied eight patients with this syndrome who belong to five different families .
The mean age at diagnosis was 15 +/- 7 years ( 5 to 25 years ) .
The primary clinical data were polyuria-polydipsia ( 8 cases) , ocular abnormalities (5 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent urinary tract infections <END> (5 ) and recurrent renal colics with stone passage (2 ) .
Bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> was observed in all cases .
Every patient showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> ( 1 .1 +/- 0.2 mg/dl ) with inappropriately high urinary magnesium ( Mg ) excretions (7 0 +/- 17 mg/day ) , Mg clearances ( 4.4 +/- 1.2 ml/m ) and Mg fractional excretions ( 16 .2 +/- 7.1% ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypercalciuria <END> was present in every case except in those with advanced renal insufficiency .
Serum parathormone levels were abnormally high .
Serum calcium ( Ca) , phosphorus and potassium , and urinary excretions of uric acid and oxalate were normal .
Neither chronic oral Mg administration nor thiazide diuretics normalized serum Mg levels or urinary Ca excretions , respectively .
Follow-up was 6 +/- 4.5 years .
Renal function worsened in every case with six patients starting on chronic dialysis after 4.3 +/- 3.8 years .
The progression rate of renal insufficiency correlated with the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> .
Five patients have received a kidney graft , and their serum Mg and urinary Ca have always been within normal values after transplantation .
Twenty-six members of four of the affected families were studied : none of them showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> , renal insufficiency or <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> .
However , eleven cases ( 42% ) had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and four of them presented with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> renal stones <END> .
Two family members had medullary sponge kidneys .
In conclusion , progression to renal insufficiency is common in this syndrome ; oral Mg and thiazide diuretics are ineffective to correct abnormalities .
After kidney graft , tubular handling of Mg and Ca was normal .
A striking incidence ( 42% ) of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> was found in the familial study .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Glutaric aciduria <END> type II: review of the phenotype and report of an unusual glomerulopathy.
A male infant with <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> II secondary to electron transfer flavoprotein : ubiquinone oxidoreductase deficiency is compared to previously reported cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> II. A common pattern of anomalies in patients with malformations ( 8 /16 ) includes <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large anterior fontanelle <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> malformed ears <END> .
Abnormalities such as hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral gliosis <END> , heterotopias , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic periportal necrosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidneys <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> genital defects <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> II are reminiscent of those in Zellweger syndrome , whereas elevations of glutaric , ethylmalonic , adipic , and isovaleric acids are quite distinctive .
A unique ultrastructural alteration of the glomerular basement membrane was observed in the proposita .
This manifestation may represent an early stage in renal cyst formation and provide a diagnostic criterion for <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric aciduria <END> II when enzyme studies are unavailable .
Ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 2 : clinical , biological and genotype/phenotype correlation study of a cohort of 90 patients .
Ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 2 ( AOA2 ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disease due to mutations in the senataxin gene , causing progressive cerebellar ataxia with peripheral neuropathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> , occasional <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> and elevated alpha-feto-protein ( AFP ) serum level .
We compiled a series of 67 previously reported and 58 novel ataxic patients who underwent senataxin gene sequencing because of suspected AOA2 .
An AOA2 diagnosis was established for 90 patients , originating from 15 countries worldwide , and 25 new senataxin gene mutations were found .
In patients with AOA2 , median AFP serum level was 31. 0 microg/l at diagnosis , which was higher than the median AFP level of AOA2 negative patients : 13.8 microg/l , P = 0.0004 ; itself higher than the normal level ( 3.4 microg/l , range from 0.5 to 17. 2 microg/l ) because elevated AFP was one of the possible selection criteria .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Polyneuropathy <END> was found in 97.5 % of AOA2 patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> in 96% , occasional <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> in 51 % , pyramidal signs in 20.5% , <START:PHENOTYPE> head tremor <END> in 14% , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> in 13.5% , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> in 12 .3% and <START:PHENOTYPE> chorea <END> in 9.5 % . No patient was lacking both peripheral neuropathy and cerebellar atrophy.
The age at onset and presence of occasional <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> were negatively correlated to the progression rate of the disease ( P = 0.03 and P = 0.009 , respectively) , whereas <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> was positively correlated to the progression rate ( P = 0.03 ) .
An increased AFP level as well as <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> seem to be stable in the course of the disease and to occur mostly at or before the onset of the disease .
One of the two patients with a normal AFP level at diagnosis had high AFP levels 4 years later , while the other had borderline levels .
The probability of missing AOA2 diagnosis , in case of sequencing senataxin gene only in non-Friedreich ataxia non-ataxia-telangiectasia ataxic patients with AFP level > or =7 microg/l , is 0.23% and the probability for a non-Friedreich ataxia non-ataxia-telangiectasia ataxic patient to be affected with AOA2 with AFP levels > or =7 microg/l is 46 % .
Therefore , selection of patients with an AFP level above 7 microg/l for senataxin gene sequencing is a good strategy for AOA2 diagnosis .
Pyramidal signs and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> were more frequent and disease was less severe with missense mutations in the helicase domain of senataxin gene than with missense mutations out of helicase domain and deletion and nonsense mutations ( P = 0.001 , P = 0.008 and P = 0.01 , respectively ) .
The lack of pyramidal signs in most patients may be explained by masking due to severe motor neuropathy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> ( MELAS ) : adolescent onset with severe cerebral edema .
A 19-year-old woman with long-standing <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral cataracts <END> and mild clumsiness , presented with acute focal edema in the left temperoparieto-occipital area which required surgical decompression as a life-saving measure .
Investigation revealed a persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidemia <END> and evidence of many ragged red fibres in a skeletal muscle biopsy specimen , suggesting a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> ( MELAS ) syndrome .
The patient developed two further <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> over a short period .
One sibling died at the age of 14 years with a progressive neurological illness characterised by seizures , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , ataxia , myoclonus and <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive dementia <END> .
The diagnosis of MELAS syndrome should be considered in young people presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> that fail to conform to a given vascular territory , particularly if they have long-standing minor neurological abnormalities or a family history of obscure early onset neurological disease .
The different clinical pictures in the two affected siblings in this family suggest that MELAS syndrome is part of a spectrum of inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> cytopathies rather than a discrete disease entity .
Cardiac involvement in <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> : specific myocardiopathy or consequence of <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic hypertension <END> ?
To evaluate the relative contributions of past or present GH hypersecretion and of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> to the cardiac abnormalities present in <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> , we have studied the serum GH and insulin-like growth factor I concentrations , systolic and diastolic blood pressures , and morphological and functional cardiac indexes as measured by echocardiography-Doppler , in 39 patients with active or cured <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> , 16 hypertensive controls , and 17 normotensive controls .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertension <END> was present in 42.8 % of patients with active <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> and in 28.0% of patients in which <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> was cured .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertension <END> was independently related to an increase in indexes of cardiac morphology ( left ventricular mass , left ventricular posterior wall thickness , interventricular septum thickness , relative wall thickness with respect to the diastolic diameter of the left ventricle , and left atrial end-systolic diameter ) , systolic function ( stroke volume , fractional shortening , and end-systolic stress ) , and diastolic function ( isovolumic relaxation time and maximal late diastolic flow velocity ) and to a reduction in the early to late maximal diastolic flow velocity ratio .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Acromegaly <END> was related to an increase in left ventricular mass , stroke volume , cardiac output , and isovolumic relaxation time , which were independent from the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
End-systolic stress was reduced by <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> .
In the five patients in which active <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> was successfully treated , left ventricular mass and left ventricular posterior wall thickness were reduced 1 yr later .
In conclusion , the asymptomatic morphological and functional cardiac abnormalities present in acromegalic patients are independently related to <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , pointing to the existence to a specific acromegalic myocardiopathy that might be aggravated by the coexistence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
Premature <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> associated with monogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> .
The common <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> syndrome , with obesity , <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslipidemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperglycemia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , is associated with increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> .
Early <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> in rare monogenic forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , however , has not been extensively documented .
Cardiovascular end points were thus evaluated in subjects with Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy ( FPLD ) due to mutations at LMNA codon 482 .
FPLD subjects >/=35 years old were stratified by genotype for either the LMNA R482Q or R482W mutation .
Twenty-three subjects were heterozygous mutation carriers , and 17 were R482/R482 homozygous family control subjects .
All LMNA mutation carriers had FPLD with <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> .
In addition , LMNA mutation carriers had significantly more type 2 diabetes , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslipidemia <END> than normal family control subjects .
Eight LMNA mutation carriers had coronary heart disease ( CHD) , compared with 1 normal control subject ( OR 5 .9 , 95 % CI 1.2 to 30.2 ) .
Six LMNA mutation carriers had CHD end points before age 55 years , and 4 of these , all women , had been hospitalized for CABG surgery between the ages of 35 and 54 years .
Rare LMNA mutations that underlie FPLD with <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> are also associated with early CHD , notably in women .
This suggests that abnormalities of the nuclear envelope can result in a phenotype that recapitulates most of the important attributes of the common <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> syndrome , including accelerated cardiovascular disease .
FPLD thus appears to be an appropriate human monogenic model for the common <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> syndrome .
A common MUC5B promoter polymorphism and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
The mutations that have been implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> account for only a small proportion of the population risk .
Using a genomewide linkage scan , we detected linkage between idiopathic interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> and a 3.4-Mb region of chromosome 11p15 in 82 families .
We then evaluated genetic variation in this region in gel-forming mucin genes expressed in the lung among 83 subjects with familial interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> , 492 subjects with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> , and 322 controls .
MUC5B expression was assessed in lung tissue .
Linkage and fine mapping were used to identify a region of interest on the p-terminus of chromosome 11 that included gel-forming mucin genes .
The minor-allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rs3570595 0 , located 3 kb upstream of the MUC5B transcription start site , was present at a frequency of 34% among subjects with familial interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> , 38 % among subjects with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> , and 9% among controls ( allelic association with familial interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> , P=1.2Ã—10( -15 ) ; allelic association with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> , P=2.5 Ã—10( -37) ) .
The odds ratios for disease among subjects who were heterozygous and those who were homozygous for the minor allele of this SNP were 6.8 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI] , 3.9 to 12.0 ) and 20.8 ( 95 % CI , 3.8 to 113.7) , respectively , for familial interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> and 9. 0 ( 95 % CI , 6.2 to 13.1 ) and 21.8 ( 95 % CI , 5 .1 to 93.5 ) , respectively , for idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
MUC5B expression in the lung was 14 .1 times as high in subjects who had idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> as in those who did not ( P< 0.001 ) .
The variant allele of rs35705950 was associated with up-regulation in MUC5B expression in the lung in unaffected subjects ( expression was 37. 4 times as high as in unaffected subjects homozygous for the wild-type allele , P< 0.001 ) .
MUC5B protein was expressed in lesions of idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
A common polymorphism in the promoter of MUC5B is associated with familial interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> and idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .
Our findings suggest that dysregulated MUC5B expression in the lung may be involved in the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> .

The rational clinical examination .
Does this patient have <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> ?
The association between <START:PHENOTYPE> digital clubbing <END> and a host of diseases has been recognized since the time of Hippocrates .
Although the features of advanced <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> are familiar to most clinicians , the presence of early <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> is often a source of debate .
To perform a systematic review of the literature for information on the precision and accuracy of clinical examination for <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> .
The MEDLINE database from January 1966 to April 1999 was searched for English-language articles related to <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> .
Bibliographies of all retrieved articles and of standard textbooks of physical diagnosis were also searched .
Studies selected for data extraction were those in which quantitative or qualitative assessment for <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> was described in a series of patients .
Sixteen studies met these criteria and were included in the final analysis .
Data were extracted by both authors , who independently reviewed and appraised the quality of each article .
Data extracted included quantitative indices for distinguishing clubbed from normal digits , precision of clinical examination for <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> , and accuracy of <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> as a marker of selected diseases .
The profile angle , hyponychial angle , and phalangeal depth ratio can be used as quantitative indices to assist in identifying <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> .
In individuals without <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> , values for these indices do not exceed 176 degrees , 192 degrees , and 1.0 , respectively .
When clinicians make a global assessment of <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> at the bedside , interobserver agreement is variable , with kappa values ranging between 0.39 and 0.90 . Because of the lack of an objective diagnostic criterion standard , accuracy of physical examination for <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> is difficult to determine .
The accuracy of <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> as a marker of specific underlying disease has been determined for lung cancer ( likelihood ratio , 3.9 with phalangeal depth ratio in excess of 1.0 ) and for inflammatory bowel disease ( likelihood ratio , 2.8 and 3.7 for active Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis , respectively , if <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> is present ) .
We recommend use of the profile angle and phalangeal depth ratio as quantitative indices in identifying <START:PHENOTYPE> clubbing <END> .
Clinical judgment must be exercised in determining the extent of further evaluation for underlying disease when these values exceed 180 degrees and 1.0 , respectively .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperthyroidism <END> in McCune-Albright syndrome with a review of thyroid abnormalities sixty years after the first report .
We present a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> associated with McCune-Albright syndrome ( MAS ) .
MAS is a sporadic genetic disease characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> polyostotic fibrous dysplasia <END> , cafe au lait cutaneous spots and endocrinopathies ( peripheral <START:PHENOTYPE> precocious puberty <END> , thyroidopathies , <START:PHENOTYPE> acromegaly <END> , etc. ) .
It is caused by an activating mutation of the gene for the Gs alpha membrane-associated protein , which mediates the thyrotropin ( TSH)-induced and other hormone-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase .
A 13-month-old girl was diagnosed with MAS .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Precocious puberty <END> was treated initially with testolactone and later with oophorectomy .
Subclinical <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> was detected biochemically at birth , and 10 months later , it became clinically evident , albeit mild , with absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> .
A concomitant liver dysfunction precluded treatment with thionamides and she was sporadically treated with beta-blockers .
The combination of increased free thyroxine ( T4 ) and triiodothyronine ( T3 ) with low plasma thyrotropin ( TSH ) levels in the absence of thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies persisted until the age of 6 years , when she was referred to our unit .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperthyroidism <END> was then clinically evident with cardiac hyperactivity , and it was cured with administration of radioiodine ( 131I ) .
Thyroid disease is the second most common endocrinopathy associated with MAS , and since 1936 , 63 cases of thyroidopathies have been described , including 19 nodular ( 14 with and 5 without <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> ) and 23 diffuse (2 0 with and 3 without <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> ) goiters , and 18 cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> without <START:PHENOTYPE> goiter <END> .
The previously described somatic activating mutation of the gs alpha gene in the ovaries , the liver and the peripheral blood of our patient , in the absence of stigmata , autoimmunity might be incriminated for the secretory and mitotic activation of the thyroid gland .
We suggest the treatment of choice of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> in MAS patients should be 131I administration because : (a ) <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> is very likely to recur after withdrawal of antithyroid medication ; (b ) the morbidity of these patients is elevated ; (c ) oophorectomized patients do not need to be advised to avoid procreation during the months after 131I administration ; and (d ) finally , even in the usual cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> in childhood , 131I treatment is becoming more popular worldwide .
Analysis of the phenotypic abnormalities in lymphoedema-distichiasis syndrome in 74 patients with FOXC2 mutations or linkage to 16q24.
Lymphoedema-distichiasis syndrome ( LD ) ( OMIM 153400 ) is a rare , primary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> of pubertal onset , associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> .
Causative mutations have now been described in FOXC2 , a forkhead transcription factor gene .
Numerous clinical associations have been reported with this condition , including congenital heart disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> varicose veins <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and spinal extradural cysts .
We report clinical findings in 74 affected subjects from 18 families and six isolated cases .
All of them were shown to have mutations in FOXC2 with the exception of one family who had two affected subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> and linkage consistent with the 16q24 locus .
The presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> was highly penetrant .
Males had an earlier onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> and a significantly increased risk of complications .
Lymphatic imaging confirmed the earlier suggestion that LD is associated with a normal or increased number of lymphatic vessels rather than the hypoplasia or aplasia seen in other forms of primary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Distichiasis <END> was 94.2% penetrant , but not always symptomatic .
Associated findings included <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> ( 31% ) , congenital heart disease ( 6.8% ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ( 4% ) . Other than <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> , the most commonly occurring anomaly was <START:PHENOTYPE> varicose veins <END> of early onset ( 49% ) .
This has not been previously reported and suggests a possible developmental role for FOXC2 in both venous and lymphatic systems .
This is the first gene that has been implicated in the aetiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> varicose veins <END> .
Unlike previous publications , the thorough clinical characterisation of our patients permits more accurate prediction of various phenotypic abnormalities likely to manifest in subjects with FOXC2 mutations .
Worldwide variation in prevalence of symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , and atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> : ISAAC .
The International Study of <START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> and Allergies in Childhood ( ISAAC ) Steering Committee .
Systematic international comparisons of the prevalences of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and other allergic disorders in children are needed for better understanding of their global epidemiology , to generate new hypotheses , and to assess existing hypotheses of possible causes .
We investigated worldwide prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , and atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> .
We studied 463 ,801 children aged 13-14 years in 155 collaborating centres in 56 countries .
Children self-reported , through one-page questionnaires , symptoms of these three atopic disorders .
In 99 centres in 42 countries , a video <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> questionnaire was also used for 304 ,796 children .
We found differences of between 20-fold and 60-fold between centres in the prevalence of symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , and atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> , with four-fold to 12-fold variations between the 10th and 90th percentiles for the different disorders .
For <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> symptoms , the highest 12-month prevalences were from centres in the UK , Australia , New Zealand , and Republic of Ireland , followed by most centres in North , Central , and South America ; the lowest prevalences were from centres in several Eastern European countries , Indonesia , Greece , China , Taiwan , Uzbekistan , India , and Ethiopia .
For allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , the centres with the highest prevalences were scattered across the world .
The centres with the lowest prevalences were similar to those for <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> symptoms .
For atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> , the highest prevalences came from scattered centres , including some from Scandinavia and Africa that were not among centres with the highest <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> prevalences ; the lowest prevalence rates of atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> were similar in centres , as for <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> symptoms .
The variation in the prevalences of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , and atopic-eczema symptoms is striking between different centres throughout the world .
These findings will form the basis of further studies to investigate factors that potentially lead to these international patterns .
Subtelomeric deletions of chromosome 6p : molecular and cytogenetic characterization of three new cases with phenotypic overlap with Ritscher-Schinzel ( 3C ) syndrome .
We have identified six children in three families with subtelomeric deletions of 6p25 and a recognizable phenotype consisting of ptosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> posterior embryotoxon <END> , optic nerve abnormalities , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> patent ductus arteriosus <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
There is considerable clinical overlap between these children and individuals with the Ritscher-Schinzel ( or cranio-cerebello-cardiac ( 3C) ) syndrome ( OMIM #220210 ) .
Clinical features of 3C syndrome include craniofacial anomalies ( <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , prominent forehead and occiput , foramina parietalia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular colobomas <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , narrow or <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> ) , cerebellar malformations ( variable manifestations of a <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> with moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ) , and cardiac defects ( primarily septal defects ) .
Since the original report , over 25 patients with 3C syndrome have been reported .
Recessive inheritance has been postulated based on recurrence in siblings born to unaffected parents and parental consanguinity in two familial cases .
Molecular and cytogenetic mapping of the 6p deletions in these three families with subtelomeric deletions of chromosome 6p have defined a 1.3 Mb minimally deleted critical region .
To determine if 6p deletions are common in 3C syndrome , we analyzed seven unrelated individuals with 3C syndrome for deletions of this region .
Three forkhead genes ( FOXF1 and FOXQ1 from within the critical region , and FOXC1 proximal to this region ) were evaluated as potential candidate disease genes for this disorder .
No deletions or disease-causing mutations were identified .
Familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
Mild expression of the gene in heterozygotes and severe expression in homozygotes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> was found in a kindred with neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> primary hyperparathyroidism <END> , previously judged to be an autosomal recessive trait .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> was documented in eight members representing three generations .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> was documented at an age as early as one week .
In seven adults presumed to be heterozygotes , urinary calcium levels were in the same range as for familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
An additional adult member ( who previously underwent parathyroidectomy for neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> primary hyperparathyroidism <END> ) showed an abnormality in renal clearance of calcium and sodium characteristic of combined familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> and surgical hypoparathyroidism .
Parathyroidectomy in three hypercalcemic members did not cause normocalcemia .
Unlike other kindreds with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> in whom <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> is consistent over time and moderate in heterozygotes , this kindred was characterized by heterozygotes showing <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> that was intermittent and mild .
The consanguineous parents of the two previously described severely affected neonates were judged to be heterozygotes for familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
In conclusion , (1 ) a gene presenting as familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> can be expressed as <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> that is intermittent and very mild in heterozygotes ; (2 ) such a gene can cause neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> primary hyperparathyroidism <END> in homozygotes .
Significant overlap and possible identity of <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> capillary malformation and <START:PHENOTYPE> megalencephaly <END> polymicrogyria-polydactyly <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> syndromes .
We report on three patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> , and additional anomalies seen in <START:PHENOTYPE> megalencephaly <END> polymicrogyria-polydactyly <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( MPPH ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> capillary malformation ( MCM ) syndromes .
Based on their characteristic brain malformations they were originally diagnosed with MPPH .
In one patient the phenotype evolved during early infancy , and ultimately resulted in a diagnosis of MCM .
A second was prenatally diagnosed with MPPH , but postnatally visualized capillary malformations led to a diagnosis of MCM .
In a third , the original MPPH diagnosis was reconsidered after a critical review revealed additional subtle findings suggestive of MCM . Characteristic brain malformations are thought to distinguish between MPPH with perisylvian <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> , and MCM with <START:PHENOTYPE> megalencephaly <END> with Chiari 1 malformation . However , <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> was reported in a significant number of patients with MCM .
Conversely , upon review of imaging studies of patients with MPPH , we noted progressive crowding of the posterior fossa and acquired tonsillar herniation , a process deemed characteristic for MCM .
Thus , neither <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> nor acquired tonsillar herniation are distinguishing features , and occur in both disorders .
In addition to brain abnormalities , shared findings include <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> , coarse facial features and <START:PHENOTYPE> postaxial polydactyly <END> .
Facial nevus flammeus and <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis marmorata <END> are most noticeable in infancy , and ligamentous laxity and redundant soft tissue are somewhat subjective findings .
While asymmetric <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> is considered typical for MCM , it is not universally present .
These variable and subtle findings can be identified in patients with MPPH .
We propose that MPPH and MCM may not represent distinct entities and that the term MPPH-CM syndrome be used to describe this spectrum .
A syndrome of hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , delayed and dysharmonic skeletal maturation , and congenital fibre type disproportion .
Three unrelated Puerto Rican boys , ranging in age from 3 to 4 years , had marked , central , non-progressive hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic constipation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> severe psychomotor retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> or abnormal electroencephalograph or both , <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal dermatoglyphics <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> , dysharmonic skeletal maturation , and preponderance and larger size of type 2 muscle fibres .
Additional findings included narrow , <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent nasal root <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> distended abdomen <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> drooling <END> from <START:PHENOTYPE> open mouth <END> .
Two of the three patients also had <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tapered fingers <END> .
Birth weight , postnatal physical growth , and head size were average .
Family and gestational histories and laboratory evaluations were normal .
The combination of features observed in the three boys appears to be distinct and to represent a new syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> malformation complexes explained by abnormal embryonic body curvature .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> malformation complexes characteristically have severe cardiovascular defects and visceral heterotaxy .
We examined the hypothesis that the conditions may arise from an altered timing of development of embryonic body curvature : delayed in <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> , accelerated in <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> .
The morphologic features of the 25 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and 15 with <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> autopsied at The Johns Hopkins Hospital were determined .
The time of appearance of various morphologic features and the evolution of body curvature was studied in 351 staged serially sectioned human embryos of The Carnegie Embryological Collection .
All <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> patients had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> atrioventricular canal <END> malformations .
Bilateral trilobed lungs were found in 12 patients .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> patients had severe interatrial septal defects in 10 patients ; but <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defects <END> in only six .
Bilateral bilobed lungs were seen in five patients .
Comparison of the time of appearance of anatomic structures in normal embryos with the observed malformations suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> complexes originate in stages 13 to 15 .
The observations are consistent with the concept that the malformations in <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polysplenia <END> can be explained by minor alterations in the sequence of development of embryonic body curvature relative to organ maturation .
Lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> with contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> and soft tissue bleeding due to a novel homozygous fibulin-4 gene mutation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cutis laxa <END> is characterised by redundant , inelastic skin with deep wrinkling and additional variable systemic involvement .
Mutations in fibulin-4 ( EFEMP2 ) and fibulin-5 ( FBLN5 ) were described to be causative for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> type 1 in a few families each .
The female patient was born to healthy consanguineous parents .
Pregnancy was remarkable for <START:PHENOTYPE> fetal overgrowth <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> oligohydramnios <END> .
The newborn girl showed extreme <START:PHENOTYPE> bradycardia <END> and died perinatally .
Apart from <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> of hands and feet with contractures of the third to fifth finger , medial rotation of feet , spina bifida of the os sacrum , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and facial dysmorphism were noted .
Autopsy showed collapsed lungs with hypoplastic diaphragm and signs of cervical soft tissue bleedings due to fragility of vessels .
Histologic examination showed fragmentation of elastic fibres with formation of cystic cavities in the medial layer of the aorta and central lung vessels .
Sequencing of the elastin , fibulin-4 and fibulin-5 genes revealed a homozygous missense mutation ( p.Cys267Tyr ) in the fibulin-4 gene in the patient .
Our observation increases the number of cases with fibulin-4 mutations to three and extends the phenotypic spectrum of fibulin-4 mutations by <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> .
Is <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> associated with oculocutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> a " coincidence syndrome " ?
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hearing impairment <END> is frequently found associated with pigmentary disorders in many syndromes .
However , total oculocutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> ( OCA ) associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> has been described only once , by Ziprkowski and Adam ( Arch Dermatol 89:151 -155 , 1964 ) in an inbred family .
A syndrome associating <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and OCA was suggested by the authors , but two separate recessive genes segregating in this inbred group were also proposed later by Fraser ( OMIM # 220900 ) .
Combined <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and total OCA were also observed by us in a family originally reported to be nonconsanguineous but in which haplotyping showed evidence of a common ancestry : the proband was affected by both diseases , one of his sisters had only OCA and another sister had only <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
Both the proband and his deaf sister were found to be homozygotes for the 35delG mutation ( GJB2 gene) , the most frequent cause of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
Linkage analysis with markers close to the four known OCA loci excluded linkage to OCA1 , OCA2 , and OCA3 , and homozygosity in markers near OCA4 locus was observed .
Sequencing of the corresponding gene ( MATP ) revealed a c.1121delT mutation , which leads to a stop codon at position 397 ( L374fsX397 ) .
Clearly , the combined occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> in this pedigree was due to mutations in two different genes , showing <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
We speculate that the putative syndrome reported by Ziprkowski and Adam might have resulted from the co-occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> in the same pedigree , as suggested by Fraser .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> : phenotypic differences in genetically defined subtypes ?
Seventy-seven families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> were analyzed for the CAG repeat expansions causing spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( SCA ) types 1 , 2 , 3 , and 6 .
The SCA1 mutation accounted for 9% , SCA2 for 10% , SCA3 for 42% , and SCA6 for 22% of German <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> families .
Seven of 27 SCA6 patients had no family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
Age at onset correlated inversely with repeat length in all subtypes .
Yet the average effect of one CAG unit on onset age was different for each SCA subtype .
We compared clinical , electrophysiological , and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) findings to identify phenotypic characteristics of genetically defined SCA subtypes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Slow saccades <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyporeflexia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> action tremor <END> proposed SCA2 .
SCA3 patients frequently developed <START:PHENOTYPE> diplopia <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> or pronounced peripheral neuropathy , and impaired temperature discrimination , apart from <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
SCA6 presented with a predominantly cerebellar syndrome and patients often had onset after 55 years of age .
SCA1 was characterized by markedly prolonged peripheral and central motor conduction times in motor evoked potentials .
MRI scans showed pontine and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> in SCA1 and SCA2 .
In SCA3 , enlargement of the fourth ventricle was the main sequel of atrophy.
SCA6 presented with pure <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> on MRI . However , overlap between the four SCA subtypes was broad .
Effect of family history , body-fat distribution , and reproductive factors on the risk of postmenopausal <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
A family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> reflects shared cultural factors , genetic predisposition , or both .
There is evidence that the estimated risk associated with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> increases multiplicatively in combination with other risk factors .
We examined the combined effect of family history and anthropometric and reproductive factors on the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in postmenopausal women .
Using data from a prospective cohort study , we studied 37 ,105 women 55 to 69 years of age to determine whether known risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> are modified by a reported family history at the time of entry into the study .
During the first 4 years of follow-up , 493 new breast cancers were diagnosed .
The association of the waist-to-hip ratio ( the circumference of the waist divided by that of the hips ) with the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> was limited predominantly to women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> ; the age-adjusted relative risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> for the women above the fourth quintile for waist-to-hip ratio as compared with those below the first quintile was 3.2 in women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and 1.2 for women without such a family history .
An interaction was observed between a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and the number of live-born children ; the protective effect of higher parity was observed primarily among women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Similarly , the age-adjusted relative risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> associated with a late age at first pregnancy ( i .e. , greater than or equal to 30 years ) was 5.8 for women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and 2.0 for women without such a family history .
The increase in the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> associated with a high waist-to-hip ratio , low parity , or greater age at first pregnancy is more pronounced among women with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
These findings suggest etiologic differences between familial <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and the sporadic form .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lissencephaly <END> has been described in over 10 distinct malformation syndromes .
Recently , we have recognized 5 children from four unrelated families with an almost identical disorder comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with a posterior-to-anterior gradient and only moderate increase in thickness of the cortex , <START:PHENOTYPE> absent corpus callosum <END> , neonatal-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , hypothalamic dysfunction including deficient temperature regulation , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> in genotypic males .
Our observation of 5 affected males in one of these families is consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> pattern of inheritance .
However , it differs in many regards from the <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked form <END> of isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> sequence that is associated with mutations of the XLIS ( DCX ) gene .
Therefore , we propose that this disorder comprises a new <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> malformation syndrome , which we refer to as <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> ( XLA-G ) .

A new <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> transfer RNAPro gene mutation associated with myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> and other neurological features .
Pathogenic mutations of the human <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome are associated with well-characterized , progressive neurological syndromes , with mutations in the transfer RNA genes being particularly prominent .
To describe a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> transfer RNA( Pro ) gene mutation in a woman with a myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with ragged-red fibers-like disease .
Design , Setting , and Patient Case report of a 49-year-old woman presenting with a myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with ragged-red fibers-like disease comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonic jerks <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , and proximal <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> .
Histochemical analysis of a muscle biopsy revealed numerous cytochrome-c oxidase-deficient , <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> , while biochemical studies indicated decreased activity of respiratory chain complex I . Molecular investigation of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA revealed a new heteroplasmic mutation in the TpsiC stem of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> transfer RNA( Pro ) gene that segregated with cytochrome-c oxidase deficiency in single muscle fibers .
Our case serves to illustrate the ever-evolving phenotypic spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA disease and the importance of performing comprehensive <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genetic studies in the absence of common <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations .
Mutations in the gene encoding neutrophil elastase in congenital and cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> and cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> are disorders of neutrophil production predisposing patients to <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent bacterial infections <END> .
Recently the locus for autosomal dominant cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> was mapped to chromosome 19p13.3 , and this disease is now attributable to mutations of the gene encoding neutrophil elastase ( the ELA2 gene ) .
The authors hypothesized that congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is also due to mutations of neutrophil elastase .
Patients with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , or Shwachman-Diamond syndrome were referred to the Severe Chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> Neutropenia <END> International Registry .
Referring physicians provided hematologic and clinical data .
Mutational analysis was performed by sequencing polymerase chain reaction ( PCR )-amplified genomic DNA for each of the 5 exons of the neutrophil ELA2 gene and 20 bases of the flanking regions .
RNA from bone marrow mononuclear cells was used to determine if the affected patients expressed both the normal and the abnormal transcript .
Twenty-two of 25 patients with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> had 18 different heterozygous mutations .
Four of 4 patients with cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> and 0 of 3 patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome had mutations .
For 5 patients with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> having mutations predicted to alter RNA splicing or transcript structure , reverse transcriptase-PCR showed expression of both normal and abnormal transcripts .
In cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> , the mutations appeared to cluster near the active site of the molecule , whereas the opposite face was predominantly affected by the mutations found in congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
This study indicates that mutations of the gene encoding neutrophil elastase are probably the most common cause for severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> as well as the cause for sporadic and autosomal dominant cyclic <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in predicting ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> in patients with cerebrovascular disease .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> or transient ischemic attack are at high risk of another <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> , and there is need for improved strategies to predict recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
To assess the prognostic value of levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( sVCAM-1 ) , N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP) , C-reactive protein , homocysteine , renin , and lipids and lipoprotein particle concentration and size in patients with previous <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> or transient ischemic attack .
A nested case-control study of participants of the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> Stroke <END> Study was performed .
The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> Stroke <END> Study was a placebo-controlled trial of a perindopril erbumine-based , blood pressure-lowering regimen that reduced ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> risk by 24% among individuals with previous <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> or transient ischemic attack .
Each of 252 patients who experienced ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> during a mean follow-up of 3.9 years was matched to 1 to 3 control patients .
Matching variables were age , sex , treatment allocated , region , and most recent qualifying event at randomization . Risk of ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> predicted by baseline levels of sVCAM-1 , NT-proBNP , C-reactive protein , homocysteine , renin , and lipids and lipoprotein particle concentration and size .
Levels of sVCAM-1 and NT-proBNP predicted recurrent ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
The odds ratio for patients in the highest , as compared with the lowest , quarter was 2.24 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.35-3.73 ) for sVCAM-1 level and 1.62 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.98-2.69 ) for NT-proBNP level , after adjustment for matching and other risk factors .
Patients in the highest quarters for both sVCAM-1 and NT-proBNP levels had 3.6 times the risk of recurrent ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> compared with patients in the lowest quarters for both biologic markers .
Level of sVCAM-1 was similarly predictive of ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> in patients allocated to placebo and perindopril-based therapy .
Baseline plasma levels of C-reactive protein , homocysteine , renin , and lipids and lipoprotein particle concentration and size did not predict recurrent ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> risk .
Measurement of sVCAM-1 and NT-proBNP levels provides prognostic information for recurrent ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> beyond traditional risk factors .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Polyhydramnios <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> fetal overgrowth <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> : prenatal ultrasound findings of Costello syndrome .
Costello syndrome is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome consisting of dysmorphic facies , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Complications include <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> , and benign and malignant tumors .
This report describes a new case of Costello syndrome in a preterm infant born at 27 weeks gestation and diagnosed with Costello syndrome at 7 weeks of life who died at 6 months of age due to cardiac and pulmonary complications .
In addition , data were compiled from parent surveys including growth parameters on 16 infants who were subsequently diagnosed with Costello syndrome and had mutation confirmation .
The most common prenatal findings in the literature and in this cohort were <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> fetal overgrowth <END> with relative <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> .
Based on this study , ultrasound identification of <START:PHENOTYPE> polyhydramnios <END> in the context of prenatal <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> , especially with relative <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , needs to raise the possibility of a diagnosis of Costello syndrome in the fetus because of the life-threatening cardiac complications that may occur early in the newborn period .
A new Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with craniofacial characteristics , <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple congenital contractures <END> , progressive joint and skin laxity , and multisystem fragility-related manifestations .
We previously described two unrelated patients showing characteristic facial and skeletal features , overlapping with the kyphoscoliosis type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ( EDS ) but without lysyl hydroxylase deficiency [Kosho et al . (2005 ) Am J Med Genet Part A 138 A:282-287 ] .
After observations of them over time and encounter with four additional unrelated patients , we have concluded that they represent a new clinically recognizable type of EDS with distinct craniofacial characteristics , <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple congenital contractures <END> , progressive joint and skin laxity , and multisystem fragility-related manifestations .
The patients exhibited strikingly similar features according to their age : craniofacial , <START:PHENOTYPE> large fontanelle <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , short and <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , short nose with hypoplastic columella , low-set and rotated ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , thin vermilion of the upper lip , small mouth , and micro-retrognathia in infancy ; slender and asymmetric face with protruding jaw from adolescence ; skeletal , congenital contractures of fingers , wrists , and hips , and <START:PHENOTYPE> talipes equinovarus <END> with anomalous insertions of flexor muscles ; progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> dislocations <END> ; slender and/or cylindrical fingers and progressive talipes valgus and cavum or planus , with diaphyseal narrowing of phalanges , metacarpals , and metatarsals ; pectus deformities ; <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> or kyphoscoliosis with decreased physiological curvatures of thoracic spines and tall vertebrae ; cutaneous , progressive hyperextensibility , <START:PHENOTYPE> bruisability <END> , and fragility with atrophic scars ; fine palmar creases in childhood to acrogeria-like prominent wrinkles in adulthood , recurrent subcutaneous infections with fistula formation ; cardiovascular , cardiac valve abnormalities , recurrent large subcutaneous hematomas from childhood ; gastrointestinal , <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> , diverticula perforation ; respiratory , ( hemo )pneumothorax ; and ophthalmological , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , refractive errors .

Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , Down syndrome-like facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> : two additional cases .
An apparently new syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , Down syndrome-like facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> was described by Gripp et al . 1996 .
The authors reported on two unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , distinctive facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and skeletal changes .
We report on two additional patients with findings most similar to the reported patients by Gripp et al . 1996 , including <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral congenital cataracts <END> , hearing loss , craniofacial abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , skeletal abnormalities , and developmental delay .
Both of the patients reported herein had chromosome microarray analysis , which showed normal results in Patient 2 but abnormal results in Patient 1 and his mother who both had a chromosome 11q25 subtelomere deletion .
Patient 1 and his mother 's findings are atypical for the common findings reported in Jacobsen syndrome ( 11 q terminal deletion syndrome ) , and consistent with the patients reported by Gripp et al . 1996 .
The etiology for these cases has been unknown .
The microarray results on Patient 1 suggest that the other patients with findings of developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , sensorineural hearing loss , and similar craniofacial features may have either a microdeletion of chromosome 11q terminal region or haploinsufficiency of a gene localized to this region .

Families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> brachydactyly type E , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
Rare , monogenic forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> may give insight into novel mechanisms relevant to essential <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> with brachydactyly has been documented in a single Turkish kindred ; the gene was mapped to chromosome 12p. To describe the molecular genetics of additional families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly .
Case series .
Tertiary care medical centers .
An 11-member Canadian family and a 7-member U.S . family , neither of Turkish background , with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and type E brachydactyly .
Clinical evaluation , genotyping , and haplotype analyses .
The mode of inheritance , the type E brachydactyly , and the propensity for stroke were consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> with brachydactyly .
The same markers on chromosome 12p cosegregated with the phenotype in the families .
A haplotype analysis strongly supported the conclusion that these families have a molecular defect in the same gene .
The syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly is not confined to patients of Turkish origin .
All persons with brachydactyly should have their blood pressure measured , and the syndrome should be considered if <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> is found .
MICRO syndrome : an entity distinct from COFS syndrome .
Children born with the findings of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , cataracts and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> can result not only from a prenatal viral infection , but also from an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> Mendelian disorders .
We present three pairs of affected siblings with MICRO syndrome , who were born with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , and cataracts .
MICRO syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome consisting of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , cortical dysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , cataracts , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , hypotonic diplegia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogenitalism <END> .
At birth , MICRO syndrome resembles Cerebro-Oculo-Facio-Skeletal ( COFS ) syndrome , but it differs in the lack of the rapidly progressive neurologic features leading to severe brain atrophy with calcifications .
Patients with MICRO syndrome manifest frontal cortical dysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of the corpus callosum <END> , cortical blindness with <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , profound <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and progressive joint contractures with growth failure .
COFS syndrome shares also many clinical and cellular similarities with Cockayne syndrome ( CS) , and cultured cells in both conditions demonstrate hypersensitivity to ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation due to impaired nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) .
NER studies in cultured fibroblasts from MICRO patients give normal results , so MICRO syndrome should be considered in children with features resembling COFS syndrome and CS , but who have normal NER . MICRO should be distinguished from other similar clinical disorders with normal NER by the presence of significant visual impairment and cortical blindness despite early surgery for <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , frontal polymicrogyria , <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> , and cortical atrophy by MRI .

[ Juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> : a new syndrome ] .
Predisposition is responsible for approximately 5 0 % of age-related <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
Investigation of inherited forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> provides the opportunity to identify the genes that may play a role in age-related <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> as well .
We describe the phenotype of a Swiss family with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> .
11 of 17 family members in three generations underwent ophthalmic assessment and urine analysis .
Medical records or questionnaires were evaluated in the remaining six cases . Eleven family members had progressive juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> .
Eight affected members available for clinical examination had bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , not associated with microphthalmos .
Furthermore , renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> was demonstrated in six of these persons .
The mode of inheritance is autosomal-dominant .
We have defined a new syndrome , consisting of the association of juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> .
The pattern of inheritance is autosomal-dominant .
Genotyping is ongoing .
Location and type of mutation in the LIS1 gene do not predict phenotypic severity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lissencephaly <END> is a neuronal migration disorder leading to absent or reduced gyration and a broadened but poorly organized cortex .
The most common form of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> is isolated , referred as classic or type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> is mostly associated with a heterozygous deletion of the entire LIS1 gene , whereas intragenic heterozygous LIS1 mutations or hemizygous DCX mutations in males are less common .
Eighteen unrelated patients with type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> were clinically and genetically assessed .
In addition , patients with subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> ( n = 1 ) or <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> ( n = 2 ) were included .
Fourteen new and seven previously described LIS1 mutations were identified .
We observed nine truncating mutations ( nonsense , n = 2 ; frameshift , n = 7) , six splice site mutations , five missense mutations , and one in-frame deletion .
Somatic mosaicism was assumed in three patients with partial subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> in the occipital-parietal lobes or mild <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> .
We report three mutations in exon 11 , including a frameshift which extends the LIS1 protein , leading to type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> and illustrating the functional importance of the WD domains at the C terminus .
Furthermore , we present two patients with novel LIS1 mutations in exon 10 associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> type a . In contrast to previous reports , our data suggest that neither type nor position of intragenic mutations in the LIS1 gene allows an unambiguous prediction of the phenotypic severity .
Furthermore , patients presenting with mild cerebral malformations such as subcortical band <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> should be considered for genetic analysis of the LIS1 gene .
Transient RLS during pregnancy is a risk factor for the chronic idiopathic form .
Pregnancy is a risk factor for transient <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> , which usually recovers during the postdelivery period .
The goal of the present survey is to investigate whether <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> during pregnancy represents a risk factor for later development of <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> .
A long-term follow-up study , planned as an extension of a previous survey on <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> during pregnancy , was carried out .
After a mean interval of 6.5 years , 207 parous women were contacted again to compare the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> among subjects who never experienced the symptoms with those who reported <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> during the previously investigated pregnancy .
Seventy-four women who experienced <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> during previous pregnancy , and 133 who did not , were included in the study .
The incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> was 56 % person/year in women who experienced the transient pregnancy <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> form , and 12 .6 % person/year in subjects who did not , with a significant 4-fold increased risk of developing chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> in women who presented <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs <END> in the previous pregnancy .
Considering further new pregnancies during the follow-up period , the <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs <END> symptoms reappeared in 58 % of the cases , while they emerged for the first time in only 3% of women who had never experienced <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> .
The transient pregnancy <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> form is a significant risk factor for the development of a future chronic idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> form , and for a new transient symptomatology in a future pregnancy .
ASPM mutations identified in patients with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Human <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( MCPH ) is a heterogeneous disorder with at least six genetic loci ( MCPH1-6) , with MCPH5 , caused by ASPM mutation , being the most common .
Despite the high prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with frequent <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> has been excluded from the ascertainment of MCPH .
Here , we report a pedigree with multiple affected individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
To identify the gene responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in this pedigree .
Clinical assessments of three patients and brain MRIs of two patients were obtained .
Genome-wide linkage screen with 10 k SNP microarray , fine mapping with microsatellite markers , and mutational analysis of the genomic DNA were performed on the pedigree .
We found that the family was linked to the MCPH5 locus on chromosome 1q31.2-q32 .1 .
We screened ASPM and identified a previously unreported nonsense mutation that introduced a premature stop codon in exon 18 of the ASPM gene .
We thus expand the clinical spectrum of ASPM mutations by showing that they can occur in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and that the history of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> alone should not necessarily preclude the diagnosis of primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome consisting of posterior <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> , retinitis pigmentosa , <START:PHENOTYPE> foveoschisis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic disc drusen <END> is caused by a MFRP gene mutation .
To describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of a new ophthalmic syndrome , which consists of posterior <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> , retinitis pigmentosa , <START:PHENOTYPE> foveoschisis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic disc drusen <END> , that segregates as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait in a family with four affected siblings .
The membrane-type frizzled-related protein ( MFRP ) and CEH10 homeodomain-containing homolog ( CHX10 ) genes , previously implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> forms of nanophthalmos/microphthalmos , were analyzed as candidate genes for this novel disease .
Complete ophthalmologic examinations were performed in four affected siblings and their parents .
Ophthalmologic manifestations , fundus photographs , ultrasonographic ( US ) assessment , electroretinography ( ERG) , fluorescein retinal angiography ( FA) , Goldmann kinetic perimetry ( GKP) , and optical coherence tomography ( OCT) , as well as mutational status of MFRP and CHX10 genes in genomic DNA .
In all affected siblings , ophthalmologic examination demonstrated normal horizontal corneal diameters and high hyperopia ; funduscopy , ERG , and FA evidenced a progressive retinal dystrophy compatible with retinitis pigmentosa ; A- and B-mode ultrasonography revealed decreased axial eye length and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic disc drusen <END> ; OCT showed localized macular retinoschisis .
MFRP molecular analysis disclosed a one base pair insertion in exon 5 ( c.498_499insC ) in all affected individuals , a mutation that predicts a truncated protein ( P165fsX198 ) .
Both parents were heterozygous for this mutation .
A distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ophthalmic syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmos <END> , retinitis pigmentosa , <START:PHENOTYPE> foveoschisis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic disc drusen <END> is described .
We demonstrated that this clinical association is caused by a mutation in MFRP , a gene previously implicated in isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> nanophthalmos <END> .
Our data indicate that defects in MFRP could be responsible for syndromic forms of microphthalmos/retinal degeneration and that this gene is necessary for photoreceptor maintenance .
High <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> and glaucoma susceptibility the Beijing Eye Study . To evaluate whether marked <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , compared with moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> and low <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , is associated with a higher prevalence of glaucomatous optic nerve damage .
Population-based cross-sectional study .
Four thousand four hundred thirty-nine of 5324 subjects 40 years or older were invited to participate ( response rate , 83.4% ) .
The group was stratified according to refractive error into high <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> > -8 diopters [D] ) , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( <-6 to -8 D) , moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( <-3 to -6 D) , low <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( <-0.5 to -3 D) , emmetropia ( - 0.5 to + <2 D) , and hyperopia ( > + 2 D ) subgroups .
Morphologic assessment of optic disc monoscopic photographs .
Morphologic optic disc parameters and intraocular pressure ( IOP ) .
For 4319 ( 97.3% ) subjects ( 8484 eyes) , optic disc photographs were evaluated .
Prevalence of glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy as defined by the glaucomatous optic nerve head appearance did not vary significantly ( P = 0.77 ; odds ratio [ OR] , 1.2 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI] , 0.38-3.81 ) between the highly myopic group and the group with marked <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> .
In both refractive groups combined , glaucoma frequency seemed to be higher ( P = 0.075 ; OR , 2.28 ; 95 % CI , 0.99-5.25 ) higher than in the group with moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ; it was significantly ( P = 0.001 ; OR , 3.5 ; 95 % CI , 1.71 -7.25 ) higher than in the group with low <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ; significantly ( P< 0.001 ; OR , 7.56 ; 95 % CI , 3.98-14 .35 ) higher than in the group with emmetropia ; and significantly ( P = 0.005 ; OR , 4.23; 95 % CI , 1.57-11 .45 ) higher than in the group with hyperopia .
Glaucoma frequency did not vary significantly between the hyperopic group and the emmetropic group ( P = 0.17 ) , the group with low <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( P = 0.83) , and the group with moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> ( P = 0.32 ) .
Intraocular pressure did not vary significantly ( P> 0.10 ) between any of the subgroups .
Similar results were obtained for the frequency of glaucoma defined as glaucomatous optic disc appearance and visual field defects .
In binary logistic regression analysis , presence of glaucoma was significantly associated with the myopic refractive error ( P< 0.001 ) , age ( P< 0.001 ) , and IOP ( P< 0.001 ) .
Marked to high <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> with a myopic refractive error exceeding -6 D may be a risk factor associated with glaucomatous optic neuropathy.
New RAB3GAP1 mutations in patients with Warburg Micro Syndrome from different ethnic backgrounds and a possible founder effect in the Danish .
Warburg Micro Syndrome is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , microcornia , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , cortical dysplasia , in particular <START:PHENOTYPE> corpus callosum hypoplasia <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic diplegia <END> , and hypogonadism .
We have found five new mutations in the RAB3GAP1 gene in seven patients with suspected Micro Syndrome from families with Turkish , Palestinian , Danish , and Guatemalan backgrounds .
A thorough clinical investigation of the patients has allowed the delineation of symptoms that are consistently present in the patients and may aid the differential diagnosis of Micro Syndrome for patients in the future .
All patients had postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , micropthalmia , microcornia , <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral congenital cataracts <END> , short palpebral fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and congenital hypotonia with subsequent spasticity .
Only one patient had <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> at birth , highlighting the fact that congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> is not a consistent feature of Micro syndrome .
Analysis of the brain magnetic resonance imagings ( MRIs ) revealed a consistent pattern of polymicrogyria in the frontal and parietal lobes , wide sylvian fissures , a thin <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic corpus callosum <END> , and increased subdural spaces .
All patients were homozygous for the mutations detected and all mutations were predicted to result in a truncated RAB3GAP1 protein .
The analysis of nine polymorphic markers flanking the RAB3GAP1 gene showed that the mutation c.141 0C> A ( p.Tyr470X) , for which a Danish patient was homozygous , occurred on a haplotype that is shared by the unrelated heterozygous parents of the patient .
This suggests a possible founder effect for this mutation in the Danish population .
Oto-facio-osseous-gonadal syndrome : a new form of syndromic deafness ?
In this study , we report on two brothers , born to consanguineous parents , with a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , low nasal root , hypoplastic alae and round tip to the nose , low-set <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow thorax <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> genu valgum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> wormian bones <END> , fusion of carpal bones , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfeet <END> .
This combination of anomalies appears to be a previously undescribed syndrome , with probable <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> DNA deletions in <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> and Kearns-Say re syndrome .
We investigated the correlations of deletions of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA in skeletal muscle with clinical manifestations of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathies , a group of disorders defined either by biochemical abnormalities of mitochondria or by morphologic changes causing a ragged red appearance of the muscle fibers histochemically .
We performed genomic Southern blot analysis of muscle <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA from 123 patients with different <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathies or encephalomyopathies .
Deletions were found in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA of 32 patients , all of whom had <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
Some patients had only ocular myopathy , whereas others had Kearns-Say re syndrome , a multisystem disorder characterized by ophthalmoplegia , <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinopathy <END> , heart block , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
The deletions ranged in size from 1.3 to 7. 6 kilobases and were mapped to different sites in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA , but an identical 4.9-kilobase deletion was found in the same location in 11 patients .
Biochemical analysis showed decreased activities of NADH dehydrogenase , rotenone-sensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase , succinate-cytochrome c reductase , and cytochrome c oxidase , four enzymes of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> respiratory chain containing subunits encoded by <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA .
We conclude that deletions of muscle <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA are associated with ophthalmoplegia and may result in impaired <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> function .
However , the precise relation between clinical and biochemical phenotypes and deletions remains to be defined .
Mendelian inheritance of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
Previous studies have demonstrated familial clustering of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
To define the nature of this familial aggregation and to assess whether Mendelian inheritance can explain <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> clustering , proportional hazards and segregation analyses were performed on 691 families ascertained through a single <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> proband .
The proportional hazards analyses revealed that two factors , early age at onset of disease in the proband and multiple affected family members , were important determinants of risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> in these families .
Furthermore , segregation analyses revealed that this clustering can be best explained by <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> of a rare ( q = 0.0030 ) high-risk allele leading to an early onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
The estimated cumulative risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> for carriers revealed that the allele was highly penetrant : by age 85 , 88 % of carriers compared to only 5 % of noncarriers are projected to be affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
The best fitting <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model further suggested that this inherited form of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> accounts for a significant proportion of early onset disease but overall is responsible for a small proportion of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> occurrence ( 9% by age 85 ) . These data provide evidence that <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> is inherited in Mendelian fashion in a subset of families and provide a foundation for gene mapping studies of heritable <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
Characterization of genes involved in inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> could provide important insight into the development of this disease in general .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Exstrophy <END> of the cloaca and <START:PHENOTYPE> exstrophy <END> of the bladder : two different expressions of a primary developmental field defect .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Exstrophy <END> of the bladder ( EB ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> exstrophy <END> of the cloaca ( EC ) are generally recognizable as distinct clinical entities .
In patients with EB , the posterior bladder wall is exposed through a midline defect of the abdomen .
The umbilicus is inferiorly displaced and located close to the superior margin of the exstrophic bladder .
Genital abnormalities are common in boys and girls who may present <START:PHENOTYPE> epispadias <END> and a small , split phallus or a split clitoris , a <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid uterus <END> , and a duplicate or exstrophic vagina .
In contrast to classic EB , EC is commonly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , spinal defects , and incompletely formed external genitalia and is always associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> .
Some authors state that EC and EB constitute two distinct disorders , but others consider them part of a " continuum , " representing different levels of severity within the same spectrum .
The use of the acronym OEIS to refer to the combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> exstrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , and spinal defects , in our opinion , has not helped to clarify the clinical definition , pathogenesis , or cause of this multiple congenital anomaly ( MCA ) pattern , mostly because the term makes no distinction between EC or EB . Here we present the epidemiological analysis of a group of characteristics in infants with EC and infants with EB to determine if they constitute two different entities .
We also analyze if the different combinations of <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , and spinal defects are more frequent in infants with EC than in infants with MCA patterns other than EC and EB .
The prevalence in our data for EC was 1:200,233 live births and 1:35 ,597 for EB .
The clinical analysis indicated that the study defects ( <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , spine defects , spina bifida , and <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> ) tend to occur together in the same child with a higher frequency if the child has the EC defect than in infants with MCA patterns that did not include EC or EB . Our findings of low birth weight , twinning , single umbilical artery , and preferentially associated malformations suggest that EC is the result of damage occurring very early in development and that EC and EB are two different expressions of a primary polytopic developmental field defect .

An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> syndrome of hypotrichosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodysplasia <END> , hyperkeratosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , catartact , and other manifestations .
We describe a 20-year-old woman with <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized trichodysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dry skin <END> with scaling , hyperchromic spots on limbs , hyperkeratosis ( particularly intense on soles) , <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatoglyphic abnormalities <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodysplasia <END> , shortness of stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> unusual facial appearance <END> , minor malformations of limbs , bilateral nuclear <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> entropion <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> trichiasis <END> , etc .
The condition is probably due to an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> gene .
The patient is the only affected member in a sibship of four whose parents are second cousins .
Resolution of the two loci for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , AN1 and AN2 , to a single locus on chromosome 11p13 .
Two distinct loci have been proposed for <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> ; AN1 for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> on chromosome 2p and AN2 for the <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> in the WAGR contiguous gene syndrome on chromosome 11p13 .
In this report , the kindred segregating for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , which suggested linkage to acid phosphatase-1 ( ACP1 ) and led to the assignment of the AN1 locus on chromosome 2p , has been updated and expanded .
Linkage analysis between the <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> phenotype and ACP1 does not support the original linkage results , excluding linkage up to theta = 0.17 with Z = -2 . Tests for linkage to other chromosome 2p markers .
APOB , D2S71 , D2S5 , and D2S1 , also excluded linkage to <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
Markers that have been isolated from the chromosome 11p13 region were then analyzed in this <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> family .
Two RFLPs at the D11S323 locus give significant evidence for linkage .
The PvuII polymorphism detected by probe p5S1.6 detects no recombinants , with a maximum lod score of Z = 6 .97 at theta = 0.00 .
The HaeIII polymorphism detected by the probe p5BE1.2 gives a maximum lod score of Z = 2.57 at theta = 0.00 . Locus D11S325 gives a lod score of Z = 1.53 at theta = 0.00 . These data suggest that a locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> ( AN1 ) on chromosome 2p has been misassigned and that this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> family is segregating for an <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> mutation linked to markers in the 11p13 region .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> with isolated C3 deposits : a new entity which shares common genetic risk factors with haemolytic uraemic syndrome .
Abnormal control of the complement alternative pathway ( CAP ) ( factor H , factor I and membrane cofactor protein ( MCP ) deficiencies ) is a well established risk factor for the occurrence of haemolytic uraemic syndrome ( HUS ) .
In some instances , HUS may be associated with an unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> with isolated C3 deposits ( <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 ) .
We determined whether HUS and <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 share common genetic susceptibility factors .
We identified 19 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 .
We measured levels of circulating complement components , performed assays for the detection of C3 nephritic factor ( C3NeF ) and screened factor H , factor I and MCP coding genes for the presence of mutations .
Patients were divided in two groups based on renal pathology findings : group I ( n = 13 ) had typical features of type I membranoproliferative <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 with membranoproliferative <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> ( MPGN) ) and group II ( n = 6 ) was characterised by mesangial and epimembranous C3 deposits in the absence of mesangial proliferation ( <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 without MPGN ) .
Mutations in complement regulatory genes were detected in 4/6 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 without MPGN ( heterozygous mutations in factor H gene ( two patients ) with low factor H antigenic level in one case , heterozygous mutations in factor I gene ( two patients) ) and in only 2/13 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 with MPGN ( heterozygous mutations in factor H gene ( one patient ) and double heterozygous mutation in CD 46 gene ( one patient) ) .
In contrast , C3NeF was present in 5/13 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 with MPGN and in 2/6 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 without MPGN , one of whom had a factor H mutation .
HUS and <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 without MPGN share common genetic risk factors .
Constitutional or acquired dysregulation of the CAP is probably associated with a wide spectrum of diseases , ranging from HUS to <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> C3 with MPGN .
Identical twins who are discordant for Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy.
Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> is a maternally inherited form of <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> that is associated with several <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations .
These <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations are not the sole determinants of <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> , as epigenetic factors may play a pathogenetic role .
To clarify the role of these factors , we studied two visually discordant twins and determined their zygosity and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genotype .

The monozygous twin brothers have remained discordant for the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> for 6 1/2 years despite harboring the identical homoplasmic 4216 , 13708 , and 11778 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations .
The patients are visually discordant despite being genetically identical at the nuclear and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> levels .
Epigenetic factors are important determinants of <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> in Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> in these brothers .
Among those factors studied in these patients , a substantial difference was noted in regard to occupational exposure to toxic substances .
Epigenetic factors that may influence the clinical expression of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations associated with Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> should be systematically studied .
Risk-factor intervention strategies should be formulated and implemented .
A distinctive <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> disproportionate short stature <END> with short long bones , brachydactyly , and hypotrichosis in two consanguineous Arab families .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Disproportionate short stature <END> is a heterogeneous group of hereditary disorders , which are classified according to their mode of inheritance , their clinical skeletal and non-skeletal manifestations , and their radiological characteristics .
Herein , we inform on eight individuals with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> disproportionate short stature <END> from two unrelated consanguineous families of Arab-Muslim ancestry .
The adult height of the affected individuals is between 112 cm and 127 cm , and is due to pre- and post-natal growth retardation , which probably manifests as early as the second trimester of pregnancy .
At a young age , the phenotype is characterized by a short stature , a relatively <START:PHENOTYPE> large head <END> , and a long <START:PHENOTYPE> triangular face <END> , and this phenotype later evolves to one with in which the head is relatively small , the mandible is large and pointy .
The affected individuals have normal cognitive abilities and lack any neurological deficits .
Other typical features include a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent nose <END> , a voice with an unusual high-pitched sound , relatively <START:PHENOTYPE> small ears <END> , clinodactyly , brachydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> small hands <END> , hypoplastic fingernails , a <START:PHENOTYPE> waddling gait <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> post-pubertally .
Typical skeletal changes include short long bones , especially the femurs and humeri , with mild metaphyseal changes and very <START:PHENOTYPE> short femoral necks <END> .
After due consideration of the other hereditary causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> disproportionate short stature <END> and close examination of the pedigrees of the two families , we concluded that these eight individuals have the same hitherto unreported form of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> disproportionate short stature <END> that is inherited in the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode .

Micro syndrome .
Three affected children from an inbred family had <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , retinal dystrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic nerve atrophy <END> , hypothalamic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogenitalism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> .
The disorder is presumably <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> ; no identical syndrome has been described , but we consider syndromes with similar features .
Further delineation of the G syndrome : a manageable genetic cause of infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> .
Three families including five subjects with the G or Opitz-Frias syndrome are added to 23 published cases who had <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> ; characteristics of the two affected relatives were added to 19 well documented published reports .
The data from index cases support the concept of the G syndrome as a constellation of midline defects , which include <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> ( 89% ) , oesophageal dysmotility ( 69% ) , laryngotracheal clefts ( 44% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid uvula <END> ( 34% ) , heart defects ( 29% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> (100% of males) , renal or <START:PHENOTYPE> ureteral anomalies <END> ( 42%) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( 38% ) .
Affected relatives , often identified by <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , had a much lower incidence of associated defects and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
They provide a more rounded but still biased view of a syndrome compatible with normal intelligence and life span .
The data do not support a highly characteristic face in the G syndrome , which discriminates it from the phenotypically similar BBB syndrome .
The variable expressivity and five cases of male to male transmission observed in 18 families are consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Vigilance for the morphological characteristics of G syndrome in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> is underscored by the potential for normal development with appropriate intervention .
Environmental risk factors and clinical phenotype in familial and <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> primary <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> .
Although environmental and genetic factors may contribute to the etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> , their relative contribution in causing familial and <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> is unknown .
First-degree relatives of 122 patients with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> were examined with a validated 2-step diagnostic procedure , including a screening questionnaire and examination of some relatives .
Examiners were blinded to the questionnaire data for family history of probands .
Data for demographic and clinical features , prior ophthalmologic complaints , and nondecaffeinated coffee intake were collected from probands before family investigation .
Dystonia was diagnosed in 27 relatives from 23 families (20% rate of family history for dystonia ) .
No significant differences were found between familial and <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases in the frequency of coffee drinking and eye diseases or in sex , age at onset , or tendency to spread .
Multivariable conditional logistic analysis testing of 67 case patients and 127 family-matched unaffected siblings yielded a significant positive association between <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> and prior eye diseases ( adjusted odds ratio [ OR] 2.5 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 .1-6 .1 ; p = 0.03 ) and a significant inverse association between case status and ever coffee drinking ( adjusted OR 0.23; 95 % CI 0.1- 0.8 ; p = 0.02 ) .
The new information from this large family-based study on primary <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> strongly supports eye diseases and coffee as risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> .
The finding that the 2 environmental exposures exerted a similar influence on familial and <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> , together with the convergent phenotypic expression in familial and <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> cases , implies that familial and <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharospasm <END> probably share a common etiologic background .

A broad clinical spectrum .
To describe the spectrum of illnesses associated with Escherichia coli O15 7 : H7 infections .
Described an outbreak that showed the broad spectrum of these infections .
Reviewed the clinical findings in the other eight major outbreaks reported between 1982 and 1986 .
Also reviewed reports of sporadic cases .
Outbreaks in communities , nursing homes , a day care center , and a kindergarten .
Persons identified in outbreaks of E . coli O15 7 : H7 infections .
Escherichia coli O15 7 : H7 infection causes bloody <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> ( hemorrhagic colitis ) , nonbloody <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> , and thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> .
Infection can be asymptomatic , can involve extraintestinal sites , and can be fatal .
Bloody <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> is the commonest symptom .
Most patients have severe abdominal cramps ; <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> is documented in less than half .
Findings from fecal leukocyte examinations often suggest a noninfectious cause .
Results of radiologic and colonoscopic examinations can be consistent with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease or ischemic colitis .
Patients at the extremes of age are at increased risk for E . coli O15 7 : H7-associated <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> , thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> , and death .
Antimicrobial agents have not been shown to modify the illness , but there are few data on individual agents .
Infection with E . coli O15 7 : H7 should be considered in all patients with bloody <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> , or thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> because the infection can masquerade as gastrointestinal bleeding of noninfectious cause , the antecedent <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> may be resolved and forgotten by the time the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> or thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> is diagnosed , and the detection of E . coli O15 7 : H7 requires specific stool culture techniques .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> ureteral triplication <END> and bilateral amastia .
We report a case of <START:PHENOTYPE> ureteral triplication <END> as part of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome comprising bilateral amastia , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> patent ductus arteriosus <END> , dysmorphic <START:PHENOTYPE> low set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> with an antimongoloid slant to the eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> , flat <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , tapered digits , <START:PHENOTYPE> cubitus valgus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> .
Molecular diagnosis of Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> .
The distinction between Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> and diffuse large-B-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> is crucial because these two types of <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> require different treatments .
We examined whether gene-expression profiling could reliably distinguish Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> from diffuse large-B-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> .
Tumor-biopsy specimens from 303 patients with aggressive lymphomas were profiled for gene expression and were also classified according to morphology , immunohistochemistry , and detection of the t(8 ;14 ) c-myc translocation .
A classifier based on gene expression correctly identified all 25 pathologically verified cases of classic Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> .
Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> was readily distinguished from diffuse large-B-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> by the high level of expression of c-myc target genes , the expression of a subgroup of germinal-center B-cell genes , and the low level of expression of major-histocompatibility-complex class I genes and nuclear factor-kappaB target genes .
Eight specimens with a pathological diagnosis of diffuse large-B-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> had the typical gene-expression profile of Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> , suggesting they represent cases of Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> that are difficult to diagnose by current methods .
Among 28 of the patients with a molecular diagnosis of Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> , the overall survival was superior among those who had received intensive chemotherapy regimens instead of lower-dose regimens .
Gene-expression profiling is an accurate , quantitative method for distinguishing Burkitt 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> from diffuse large-B-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> .

Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> is caused by mutations in the sodium-phosphate cotransporter gene SLC34A3 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypophosphatemia <END> due to isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> results from a heterogeneous group of disorders .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> ( HHRH ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> that is characterized by reduced renal phosphate reabsorption , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> .
It can be distinguished from other forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> by increased serum levels of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
Using SNP array genotyping , we mapped the disease locus in two consanguineous families to the end of the long arm of chromosome 9 .
The candidate region contained a sodium-phosphate cotransporter gene , SLC34A3 , which has been shown to be expressed in proximal tubulus cells .
Sequencing of this gene revealed disease-associated mutations in five families , including two frameshift and one splice-site mutation .
Loss of function of the SLC34A3 protein presumably results in a primary <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular defect <END> and is compatible with the HHRH phenotype .
We also show that the phosphaturic factor FGF23 ( fibroblast growth factor 23) , which is increased in X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> and carries activating mutations in autosomal dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> , is at normal or low-normal serum levels in the patients with HHRH , further supporting a primary renal defect .
Identification of the gene mutated in a further form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> adds to the understanding of phosphate homeostasis and may help to elucidate the interaction of the proteins involved in this pathway .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> owing to <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse mesangial sclerosis <END> : an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
Three sibs born to consanguineous parents had congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> .
Pathology of the kidneys showed <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse mesangial sclerosis <END> with deposits of IgG and C3 in the mesangium and glomerular basement membranes .
All three children died before the age of 3 years .
Of 19 published cases of children with the association of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , only four had histological evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse mesangial sclerosis <END> , and two of their sibs probably had the same disease .
The association of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> owing to congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse mesangial sclerosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and mental retardation appears to be a distinct syndrome with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance .
Renal tubular insufficiency , cholestatic <START:PHENOTYPE> jaundice <END> , and multiple congenital anomalies--a new multisystem syndrome .
We are describing two male siblings with proximal renal tubular insufficiency , cholestatic <START:PHENOTYPE> jaundice <END> , predisposition to infection , and multiple congenital anomalies .
These patients presented in the early neonatal period with <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high arched palate <END> , barrel shaped chest , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> simian creases <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> club feet <END> , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hip dislocation <END> , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> conjugated hyperbilirubinemia <END> , repeated infections , and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> .
They died at the age of 2 and of 4 months despite medical therapy .
Findings of renal tubular insufficiency included persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> , phosphaturia , <START:PHENOTYPE> aminoaciduria <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> .
Kidney biopsy , liver biopsy , and a comprehensive immunologic investigation were performed on the first sibling .
Kidney histology was normal except for calcification of some distal tubules .
Liver biopsy revealed paucity of bile ducts , bile stasis , and some inflammatory cell infiltration .
Immunologic investigation suggested a defect in polymorphonuclear cell migration and intracellular killing .
Review of the literature revealed remarkably similar findings in two previously reported male siblings .
These four cases probably represent a previously unrecognized familial syndrome .
The possible etiology and mode of inheritance of this syndrome are discussed , and the association of hepatic and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular dysfunction <END> is reviewed .
Management of ophthalmic complications of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> .
To determine the safety and efficacy of surgical versus medical management in the treatment of ophthalmic complications of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> , and also to document ocular complications of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> other than <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> .
Retrospective case series .
Forty-five patients with ophthalmic complications of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> participated .
Eighty-four surgical procedures were performed on 40 patients .
There were 82 procedures done with the patients under general anesthesia and 2 with the patients under local anesthesia .
Medical therapy was attempted initially in all patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> and was the sole therapy used for five patients .
Complications resulting from medical or surgical treatment and final visual acuity were studied .
All patients had a history of lens subluxation or dislocation .
Fourteen ( 31% ) were receiving dietary treatment at the time of presentation and 29 ( 64% ) were mentally retarded .
Eighty-two procedures were performed with the patients under general anesthesia with 2 surgical complications and 1 postsurgical complication .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lens dislocation <END> into the anterior chamber was the most frequent indication for surgery (5 0% ) followed by pupillary block <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> ( 12% ) .
Prophylactic peripheral iridectomy was not successful in preventing <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> into the anterior chamber in five patients .
Anesthetic precautions such as stockings to prevent deep venous thrombosis , preoperative hydration , or aspirin were given in 85 % of cases .
Other common ophthalmic complications found include <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( 23% ) , iris atrophy ( 21% ) , anterior staphylomas ( 13% ) , lenticular opacities ( 9% ) , and corneal opacities ( 9% ) .
Laser iridectomy was unsuccessful in preventing <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> into the anterior chamber .
With appropriate anesthetic precautions and modern microsurgical techniques , the risks associated with the surgical management of ocular complications of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> are reduced .
Surgical treatment should be considered , especially for cases of repeated <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> into the anterior chamber or pupillary block <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
If a conservative , nonsurgical approach is undertaken , these patients must be observed carefully for repeat episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> lens dislocation <END> .
Split hand/split foot malformation with <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> : first report of families linked to the SHFM1 locus in 7q21 .
Developmental anomalies of the appendicular skeleton are among the most common and easily ascertained birth defects .
Split hand/split foot malformations , distinctive in having deficiency of the central rays , occur as isolated anomalies and as one component of multisystem syndromes .
The clinical and molecular characterization of a new syndrome , found in two unrelated families , consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> split foot <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , is presented here .
As in other split hand/split foot conditions , variable expression and reduced penetrance is notable .
In the larger family , variably expressed <START:PHENOTYPE> split foot <END> malformations were found in 6 of 11 gene carriers .
and mild-to-moderate sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> in 4 . <START:PHENOTYPE> Split hand <END> and cleft lip/palate in one individual and tibial deficiency in another suggest that these malformations are uncommon components of the syndrome .
Ectodermal abnormalities did not occur .
In the second family , variable <START:PHENOTYPE> split foot <END> was observed in 3 of 4 gene carriers , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> was present in 3 . <START:PHENOTYPE> Split hand <END> was only seen in a gene carrier who also had <START:PHENOTYPE> split foot <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
One gene carrier only had <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
The gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> split hand <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> split foot <END> with sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> was linked to markers in 7q21 in both families , with a combined ( maximum LOD score of 4.37 at theta = 0.0 for locus D7S527) at 80% penetrance .
Efforts to identify the responsible gene have not yet been successful .
Neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> , neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and intellectual disability in 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome .
Purpose:Hypocalcemia is a common endocrinological condition in 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome .
Neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> may affect neurodevelopment .
We hypothesized that neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> would be associated with rare , more severe forms of intellectual disability in 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome .Methods:We used a logistic regression model to investigate potential predictors of intellectual disability severity , including neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> , neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and complex congenital heart disease , e.g. , <START:PHENOTYPE> interrupted aortic arch <END> , in 149 adults with 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome .
Ten subjects had moderate-to-severe intellectual disability.Results: The model was highly significant ( P < 0.0001 ) , showing neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( P = 0.0018 ) and neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> ( P = 0.047 ) to be significant predictors of a more severe level of intellectual disability .
Neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were significantly associated with neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> in the entire sample ( P < 0.0001 ) , regardless of intellectual level .
There was no evidence for the association of moderate-to-severe intellectual disability with other factors such as major structural brain malformations in this sample .Conclusion : The results suggest that neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> may increase the risk for more severe intellectual deficits in 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome , likely mediated by neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> .
Neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> often remains unrecognized until the postseizure period , when damage to neurons may already have occurred .
These findings support the importance of early recognition and treatment of neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> and potentially neonatal screening for 22q11 .2 deletions .Genet Med 16 1 , 40-44 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia : clinical characterization of a novel renal phosphate-wasting disorder .
Renal phosphate-wasting disorders are the most common form of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> in western countries .
Although <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> has been described , previous studies included too few affected individuals to adequately characterize the disorder .
We performed clinical and biochemical evaluations of individuals from a large kindred with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia .
We identified 23 affected members in this family , and for some individuals , follow-up was up to 25 yr .
As patients were all members of the same kindred , we had the opportunity to determine the clinical manifestations of the disorder in patients who presumably all have the same genetic mutation .
Affected individuals have isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> and inappropriately normal serum calcitriol concentrations .
The inheritance pattern was consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission with variable penetrance .
The family contained two subgroups of affected individuals .
Group 1 consisted of patients who presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> as adolescents or adults .
These patients presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> bone pain <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , and insufficiency fractures , but did not manifest lower extremity deformity .
Group 2 consisted of patients who presented with phosphate wasting , <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> , and lower extremity deformity as children .
Surprisingly , some individuals in group 2 lost the renal phosphate-wasting defect after puberty .
In conclusion , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia is an inherited disorder of isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> .
The spectrum of disease includes delayed onset of penetrance and loss of the renal phosphate-wasting defect .
Our results have implications in the evaluation of patients who present with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> as either adults or children .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> Kufs ' disease : a cause of early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Kufs ' disease is the rare , adult-onset form of the neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses ( NCL ) .
Two clinical Kufs ' phenotypes have been described , one featuring generalized tonic-clonic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and the other characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant inheritance <END> of Kufs ' disease has been reported for only two families .
The genetic and molecular defects underlying Kufs ' disease are unknown .
We report a third family with apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Kufs ' disease in a family of English ancestry .
Ten individuals ( five men , five women ) have been affected over five generations .
Age of onset typically is in the fourth decade of life and is heralded by <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Clinical and neuropsychological assessments in several affected individuals , however , confirm the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and follow-up evaluations suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> is the primary disabling feature of the illness .
Motor abnormalities also are frequent .
Neuropathological examination ( three cases ) documents the presence of neuronal lipopigment accumulation consistent with NCL .
The combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in this and two other reported families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Kufs ' disease suggest that this entity represents a distinctive clinicopathological entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dementia <END> is prominent but is almost always associated with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and motoric disturbances early in the disease course .
Kufs ' disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of early onset , atypical <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Northern <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome : an inherited childhood onset <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with associated <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deterioration <END> .
A new autosomal recessively inherited disease of the central nervous system involving childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deterioration <END> is described .
Twenty three patients ( 11 males and 12 females ) belonging to 11 families from northern Finland have been identified .
A common ancestor has been found for nine families .
The mean age of onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> was 6.7 years ( range 5-1 0 years ) and the <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> was characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> generalised tonic-clonic seizures <END> increasing in frequency up to puberty .
One third of the patients also had <START:PHENOTYPE> complex partial seizures <END> during childhood .
During young adulthood the epileptic activity began to decrease , but complete remission did not occur .
Electroencephalography showed progressive slowing of the background activity with relatively scanty epileptiform activity .
Out of four ictal recordings the paroxysmal activity was initiated focally in two cases .
Clonazepam and sodium valproate had some antiepileptic effect , clonazepam being the more beneficial of the two .
Mental development , which was originally normal , began to deteriorate two to five years after the onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and the deterioration continued during adulthood in spite of good <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> control , leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> by middle age .
The pathogenesis of the disorder , called the Northern <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome , is unknown .
Linkage analysis using DNA markers linked to the EPM1 gene for progressive myoclonus <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> of Unverricht-Lundborg type showed that the Northern <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome is not allelic to EPM1 .
Mutation in the glutamate transporter EAAT1 causes <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiplegia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Transporters , ion pumps , and ion channels are membrane proteins that regulate selective permeability and maintain ionic gradients across cell membranes .
Mutations in CACNA1A encoding a neuronal calcium channel and ATP1A2 encoding an ion pump cause <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> , hemiplegic <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Mutant gene products of both CACNA1A and ATP1A2 may affect neurotransmission of glutamate , the most abundant excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter .
We examined our patient population with <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> and hemiplegic <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> but with no mutation in either CACNA1A or ATP1A2 .
We looked for mutations in SLC1A3 , which encodes the glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid transporter ( EAAT ) 1 that is important in removing glutamate from the synaptic cleft .
A patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , and alternating <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiplegia <END> has a heterozygous mutation in SLC1A3 that is not present in his asymptomatic parents and controls .
Expression studies of the mutant EAAT1 showed decreased expression of the protein with a markedly reduced capacity for glutamate uptake .
When coexpressed , the mutant EAAT1 decreased the activity of wild-type EAAT1 but not of two other transporters EAAT2 or EAAT3 , suggesting that mutant EAAT1 specifically multimerizes with wild-type EAAT1 to exert its dominant negative effect .
Our data show that a heterozygous mutation in EAAT1 can lead to decreased glutamate uptake , which can contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability to cause <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiplegia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic ataxia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebellar hypoplasia <END> is found in association with a variety of neurologic and systemic disorders .
It is the primary finding in the uncommonly reported condition of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
We describe two siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> documented in both by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and review the clinical features of previously reported cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> .
The most common findings in this disorder are nonprogressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , strabismus , mental retardation , and speech delay with dysarthria .
Previously reported cases have been confirmed by autopsy , pneumoencephalography , or computed tomographic ( CT) scans .
MRI clearly documents diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> and aids in distinguishing <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> from other disorders .
The pathophysiology of this disorder is uncertain , however , studies of the weaver mutant mouse ( an animal model of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> ) suggest that an abnormality of the Bergmann glia may lead to the observed granule cell layer deficiency in these patients .
This diagnosis should be considered for children with nonprogressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and families should be made aware of the 25% recurrence risk .
Subependymal <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> : a distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal migration disorder <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Subependymal <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> has recently been recognised as a cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , but the clinical and investigational features have not been fully described .
The clinical , psychometric , imaging , and electroencephalographic features of 13 adult patients with subependymal <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> have been reviewed .
Age at <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> onset ranged from 18 months to 20 years ( median 13 years ) .
There were significantly more female ( 12 ) than male (1 ) patients ( p < 0.01 ) .
Diagnosis of subependymal <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> was made by MRI in 11 patients and CT in two .
The heterotopic grey matter was nodular in 11 patients and diffuse in two ; bilateral in eight and unilateral in five .
There were significantly more patients with predominant right than left cerebral hemisphere involvement ( p < 0.01 ) .
The most commonly involved site was the occipital horn of the lateral ventricles (1 0 of 13 patients ) .
Eleven patients presented with partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , 10 of whom also had secondarily generalised <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
The clinical description of the <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> often suggested either an occipital ( four patients ) or temporal ( five patients ) onset .
Two patients presented with absence attacks without clear focal features .
Patients demonstrated normal early milestones ( 12 of 13 patients) , including normal motor development ( all patients ) and average or above average intelligence (1 0 of 13 patients ) .
An EEG examination showed normal background activity in all but two patients , one of whom had large intracranial haematomas .
Epileptiform activity was usually widespread (1 0 of 13 patients ) and in three patients , there was generalised 3-Hz spike and wave activity that had previously led to an erroneous diagnosis of concomitant primary generalised <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in the second decade of life , normal developmental milestones and intelligence , and the finding of an overwhelming female preponderance differentiates subependymal <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> from other cortical dysgeneses .
The female preponderance supports the importance of the X chromosome and sex steroids in the maturation and development of the cerebral cortex .
A point mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> tRNA( Leu ) ( UUR ) gene in MELAS ( <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and strokelike episode ( MELAS ) is a major group of heterogeneous <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disorders .
To identify the defective gene , <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA from a patient with MELAS was sequenced by using amplified DNA fragments as sequencing templates .
In 14 .1 kbp determined out of 16 .6 kbp of the whole <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> gene , at least 21 nucleotides were different from those of a control human <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA .
One of the substitutions was a transition of A to G in the tRNA( Leu ) ( UUR ) gene at Cambridge nucleotide number 3,243 .
This nucleotide is conserved not only in many <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> tRNAs but in most cytosolic tRNA molecules .
An Apa I restriction site was gained by the substitution of this nucleotide .
The Apa I digestion of the amplified DNA fragment revealed that all independent 6 patients had G at nucleotide number 3,243 in their <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNAs , but none of 11 control individuals had G at this position .
This result strongly suggests that the mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> tRNALeu gene causes MELAS .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> tic disorder <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , motor neuron disease , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> : a new syndrome .
We report two brothers who were of consanguineous parents and who displayed a unique association of motor and vocal <START:PHENOTYPE> tics <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , distal <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular atrophy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> .
In the older brother , leg weakness and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle wasting <END> started at age 13 , and he became wheelchair bound at 40 . Electrophysiologic studies and muscle biopsy confirmed diffuse denervation .
Involuntary vocalizations and facial <START:PHENOTYPE> tics <END> began at age 36 , but within 5 years the <START:PHENOTYPE> tics <END> were replaced by progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> with supranuclear ophthalmoparesis .
CSF studies implied impaired central dopamine and serotonin turnover .
In the younger brother , orofacial <START:PHENOTYPE> tics <END> started at age 36 , vocalizations and fasciculations in the legs began 1 year later , and parkinsonian findings were present at age 40 .
This is the first report of an association of Tourettism , <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , motor neuron disease , and <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> occurring as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
Intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> is a subtype of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> GIST <END> and results from a dominant activating mutation in PDGFRA .
Intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> ( Online Mendelian inheritance in Man database number 162220) is an alternate form of <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> .
Patients present with <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromas <END> limited to the intestine in the absence of any other typical features of NF1 and NF2 .
At present , the molecular basis of intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> remains elusive .
The aim of the present study was to find the gene responsible for intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> and to characterize functionally the mutation .
Three candidate genes ( NF1 , KIT, and PDGFRA ) were screened for mutations in 3 sisters diagnosed with intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> .
Five tumors were available for pathologic examination .
Activation ( phosphorylation ) of PDGFRalpha was subsequently tested by Western blot analysis on a transfected 293T and Ba/F3 cell line .
We found an inherited mutation ( Y555C ) in the juxtamembrane domain of PDGFRA in the affected individuals .
The Y555C mutation leads to autophosphorylation and thus activation of PDGFRalpha .
These observations confirm that PDGFRalpha( Y555C ) is an oncogenic kinase .
The clinical phenotype in the reported family resembles the syndrome of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastrointestinal stromal tumors <END> ( familial GIST) .
Somatic activating mutations in KIT and PDGFRA are frequent in <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> GISTs , and mutations in both genes have also been described in familial GISTs .
The tumors in the reported family are morphologically identical to intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromas <END> , but , immunohistochemically , they do not express S100 or any of the known <START:PHENOTYPE> GIST <END> markers .
The inherited PDGFRA mutation in the reported family shows that intestinal <START:PHENOTYPE> neurofibromatosis <END> is allelic to familial <START:PHENOTYPE> GIST <END> caused by PDGRA mutations .
We therefore propose that these tumors be classified as familial KIT-negative <START:PHENOTYPE> gastrointestinal stromal tumors <END> .
Further delineation of deletion 1p36 syndrome in 60 patients : a recognizable phenotype and common cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Deletion 1p36 syndrome is a recently delineated disorder , considered to be the most common subtelomeric microdeletion syndrome ( 1 in 5000 newborns ) .
1p36.3 deletions account for 0.5 % to 1.2% of idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ; thus , knowledge about the condition is important for pediatricians caring for such patients .
Despite 100 reported cases , little is known about its natural history .
Our aim was to delineate the natural history of deletion 1p36 and develop complete and accurate information with which to answer families ' questions in the clinical setting .
We evaluated 60 patients with the 1p36 deletion syndrome ( 41 female , 19 male ) .
All underwent physical and neurologic assessments , and most received a psychological evaluation .
Standard cytogenetics , fluorescence in situ hybridization of the subtelomeric regions , or array comparative genomic hybridization were used for diagnosis .
Fourteen cases were detected by standard cytogenetics , and 46 were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization of the subtelomeric regions or array comparative genomic hybridization .
Occipitofrontal circumference was at < or = 2nd centile in 95 % , and height and weight ranged between the < 3rd and 90th centiles .
All patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> straight eyebrows <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deep-set eyes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , broad nasal root/bridge , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pointed chin <END> . Other features included microbrachycephaly ( 65% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus <END> (5 0% ) , large , late-closing anterior fontanel ( 77% ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated <END> , low-set , abnormal ears (40% ) .
Brachy/camptodactyly and <START:PHENOTYPE> short feet <END> were prominent .
Seventy-one percent exhibited heart defects , including 23% with a " noncompaction cardiomyopathy. "
Fifty-two percent had eye/visual abnormalities , and 64 % had visual inattentiveness .
Twenty-eight percent had <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , 41 % had skeletal anomalies , 25% had abnormal genitalia , and 22% had renal abnormalities .
Eighty-eight percent had central nervous system anomalies , and 44 % had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
All patients demonstrated <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> with poor/absent speech ; 95 % had hypotonia .
Twenty-six percent were able to walk alone , and 47 % had a behavior disorder .
Constant developmental progress was observed in all cases over time .
Noncompaction cardiomyopathy and most <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were controlled by pharmacotherapy .
These 60 patients with deletion 1p36 represent the largest clinical series to date and provide new information on several aspects of this disorder , which is characterized by neurodevelopmental disability and a recognizable pattern of malformation .
Lambotte syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , holoprosencephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , facial anomalies , and early lethality--a new sublethal multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome in four sibs .
We report on an Arabic sibship originating from Morocco in which four children manifest an undiagnosed sublethal multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation ( MCA/MR ) syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> ( IUGR) , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , large soft pinnae , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> or true <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> squint <END> , flat face , unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> hooked nose <END> , very <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow mouth <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retrognathia <END> , and extremely severe neurologic impairment .
One child was stillborn .
Three others died in a cachectic state during their second year .
One child had a severe cerebral malformation compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> semilobar holoprosencephaly <END> . Other inconstant manifestations are <START:PHENOTYPE> anterior chamber cleavage defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> preaxial polydactyly of feet <END> , interventricular septal defect , and atresia of the external auditory meatus .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> is likely .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> with muscle coenzyme Q10 deficiency .
To describe a clinical syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> associated with muscle coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10 ) deficiency .
Muscle CoQ10 deficiency has been reported only in a few patients with a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy characterized by 1 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent myoglobinuria <END> ; 2 ) brain involvement ( <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ) , and 3 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> and lipid storage in the muscle biopsy .
Having found decreased CoQ10 levels in muscle from a patient with unclassified familial <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , the authors measured CoQ10 in muscle biopsies from other patients in whom <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> could not be attributed to known genetic causes .
The authors found muscle CoQ10 deficiency ( 26 to 35 % of normal ) in six patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , pyramidal signs , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
All six patients responded to CoQ10 supplementation ; strength increased , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> improved , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> became less frequent .
Primary CoQ10 deficiency is a potentially important cause of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of this condition because CoQ10 administration seems to improve the clinical picture .
Dubowitz syndrome : long-term follow-up of an original patient .
Dubowitz syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder of growth retardation , characteristic face , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> originally described by Dubowitz [ 1965 ] .
Little information is available on natural history and adulthood in this disorder .
We report on a 30-year-old woman who was one of the first patients to be diagnosed with the condition [ Grosse et al. , 1971 , Z Kinderheilkd 11 0 :175 -187 ] . <START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , leg length discrepancy , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperextensible joints <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida occulta <END> , and absence of anterior cruciate ligaments were present .
Her facial appearance had been modified by several plastic surgery procedures .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Eczema <END> resolved with age , with occasional flareups .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> , headaches , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were additional medical findings .
Speech delays , an unusually soft , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-pitched voice <END> , submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> velopharyngeal insufficiency <END> were noted in childhood .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> was present .
At age 30 years she is living independently in her own apartment and working full-time in a nearby sheltered workshop .
Oculo-facio-cardio-dental ( OFCD ) syndrome .
Oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome consists of (1 ) eye anomalies : <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , or secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , (2 ) facial abnormalities : ( long <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> , pointed nose with cartilages separated at the tip , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , or submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , (3 ) cardiac anomalies : <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> ( ASD) , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> ( VSD) , or floppy mitral valve ; and (4 ) dental abnormalities : canine radiculomegaly , delayed dentition , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> persistent primary teeth <END> , or variable root length .
Other less common findings are : sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> septate vagina <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly of toes <END> 2-3 .
Inheritance may be an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> trait , lethal in the male .
SPONASTRIME dysplasia : report of an 11-year-old boy and review of the literature .
SPONASTRIME ( SPOndylar and NAsal changes , with STRIations of the MEtaphyses ) dysplasia is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> bone disorder first described by Fanconi et al . [ 1983 : Helv Paediatr Acta 38:267-280] .
Radiographic findings include abnormal vertebral bodies with age-dependent changes , and striations of the metaphyses , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and retarded ossification of the carpal bones .
Physical features include severe <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lumbar lordosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal root <END> .
To date , 12 patients from 6 families have been reported .
Four additional patients have been reported with a variant of this condition , which includes <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We report on an 11-year-old boy with features consistent with SPONASTRIME dysplasia .
Height was 106 .1 cm ( -6 SD ) .
He had a coarse appearing face with a <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , short , <START:PHENOTYPE> upturned nose <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> .
Intelligence was normal .
A clinical evaluation at 6 years of age suggested the diagnosis of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia ( SED ) .
However , genetics evaluation at 11 years of age with repeat radiologic studies revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed carpal ossification <END> ( -4 to -5 SD) , <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal irregularities <END> and striations most notably in the distal femurs and the proximal tibias , <START:PHENOTYPE> lumbar lordosis <END> , narrow interpedicular distances of the lumbar spine , and pear-shaped vertebral bodies .
These findings were most consistent with the diagnosis of SPONASTRIME dysplasia , and not SED .
Although radiographic findings of SPONASTRIME dysplasia are distinguishable from SED , the physical appearance may be similar .
Many bone dysplasias have overlapping radiographic findings and clinical presentation but with different recurrence risks , making genetic counseling a challenge .

Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple pterygia <END> , camptodactyly , facial anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic lungs <END> and heart , <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic hygroma <END> , and skeletal anomalies : delineation of a new entity and review of lethal forms of multiple pterygium syndrome .
Three unrelated stillborn infants ( cases 1-3 ) are presented here with a distinct constellation of multiple anomalies : namely , <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple pterygia <END> involving chin-to-sternum , cervical , axillary , antecubital , crural and/or popliteal areas , <START:PHENOTYPE> flexion contractures <END> of multiple joints , small chest , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops <END> , characteristic abnormal facial appearance with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , markedly flattened nasal bridge with hypoplastic nasal alae , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , apparently low-set malformed ears , short neck with a <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic hygroma <END> at the back of the neck and head , and pulmonary and cardiac hypoplasia .
Radiographic studies , in addition , showed scalp <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> , microbrachycephaly , flattened mandibular angle , lack of normal curvature at the cervico-thoracic junction , marked bony fusion of posterior spinous processes of older fetuses ( cases 1 , 2) , thin crowded ribs , markedly hypoplastic scapulae , hypoplastic iliac wings , ischia and pubic bones , undermodeling of tubular bones , and radio-ulnar synostosis .
Histologic studies of the skeletal system showed cartilaginous and bony fusion of the spinous processes ( cases 1 , 2) , fusion of epiphyseal cartilages of distal humerus and proximal ulna , a poorly developed joint space , an abnormal growth plate , and weak safranin staining of the resting cartilages ( cases 1 , 2 ) . To the best of our knowledge , this pattern of anomalies constitutes a previously undescribed syndrome .
Prenatal diagnosis of this entity is possible by ultrasonographic studies on the basis of nonimmune fetal <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> cystic hygroma <END> at the back of the head and neck , diminished fetal activity , short and fixed limbs , and/or maternal <START:PHENOTYPE> hydramnios <END> .
Three additional cases ( cases 4-6 ) are also presented to show a possible heterogeneity of this syndrome .
Coloboma , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> : critical review of the so-called Biemond syndrome type 2 , updated nosology , and delineation of three " new " syndromes .
Biemond syndrome type 2 ( BS2 ) is classically regarded as a recessively inherited condition ( MIM 210350 ) comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , coloboma , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , polydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , and facial dysostosis .
Clinically , the disorder is closely related to Bardet-Biedl syndrome .
Few cases have been reported , most of them before 197 0 .
We present clinical data on three mentally retarded sporadic cases with coloboma , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , and hypogenitalism ( in two of them) , fitting as first glance a diagnosis of BS2 .
A review documents striking clinical variability among the patients said to have BS2 .
We propose a new nosology of those cases and delineate several new clinical forms .
Purported BS2 cases may be divided into : (1 ) Bardet-Biedl syndrome with fortuitous coloboma or aniridia , (2 ) BS2 sensu stricto , a recessively inherited syndrome of sexual infantilism , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , coloboma , and preaxial polydactyly without <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , only known from the original report , (3 ) a " new " dominantly inherited form of colobomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> occasionally associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , to which our observations belong .
(4 ) cytogenetically proven Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome ( one case) , (5 ) an unclassifiable , early lethal familial syndrome resembling Buntinx-Majewski syndrome , and (6 ) a " new " coloboma-zygodactyly-clefting syndrome .
The latter two syndromes may result from chromosomal anomaly .
New form of <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> ( SEMD ) in Jewish family of Iraqi origin .
We report a distinct type of <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> seen in 2 sibs and their second cousin , characterized by early onset severe short stature , small chest , and <START:PHENOTYPE> distended abdomen <END> .
They had <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lumbar lordosis <END> , and marked <START:PHENOTYPE> genu varum <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> fibular overgrowth <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> .
Radiographically , the patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> , initially noted during the first years of life , with central hypoplasia of the vertebral bodies .
At a later age , the vertebrae appear squared with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> interpedicular narrowing <END> .
The long bone changes , which at early age resemble those seen in achondroplasia , later include general <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal irregularities <END> and significant <START:PHENOTYPE> epiphyseal ossification delay <END> .
These patients present a previously undescribed form of <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> , most probably transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> tract .
Steinfeld syndrome : report of a second family and further delineation of a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder .
We report on a fetus with alobar <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> midline cleft lip <END> and palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> absent nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysplastic ears <END> , radial defects , pentalogy of Fallot , unilateral renal aplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> absent gallbladder <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vertebral anomalies <END> , and absence of ribs .
The father had a cleft palate , bilateral colobomas of the iris and retina , a <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid uvula <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vertebral anomalies <END> , and unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hearing loss <END> .
His sister had a cleft lip .
On the basis of this family and the family reported by Steinfeld [ 1982] , this malformation syndrome can be defined as a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome whose main component manifestations are <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> , predominantly radial limb deficiency , heart defects , kidney malformations , absence of gallbladder , and <START:PHENOTYPE> vertebral anomalies <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> associated with ragged-red fibres ( <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> abnormalities ) : disease entity or a syndrome ?
Light-and electron-microscopic studies of two cases and review of literature .
A report is given of an association of dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclonica associated with Friedreich 's <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> in 2 patients .
They had suffered from gradually increasing bursts of <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> since the wage of 14 and childhood , respectively .
The other striking clinical features included generalized convulsions , mental deterioration , intention tremor , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , muscular atrophy and deformity of feet .
Muscle biopsies revealed ragged-red fibres in both cases .
On electron microscopy these fibres contained subsarcolemnal aggregations of abundant abnormal mitochondria with proliferation of inner membranes or paracrystalline inclusions .
One of these patients showed elevated blood lactate and pyruvate with an increased lactate/pyruvate ration , apparently of primary origin .
These 2 cases resemble those reported briefly by Tsairis et al . ( 1974 ) .
An association of dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclonica associated with Friedreich 's <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> in these 2 patients is unlikely to be coincidental but may represent one nosological entity .
This <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome associated with ragged-red fibres is compared with other possibly related <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathies .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinoblastoma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> microdeletion syndrome : clinical characterization and molecular dissection using array CGH .
We describe three patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , dysmorphic features and developmental delay .
Patients 1 and 2 have high and <START:PHENOTYPE> broad forehead <END> , deeply grooved philtrum , thick anteverted lobes and <START:PHENOTYPE> thick helix <END> .
Patient 1 also has dolicocephaly , sacral pit/dimple and toe crowding ; patient 2 shows <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> and short fifth toe .
Both patients have partial agenesis of corpus callosum .
Patient 3 has growth retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , thick lower lip and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
Using array-comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH) , we identified a 13q14 de novo deletion in patients 1 and 2 , while patient 3 had a 7q11 .21 maternally inherited deletion , probably not related to the disease .
Our results confirm that a distinct facial phenotype is related to a 13q14 deletion .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> and malformations without a peculiar facial phenotype may have a different deletion syndrome or a casual association of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Using array-CGH , we defined a critical region for <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and dysmorphic features .
We compared this deletion with a smaller one in a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( case 4 ) and identified two distinct critical regions , containing 30 genes .
Four genes appear to be good functional candidates for the neurological phenotype : NUFIP1 ( nuclear fragile X <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> protein 1 ) , HTR2A ( serotonin receptor 2A) , PCDH8 ( prothocaderin 8 ) and PCDH17 ( prothocaderin 17 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Macrocephaly <END> with hamartomas : Bannayan-Zonana syndrome .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> with mesodermal hamartomas is described as a distinct syndrome in nine individuals from four families .
Constant manifestations include symmetrical <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> without ventricular enlargement , mild neurological dysfunction , and <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth deceleration <END> .
Speech and motor delays observed in all the children were usually well compensated by adulthood .
Two children had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> which may have been related to intracerebral hemorrhage in one .
Mesodermal hamartomas were present in affected persons from all four families , with 60 % of individuals manifesting only discrete <START:PHENOTYPE> lipomas <END> and hemangiomas .
More serious tumors , including intracerebral hemangiomas , hemangiomatous involvement of the bone , and aggressive <START:PHENOTYPE> lipomas <END> occurred in 40% . Other findings that make it possible to delineate a recognizable syndrome include <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> ( 66% ) , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> ( 67% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hyperextensibility <END> (55% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> ( 22%) , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> amblyopia <END> ( 33% ) , and prolonged drooling ( 44% ) .
The Bannayan-Zonana syndrome is an autosomal-dominant trait with male predominance of affected individuals .
Linkage of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> iris hypoplasia <END> to the region of the Rieger syndrome locus ( 4q25 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Iris hypoplasia <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder which is frequently associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
This <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is usually resistant to medical therapy and can lead to blindness .
A large family of Scandinavian descent with a five generation history of <START:PHENOTYPE> iris hypoplasia <END> was studied .
Fifteen individuals were found to have <START:PHENOTYPE> iris hypoplasia <END> , nine of whom had associated <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
In an attempt to identify the chromosomal location of the disease-causing gene , this family was genotyped with short tandem repeat polymorphisms ( STRPs ) known to map to loci previously associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
The juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> locus at 1q25 and a congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> locus on 6p were both statistically excluded .
However , significant linkage was demonstrated at the Rieger syndrome locus at 4q25 .
The highest observed LOD score was 3.70 ( theta = 0 ) and was obtained with marker D4S1616 .
Three recombination events were observed in affected individuals that together demonstrate that the disease-causing gene lies between markers ACT3E03 and D4S1611 , an interval of approximately 7 cM . These results suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> iris hypoplasia <END> and Rieger syndrome are allelic .
LIS1- related isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> : spectrum of mutations and relationships with malformation severity .
With the largest data set of patients with LIS1- related <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , the major cause of posteriorly predominant <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> related to either LIS1 mutation or intragenic deletion , described so far , we aimed to refine the spectrum of neurological and radiological features and to assess relationships with the genotype .
Retrospective study .
Subjects A total of 63 patients with posteriorly predominant <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Of the 63 patients , 40 were found to carry either LIS1 point mutations ( 77 .5% ) or small genomic deletions (20% ) , and 1 carried a somatic nonsense mutation .
On the basis of the severity of neuromotor impairment , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and radiological findings , correlations with the location and type of mutation were examined .
Most patients with LIS1 mutations demonstrated posterior <START:PHENOTYPE> agyria <END> ( grade 3a , 55 .3% ) with thin corpus callosum (5 0% ) and prominent perivascular spaces ( 67 .4% ) .
By contrast , patients without LIS1 mutations tended to have less severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> ( grade 4a , 41 .6% ) and no additional brain abnormalities .
The degree of neuromotor impairment was in accordance with the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , with a high incidence of tetraplegia ( 61 .1% ) .
Conversely , the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> was not determined with the same reliability because 82 .9% had early onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and 48 .7% had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> more often than daily .
In addition , neither the mutation type nor the location of the mutation were found to predict the severity of LIS1- related <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Our results confirm the homogeneity profile of patients with LIS1- related <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> who demonstrate in a large proportion Dobyns <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> grade 3a , and the absence of correlation with LIS1 mutations .
Atrichia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> follicular hyperkeratosis <END> , chronic candidiasis , keratitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> : a severe manifestation of IFAP syndrome ?
A boy with congenital atrichia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicular , keratitis , cutaneous infections and a huge <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> , but without <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is reported .
We believe it represents a new case of a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> syndrome known as <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> syndrome ( IFAP ) .
The differential diagnosis from keratitis <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is discussed .
The cutaneous infections seen in our case suggest the possibility of considering a genetic link between these syndromes .
A missense mutation in CDH3 , encoding P-cadherin , causes <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile macular dystrophy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by early hair loss heralding severe degenerative changes of the retinal macula and culminating in <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> during the second to third decade of life .
Recently , we identified a frameshift mutation in the CDH3 gene encoding P-cadherin as the proximal cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> in four families .
We report here another consanguineous family in which four members were diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile macular dystrophy.
Light and scanning electron microscopy revealed in all patients morphologic hair shaft abnormalities consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> pili torti <END> .
Ocular fundus examination disclosed marked degeneration of the macular pigment epithelium .
Electrophysiologic studies were diagnostic for severe retinal dysfunction .
DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding sequence of CDH3 revealed in all affected individuals a homozygous missense mutation resulting in a single amino acid substitution at position 503 of P-cadherin sequence ( R503H ) .
The mutation completely segregated with the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> phenotype in the family but was not detectable in 83 healthy , unrelated controls .
The amino acid substitution affects a highly conserved residue and is predicted to alter a Ca2+ binding domain of P-cadherin .
This is the first pathogenic missense mutation reported in CDH3 and the second mutation found to underlie <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile macular dystrophy.
Our data establish recessive mutations in CDH3 as the molecular cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> with juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> macular dystrophy <END> and expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of this intriguing disorder .
New mental retardation syndrome associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular colobomas <END> , cleft palate , and genital , skeletal , and craniofacial abnormalities .
We describe three Canadian brothers of Cree origin , with a previously undescribed pattern of malformation including distinctive craniofacial abnormalities with <START:PHENOTYPE> triangular facies <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , low-set and <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular colobomas <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> with widely separated sutures , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft soft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid scrotum <END> and hypospadius , wide <START:PHENOTYPE> webbed neck <END> , webbed fingers , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> and hypersegmented sternum , and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> .
The presence of normal brain imaging and physical growth distinguishes them from other syndromes with overlapping abnormalities .
This is either an X-linked or <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition .

Diagnostic criteria for Walker-Warburg syndrome .
Walker-Warburg syndrome ( WWS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder manifest by characteristic brain and eye malformations .
We reviewed data on 21 of our patients and an additional 42 patients from the literature .
From this review , we expand the phenotype to include <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> ( CMD ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and/or palate ( CLP) , and revise the diagnostic criteria .
Four abnormalities were present in all patients checked for these anomalies : <START:PHENOTYPE> type II lissencephaly <END> ( 21/21) , cerebellar malformation (20/20) , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal malformation <END> ( 18 /18 ) , and CMD ( 14 /14 ) .
We propose that these comprise necessary and sufficient diagnostic criteria for WWS .
Two other frequently observed abnormalities , ventricular dilatation with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> (20/21 ) and anterior chamber malformation ( 16/21) , are helpful but not necessary diagnostic criteria because they were not constant .
All other abnormalities occurred less frequently .
Congenital macrocephaly with <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( 11 / 19 ) was more common than congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( 3/19 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> (1 0/19 ) was sometimes associated with posterior cephalocele ( 5/21 ) .
Additional abnormalities included slit-like ventricles ( 1/21) , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> ( 8/21) , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular colobomas <END> ( 3/15 ) , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> ( 7/20) , genital anomalies in males ( 5/8 ) , and CLP ( 4/21 ) .
Median survival in our series was 9 months .
A related <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder , Fukuyama <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> , consists of similar but less severe brain changes and CMD . It differs from WWS because of consistently less frequent and severe cerebellar and retinal abnormalities .
We think that WWS is identical to " cerebro-oculo-muscular syndrome " and " muscle , eye , and brain disease. "
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , hypotonia , severe psychomotor retardation , and cerebral malformations : a second family with micro syndrome or a new syndrome ?
We report on four children of both sexes from a highly inbred family with hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic diplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and cerebral malformations .
Six other children may also have been affected .
The differential diagnosis and the possibility of a second family with the micro syndrome are discussed .
Digenic inheritance of early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> : CYP1B1 , a potential modifier gene .
" Early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> " refers to genetically heterogeneous conditions for which <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> manifests at age 5-40 years and for which only a small subset is molecularly characterized .
We studied the role of MYOC , CYP1B1 , and PITX2 in a population ( n=60 ) affected with juvenile or early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> from the greater Toronto area .
By a combination of single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct cycle sequencing , MYOC mutations were detected in 8 ( 13.3% ) of the 60 individuals , CYP1B1 mutations were detected in 3 ( 5% ) of the 60 individuals , and no PITX2 mutations were detected .
The range of phenotypic expression associated with MYOC and CYP1B1 mutations was greater than expected .
MYOC mutations included cases of juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> with or without pigmentary <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and mixed-mechanism <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
CYP1B1 mutations involved cases of juvenile open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , as well as cases of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
The study of a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> showed the segregation of both MYOC and CYP1B1 mutations with disease ; however , in this family , the mean age at onset of carriers of the MYOC mutation alone was 51 years ( range 48-64 years ) , whereas carriers of both the MYOC and CYP1B1 mutations had an average age at onset of 27 years ( range 23-38 years ) ( P=.001 ) .
This work emphasizes the genetic heterogeneity of juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and suggests , for the first time , that (1 ) congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> are allelic variants and (2 ) the spectrum of expression of MYOC and CYP1B1 mutations is greater than expected .
We also propose that CYP1B1 may act as a modifier of MYOC expression and that these two genes may interact through a common pathway .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> , distinctive face , mental retardation , brachydactyly , and genital abnormalities .
We report on three individuals of Muslim Arab origin from a village located in Northern Israel affected by an apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome characterized by distinctive facial phenotype of which the most prominent feature is <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> .
The other clinical features of the syndrome include variable degree of mental retardation , genital abnormalities dominated by <START:PHENOTYPE> short penis <END> , and skeletal abnormalities including chest deformity ( combination of upper <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus carinatum <END> with lower pectus excavatum) , and short palms with broad <START:PHENOTYPE> short fingers <END> .
Affected individuals displayed distinctive facial features including <START:PHENOTYPE> upslanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thick eyebrows <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> wide mouth <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin upper lip <END> and upturned corners of the mouth , widow 's peak , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , and simple ears with fleshy <START:PHENOTYPE> overfolded helices <END> .
This phenotype does not fully meet typical diagnostic features of any known condition .
The expanding phenotype of GLUT1-deficiency syndrome .
Transport of glucose from the bloodstream across the blood-brain barrier to the central nervous system is facilitated by glucose transport protein type 1 ( GLUT1 ) , the first member of the solute carrier family 2 ( SLC2 ) .
Heterozygous mutations in the GLUT1 / SLC2A1 gene , occurring de novo or inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait , result in cerebral energy failure and a clinical condition termed GLUT1-deficiency syndrome ( GLUT1 - DS ) .
Clinical features usually comprise motor and mental <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> infantile onset <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deceleration of head growth <END> often resulting in acquired microcephaly , and a movement disorder with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> .
Subsequent to the delineation of this classic phenotype the variability of signs and symptoms in GLUT1 - DS is being recognized .
Patients with (i ) carbohydrate-responsive symptoms , with ( ii ) predominant <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , but without <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and with ( iii ) paroxysmal exertion-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> dyskinesia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> have been reported .
Common laboratory hallmark in all phenotypes is the reduced glucose level in cerebrospinal fluid with lowered CSF-to-blood glucose ratio .
Treatment with a ketogenic diet results in marked improvement of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and movement disorders .
Type I <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> includes two clinically and genetically distinct entities with either renal or multiple target organ defects .
Type I <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudohypoaldosteronism <END> ( PHA ) is a hereditary disease characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> salt wasting <END> resulting from target organ unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids .
We have studied two kindreds including a total of nine patients with PHA .
In kindred I , the propositus presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal salt wasting <END> in infancy ( <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , short stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyponatremia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> ) and responded dramatically to a high salt diet ( 2.5 g/day ) .
Sodium supplementation was discontinued at the age of two .
In seven additional family members from three generations , clinical expression of PHA varied from asymptomatic to moderate .
In affected members ( propositus , mother , and two brothers ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperaldosteronism <END> persisted over 13 yr ; however , the PRA decreased gradually to near normal values .
Persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperaldosteronism <END> in the face of a decrease in PRA indicated the development of tertiary <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperaldosteronism <END> due to autonomously functioning zona glomerulosa .
The pedigree was consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode of transmission with variable expression .
In kindred II , the propositus , who was the product of a consanguineous marriage , developed severe renal salt losing at age 9 days .
She had also increased salivary and sweat electrolytes consistent with PHA resulting from multiple organ unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids .
Life threatening episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> salt wasting <END> recurred beyond the age of 2 yr . At 5 yr of age she still requires high amounts of salt supplements ( 14 g/day ) .
A sister died at 9 days of age with PHA symptoms .
Six close relatives ( parents , three siblings , maternal uncle ) showed no biochemical abnormalities .
This pedigree was consistent with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance .
In view of the findings on these two kindreds and the analysis of those in the literature , we conclude that type I PHA includes two clinically and genetically distinct entities with either renal or multiple target organ defects .
UBE2A deficiency syndrome : Mild to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , absent speech , urogenital , and skin anomalies in male patients .
We describe three patients with a comparable deletion encompassing SLC25A43 , SLC25A5 , CXorf56 , UBE2A , NKRF , and two non-coding RNA genes , U1 and LOC100303728 . Moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> ( ID) , psychomotor retardation , severely impaired/absent speech , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and urogenital anomalies were present in all three patients .
Facial dysmorphisms include ocular hypertelorism , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> .
These clinical features overlap with those described in two patients from a family with a similar deletion at Xq24 that also includes UBE2A , and in several patients of Brazilian and Polish families with point mutations in UBE2A.
Notably , all five patients with an Xq24 deletion have ventricular septal defects that are not present in patients with a point mutation , which might be attributed to the deletion of SLC25A5 .
Taken together , the UBE2A deficiency syndrome in male patients with a mutation in or a deletion of UBE2A is characterized by ID , absent speech , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , urogenital anomalies , frequently including a <START:PHENOTYPE> small penis <END> , and skin abnormalities , which include generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low posterior hairline <END> , myxedematous appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> widely spaced nipples <END> , and hair whorls .
Facial dysmorphisms include a wide face , a <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> large mouth <END> with downturned corners , thin vermilion , and a short , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad neck <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis verticis gyrata <END> of the scalp , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , cataracts , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in two brothers .
We describe the cases of two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , primary <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis verticis gyrata <END> of the scalp , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent supraorbital ridges <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> exotropia <END> , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , cataracts , sensorineural hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
A review of the literature focusing on the major clinical findings suggests that our cases may represent a hitherto unreported new syndrome .

Role of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> in human disease .
Resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is present in the majority of patients with impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT) or non-insulin-dependent <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> ( NIDDM ) and in approximately 25% of nonobese individuals with normal oral glucose tolerance .
In these conditions , deterioration of glucose tolerance can only be prevented if the beta-cell is able to increase its insulin secretory response and maintain a state of chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> .
When this goal cannot be achieved , gross decompensation of glucose homeostasis occurs .
The relationship between <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , plasma insulin level , and glucose intolerance is mediated to a significant degree by changes in ambient plasma free-fatty acid ( FFA ) concentration .
Patients with NIDDM are also resistant to insulin suppression of plasma FFA concentration , but plasma FFA concentrations can be reduced by relatively small increments in insulin concentration .
Consequently , elevations of circulating plasma FFA concentration can be prevented if large amounts of insulin can be secreted .
If <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> cannot be maintained , plasma FFA concentration will not be suppressed normally , and the resulting increase in plasma FFA concentration will lead to increased hepatic glucose production .
Because these events take place in individuals who are quite resistant to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake , it is apparent that even small increases in hepatic glucose production are likely to lead to significant fasting <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperglycemia <END> under these conditions .
Although <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> may prevent frank decompensation of glucose homeostasis in insulin-resistant individuals , this compensatory response of the endocrine pancreas is not without its price .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , treated or untreated , are insulin resistant , hyperglycemic , and hyperinsulinemic .
In addition , a direct relationship between plasma insulin concentration and blood pressure has been noted .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertension <END> can also be produced in normal rats when they are fed a fructose-enriched diet , an intervention that also leads to the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> .
The development of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> in normal rats by an experimental manipulation known to induce <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> provides further support for the view that the relationship between the three variables may be a causal one.( ABSTR ACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS )
A cytogenetic abnormality and rare coding variants identify ABCA13 as a candidate gene in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , bipolar disorder , and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Schizophrenia <END> and bipolar disorder are leading causes of morbidity across all populations , with heritability estimates of approximately 80% indicating a substantial genetic component .
Population genetics and genome-wide association studies suggest an overlap of genetic risk factors between these illnesses but it is unclear how this genetic component is divided between common gene polymorphisms , rare genomic copy number variants , and rare gene sequence mutations .
We report evidence that the lipid transporter gene ABCA13 is a susceptibility factor for both <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and bipolar disorder .
After the initial discovery of its disruption by a chromosome abnormality in a person with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , we resequenced ABCA13 exons in 100 cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and 100 controls .
Multiple rare coding variants were identified including one nonsense and nine missense mutations and compound heterozygosity /homozygosity in six cases . Variants were genotyped in additional <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , bipolar , <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> ( n > 1600) , and control ( n > 950 ) cohorts and the frequency of all rare variants combined was greater than controls in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ( OR = 1 .93 , p = 0.0057 ) and bipolar disorder ( OR = 2.71 , p = 0.00007 ) .
The population attributable risk of these mutations was 2.2% for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and 4. 0% for bipolar disorder .
In a study of 21 families of mutation carriers , we genotyped affected and unaffected relatives and found significant linkage ( LOD = 4.3 ) of rare variants with a phenotype including <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , bipolar disorder , and major <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> .
These data identify a candidate gene , highlight the genetic overlap between <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , bipolar disorder , and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , and suggest that rare coding variants may contribute significantly to risk of these disorders .
Monogenic nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> : audiological and linkage analysis in a large Greek pedigree .
The aim of our study was to characterize the <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> in a large multigenerational Greek family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> and to perform genetic linkage analysis to known <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> loci and collagen genes .
In addition , we looked for mutations in the NOG gene to rule out congenital stapes ankylosis syndrome .
Audiological analysis of the affected persons was based on multiple linear regression ( MLR ) analysis and construction of age-related typical audiograms ( ARTA ) .
Genotyping of microsatellite DNA polymorphisms for known <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> ( OTSC ) loci or collagen genes and linkage analysis using the MLINK computer program were performed .
The coding region of the NOG gene was screened for mutations by direct DNA sequencing .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> in this family appears in childhood as conductive , but soon becomes mixed .
Because the additional sensorineural component is progressive , this finally has lead to a pure sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> in some family members , as the conductive component is masked .
Audiological analysis showed an age-independent conductive component and a progressive frequency-specific sensorineural component .
Linkage analysis excluded linkage to the four known <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> loci ( OTS C1 , OTSC2 , OTSC3 , and OTSC5 ) , as well as to the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes .
Mutation analysis of the coding region of the NOG gene did not reveal any disease causing mutation .
This study represents the first description of a detailed audiological analysis in a large pedigree segregating <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> as a monogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
Exclusion of the four known <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> loci in this family shows that monogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> is a genetically heterogeneous disease involving at least five different genes .
A mutation in the NOG gene is not the underlying molecular mechanism of the early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> segregating in this family .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ambiguous genitalia <END> associated with skeletal abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> craniostenosis <END> , psychomotor retardation , and facial abnormalities ( SCARF syndrome ) .
We describe 2 male maternal first cousins , 7 years and 7 months old , with a previously unreported pattern of malformations including <START:PHENOTYPE> lax skin <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hyperextensibility <END> , umbilical and inguinal herniae , <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus carinatum <END> , several abnormally shaped vertebrae , <START:PHENOTYPE> enamel hypoplasia <END> and hypocalcification of the teeth , facial abnormalities and wide <START:PHENOTYPE> webbed neck <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> , multiple nodular liver tumors , and mild psychomotor retardation .
The occurrence of 2 male children related through their mothers suggests the possibility of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive inheritance <END> .
It is proposed to call this disorder the SCARF syndrome ( skeletal abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> craniostenosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> , retardation , facial abnormalities ) .
Characterization of a 8q21.11 microdeletion syndrome associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> and a recognizable phenotype .
We report eight unrelated individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> and overlapping submicroscopic deletions of 8q21.11 ( 0.66-13.55 Mb in size ) .
The deletion was familial in one and simplex in seven individuals .
The phenotype was remarkably similar and consisted of a <START:PHENOTYPE> round face <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> full cheeks <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , cornea opacities , an underdeveloped alae , a <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , a cupid 's bow of the upper lip , down-turned corners of the mouth , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , low-set and <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent ears <END> , and mild finger and toe anomalies ( <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> , and broadening of the first rays ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Intellectual disability <END> , hypotonia , decreased balance , sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , and unusual behavior were frequently observed .
A high-resolution oligonucleotide array showed different proximal and distal breakpoints in all of the individuals .
Sequencing studies in three of the individuals revealed that proximal and distal breakpoints were located in unique sequences with no apparent homology .
The smallest region of overlap was a 539.7 kb interval encompassing three genes : a Zinc Finger Homeobox 4 ( ZFHX4) , one microRNA of unknown function , and one nonfunctional pseudogen .
ZFHX4 encodes a transcription factor expressed in the adult human brain , skeletal muscle , and liver .
It has been suggested as a candidate gene for congenital bilateral isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> .
Our results suggest that the 8q21.11 submicroscopic deletion represents a clinically recognizable entity and that a haploinsufficient gene or genes within the minimal deletion region could underlie this syndrome .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Urticaria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthralgia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> without amyloidosis : another variant of the Muckle-Wells syndrome ?
The term Muckle-Wells syndrome ( MWS ) describes an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterised by various combinations of <START:PHENOTYPE> urticaria <END> , sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , amyloidosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthralgia <END> and skeletal abnormalities .
We describe a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> and several symptoms of MWS , but no evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> or amyloidosis .
Since <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> without amyloidosis has never been reported in MWS , but <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is a feature of all reported pedigrees , we conclude that members of this family have a previously unreported inherited predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> urticaria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthralgia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> which is distinct from the MWS phenotype .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small hands <END> and feet , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is linked to Xq28 . Of the gene-rich regions of the human genome , Xq28 is the most densely mapped .
Mutations of genes in this band are responsible for 10 syndromal forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and 5 nonsyndromal forms .
Clinical and molecular studies reported here add an additional syndromic form of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) to this region .
The condition comprises <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small hands <END> and feet , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
One affected male died at age 19 years in status epilepticus , but others have survived to old age .
Carrier females do not have somatic anomalies or <START:PHENOTYPE> mental impairment <END> .
The gene is localized to the terminal 8 Mb of Xq28 with markers distal to DXS8011 showing linkage to the disorder with a lod score of 2.11 at zero recombination .

Clinical features and management issues in Mowat-Wilson syndrome .
Mowat-Wilson syndrome ( MWS ) is a relatively newly described multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome .
Haploinsufficiency of a gene termed ZFHX1B ( also known as SIP1 ) on chromosome 2 is responsible for this condition , and clinical genetic testing for MWS recently became available .
The majority of reports in the literature originate from Northern Europe and Australia .
Here we report our clinical experience with 12 patients diagnosed with MWS within a 2-year period of time in the United States , with particular emphasis on clinical characteristics and management strategies .
Individuals with this condition have characteristic facial features , including <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , medially flared and broad eyebrows , prominent columella , <START:PHENOTYPE> pointed chin <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> uplifted earlobes <END> , which typically prompt the clinician to consider the diagnosis .
Medical issues in our cohort of patients included <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( 75% ) with no predeliction for any particular <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> type ; <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> (6 0 % of our patients studied ) ; congenital heart defects ( 75% ) , particularly involving the pulmonary arteries and/or valves ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> (55 % of males ) ; severely impaired or <START:PHENOTYPE> absent speech <END> (100% of individuals over 1 year of age ) with relatively spared receptive language ; and <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> (5 0% ) or chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> ( 25% ) .
The incidence of MWS is unknown , but based on the number of patients identified in a short period of time within the US , it is likely greatly under recognized .
MWS should be considered in any individual with severely impaired or <START:PHENOTYPE> absent speech <END> , especially in the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and anomalies involving the pulmonary arteries ( particularly <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary artery sling <END> ) or pulmonary valves .

Variable expressivity of the clinical and biochemical phenotype associated with the apolipoprotein E p.Leu149del mutation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Splenomegaly <END> with sea-blue histiocytes , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> is a very rare association that has been described in only one report to date .
The molecular defect in the two reported patients consists in a deletion of a leucine at position 149 in the receptor-binding region of the apoE molecule .
Here , we report on another family in whom the proband and his brother were diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> .
An apoE p.Leu149del mutation was found in both subjects .
A large beta band in the VLDL fraction and elevated VLDL cholesterol-to-plasma triglyceride ratio was observed in the proband only .
Their mother , presenting with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , also carried the same p.Leu149del mutation .
The coexistence of factors facilitating the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> and/or low HDL-cholesterol level could explain why the proband and his brother developed a <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , whereas the mother did not .
Moreover , the presence of an apoE2 allele in the proband likely explains the more severe phenotype we observed in this subject .
In conclusion , the apoE p.Leu149del mutation results in a very striking phenotype including one or all symptoms among <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , and should be considered as a differential diagnosis of storage disorders in the causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> with sea-blue histiocytes .
The gene responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ( CPX ) in a British Columbia native kindred is localized between PGK1 and DXYS1 .
Human craniofacial malformations are a class of common congenital anomalies in which the etiology is heterogeneous and often poorly understood .
To better delineate the molecular basis of craniofacial development , we have undertaken a series of experiments directed toward the isolation of a gene involved in human secondary palate formation .
DNA marker linkage studies have been performed in a large British Columbia ( B.C. ) Native family in which <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> segregates as an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> trait .
We have examined 62 family members , including 15 affected males and 8 obligate carrier females .
A previous clinical description of the clefting defect in this kindred included submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and bifid or absent uvula .
Our recent reevaluation of the family has indicated that <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> ( tongue-tie ) is also a feature of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> in some of the affected males and carrier females .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ankyloglossia <END> has previously been associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> in an Icelandic kindred in which a gene responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ( CPX ) was assigned to the Xq21.3-q22 region between DXYS12 and DXS17 .
For the B.C . kindred reported here , we have mapped the gene responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> ankyloglossia <END> to a more proximal position on the X chromosome .
No recombination was observed between B.C . CPX and the DNA marker DXS72 ( peak lod score [Zmax ] = 7.44 at recombination fraction [theta] = .0 ) localized to Xq21.1 .
Recombination was observed between CPX and PGK1 ( Zmax = 7.35 at theta = .03 ) and between CPX and DXYS1 ( Zmax = 5.59 at theta = .04 ) .
These recombination events localize B.C . CPX between PGK1 and DXYS1 in the Xq13-q21.31 region .
Thin-basement-membrane nephropathy in adults with persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Thin-basement-membrane nephropathy , also called benign recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , is characterized by diffuse thinning of the glomerular basement membrane and by <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
To determine the incidence of thin-basement-membrane nephropathy among patients with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , we conducted a prospective study in the nephrology units of three large hospitals in the Netherlands .
Eighty normotensive adults without azotemia underwent renal biopsy because of recurrent macroscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> ( n = 26 ) or persistent microscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> ( n = 54 ) . Idiopathic IgA nephropathy was found in 27 of the 80 patients .
Light microscopical examination showed that 42 patients had normal renal tissue .
The remaining 11 patients had mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis ( n = 5 ) , interstitial nephritis ( n = 3) , or focal global glomerulosclerosis ( n = 3 ) . Tissue from the 42 patients whose renal biopsy specimens were normal when examined with light microscopy was analyzed morphometrically with electron microscopy to determine the thickness of the glomerular basement membrane .
Two subsets of patients were identified by this analysis .
In 18 , thin-basement-membrane nephropathy was found ( mean basement-membrane thickness [ + /- SE] , 191 +/- 28 nm ; normal , 350 +/- 43 nm ) ; all but one of these 18 patients had microscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , which persisted during follow-up ( median duration , 50 months ) .
( Of the 54 patients who presented with microscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , 17 [31 percent ] had thin-basement-membrane nephropathy. )
The thickness of the glomerular basement membrane was normal in the other 24 patients ( 361 +/- 69 nm ) ; during follow-up , <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> disappeared in all 13 of these patients who had macroscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> resolved in 5 of the 11 patients who had microscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
We conclude that in patients with persistent microscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , the incidence of thin-basement-membrane nephropathy is similar to that of idiopathic IgA nephropathy.
Morphometric analysis of the thickness of the glomerular basement membrane should be included in the workup of adults with persistent microscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> that is not of urologic origin .
Brain anomalies , retardation of mentality and growth , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> , skeletal malformations , <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> , ear deformity and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , eye hypoplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and kidney dysplasia/hypoplasia ( BRESEK/BRESHECK ) : new X-linked syndrome ?
Two half brothers ( maternally related ) had a similar syndrome of microhydrocephaly in both brothers and dilatation of the spinal canal with fusion of thalami in one brother .
Primordial growth delay was noted in both brothers , with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in the surviving brother .
Both had <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> with scaling , hyperkeratosis , and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , but normal sweat and sebaceous glands .
Skeletal anomalies included hemivertebrae with abnormal segmentation in one and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> with polydactyly in the other .
Ears were apparently low set , large , and protruding , with mixed <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> in the brother who survived .
Eye anomalies included maldevelopment of one eye in Patient 1 and small optic nerves more noticeable on one side in Patient 2 . Both had <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> and dysplastic/hypoplastic kidneys of varying severity that resulted in the early postnatal death of one sib .
Manifestations present in only one or the other sib included submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , aganglionosis of the rectum and colon , agenesis of one testicle , and single umbilical artery .
This syndrome has not been described previously and may be due to an X-linked mutation .
The acronym BRESEK reflects the common findings , whereas BRESHECK denotes all manifestations of both patients : brain , retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> , skeletal deformities , <START:PHENOTYPE> Hirschsprung disease <END> , ear/eye anomalies , cleft palate/cryptorchidism , and kidney dysplasia/hypoplasia .
In addition to an X-linked mutation , a contiguous gene deletion or maternal mosaicism of an autosomal dominant gene must be considered .
Clinical review : Thyrotoxic <START:PHENOTYPE> periodic paralysis <END> : a diagnostic challenge .
The aim of this article was to review the clinical presentation , pathogenesis , and management of thyrotoxic <START:PHENOTYPE> periodic paralysis <END> ( TPP ) .
A MEDLINE search was conducted for articles published during the last 40 yr based on the key words thyrotoxic <START:PHENOTYPE> periodic paralysis <END> and hypokalemic <START:PHENOTYPE> periodic paralysis <END> .
A total of 281 primary articles and 168 references of the retrieved articles were also reviewed .
TPP is a common complication of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> in Asian men but is increasingly seen in Western countries .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypokalemia <END> and muscle paralysis results from a sudden intracellular shift of potassium and is not due to potassium deficiency .
Clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> in patients with TPP may be subtle .
Immediate potassium supplementation prevents serious cardiopulmonary complications and may hasten the recovery of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> .
Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers can ameliorate and prevent recurrence of the paralytic attacks .
This <START:PHENOTYPE> episodic paralysis <END> will remit with definitive control of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperthyroidism <END> .
Increased sodium-potassium ATPase pump activity and enhanced insulin response in patients with TPP is postulated to contribute to the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemia <END> .
The genetic predisposition for TPP is not entirely clear .
Association of polymorphisms of the calcium channel alpha1-subunit gene with TPP has been noted .
Due to population mobility , TPP is increasingly common in Western countries .
Early diagnosis and prompt treatment prevent life-threatening complications associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> .
Assaying of thyroid function in patients with hypokalemic paralysis distinguishes TPP from other forms of hypokalemic <START:PHENOTYPE> periodic paralysis <END> .
SLC34A3 mutations in patients with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> predict a key role for the sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaPi-IIc in maintaining phosphate homeostasis .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> ( HHRH ) is a rare disorder of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> that was first described in a large consanguineous Bedouin kindred .
HHRH is characterized by the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> secondary to <START:PHENOTYPE> renal phosphate wasting <END> , radiographic and/or histological evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> , limb deformities , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> bone pain <END> .
HHRH is distinct from other forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> in that affected individuals present with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> due to increased serum 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D levels and increased intestinal calcium absorption .
We performed a genomewide linkage scan combined with homozygosity mapping , using genomic DNA from a large consanguineous Bedouin kindred that included 10 patients who received the diagnosis of HHRH .
The disease mapped to a 1.6-Mbp region on chromosome 9q34 , which contains SLC34A3 , the gene encoding the renal sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaP(i )-IIc.
Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a homozygous single-nucleotide deletion ( c.228delC ) in this candidate gene in all individuals affected by HHRH .
This mutation is predicted to truncate the NaP(i )-IIc protein in the first membrane-spanning domain and thus likely results in a complete loss of function of this protein in individuals homozygous for c.228delC .
In addition , compound heterozygous missense and deletion mutations were found in three additional unrelated HHRH kindreds , which supports the conclusion that this disease is caused by SLC34A3 mutations affecting both alleles .
Individuals of the investigated kindreds who were heterozygous for a SLC34A3 mutation frequently showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> , often in association with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> and/or elevations in 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D levels .
We conclude that NaP(i )-IIc has a key role in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis .
Deletion of the CUL4B gene in a boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , minor facial anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , and ataxia .
The CUL4B gene encodes a member of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex .
Point mutations in CUL4B were identified recently in patients with syndromic X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) .
Here , using oligoarray-based comparative genomic hybridization ( array CGH) , we identified a de novo deletion of the CUL4B gene in a boy with syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , minor facial anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed puberty <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> relative macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gait ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , all manifestations described previously in patients with CUL4B point mutations .
Interestingly , our patient also presented with aortic valvular "dysplasia " and vertebral anomalies similar to those seen in Scheuermann disease , both of which may also be part of this syndrome .
This report further suggests that point mutations and deletions of the CUL4B gene lead to a recognizable phenotype .
The association of facial anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> gait ataxia <END> in a mentally retarded boy should prompt molecular analyses of the CUL4B gene .
A newly recognized neuroectodermal syndrome of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> , deafness , and hypogonadism .
We describe a large , three generation kindred in which 16 individuals were affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , hyposmia or <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive deafness <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> , and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> atresia of the external auditory canal <END> , hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to LH/FSH deficiency , and a greater than normal tendency to <START:PHENOTYPE> dental caries <END> .
Variable manifestations include mild <START:PHENOTYPE> facial asymmetry <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
This seems to be a previously undescribed pleiotropic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait with variable expressivity .
The manifestations can be explained on the basis of involvement of the ectoderm and neuroectoderm of the first and second branchial arches , of Rathke 's pouch , and of the diencephalon .
Clinical and genetic analysis of two Tunisian <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> families .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Otosclerosis <END> is caused by an abnormal bone homeostasis of the otic capsule resulting in a conductive <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> when the free motion of the stapes is compromised .
An additional sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> arises in some patients , most likely due to otosclerotic foci that invade the cochlear endosteum .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Otosclerosis <END> is a very common <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> among Caucasians with a prevalence of about 0.3- 0.4% among white adults .
In the majority of cases , <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> can be considered as a complex disease , caused by both genetic as environmental factors , but <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> exist .
However , families large enough for genetic analysis are very rare and often show <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced penetrance <END> .
To date five loci have been reported , but none of the genes have been cloned yet .
In this study , we analyzed two new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> families from Tunisia , and genotyped them with microsatellite markers for the known loci , the collagen genes COL1A1 and COL1A2 , and NOG gene .
In the family LK , linkage to all known loci was excluded .
However , the family LS shows suggestive linkage to the OTSC3 region on chromosome 6p21.3-p22.3 .
This result points out that , besides the five reported loci , there must be at least one additional locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> otosclerosis <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> ( SEMDJL ) : presentation in two unrelated patients in the United States .
This is a report of two North American patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> , an uncommon <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal dysplasia <END> rarely reported outside of South Africa .
Patients with SEMDJL have vertebral abnormalities and ligamentous laxity that results in spinal misalignment and progressive severe <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> , thoracic asymmetry , and respiratory compromise resulting in early death .
Nonaxial skeletal involvement includes elbow deformities with <START:PHENOTYPE> radial head dislocation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dislocated hips <END> , clubbed feet , and tapered fingers with spatulate distal phalanges .
Many affected children have an <START:PHENOTYPE> oval face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat midface <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent eyes <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> .
Palatal abnormalities and congenital heart disease are also observed .
Diagnosis in infancy may be difficult because many of the typical findings are not apparent early and only evolve over time .
We review the physical and radiographic findings in two unrelated patients with this disorder in order to increase the awareness of this disorder , particularly for clinicians outside of South Africa .

von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease in thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> and the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> .
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> and the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> are severe microvascular disorders of platelet clumping with similar signs and symptoms .
Unusually large multimers of von Willebrand factor , capable of agglutinating circulating platelets under high shear stress , occur in the two conditions .
We investigated the prevalence of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease deficiency in patients with familial and nonfamilial forms of these disorders .
Plasma samples were obtained from 53 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> .
Von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease was assayed in diluted plasma samples with purified normal von Willebrand factor as the substrate .
The extent of the degradation of von Willebrand factor was assessed by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gels and immunoblotting .
To determine whether an inhibitor of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease was present , we measured the protease activity in normal plasma after incubation with plasma from the patients .
We examined 30 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> and 23 patients with the <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> .
Of 24 patients with nonfamilial thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> , 20 had severe and 4 had moderate protease deficiency during an acute event .
An inhibitor found in 20 of these patients was shown to be IgG in five of five tested plasma samples .
Of 13 patients with nonfamilial <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> , 11 had normal levels of activity of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease during the acute episode , whereas in 2 patients , the activity was slightly decreased .
All 6 patients with familial thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> lacked von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease activity but had no inhibitor , whereas all 10 patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> had normal protease activity .
In vitro proteolytic degradation of von Willebrand factor by the protease was studied in 5 patients with familial and 7 patients with nonfamilial <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic-uremic syndrome <END> and was normal in all 12 patients .
Nonfamilial thrombotic thrombocytopenic <START:PHENOTYPE> purpura <END> is due to an inhibitor of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease , whereas the familial form seems to be caused by a constitutional deficiency of the protease .
Patients with the hemolyticuremic syndrome do not have a deficiency of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease or a defect in von Willebrand factor that leads to its resistance to protease .
Microdeletion/duplication at 15q13.2q13.3 among individuals with features of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and other neuropsychiatric disorders .
Segmental duplications at breakpoints ( BP4-BP5 ) of chromosome 15q13.2q13.3 mediate a recurrent genomic imbalance syndrome associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and/or electroencephalogram ( EEG ) abnormalities .
DNA samples from 1445 unrelated patients submitted consecutively for clinical array comparative genomic hybridisation ( CGH ) testing at Children 's Hospital Boston and DNA samples from 1441 individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> from 751 families in the <START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> Genetic Resource Exchange ( AGRE ) repository .
We report the clinical features of five patients with a BP4-BP5 deletion , three with a BP4-BP5 duplication , and two with an overlapping but smaller duplication identified by whole genome high resolution oligonucleotide array CGH . These BP4-BP5 deletion cases exhibit minor dysmorphic features , significant expressive language deficits , and a spectrum of neuropsychiatric impairments that include <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorder , <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <END> , anxiety disorder , and mood disorder .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cognitive impairment <END> varied from <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate mental retardation <END> to normal IQ with learning disability .
BP4-BP5 covers approximately 1.5 Mb ( chr15 :28.719-30.298 Mb ) and includes six reference genes and 1 miRNA gene , while the smaller duplications cover approximately 500 kb ( chr15 :28.902-29.404 Mb ) and contain three reference genes and one miRNA gene .
The BP4-BP5 deletion and duplication events span CHRNA7 , a candidate gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
However , none of these individuals reported here have <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , although two have an <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal EEG <END> .
The phenotype of chromosome 15q13.2q13.3 BP4-BP5 microdeletion/duplication syndrome may include features of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorder , a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> .
Recognition of this broader phenotype has implications for clinical diagnostic testing and efforts to understand the underlying aetiology of this syndrome .
STAT4 and the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Rheumatoid arthritis <END> is a chronic inflammatory disease with a substantial genetic component .
Susceptibility to disease has been linked with a region on chromosome 2q .
We tested single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in and around 13 candidate genes within the previously linked chromosome 2q region for association with <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
We then performed fine mapping of the STAT1 - STAT4 region in a total of 1620 case patients with established <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> and 2635 controls , all from North America . Implicated SNPs were further tested in an independent case-control series of 1529 patients with early <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> and 881 controls , all from Sweden , and in a total of 1039 case patients and 1248 controls from three series of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .
A SNP haplotype in the third intron of STAT4 was associated with susceptibility to both <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .
The minor alleles of the haplotype-defining SNPs were present in 27% of chromosomes of patients with established <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> , as compared with 22% of those of controls ( for the SNP rs7574865 , P=2.81x10( -7 ) ; odds ratio for having the risk allele in chromosomes of patients vs . those of controls , 1.32 ) .
The association was replicated in Swedish patients with recent-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( P= 0.02 ) and matched controls .
The haplotype marked by rs7574865 was strongly associated with lupus , being present on 31 % of chromosomes of case patients and 22% of those of controls ( P=1.87x10( -9 ) ; odds ratio for having the risk allele in chromosomes of patients vs . those of controls , 1.55 ) .
Homozygosity of the risk allele , as compared with absence of the allele , was associated with a more than doubled risk for lupus and a 60 % increased risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
A haplotype of STAT4 is associated with increased risk for both <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> , suggesting a shared pathway for these illnesses .

Familial cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , epilepsy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> : a distinct clinical entity ?
To describe a European family with cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , epilepsy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , the pedigree of which indicates an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> of the disease .
Clinical , laboratory , neurophysiological , and neuroimaging data were studied .
Institute for research on <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Two siblings ( aged 25 and 28 years ) and their 49-year-old mother had postural and action <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , seizures , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Only <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> was present in the maternal grandmother ( aged 68 years ) .
The electroencephalogram showed diffuse spike-and-wave complexes and/or posterior spikes , and a photoparoxysmal response in the 4 subjects .
The typical electrophysiologic features of cortical reflex myoclonus , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> giant somatosensory evoked potentials <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> enhancement of the C-reflex <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> jerk-locked premyoclonus spikes <END> , were found in all patients .
This syndrome may represent a specific form of familial cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> with a benign form of epilepsy and a new genetic model of cortical hyperexcitability inherited with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mechanism .
Prevalence , genetics , and clinical features of patients carrying podocin mutations in steroid-resistant nonfamilial <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> .
Podocin mutations ( NPHS2 gene ) are responsible for the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> of steroid-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
As a result of a screening for these gene alterations in a cohort of Italian patients with nonfamilial <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> and histologic <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> ( FSGS) , nine patients with NPHS2 gene homozygous or composite heterozygous mutations were found .
In addition to the previously described defects , two novel mutations at exon 4 were identified ( frameshift , L169P ) ; four single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and one dinucleotide repeat were also identified .
On the basis of haplotype analysis , a founder effect was suggested for the 419delG mutation , the most frequently observed in the patients studied .
Patients carrying NPHS2 mutations and without a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> were indistinguishable from those with idiopathic FSGS on the basis of the clinical phenotype .
Two of the nine patients had normal renal function at 3 and 10 yr of age , despite the presence of the <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
The other seven had reached <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal failure <END> at a mean age of 9.6 yr ( range , 4 to 17 yr ) and had received renal allografts .
In those presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal failure <END> , the clinical and laboratory features both before and after transplantation were similar , including the age at onset , the amount of <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , and the absence of any response to steroids and other immunosuppressants .
Finally , two children presented recurrence of mild <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> after transplantation , which promptly remitted after plasmapheresis combined with cyclophosphamide .
These data demonstrate that podocin mutations in nonfamilial cases of steroid-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> are frequent and may be due in one case to a founder effect .
The pretransplantation and posttransplantation outcomes in the group of patients with mutations of the podocin gene are similar to classical idiopathic FSGS , including the possibility of recurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> that is mild and responsive to plasmapheresis .
These observations support a role of molecular screening of the podocin gene in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> before immunosuppressive treatment is started .
Recessive POLG mutations presenting with sensory and ataxic neuropathy in compound heterozygote patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> is a mitochondrial disease characterized by accumulation of multiple large-scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA .
We previously reported missense mutations in POLG , the gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma in two nuclear families compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
Here , we report a novel POLG missense mutation ( R627W ) in a sporadic patient and we provide genetic support that all these POLG mutations are actually causal and recessive .
The novel patient presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory ataxic neuropathy <END> and has the clinical triad of <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory ataxic neuropathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and ophthalmoparesis ( SANDO ) .
This is the first finding of a genetic cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> Sensory Ataxic Neuropathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Dysarthria <END> and Ophthalmoparesis and it implies that this disorder may actually be a variant of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
Sensory neuropathy is the initial feature in Belgian compound heterozygote <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> patients , all carrying the POLG A467T mutation , which occurs at a frequency of 0.6 % in the Belgian population .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Encephalopathy <END> with calcifications of the basal ganglia in children .
A reappraisal of Fahr 's syndrome with respect to 14 new cases .
Calcifications of the basal ganglia are described under the heading of " Fahr 's syndrome " .
The clinical pattern is variable and the syndrome may be sporadic or familial .
This study describes a personal series of 14 cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> calcification of the basal ganglia <END> and reviews the literature cases .
A four-group classification is proposed .
The first group includes <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> or optic atrophy , symmetrical patchy demyelination with calcifications and probable <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Some cases have an early onset , a rapid evolution .
Others have a later onset , longer course and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> .
In the second group , the children suffer from a congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> or a cerebral palsy without clear deterioration , without <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , ocular impairment or persistent CSF abnormalities .
This group has not been reported in the literature .
The cases do not seem to be genetic .
The precise cause in unknown but a sporadic non progressive anoxo-ischemic , or viral prenatal disease is suggested .
In the third group , the association of <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and persistent CSF lymphocytosis , has a high recurrence rate .
The pathogenesis is still a matter of dispute .
The fourth group is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> calcifications of the basal ganglia with or without neurological abnormalities .
Finally calcium metabolism disorders and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy may be associated with calcifications of the basal ganglia .
Isolated and syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> .
The association between <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> and multiple congenital malformations has been well documented over the last century .
Numerous authors have described cases as the <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> syndrome , but recently reports of cases without <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> have led several authors to use the eponymic designation Fraser syndrome .
We have seen seven cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> syndrome , including three sib pairs .
All presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> and bilateral renal agenesis in addition to other characteristic associated malformations .
A literature review showed 124 cases in which 27 demonstrated isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> , while 97 showed a pattern of multiple congenital malformations .
We selected four major and eight minor criteria which enabled us to classify 86 of those cases as having <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> syndrome with 11 remaining unclassified .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cryptophthalmos <END> demonstrates equal sex distribution , occurrence in sibs , consanguinity in families with more than one affected child , and lack of vertical transmission--strongly suggesting <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> sequence was sporadic in 16 cases and familial in 11 .
The familial cases occurred in three families and demonstrated vertical transmission .
The pathogenesis of this syndrome is unknown .
There are similarities to animal models of maternal vitamin A deprivation and defects in programmed cell death .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cryptophthalmos <END> syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases with multiple congenital malformations , especially when they are associated with renal agenesis , even in the absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> .
A new X-linked syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , coloboma , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , and a mutation in the Alpha 4 gene at Xq13 .
We describe two brothers with a unique pattern of malformations that includes coloboma ( iris , optic nerve) , <START:PHENOTYPE> high forehead <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> retrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ( ACC ) .
Both boys have low-set <START:PHENOTYPE> cupped ears <END> with sensorineural hearing loss , normal phallus , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
One brother had <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> and cardiac defects consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> ( VSD ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> patent ductus arteriosus <END> ( PDA ) which resolved spontaneously .
Differential diagnosis between a number of clinical entities was considered , however , because ACC and the distinctive facial features were reminiscent of FG syndrome , DNA was analyzed for markers linked to the FGS1 locus at Xq13-q21 . Notably , the brothers were concordant for markers spanning this presumed FG region , and in both we have identified adjacent alterations ( -57delT and T-55A ) in the Alpha 4 gene located within this interval .
Alpha 4 is a regulatory subunit of the major cellular phosphatase , PP2A , that has recently been shown to interact with MID1 , the product of the gene mutated in X-linked Opitz GBBB syndrome .
The double nucleotide change identified in this family was not observed in 410 control chromosomes , suggesting that it may be a pathogenetic change .
Altered expression of Alpha 4 , through either a change in translational efficiency , mRNA stability or splicing , could explain the clinical phenotype in these boys and the phenotypic overlap with Opitz GBBB syndrome .

Ataxia-pancytopenia : syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic anemia <END> , monosomy 7 , and acute myelogenous leukemia .
In a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> , the proband had <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , developed <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic anemia <END> at age 3 years , and died of <START:PHENOTYPE> acute myelomonocytic leukemia <END> at age 7 . Serial cytogenetic studies of the proband 's hypoplastic bone marrow over a 25-month period revealed progressive expansion of a clone of cells with C( 6 - 12 + X ) monosomy from 33% to 94 % of metaphases .
The missing chromosome by banding was deduced to be No.7 . No increased sensitivity of the patient 's cells was found in response to ultraviolet or ionizing radiation or to mitomycin C . <START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebellar atrophy <END> was confirmed at autopsy . Family studies revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> in the proband 's father and all four siblings .
Two brothers , including one with C-monosomy , died with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic anemia <END> and another brother died with acute myelocytic leukemia .
The only surviving sibling is a 19-year-old sister who has unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> , decreased mitotic activity in bone marrow , and slow progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
The name ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome is proposed to encourage study of additional patients with this disorder , which predisposes to <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> acute leukemia <END> .
Clinical and molecular genetics of primary dystonias .
Primary dystonias are movement disorders with <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> as a major symptom .
They are frequently inherited as Mendelian traits .
There are at least eight clinically distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and two X-linked recessive forms .
In addition , pedigree analyses suggest the occurrence of an autosomal recessive variant .
The clinical classification is increasingly being replaced by a genetic one .
To date gene loci have been identified in at least six <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> forms , i.e. , in idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> ( 9q34) , focal <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> ( 18p ) , adult-onset idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> of mixed type ( 8p21-q22) , dopa-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> ( 14q22.1-q22.2) , and paroxysmal dystonic <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> ( 2q25-q33 ; 1p21-p13.3 ) .
Gene loci in the X-linked recessive forms have been assigned to Xq13.1 in the X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> parkinsonism syndrome and to Xq22 in X-linked sensorineural deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , and mental retardation .
The disease genes have been identified in two <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> forms and in one X-linked recessive form .
Mutations in a gene coding for an ATP-binding protein were detected in idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> torsion dystonia <END> ( DYT1 ) , and the GTP cyclohydrolase 1 gene is mutated in dopa-responsive <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> ( DYT5 ) .
In sensorineural deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , and mental retardation , mutations were found in the gene DDP coding for a polypeptide of unknown function .
This article reviews the clinical and molecular genetics of primary dystonias , critically discusses present findings , and proposes referring to the known forms , most of which can be distinguished by genetic criteria , as dystonias 1-12 .
Apparent third patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous mastocytosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mastocytosis <END> refers to a heterogeneous group of rare disorders characterized by an abnormal accumulation of mast cells in one or more organ systems .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cutaneous mastocytosis <END> ( CM ) is the most frequent form in children and is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperpigmented macules <END> or papules symmetrically distributed over the trunk , and less so over the limbs , neck , and scalp .
Two published articles have reported on unrelated girls presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> mastocytosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , hearing loss , and hypotonia .
Based on the original observation , this disorder was defined as CM with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> ( OMIM 248910 ) .
Here we report on a girl with similar manifestations who corroborates the existence of this rare disorder .
CM , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microtia <END> , and/or hearing loss are the minimal diagnostic criteria .
All the known patients were sporadic , but parental consanguinity in the first case argues for a possible autosomal-recessive inheritance .
Cardiac involvement in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> diseases .
A study on 17 patients with documented <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA defects .
Mutations of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA have been demonstrated as causes of human <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> diseases .
While these disorders typically involve multiple organs , the effect of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutations on the heart has not been systematically studied .
We studied <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutations and cardiac changes in 17 patients with Kearns-Say re syndrome ; ocular myopathy ; myoclonus <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with ragged red fibers ( MERRF) ; and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy , encephalopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and strokelike episodes ( MELAS ) .
Cardiac involvement was evaluated by chest radiograph , ECG , His-bundle electrogram , and echocardiogram .
All 3 patients with Kearns-Say re syndrome had large deletions of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA and disturbances in cardiac conduction .
ECG abnormalities were found in 2 of 6 patients with ocular myopathy who showed large deletions of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA .
All 3 patients with MERRF had an A-to-G mutation at nucleotide position 8344 ; 2 had cardiomegaly , asymmetrical septal hypertrophy , and diffuse hypokinesis of the left ventricle .
One patient with asymmetrical septal hypertrophy developed dilated <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> 2 years later .
All 5 patients with MELAS had an A-to-G mutation at nucleotide position 3243 , and 2 had symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with or without abnormal wall motion .
The clinical features of cardiac involvement in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> diseases vary in the different subgroups of these disorders .
Particular <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> mutations can cause characteristic cardiac abnormalities .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> ( Say syndrome ) .
In 1975 Say et al . ( Humangenetik 26:267-269 ) reported on a new dominantly inherited syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , and hand anomalies in 4 members of a family .
This is a report of a 13-month-old girl with <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , sparse scalp hair , large abnormally shaped ears , small hands with <START:PHENOTYPE> tapering fingers <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> , unusual dermatoglyphics , <START:PHENOTYPE> proximal renal tubular acidosis <END> with cystic dysplasia of the kidneys , and developmental delay .
This case appears to be the second report of this syndrome which presumably occurred as a new mutation in this family .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> congenital non-progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> overlaps with the SCA15 locus .
Most patients with pure nonprogressive congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> have a sporadic form of unknown heredity and etiology .
Several small families have been reported with a dominantly inherited nonprogressive congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( NPCA ) .
The authors ascertained and clinically characterized a four-generation pedigree segregating an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant type <END> of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia <END> associated with cognitive impairment .
Following the exclusion of several SCA localizations ( SCA-1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 17 , IOSCA , and DRPLA) , a genome-wide linkage study was performed .
Examination of the family showed that all affected members had gait <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and cognitive disability with variable features of <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysmetria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysdiadochokinesia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , dystonic movements , and cerebellar hypoplasia on imaging .
Clinical signs of pyramidal tract dysfunction and sensory changes were absent .
A genome-wide search in this family detected linkage to chromosome 3p with a maximum two-point lod score of 4.26 at D3S363 0 .
This localization to the pter is distal to D3S1304 , as defined by a recombination event .
This overlaps with the SCA15 locus , with the critical overlapping region between the microsatellite markers , D3S1304 and D3S1620 ( approximately 8 cM ) . <START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia <END> with or without cerebellar hypoplasia overlaps with the SCA15 locus on chromosome 3pter .
Association of <START:PHENOTYPE> 3-methylglutaconic aciduria <END> with sensori-neural deafness , encephalopathy , and Leigh-like syndrome ( MEGDEL association ) in four patients with a disorder of the oxidative phosphorylation .
In this paper , we describe a distinct clinical subtype of <START:PHENOTYPE> 3-methylglutaconic aciduria <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria <END> is a group of different metabolic disorders biochemically characterized by increased urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid .
We performed biochemical and genetic investigations , including urine organic acid analysis , NMR spectroscopy , measurement of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase activity , cardiolipin levels , OPA3 gene analysis and measurement of the oxidative phosphorylation in four female patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> 3-methylglutaconic aciduria <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria <END> type I , Barth syndrome , and Costeff syndrome were excluded as the activity of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase , the cardiolipin levels , and molecular analysis of the OPA3 gene , respectively , showed no abnormalities .
The children presented with characteristic association of hearing loss and the neuro-radiological evidence of Leigh disease .
They also had neonatal hypotonia , recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidemia <END> , episodes with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> feeding difficulties <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> .
Our patients were further biochemically characterized by a mitochondrial dysfunction and persistent urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid .
Presenilin 1 mutation in an african american family presenting with atypical Alzheimer <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Alzheimer disease <END> ( AD ) is characterized by memory and visuospatial deficits with relative sparing of personality .
Mutations in 3 genes ( presenilin 1 and 2 and amyloid precursor protein ) are associated with presenile AD . Presenilin 1 gene mutations have not been described in African Americans .
We studied an African American family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> rapidly progressive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and psychosis occurring early in the fifth decade of life .
We performed neurologic evaluations , psychometrics , and neuroimaging .
We sequenced the amyloid precursor protein gene , presenilin 1 and 2 , and tau in affected and unaffected family members .
One patient underwent a brain biopsy and subsequent autopsy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Personality change <END> , auditory and visual hallucinations , delusions , <START:PHENOTYPE> memory impairment <END> , word-finding difficulties , and subsequent rigidity , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , and mutism developed in 2 brothers .
Neuropsychometric testing in one was consistent with frontotemporal <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> or atypical AD . Neuroimaging studies showed diffuse cortical involvement .
A clinical diagnosis of familial non-Alzheimer <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> was made .
However , results of temporal lobe biopsy in one revealed amyloid neuritic plaques , and autopsy results confirmed the diagnosis of AD . Gene sequencing revealed a presenilin 1 point mutation ( M139V ) cosegregating with the disease .
A tau polymorphism in exon 7 ( A178T) was found in an affected brother and unaffected relatives .
We report the first documented presenilin mutation in African American patients presenting with early <START:PHENOTYPE> personality change <END> , psychosis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> memory loss <END> with preserved praxis .
The M139V mutation can present differently between kindreds , with some features suggestive of a frontal lobe syndrome .
The M139V mutation can lead to atypical AD , and genetic background may have a role in determining the phenotype of genetically defined AD .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> oculopharyngodistal myopathy in light of distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.
We investigated two Japanese siblings presenting with oculopharyngodistal myopathy , whose healthy parents were consanguineous .
To clarify their disease characteristics , we compared them with four patients with distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> linked to chromosome 9p1-q1 , and 36 patients with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy linked to 14q11 .2-q13 .
The first symptom in the patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> oculopharyngodistal myopathy was weakness of the tibialis anterior muscle .
Their biceps muscles showed initial and advanced myogenic changes , with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> in 3% and 6% of the muscle fibers , respectively .
In contrast , patients with distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> revealed many <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> , on average in 20% of the fibers , and their oculopharyngeal muscles were spared .
None of the patients with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy showed distal dominant weakness and the occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> was rare .
Ultrastructural studies in groups of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> oculopharyngodistal myopathy and distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> disclosed a collection of cytoplasmic filaments of 16-18 nm , but oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy-specific intranuclear inclusions of 8.5 nm were not found .
Thus , the phenotype of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> oculopharyngodistal myopathy is distinct from distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy , but shares some ultrastructural characteristics with distal myopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> rimmed vacuoles <END> and hereditary inclusion body myopathy.
Infantile lethal variant of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome associated with hydrops fetalis .
Simpson-Golabi Behmel syndrome ( SGBS ) is an X-linked disorder characterized by pre- and postnatal macrosomia , minor facial anomalies , and variable visceral , skeletal , and neurological abnormalities .
Since its first description by Simpson et al . [ 1975 : BD:OA XI(2 ):18-24] , a wide clinical range of cases has been reported .
There is great variability in severity , ranging from a mild form associated with long-term survival to an early lethal form with multiple congenital anomalies and <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> .
In 8 reported families , affected individuals died in infancy .
Here we present 4 maternally related , male cousins with a severe variant of SGBS .
One of these males was aborted therapeutically at 19 weeks of gestation following the detection of <START:PHENOTYPE> multicystic kidneys <END> on ultrasound .
The 3 liveborn males were hydropic at birth with a combination of craniofacial anomalies including <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> ; apparently low-set , <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly angulated ears <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> ; short , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> large mouth <END> with thin upper vermilion border ; <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent philtrum <END> ; high-arched or <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> ; redundant skin ; <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nails <END> ; skeletal defects involving upper and lower limbs ; gastrointestinal and genitourinary anomalies .
All 3 patients were hypotonic and neurologically impaired from birth .
With the exception of a trilobate left lung in one patient , the cardiorespiratory system was structurally normal .
All patients died within the first 8 weeks of life of multiple complications including <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> and sepsis .
Two SGBS kindreds , with moderate expression of the condition , have been mapped to Xq27.
It is not known whether severe , familial cases , such as ours , are genetically distinct from and map to another locus .
Final resolution of the genetic basis of the phenotypic variability in SGBS must await cloning and mutation analysis of the SGBS gene(s ) .
Dysmorphic syndrome of hereditary neuralgic <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophy <END> associated with a SEPT9 gene mutation--a family study .
We report a family in which two siblings presented with an apparent dysmorphic syndrome , including <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , slight <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthal folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microstomia <END> and dysmorphic ears .
One sibling had a <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
Initially , <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus <END> inversus syndrome ( BPES ) was suspected ; however , mutation of the FOXL2 gene was not detected .
Moreover , the patients ' father and paternal grandmother had experienced recurrent episodes of unilateral brachial neuritis and were diagnosed to have hereditary neuralgic <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophy <END> ( HNA ) .
HNA is a rare , inherited form of brachial neuritis whose phenotypic spectrum may include <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and other minor dysmorphisms .
HNA maps to chromosome 17q25 and is associated with mutations in the SEPT9 gene .
After confirming a heterozygous SEPT9 mutation ( R88W ) in the father and his mother , it became apparent that the dysmorphic features in the children were part of HNA and that previous complaints of the daughter , erroneously diagnosed as pronatio dolorosa and then epiphysiolysis of the capitellum humeri , were in fact a first neuralgic pain attack .
Both children were shown to have inherited the paternal SEPT9 mutation .
Wider recognition of HNA as a syndromic disorder may facilitate its diagnosis in affected young persons who may not yet have manifested episodes of brachial neuritis .
A new syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and radial synostosis .
A new syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and radial synostosis has been described .
The family history suggests either an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode of inheritance with limited expression in females or X-linkage . Other syndromes with similar phenotypes and modes of inheritance are discussed .
The need for accurate and complete family histories in cases involving <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip/palate <END> is discussed in relation to genetic counselling and recurrent risk estimates .
Anticipation of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> with hypogonadism .
A large Swedish family with members affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> with hypogonadism were followed-up and reviewed .
Hypogonadism included delayed sexual maturation , <START:PHENOTYPE> primary amenorrhea <END> , early menopause , and testicular atrophy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cataracts <END> , cerebellar ataxia , neuropathy , hypoacusia , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , tremor , parkinsonism , <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , and mental retardation were other features observed in this family .
Muscle biopsy samples of advanced cases showed <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> , focal cytochrome c oxidase deficiency , and multiple mtDNA deletions by Southern blot analysis .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mode of inheritance was evident with anticipation in successive generations .
Linkage analysis excluded the chromosome 10q23.3-q24.3 region reported as being linked to the disease in a Finnish family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
We report for the first time clinical evidence for anticipation in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> .
We hypothesize that the nuclear gene causing this enigmatic disorder may be directly influenced by an expansion of an unstable DNA sequence and that the resulting phenotype is caused by a concerted action with multiple deletions of mtDNA .
A further patient with van Maldergem syndrome .
We report on a male patient with the proposed diagnosis of the rare but very distinct entity of van Maldergem syndrome .
His parents are first cousins .
At the age of 4 years the boy presented with severe developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> talipes equinovarus <END> , finger camptodactyly with interphalangeal pterygium , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral microtia <END> , and a dysmorphic facies .
He showed bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus <END> , telecanthus , <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad flat nasal bridge <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dental malocclusion <END> .
The combination of the specific facial features with camptodactyly , interphalangeal pterygium , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> and developmental delay led to the diagnosis of van Maldergem syndrome .
The medical history was further on significant for pharyngeal instability requiring the placement of a tracheostomy tube , an inguinal hernia , hip subluxation , <START:PHENOTYPE> small kidneys <END> and genital abnormalities ( <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid scrotum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> ) .
Due to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> feeding difficulties <END> permanent tube feeding was required .
Metabolic tests ( newborn metabolic screening , 7-dehydrocholesterol , amino acids , organic acids in urine ) and chromosomal analysis ( 45 0-50 0 bands ; 46 , XY ) were normal .
Molecular karyotyping revealed two parental CNVs ( paternal deletion of 9q33.1 ; maternal duplication of 11p15 .1 ) , which are unlikely to contribute to the patient 's phenotype .
Taken together , the report on a further patient with van Maldergem syndrome expands the clinical spectrum of the condition by adding genital malformations , hernia , pharyngeal instability , and subluxation of the hip .

Increased prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in boys who were probands with the FMR1 premutation and co-morbid <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorder .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> are a common co-occurring condition in those with fragile X syndrome ( FXS) , and in those with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorder ( ASD ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> are also associated with ASD in those with FXS .
However , little is known about the rate of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and how commonly these problems co-occur with ASD in boys with the FMR1 premutation .
We , therefore , determined the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and ASD in boys with the FMR1 premutation compared with their sibling counterparts and population prevalence estimates .
Fifty premutation boys who presented as clinical probands ( N = 25) , or non-probands ( identified by cascade testing after the proband was found ) ( N = 25) , and 32 non-carrier controls were enrolled .
History of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> was documented and ASD was diagnosed by standardized measures followed by a team consensus of ASD diagnosis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> ( 28% ) and ASD ( 68% ) were more prevalent in probands compared with non-probands ( 0 and 28% ) , controls ( 0 and 0% ) , and population estimates ( 1 and 1.7% ) . <START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> occurred more frequently in those with the premutation and co-morbid ASD particularly in probands compared with those with the premutation alone ( 25 vs . 3.85% , p = 0.045 ) .
Although cognitive and adaptive functioning in non-probands were similar to controls , non-probands were more likely to meet the diagnosis of ASD than controls ( 28 vs . 0% , p < 0.0001 ) .
In conclusion , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were relatively more common in premutation carriers who presented clinically as probands of the family and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were commonly associated with ASD in these boys .
Therefore , boys with the premutation , particularly if they are probands should be assessed carefully for both ASD and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndrome revisited .
The clinical spectrum of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndromes is highly <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> with respect to organ involvement and severity .
One of the major diagnostic criteria is to detect abnormal elastin fibers .
In several other clinically similar <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndromes , however , the classic histological anomalies are absent , and the definite diagnosis remains uncertain .
In <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> patients mutations have been demonstrated in elastin or fibulin genes , but in the majority of patients the underlying genetic etiology remains unknown .
Recently , we found mutations in the ATP6V0A2 gene in families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> .
This genetic defect is associated with abnormal glycosylation leading to a distinct combined disorder of the biosynthesis of N- and O-linked glycans .
Interestingly , similar mutations have been found in patients with wrinkly skin syndrome , without the presence of severe skin symptoms of elastin deficiency .
These findings suggest that the <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> and wrinkly skin syndromes are phenotypic variants of the same disorder .
Interestingly many phenotypically similar patients carry no mutations in the ATP6V0A2 gene .
The variable presence of protein glycosylation abnormalities in the diverse clinical forms of the wrinkled skin-cutis laxa syndrome spectrum necessitates revisiting the diagnostic criteria to be able to offer adequate prognosis assessment and counseling .
This paper aims at describing the spectrum of clinical features of the various forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndromes .
Based on the recently unraveled novel genetic entity we also review the genetic aspects in <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndromes including genotype-phenotype correlations and suggest a practical diagnostic approach .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Corpus callosum agenesis <END> , facial anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> Robin sequence <END> , and other anomalies : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome ?
We describe findings in four children , three of whom are sibs , who appear to have the same , previously undescribed multiple congenital anomaly ( MCA ) syndrome .
The main manifestations include <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Robin sequence <END> , abnormal ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> redundant neck skin <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> laryngeal anomalies <END> , cardiac defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> short hands <END> , and hypotonia .
The presence of this condition in sibs of each sex suggests that <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> is the most likely cause .
A MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome associated with a new point mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA tRNA( Lys ) gene .
Several members of a three-generation kindred from Sardinia were affected by a maternally inherited syndrome characterized by features of both <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> ( MERRF ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> ( MELAS ) .
Clinically , symptoms such as <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , neural deafness and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> were variably associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke-like episodes <END> and/or migrainous attacks .
Morphologically , numerous MELAS-associated SDH-stained vessels were observed in muscle biopsies , either alone or in combination with <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> , the morphological hallmark of MERRF .
Sequence analysis of the mtDNA tRNA genes revealed the presence of a single , heteroplasmic T- -> C transition at nt 8356 , in the region of the tRNA( Lys ) gene corresponding to the T-psi-C stem .
The T- ->C(8356 ) transition was exclusively found in the maternal lineage of our family , and the relative amount of the mutant mtDNA species in muscle was correlated with the severity of the clinical presentation .
Therefore , we propose that the T- ->C(8356 ) transition is responsible for the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy found in our family , and must be added to the expanding list of the pathogenetically relevant mutations of human mtDNA .
Severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> : inheritance and pathophysiology .
Severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is a heterogeneous disorder of hematopoiesis characterized by a maturation arrest of granulopoiesis at the level of promyelocytes with peripheral blood absolute neutrophil counts below 0.5 x 10/l .
In this review we summarize our current knowledge on inheritance and pathophysiolgy of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
There are two major subtypes of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> as judged by inheritance : autosomal dominant trait defined by neutrophil elastase mutations consisting of 60 % of patients and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait comprising approximately 30% of patients .
This genetic heterogeneity suggests that several pathologic mechanisms may lead to the same phenotype due to downregulation of common myeloid transcription factors .
Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 is the most promising candidate , as its abrogation together with downregulation of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 target genes is compatible with this phenotype .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is considered as a preleukemic syndrome , since after 10 years of observation the cumulative incidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> is 21% .
Acquired granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor mutations are detected in approximately 80% of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> patients who developed acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> is a congenital disorder of hematopoiesis inherited by autosomal dominant or recessive traits .
Downregulation of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 is involved in the pathophysiology of all congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> patients .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> patients with acquired granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor mutations define a group with high risk for development of <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> .
OEIS complex associated with chromosome 1p36 deletion : a case report and review .
OEIS complex ( <START:PHENOTYPE> Omphalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Exstrophy <END> of the cloaca , <START:PHENOTYPE> Imperforate anus <END> , and Spine abnormalities ) is a rare defect with estimated incidence of 1 in 200,000 live births .
Most cases are <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> , with no obvious cause .
However , it has been rarely reported in patients with family members having similar malformations or with chromosomal anomalies .
In addition , OEIS complex has been observed in association with environmental exposures , twinning , and in vitro fertilization .
Monosomy 1p36 is the most common terminal deletion syndrome , with a prevalence of 1 in 5 ,000 newborns .
It is characterized by specific facial features , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and heart , skeletal , genitourinary , and neurological defects .
We describe an infant with OEIS complex and 1p36 deletion who had features of both disorders , including <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cloacal exstrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , sacral multiple segmentation , renal malposition and <START:PHENOTYPE> malrotation <END> , genital anomalies , diastasis of the symphysis pubis , microbrachycephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> large anterior fontanel <END> , cardiac <START:PHENOTYPE> septal defects <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rib fusion <END> , a limb deformity , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and typical facial features .
Chromosomal microarray analysis detected a 2.4 Mb terminal deletion of chromosome 1p .
This is the first reported case with OEIS complex in association with a chromosome 1p36 deletion .

A large-scale , consortium-based genomewide association study of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> is influenced by genes and environment ; implicated genes may indicate pathways for therapeutic intervention .
Genetic risk factors may be useful in identifying subtypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and determining whether intermediate phenotypes , such as elevation of the total serum IgE level , are causally linked to disease .
We carried out a genomewide association study by genotyping 10 ,365 persons with physician-diagnosed <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and 16 ,11 0 unaffected persons , all of whom were matched for ancestry .
We used random-effects pooled analysis to test for association in the overall study population and in subgroups of subjects with childhood-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> (defined as <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> developing before 16 years of age ) , later-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , and occupational <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
We observed associations of genomewide significance between <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and the following single-nucleotide polymorphisms : rs3771166 on chromosome 2 , implicating IL1RL1/ IL18 R1 ( P=3Ã—10( âˆ’9) ) ; rs9273349 on chromosome 6 , implicating HLA-DQ ( P=7Ã—10( âˆ’14) ) ; rs1342326 on chromosome 9 , flanking IL33 ( P=9Ã—10( âˆ’10) ) ; rs744910 on chromosome 15 in SMAD3 ( P=4Ã—10( âˆ’9) ) ; and rs2284033 on chromosome 22 in IL2RB ( P=1 .1Ã—10( âˆ’8) ) .
Association with the ORMDL3/GSDMB locus on chromosome 17q21 was specific to childhood-onset disease ( rs2305480 , P=6Ã—10( âˆ’23) ) .
Only HLA-DR showed a significant genomewide association with the total serum IgE concentration , and loci strongly associated with IgE levels were not associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> is genetically heterogeneous .
A few common alleles are associated with disease risk at all ages .
Implicated genes suggest a role for communication of epithelial damage to the adaptive immune system and activation of airway inflammation .
Variants at the ORMDL3/GSDMB locus are associated only with childhood-onset disease .
Elevation of total serum IgE levels has a minor role in the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .

Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , facial and hand abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheoesophageal fistula <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> duodenal atresia <END> , and developmental delay .
We report on six new families ( 12 new patients ) with the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , facial and hand abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheoesophageal fistula <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> duodenal atresia <END> , and developmental delay .
The most common findings were hand abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , short and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nostrils <END> , ear abnormalities , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
Inheritance is <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> .
There is a significant amount of intrafamilial variability especially as it relates to the gastrointestinal findings .
Although the first patients reported , who were very young , did not exhibit any developmental delay , they subsequently did develop learning problems , and 87 % of our 12 patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> or learning difficulties .
Mitochondrial dysfunction in <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Impaired mitochondrial function may influence processes highly dependent on energy , such as neurodevelopment , and contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
No studies have evaluated mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) abnormalities in a well-defined population of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
To evaluate mitochondrial defects in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> .
Observational study using data collected from patients aged 2 to 5 years who were a subset of children participating in the Childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> Autism <END> Risk From Genes and Environment study in California , which is a population-based , case-control investigation with confirmed <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> cases and age-matched , genetically unrelated , typically developing controls , that was launched in 2003 and is still ongoing .
Mitochondrial dysfunction and mtDNA abnormalities were evaluated in lymphocytes from 10 children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and 10 controls .
Oxidative phosphorylation capacity , mtDNA copy number and deletions , mitochondrial rate of hydrogen peroxide production , and plasma lactate and pyruvate .
The reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NADH ) oxidase activity ( normalized to citrate synthase activity ) in lymphocytic mitochondria from children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> was significantly lower compared with controls ( mean , 4.4 [95 % confidence interval { CI} , 2.8-6.0] vs 12 [95 % CI , 8-16 ] , respectively ; P = .001 ) .
The majority of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> ( 6 of 10 ) had complex I activity below control range values .
Higher plasma pyruvate levels were found in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> compared with controls ( 0.23 mM [95 % CI , 0.15- 0.31 mM ] vs 0.08 mM [95 % CI , 0.04- 0.12 mM] , respectively ; P = .02 ) .
Eight of 10 cases had higher pyruvate levels but only 2 cases had higher lactate levels compared with controls .
These results were consistent with the lower pyruvate dehydrogenase activity observed in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> compared with controls ( 1. 0 [95 % CI , 0.6-1.4 ] nmol Ã— [min Ã— mg protein] ( -1 ) vs 2.3 [95 % CI , 1.7- 2.9 ] nmol Ã— [min Ã— mg protein] ( -1 ) , respectively ; P = .01 ) .
Children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> had higher mitochondrial rates of hydrogen peroxide production compared with controls ( 0.34 [95 % CI , 0.26- 0.42 ] nmol Ã— [min Ã— mg of protein] ( -1 ) vs 0.16 [95 % CI , 0.12-0.20] nmol Ã— [min Ã— mg protein] ( -1 ) by complex III; P = .02 ) .
Mitochondrial DNA overreplication was found in 5 cases ( mean ratio of mtDNA to nuclear DNA : 239 [95 % CI , 217-239 ] vs 179 [95 % CI , 165 - 193 ] in controls ; P = 10( -4) ) .
Deletions at the segment of cytochrome b were observed in 2 cases ( ratio of cytochrome b to ND1 : 0.8 0 [95 % CI , 0.68- 0.92 ] vs 0.99 [95 % CI , 0.93-1.05 ] for controls ; P = .01 ) .
In this exploratory study , children with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> were more likely to have mitochondrial dysfunction , mtDNA overreplication , and mtDNA deletions than typically developing children .
Trilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> : a meta-analysis of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> associated with primary ectopic intracranial <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
To obtain refined knowledge regarding trilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( TRb) , which is a syndrome that consists of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> associated with an intracranial neuroblastic tumor .
Using a systematic literature review , we contacted authors to obtain missing information .
Data from 106 children were used in a meta-analysis including frequency distributions and Kaplan-Meier survival curves .
TRb showed no sex predilection .
Median age at diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> was 5 months ( range , 0 to 29 months ) ; age at diagnosis was younger among 47 children ( 47% ) with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> compared with age at diagnosis among 52 children ( 53% ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( 2 v 6.5 months , P <.0001 ) .
TRb usually affected the second or third generation with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Median time from <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> to TRb was 21 months ( range , 6 months before to 141 months after ) ; time to TRb was longer for 78 ( 77% ) pineal tumors compared with 23 ( 23% ) suprasellar tumors (32 v 6.5 months , P <.0001 ) .
The size ( 27 v 32 mm , P =.57 ) and prognosis ( survival of 9 v 8 months , P = .91 ) of pineal and suprasellar tumors were similar .
TRb was detected earlier ( 1 v 22 months , P =.0007 ) and the child survived longer if neuroimaging was routinely performed ( 16 v 8 months , P =.001 ) , but age at death was similar ( 36 v 37 months , P = .98 ) .
Cumulative 5-year survival ( which was likely to indicate cure ) was 27% ( v 0% ) if screening was undertaken .
All children whose TRb exceeded 15 mm in size died .
The family history , age at diagnosis , and laterality of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> in children with TRb resembled that of ordinary hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
Suprasellar TRb were diagnosed earlier , and may arise earlier , than pineal TRb . Screening by neuroimaging could improve the cure rate if cases of TRb were detected when tumors were 15 mm or smaller in size .
Manifestations in four males with and an obligate carrier of the Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome .
Lenz <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> syndrome is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> recessive condition first described by Lenz in 1955 and comprises of <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , external ear , digital , cardiac , skeletal , and urogenital anomalies .
We present three brothers ( ages 15 years , 9 years , and 18 months ) and a maternal uncle ( age 27 years ) with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed motor development <END> , hypotonia , and moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
They also have abnormally modeled ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , finger and toe <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> , clinodactyly , fetal pads , scoliosis , cardiac , and renal abnormalities .
An obligate carrier had abnormally modeled ears and <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> of the 2nd to 3rd toes bilaterally .
Linkage and haplotype analysis in this family indicates that the gene is located in a 17 .65 -cM region on chromosome region Xq27- Xq28 .
A MELAS-associated ND1 mutation causing leber hereditary optic <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> and spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
To report a novel mutation that is associated with Leber hereditary optic <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> ( LHON ) within the same family affected by spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
Leber hereditary optic <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> is a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disorder characterized by isolated central <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> .
Of patients with LHON , 95 % carry a mutation in 1 of 3 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA-encoded complex I genes .
The complete <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA was screened for mutations in a patient with LHON without 1 of these 3 primary mutations .
The heteroplasmy level and biochemical consequence of the mutation were determined .
A pathogenic 3697G >A/ND1 mutation was detected and seemed associated with an isolated complex I deficiency .
This family has similar clinical characteristics as the previously described families with LHON and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> with an ND6 mutation .
The 3697G >A/ND1 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutation causes the LHON and spastic <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> phenotype in the same family .
This mutation can also cause MELAS syndrome ( which encompasses <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy , encephalopathy , lactic acidosis , and stroke ) , and other genetic factors may contribute to the clinical expression .
Revelation of a new <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutation ( G12147A ) in a MELAS/MERFF phenotype .
A 26-year-old man presented at onset with the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ( MELAS ) and later with a phenotype for MELAS and myoclonic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and ragged red fiber disease ( MELAS/MERRF ) .
To identify the possible defects in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome in blood and muscle samples of the patient .
Case study of a patient clinically exhibiting <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> and then <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with myoclonic features , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Research unit of a university hospital .
Electromyographic , morphologic , and biochemical studies of muscle and molecular analysis of blood and muscle to investigate <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA ( mtDNA ) size and quantity .
Morphologically , we found abnormal <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> proliferation with several cytochrome-c oxidase ( COX)-negative fibers in muscle biopsy specimens ; the analysis of serial sections showed a decreased immunoreactivity for the mtDNA-encoded subunits COXII and , partially , COXI .
Biochemically , we found a partial and isolated COX deficiency .
The complete mtDNA sequence analysis identified 3 sequence changes , 2 of which were reported polymorphisms .
The remaining change , a G12147A transition in the transfer RNA( His ) gene , appeared to be the likely pathogenic mutation .
Our data propose that the G12147A change , the first mutation in the transfer RNA( His ) gene associated with an overlapped MELAS/MERFF phenotype , is the cause of the encephalomyopathy in this patient interfering with the overall <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> protein synthesis .
Hypercalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> , mineral balance , bone histomorphometry , and therapeutic implications of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
A 14-year-old Turkish boy had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> that had been clinically evident since he was 2 years of age .
When he was 5 years of age , he had normal serum calcium and phosphorus levels and <START:PHENOTYPE> increased alkaline phosphatase <END> activity .
Treatment with modest dosages of vitamin D (5000 U/d for 3 weeks ) resulted in hypercalcemia .
At 10 years of age , high-dose vitamin D (40,000 U/d ) plus phosphorus ( 1 .1 g/d ) therapy for 20 days resulted in symptomatic nephrolithiasis .
When , 14 years of age , he had normocalcemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> increased alkaline phosphatase <END> activity , and normal circulating parathyroid hormone concentration .
Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were normal but those of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D were markedly increased .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Rickets <END> and osteopenia were evident on radiographs , and osteomalacia was present on trabecular bone obtained at biopsy .
Balance study results showed increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> , and increased urinary phosphorus excretion .
This patient manifests an unusual form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> in which <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> is a cardinal feature .
In contrast with most varieties of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , this disorder is characterized by appropriately increased production of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D in response to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> .
It is recommended that urinary calcium excretion be assessed in all patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> so that appropriate therapy will be instituted .
3-Methylglutaconic aciduria in the Iraqi-Jewish 'optic atrophy plus ' ( Costeff ) syndrome .
Eleven new patients of Iraqi-Jewish origin with bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , neurological abnormalities ( ' <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> plus ' syndrome ) and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria ( type III) are described .
Clinical abnormalities in decreasing order of frequency were bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal signs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and cognitive deficit .
An association with age was found only for <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> extrapyramidal signs <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> frequently led to major disability , in contrast to <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and cognitive deficit .
The combined excretion of 3-methylglutaconic and 3-methylglutaric acid ranged between 9 and 187 mmol/mol creatinine .
The primary enzymatic defect possibly may reside in the mitochondrial respiratory chain .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Proteinuria <END> in a patient with the diaphragmatic hernia-hypertelorism-myopia-deafness syndrome : further evidence that the facio-oculo-acoustico-renal syndrome represents the same entity .
We present a male infant with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> severe myopia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> .
This patient combines features of two distinct genetic conditions , the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> , exomphalos , absent corpus callosum , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> ( MIM 222448 ) , and the facio-oculo-acoustico-renal syndrome ( MIM 227290) , which is characterised by similar anomalies , with the additional finding of <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , but without <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> .
The present observations further suggest that these syndromes are the variable expression of a single <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder .
The cardinal manifestations of Bardet-Biedl syndrome , a form of Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome .
To determine the interfamilial and intrafamilial variation in the expression of the Bardet-Biedl syndrome ( a form of Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome ) , we looked for the five recognized features of the disorder ( <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , polydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and hypogonadism) , plus possible renal manifestations , in some or all of 32 patients with this disorder .
All 28 patients examined had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> , but only 2 had typical <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
Polydactyly was present in 18 of 31 patients , but <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> , brachydactyly , or both were present in all .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> was present in all but 1 of 25 patients .
Only 13 of 32 patients were considered mentally retarded .
Scores on verbal subtests of intelligence were usually lower than scores on performance tasks .
Seven of eight men had <START:PHENOTYPE> small testes <END> and genitalia , which was not due to hypogonadotropism .
All 12 women studied had menstrual irregularities , and 3 had low serum estrogen levels ( 1 of these had hypogonadotropism , and 2 had primary gonadal failure ) .
The remaining women who were of reproductive age had endocrinologic evidence of reproductive dysfunction .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Diabetes mellitus <END> was present in 9 of 20 patients .
Renal structural or functional abnormalities were universal ( n = 21) , and three patients had end-stage renal failure .
We conclude that the characteristic features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome are severe <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> , dysmorphic extremities , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , renal abnormalities , and ( in male patients only ) hypogenitalism .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> , polydactyly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> in female patients are not necessarily present .
A multipedigree linkage study of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> : linkage to Xq13-q21 and evidence for genetic heterogeneity .
A locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> has previously been allocated to the Xq13-q21 region based on linkage studies in two separate pedigrees .
This has been substantiated by the observation of <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> as a clinical feature of male patients with cytogenetically detectable deletions across this region .
The question of a second locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> in this chromosomal region has been raised by the audiologically distinct nature of the <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> in some of the deleted patients compared to that observed in those patients upon whom the linkage data are based .
We have performed detailed clinical evaluation and linkage studies on seven pedigrees with nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and conclude that there is evidence for at least two loci for this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , including one in the Xq13-q21 region .
We have observed different radiological features among the pedigrees which map to Xq13-q21 , suggesting that even among these pedigrees the <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is due to different pathological processes .
Given these findings , we suggest that the classification of nonsyndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> based solely on audiological criteria may need to be reviewed .
Familial segregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical ribs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel anomaly <END> , preaxial polydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> anal atresia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> urethral obstruction <END> : a new syndrome ?
In a consanguineous Jewish family originating from Bombay , India , the propositus presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> anal atresia <END> , micropenis , <START:PHENOTYPE> urethral obstruction <END> with secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> prune belly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , patent urachus , and cryptorchidism .
The kidneys were dysplastic and he had the Potter phenotype with limb deformities .
Additional findings included IUGR with microcephaly , congenital heart defects , spinal anomalies , and hypoplastic lungs .
The mother and all three sisters had <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical ribs <END> , and she and one sister had 11 pairs of thoracic ribs .
The other two sisters had chronic immune thrombopenia .
One of those had bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel deformity <END> with homovertebral bones , <START:PHENOTYPE> club feet <END> , and microcephaly and the other sister also had unilateral preaxial hexadactyly .
Although familial segregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical ribs <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel deformity <END> has been reported , the association of the findings in this family is unique and may represent a new syndrome .
X-linked dominant transmission may explain the severe manifestations in the affected male , but other modes of inheritance may also appl y .
New X-linked mental retardation ( XLMR ) syndrome with distinct facial appearance and growth retardation .
We report on 2 brothers and their nephew with an apparently new X-linked mental retardation ( XLMR ) syndrome characterized by a distinct facial appearance , growth retardation , and <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> .
The facial traits included triangular shape ; bifrontal narrowness ; malar flatness ; <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> ; very deeply set eyes ; <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus inversus <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> bulbous nose <END> ; low hairline ; low-set , deeply cupped , and <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding ears <END> ; short ill-defined philtrum ; and thin tented upper lip .
These facial anomalies are particularly striking and recognizable even at birth .
The boys were <START:PHENOTYPE> small for gestational age <END> and remained below -2 SD in growth parameters .
With age , large <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> developed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pectus excavatum <END> was apparent at birth but became more obvious with age .
Global developmental delay was evident in infancy .
The brothers were nonverbal while their nephew spoke simple words .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> esotropia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic diplegia <END> were evident .
They were self-abusive , hyperactive , and poorly coordinated .
CT scans demonstrated atrophic hydrocephalus .
No EEG abnormalities were detected .
Karyotypes were 46 , XY and fragile X negative .
Routine chemistries ; amino , organic , and uronic acids ; oligosaccharides ; lysosomal enzymes ; and very long chain fatty acids were normal .
Remarkable phenotypic similarity between these brothers and their nephew and lack of manifestations in their mothers makes <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive inheritance <END> likely .
This syndrome , which does not appear to have been reported previously , adds to the delineation of XLMR .
Clinicopathologic review of twelve children with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> , and genital abnormalities ( Drash syndrome ) .
The clinicopathologic and radiologic features of 12 children with complete and incomplete forms of Drash syndrome are reported .
Their common denominator was a nephropathy.
Four had the full triad , consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> , and genital abnormalities ; five had <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> and genital abnormalities , and three had <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> .
Of the 11 children who had <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , eight had the <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Of the 10 whose condition progressed to <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal failure <END> , seven were less than 3 years of age .
The histologic features of <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> were favorable in all seven children , and the tumor was bilateral in three .
Of the nine patients who had genital abnormalities , eight had 46 , XY karyotype and either ambiguous genitalia (six patients ) or normal female phenotype ( two ) .
One other patient had a normal 46 , XX female karyotype and phenotype but had both mÃ¼llerian and wolffian structures and a streak ovary .
Nine patients had a distinct pelvicaliceal abnormality not previously reported as a feature of this syndrome . Other congenital abnormalities were aniridia , mental retardation , deafness , nystagmus , and cleft palate .
This syndrome must be considered in any infant with unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , particularly in young phenotypic female infants and in those children with ambiguous genitalia or <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> with an early presentation .
Acute unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> as the first symptom of cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.
Although cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> ( CADASIL ) is considered a cerebrovascular disorder with almost exclusively neurological symptoms , the arteriopathy is generalized and involves choroidal and retinal vasculature as demonstrated by fluorescein angiographic and ocular electrophysiological abnormalities .
The occurrence of acute <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy <END> ( NAION ) has not previously been reported in CADASIL .
To describe acute <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> due to NAION as a possible manifestation of CADASIL .
The patient was a 60-year-old man with subcortical diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> , multi-infarct dementia , tetraparesis , <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> , and a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
We performed clinical and neuro-ophthalmological evaluation , electrophysiological assessment , brain magnetic resonance imaging , and genetic screening for mutations or small deletions of the Notch3 gene , ( causing CADASIL ) .
The patient 's first symptom was acute <START:PHENOTYPE> visual loss <END> in the right eye due to NAION at age 27 years , in absence of the common cardiovascular risk factors and before any neurological impairment .
The patient was reevaluated at age 60 years , and neuro-ophthalmological examination showed optic disc atrophy in the right eye with arteriolar narrowing and a reduction in visual acuity in the left eye .
Fluorescein angiography of the right eye showed evidence of persistent peripapillary hypofluorescence with a retinal pigment epithelial windows defect in the inferior temporal area .
Pattern reversal visual evoked potentials were abolished in the right eye .
The P100 latency of the left eye was delayed and reduced in amplitude .
The diagnosis of CADASIL was confirmed by molecular analysis ( heterozygotes for the C406T mutation on exon 3 of the Notch3 gene ) .
There was a family history of cerebrovascular disorders and ocular impairment .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Visual loss <END> due to transient or stable ischemic events involving the optic nerve head should be considered in the CADASIL phenotype .
The possibility of CADASIL should also be evaluated in patients with NAION who do not have cardiovascular risk factors but do have a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> .
Macrosomia , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and ocular abnormalities ( MOMO syndrome ) in two unrelated patients : delineation of a newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> syndrome .
We describe 2 unrelated patients , a boy and a girl , with an <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> syndrome and the following common characteristics : <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocrania <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , ocular abnormalities ( <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal coloboma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> ) , downward slant of palpebral fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone maturation <END> .
Both cases are of sporadic occurrence with no consanguinity between the parents .
We suggest that this syndrome is due to a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> mutation and propose to designate it with the acronym of " MOMO syndrome " ( Macrosomia , <START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Macrocrania <END> , Ocular anomalities .
Germline E-cadherin gene ( CDH1 ) mutations predispose to familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> and colorectal <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Inherited mutations in the E-cadherin gene ( CDH1 ) were described recently in three Maori kindreds with familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> susceptibility in non-Maori populations is due to germline CDH1 mutations .
Therefore , we screened eight familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> kindreds of British and Irish origin for germline CDH1 mutations , by SSCP analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences .
Each family contained : (i ) two cases of gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years ; or ( ii ) three or more cases of gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Novel germline CDH1 mutations ( a nonsense and a splice site ) were detected in two families ( 25% ) .
Both mutations were predicted to truncate the E-cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain .
In one family there was evidence of non-penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> ; thus , in addition to six cases of gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> , a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> at age 30 years .
We have confirmed that germline mutations in the CDH1 gene cause familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> in non-Maori populations .
However , only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by CDH1 mutations .
Loss of E-cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers , and our findings provide evidence that germline CDH1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Thus , CDH1 should be investigated as a cause of inherited susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancers .
Hereditary optic neuropathies share a common <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> coupling defect .
Hereditary optic neuropathies are <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> diseases characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> optic nerve atrophy <END> and impairment of central vision .
We found a common coupling defect of oxidative phosphorylation in fibroblasts of patients affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( mutations of OPA1 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> ( mutations of OPA3 ) , and Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> , a disorder associated with point mutations of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA complex I genes .
Interestingly , the energetic defect was significantly more pronounced in Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> patients with a more complex phenotype , the so-called plus phenotype .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinopathy <END> in a brother-sister pair : evidence for germ line mosaicism and further delineation of the ocular phenotype .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinopathy <END> ( OMIM 156590 ) is an autosomal dominant syndrome , characterized primarily by chorioretinal lesions and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
The phenotype is variable , and has been described in association with retinal dysplasia that can be stable or show progressive degeneration , retinal folds , lymphedema , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We describe two siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and variable retinal and choroidal abnormalities .
Patient 1 has multiple atrophic and dysplastic-appearing lesions of the retina and choroid in each eye .
An ERG at 5 months of age disclosed markedly subnormal scotopic and photopic responses with delayed flicker timing .
Patient 2 has bilateral macular folds with vitreoretinopathy , serous retinal detachments , glaucoma , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> OU . Both have <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with hypotonia and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Chorioretinopathy <END> and retinal folds have been described independently in <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with chorioretinopathy.
The present sibs are the first in whom these features are observed while the parents are normal .
Our findings support an expansion of the ocular phenotype and suggest the existence of germ line mosaicism .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital heart disease <END> in maternal phenylketonuria : report from the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study .
The frequency and types of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> in offspring from pregnancies in women with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphenylalaninemia <END> were examined in the international prospective Maternal Phenylketonuria Collaborative Study . Relationships of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> in offspring to the basal blood phenylalanine level in the mother , metabolic control through diet during pregnancy , and phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations in mother and offspring were determined .
The 416 offspring from 412 maternal phenylketonuria pregnancies that produced live births and 100 offspring from the 99 control pregnancies were included in this examination .
Thirty-four of the 235 offspring ( 14 % ; 95 % CI , 10.2 to 19.6% ) from pregnancies in phenylketonuric women with a basal phenylalanine level > or = 900 microM ( 15 mg/dL ) [normal blood phenylalanine < 120 microM ( 2 mg/dL) ] and not in metabolic control [phenylalanine level < or = 600 microM (1 0 mg/dL) ] by the eighth gestational week had <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> compared with one control offspring ( 1% ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> .
One offspring among the 50 ( 2% ) from mothers with non-phenylketonuria mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphenylalaninemia <END> also had <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> .
Coarctation of the aorta and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were overrepresented compared with expected percentages among those with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> in the general population .
A basal maternal phenylalanine level > 1800 microM (30 mg/dL ) significantly increased the risk for bearing a child with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> ( p = 0.003 ) .
Phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations in the mothers and offspring did not have an independent relationship to <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> but were related through the basal maternal phenylalanine levels .
The data in this study indicate that a basal maternal phenylalanine level of 900 microM may be a threshold for <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> , that women with the most severe degree of phenylketonuria are at highest risk for bearing such a child , and that prevention of the <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> requires initiation of the low phenylalanine diet before conception or early in pregnancy with metabolic control no later than the eighth gestational week .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Megalencephaly <END> and perisylvian <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> postaxial polydactyly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> : a rare brain malformation syndrome associated with mental retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Megalencephaly <END> ( MEG ) or enlarged brain occurs as a mild familial variant with normal brain structure , but otherwise is an uncommon human brain malformation that may be associated with significant developmental and neurological problems .
It has been classified into anatomic and metabolic subtypes .
The clinical findings associated with anatomic <START:PHENOTYPE> megalencephaly <END> have been variable and few distinct subtypes have been described .
We report five unrelated children with severe congenital MEG associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> ( PMG) , <START:PHENOTYPE> postaxial polydactyly <END> ( POLY ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( HYD ) .
The clinical records and brain MRI of five patients have been reviewed .
All patients had striking MEG that was symmetric in three of the five patients , and mildly asymmetric in two .
The birth OFC was between +2 and +4 SD .
The gyral pattern was irregular with microgyri typical of PMG , which was most severe in the perisylvian region in all five patients .
Four of the five had <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> treated with a shunt .
Subsequently , one of the shunted patients had small ventricles while the others had mildly to moderately enlarged lateral ventricles .
Three of the five patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> postaxial polydactyly <END> of all four limbs .
The corpus callosum was dysmorphic in one patient with a fused rostrum and genu , and intact although mildly thin in the others .
None were abnormally thick .
All patients had severe mental retardation ; three had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and another had an epileptiform EEG .
We believe this constellation of findings ( MEG-PMG-POLY-HYD ) comprises a new and distinct malformation syndrome that we designate the MPPH syndrome .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> disease associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA heteroplasmy .
A variable combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proximal neurogenic muscle weakness <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensory neuropathy <END> occurred in four members of a family and was maternally transmitted .
There was no histochemical evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy.
Blood and muscle from the patients contained two populations of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA , one of which had a previously unreported restriction site for AvaI .
Sequence analysis showed that this was due to a point mutation at nucleotide 8993 , resulting in an amino acid change from a highly conserved leucine to arginine in subunit 6 of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> H(+ )-ATPase .
There was some correlation between clinical severity and the amount of mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA in the patients ; this was present in only small quantities in the blood of healthy elderly relatives in the same maternal line .
Outcome and family study of the subtypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> in the west of Ireland .
The authors sought to clarify differences in outcome and familial psychopathology among the classical subtypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
In the epidemiologically based Roscommon Family Study , personal interviews were conducted with 88 % of traceable living probands ( N = 415 ) an average of 16 years after illness onset and with 86 % of traceable living first-degree relatives ( N = 1 ,753 ) .
Probands meeting the DSM-III-R criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> were subtyped by DSM-III-R and ICD-9 .
By both diagnostic systems , age at onset differed significantly across subtypes , being earliest in the subjects with the hebephrenic and catatonic subtypes and latest in the paranoid subjects .
The probands with the paranoid subtype had substantially better outcome , especially in occupational functioning and capacity for self-care .
The DSM-III-R criteria for paranoid <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> were considerably more successful than the ICD-9 criteria in selecting good-outcome cases .
Neither the risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> nor the risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> spectrum disorders significantly differed in relatives as a function of the proband subtype .
The subtypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> did not " breed true " within families .
Paranoid <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , especially when narrowly defined , as in DSM-III-R , has a substantially better outcome than other subtypes .
From a familial perspective , 1 ) paranoid <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> is not a milder form of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and 2 ) catatonic <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> is probably closely related to typical <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
The subtypes of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> are not , from a familial perspective , etiologically distinct syndromes .
Fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> : the first account in a family of Chinese descent .
Fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> ( FFI ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disease linked to a mutation in the prion protein gene .
Fatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> is characterized by sleep disturbance and loss of neurons , with gliosis in the thalamic nuclei .
To describe the clinical , neurophysiological , radiological , and neuropathological data in a Chinese family with FFI .
Tertiary referral university hospital setting .
Patient 1 was a 36-year-old man who presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> .
In the subsequent 9 months , he developed <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , followed by death .
Patient 2 was the aunt of patient 1 , and presented at the age of 47 years with <START:PHENOTYPE> insomnia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ; her condition declined during a 12-month period .
Genetic analysis was performed , followed by neuropathological and biochemical analysis of the disease-associated form of the prion protein PrPSc on the postmortem brain specimen .
Molecular analysis demonstrated an aspartic acid to asparagine mutation at codon 178 and homozygosity for methionine at codon 129.
Both patients showed severe <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> and prominent gliosis in the thalamus and brainstem involvement , with evidence of astrogliosis in the inferior olivary nucleus .
Patient 1 also had <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> and astrogliosis in the region of the superior colliculus and in the periaqueductal region .
PrPSc was detected on Western blot analysis , and had a wide distribution .
The strongest signals were present in the amygdala , hypothalamus , caudate , parahippocampal gyrus , periaqueductal gray matter , and mediodorsal thalamus .
To our knowledge , this is the first report of FFI in a family of Chinese descent .
This supports the worldwide distribution of FFI , and despite differences in genetic background , the clinical and pathological findings are similar to those found in white patients with FFI .
Three distinct types of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> seen in 6 families .
Six families with <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> ( congenital contractures ) inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> manner are reported .
Family histories from a study of over 350 patients with congenital contractures of the joints ( <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> ) were reviewed and of these , three probands had family histories consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive inheritance <END> .
Three other families were recognized through correspondence .
Three forms of X-linked recessively inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> are described : (1 ) Severe lethal X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> with severe contractures <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> deformities , hypotonia , and death due to respiratory insufficiency within 3 months of birth ( 1 family ) ; (2 ) Moderately severe X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> with severe contractures , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphallus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , inguinal hernias , and normal intelligence ( 2 families ) ; and (3 ) Resolving X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> arthrogryposis <END> with mild to moderate contractures at birth which improve dramatically with time ( 2 families and 1 sporadic case ) .
Clinical and Molecular genetics of Stickler syndrome .
Stickler syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder with characteristic ophthalmological and orofacial features , deafness , and arthritis .
Abnormalities of vitreous gel architecture are a pathognomonic feature , usually associated with high <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> which is congenital and non-progressive .
There is a substantial risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> .
Less common ophthalmological features include paravascular pigmented lattice degeneration and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
Non-ocular features show great variation in expression .
Children with Stickler syndrome typically have a <START:PHENOTYPE> flat midface <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , short nose , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
These features can become less pronounced with age .
Midline clefting , if present , ranges in severity from a cleft of the soft palate to <START:PHENOTYPE> Pierre-Robin sequence <END> .
There is joint hypermobility which declines with age .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Osteoarthritis <END> develops typically in the third or fourth decade .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia <END> is often apparent radiologically .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Sensorineural deafness <END> with high tone loss may be asymptomatic or mild .
Occasional findings include slender extremities and long fingers .
Stature and intellect are usually normal .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitral valve prolapse <END> was reported to be a common finding in one series but not in our experience .
The majority of families with Stickler syndrome have mutations in the COL2A1 gene and show the characteristic type 1 vitreous phenotype .
The remainder with the type 2 vitreous phenotype have mutations in COL11A1 or other loci yet to be identified .
Mutations in COL111A2 can give rise to a syndrome with the systemic features of Stickler syndrome but no ophthalmological abnormality .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> phenotype in 22q11 deletion syndrome .
This study investigated the <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> phenotype in 24 subjects with 22q11 deletion syndrome ( 22qDS ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> ( 22qDS-schizophrenia) , a rare but relatively homogenous genetic subtype of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> associated with a microdeletion on chromosome 22 . Individuals with 22qDS are at genetically high risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Standard measures of signs , symptoms , and course of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> were assessed in 16 adults with 22qDS-schizophrenia who did not meet criteria for mental retardation and in 46 adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> without evidence of 22qDS from a community familial sample .
There were no significant differences in age at onset , lifetime or cross-sectional core positive and negative schizophrenic symptoms , or global functioning between the two groups of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Patients with 22qDS-schizophrenia had higher excitement subscale scores and less lifetime substance use than the comparison patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> , but no significant differences in anxiety-depression symptom severity were found between the groups .
These findings indicate that the core clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> phenotype would not distinguish individuals with a 22qDS subtype from those with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> who did not have the 22qDS subtype .
The results provide further support for the utility of 22qDS-schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental model of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> as well as support for prospective studies of individuals with 22qDS to help identify precursors of <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> .
Sister and brother with Vici syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> , and recurrent infections .
A sister and brother with Vici syndrome are described .
They both had oculocutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , and cardiomyopathy.
They were born to healthy unrelated parents , and had postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , profound developmental delay , hypotonia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> .
The sister had recurrent infections , and died of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> at age 19 months .
The brother is alive at age six months with mild cardiomyopathy , and had a single episode of acute bronchitis at age three months .
Review of the clinical manifestations of the sibs we described and six children reported in the literature indicates that Vici syndrome is a distinct clinical entity .
Its main clinical manifestations include <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , profound developmental delay , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , cardiomyopathy , and recurrent infections .

The syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> presenting without stroke .
To study and describe a large family with the tRNA Leu( UUR ) point mutation at position 3243 in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA , which is associated with the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> .
Survey ; case series .
University hospital inpatient and outpatient neurology department .
Twelve patients from three generations in a family carrying the tRNA Leu( UUR ) point mutation at position 3243 were studied .
Clinical evaluation , muscle biopsy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA point mutation quantitation of the syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> in muscle and blood .
Correlation between clinical , pathologic , and genotypic features .
Family members had various combinations of sensorineural hearing loss , retinal pigmentary degeneration , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , hypothalamic hypogonadism , and mild myopathy.
Only one member had a strokelike episode at the age of 46 years .
This patient had the highest point mutation percentage .
This report suggests that this point mutation may not be associated with stroke in all families and that whether patients develop stroke may depend on the percentage of mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA and its tissue distribution .
Prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> in Chamorros on Guam : relationship to age , gender , education , and APOE . To estimate the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and its clinical subtypes among Chamorros on Guam aged 65 years or older and to examine associations with age , gender , education , and APOE genotype .
Chamorros , the indigenous people of Guam , had a high incidence of ALS and parkinsonism-dementia complex ( PDC) , in the 195 0s .
Over the next 50 years , ALS incidence declined markedly , but PDC only slightly .
The prevalence of late life <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> in Chamorros and its relationship to AL S/PDC are unknown .
Island-wide population-based survey of Chamorros aged 65 years or older as of January 1 , 2003 .
Two-stage assessment : cognitive and motor screening , followed by neurologic and psychometric evaluation .
Data were reviewed at consensus conference to make clinical diagnoses .
Of 2 ,78 9 Chamorros aged 65 years or older , 73 % were enrolled ; 27% declined participation , died before contact or screening , or moved off Guam .
The point prevalence of all-cause <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> on February 1 , 2004 , was 12 .2% .
Prevalence data for subtypes were as follows : Guam <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ( clinically equivalent to AD ) , 8.8% ; PDC , 1.5 % ; pure vascular <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , 1.3% ; other , 0.6% .
The prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> rose exponentially with age .
Low education was significantly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , but gender was not .
There was a trend toward higher PDC prevalence among men .
The APOE epsilon4 allele was not associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
The prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> among elderly Chamorros is relatively high .
Guam <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> is the most common diagnosis and exceeds parkinsonism-dementia complex .
Age and low education are strongly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> , but gender and APOE epsilon4 are not .
Incidence studies will allow risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> to be clarified .
Muscle 3243A-->G mutation load and capacity of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> energy-generating system .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> energy-generating system ( MEGS ) encompasses the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> enzymatic reactions from oxidation of pyruvate to the export of adenosine triphosphate .
It is investigated in intact muscle mitochondria by measuring the pyruvate oxidation and adenosine triphosphate production rates , which we refer to as the " MEGS capacity. "
Currently , little is known about MEGS pathology in patients with mutations in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA . Because MEGS capacity is an indicator for the overall <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> function related to energy production , we searched for a correlation between MEGS capacity and 3243A-->G mutation load in muscle of patients with the MELAS ( <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ) syndrome .
In muscle tissue of 24 patients with the 3243A-->G mutation , we investigated the MEGS capacity , the respiratory chain enzymatic activities , and the 3243A-->G mutation load . To exclude coinciding mutations , we sequenced all 22 <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> transfer RNA genes in the patients , if possible .
We found highly significant differences between patients and control subjects with respect to the MEGS capacity and complex I , III , and IV activities .
MEGS-related measurements correlated considerably better with the mutation load than respiratory chain enzyme activities .
We found no additional mutations in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> transfer RNA genes of the patients .
The results show that MEGS capacity has a greater sensitivity than respiratory chain enzymatic activities for detection of subtle <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial dysfunction <END> .
This is important in the workup of patients with rare or new <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA mutations , and with low mutation loads .
In these cases we suggest to determine the MEGS capacity .
Epstein-Barr virus-induced diseases in boys with the X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome ( XLP ) : update on studies of the registry .
Analyses of 100 subjects with the X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome ( XLP ) in 25 kindreds revealed four major interrelated phenotypes : infectious mononucleosis , malignant B-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> , aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> , and hypogammaglobulinemia .
Eighty-one of the patients died .
Two male subjects were asymptomatic but showed <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> to Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .
Seventy-five subjects had the infectious mononucleosis phenotype and concurrently , 17 subjects of this group had aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> .
All subjects with aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> died within a week .
Aplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> did not accompany hypogammaglobulinemia or malignant <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> phenotypes .
Hypogammaglobulinemia had been detected before infectious mononucleosis in three subjects , after infectious mononucleosis in five subjects , and was not associated with infectious mononucleosis in 11 boys with hypogammaglobulinemia .
In nine subjects infectious mononucleosis appeared to have evolved into malignant <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> ; however , the majority of patients with malignant <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> showed no obvious antecedent infectious mononucleosis .
One subject had infectious mononucleosis following recurrent malignant <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> .
Twenty-six of 35 lymphomas were in the terminal ileum .
Results of immunologic and virologic studies of 15 survivors revealed combined variable <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> and deficient antibody responses to EBV-specific antigens .
Mothers of boys with XLP exhibited abnormally elevated titers of antibodies of EBV . Subjects of both sexes with phenotypes of XLP should be investigated for <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> to EBV . Persons with inherited or acquired <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> may be vulnerable to life-threatening EBV-induced diseases .
Use of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> drainage devices in the management of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
To describe intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and visual acuity outcomes after <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> drainage device placement in eyes with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> .
Retrospective , noncomparative , consecutive , interventional case series .
The medical records of all patients who underwent <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> drainage device placement for the management of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between January 1 , 1989 , and December 31 , 1999 , were reviewed .
The study included eight eyes of five patients with a median age at the time of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> drainage device placement of 92 months ( range , 10- 495 months ) and a median follow-up of 19 months ( range , 11 - 33 months ) .
Preoperatively , the mean IOP was 35 mm Hg using a mean of one antiglaucoma medication .
Postoperatively , the mean IOP was reduced to 14 .9 mm Hg and no patient was using antiglaucoma medication .
Final visual acuity was improved compared with preoperatively in five of eight eyes ( 63% ) and remained unchanged in two eyes ( 25% ) .
Loss of light perception occurred in one eye owing to retinal detachment .
Success rates using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were 100% at 6 months and 88 % at 1 year . <START:PHENOTYPE> Glaucoma <END> drainage device placement for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> achieves IOP control and vision preservation in most patients .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> acro-fronto-facio-nasal dysostosis associated with genitourinary anomalies : a third case report .
We report on a 22-day-old Tunisian boy born to consanguineous ( first-cousin ) parents ( F = 1/16 ) .
The patient presents <START:PHENOTYPE> wide forehead <END> with frontal <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> wide anterior fontanel <END> , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , coloboma of the upper lids , <START:PHENOTYPE> proptosis <END> , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> between fingers 3 and 4 , hypoplastic 3rd , 4th and 5th toes with nail dysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> with cleft glans , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid scrotum <END> .
Brain MRI showed right frontal <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalocele <END> with anomalies of the cortical gyration without any corpus callosum abnormality .
Normal chromosomes and parents ' consanguinity are suggestive of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Facial midline anomalies associated with limb and genitourinary anomalies is very uncommon .
We present the third case reported in the literature .

Guadalajara <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> type III: a new probably <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome .
A Mexican family is presented with the main clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , a distinctive facial appearance because of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , symblepharon and spinal defects . Other clinical manifestations included : multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> nevi <END> , simplified ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> retrognathia <END> , congenital shortness of the sternocleidomastoid muscle , thin hands and feet , a <START:PHENOTYPE> small penis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mild mental retardation <END> .
Radiographic studies revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida occulta <END> at cervical and dorso-lumbar levels , increased bone trabeculae , cortical thickening and <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> .
The presence of five affected members through four generations suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> although no male-to-male transmission was documented .
The authors propose this as a new entity , and have designated it Guadalajara <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> type III.
Myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sideroblastic anemia <END> : a new syndrome .
We describe 2 sibs ( brother and sister ) with myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> sideroblastic anemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high palate <END> , high philtrum , <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
Very low levels of cytochromes a , b , and c were detected in the patients ' muscle mitochondria .
Deposition of iron within the mitochondria of bone marrow erythroblasts was observed on electron microscopy .
Irregular and enlarged mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions were also seen on electron microscopy of the patients ' muscle specimen .
Examination of DNA from the affected sibs showed no deletions in the mitochondrial DNA nor the mutations identified in the syndromes of mitochondrial myopathy , encephalopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and strokelike episodes ( MELAS ) or myoclonus , and epilepsy associated with rugged-red fibers ( MERRF ) .
Since the parents were first cousins and 2 of 6 sibs ( male and female ) were affected , we suggest that the syndrome expressed by our patients represents a previously unknown <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder that includes mitochondrial myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sideroblastic anemia <END> .
Coeliac disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and cerebral calcifications .
The Italian Working Group on Coeliac Disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> .
There have been anecdotal reports of an association between coeliac disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with cerebral calcifications that resemble those of the Sturge-Weber syndrome .
A series of patients who had <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> with calcifications , in whom coeliac disease ( CD ) was incidentally observed , prompted us to study this association . 43 patients ( 15 male , age range 4.6-30.7 years ) were selected from two series . 31 patients with cerebral calcifications of unexplained origin and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ( series A ) underwent intestinal biopsy . 12 patients with CD and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ( series B ) underwent computed tomography.
Antibodies to gluten , folic acid serum concentrations , were measured , and HLA typing was done in most patients .
24 of the series A patients were identified as having CD on the basis of a flat intestinal mucosa ( 15 /22 with a high concentration of serum antigluten ) , and 5 series B patients showed cerebral calcifications , giving a total of 29 cases with the combination of CD , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and cerebral calcifications ( CEC ) .
In 27 of these CEC patients , calcifications were located in the parieto-occipital regions .
Only 2 of the series A patients had gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of intestinal biopsy ; most patients had recurrent diarrhoea , <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> , and other symptoms suggestive of CD in the first 3 years of life .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in CEC patients was poorly responsive to antiepileptic drugs .
Gluten-free diet beneficially affected the course of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> only when started soon after <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> onset .
Cases of "atypical Sturge-Weber syndrome " ( characterised by serpiginous cerebral calcifications and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> without facial port-wine naevus ) should be reviewed , and CD should be ruled out in all cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and cerebral calcifications of unexplained origin .
Delineation of a <START:PHENOTYPE> contiguous gene syndrome <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple exostoses <END> , enlarged <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> craniofacial dysostosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , caused by deletions in the short arm of chromosome 11 . A <START:PHENOTYPE> contiguous gene syndrome <END> due to deletions of the proximal short arm of chromosome 11 is described in eight patients belonging to four families .
The main clinical features are <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple exostoses <END> , enlarged <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> craniofacial dysostosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The patients have cytogenetic and/or molecular deletions of chromosome 11p11 -p13 .
These deletions are located between the centromere and D11S914 in a region of approximately 20cM .
The present study confirms the presence of a <START:PHENOTYPE> multiple exostoses <END> gene on chromosome 11p .
Furthermore , it suggests that the gene for isolated foramina parietalie permagna and genes associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> craniofacial dysostosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> reside in the same chromosomal region .
Mutations in the human ortholog of Aristaless cause X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> often occur together .
They are both heterogeneous conditions with acquired and genetic causes .
Where causes are primarily genetic , major advances have been made in unraveling their molecular basis .
The human X chromosome alone is estimated to harbor more than 100 genes that , when mutated , cause <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
At least eight autosomal genes involved in idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> have been identified , and many more have been implicated in conditions where <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> is a feature .
We have identified mutations in an X chromosome-linked , Aristaless-related , homeobox gene ( ARX) , in nine families with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( syndromic and nonspecific) , various forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , including infantile spasms and <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonic seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
Two recurrent mutations , present in seven families , result in expansion of polyalanine tracts of the ARX protein .
These probably cause protein aggregation , similar to other polyalanine and polyglutamine disorders .
In addition , we have identified a missense mutation within the ARX homeodomain and a truncation mutation .
Thus , it would seem that mutation of ARX is a major contributor to X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> syndrome of branchial arch and other defects .
We report on two brothers and their maternal first cousin who have branchial arch defects and other anomalies .
Similar physical findings in all three include <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , highly arched palate , apparently lowset , <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding ears <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , slightly <START:PHENOTYPE> webbed neck <END> , and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
In addition , two boys had <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and one had subvalvar <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonic stenosis <END> and body asymmetry .
We suggest that these cousins have an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> syndrome of which branchial arch defects are a component .
Other pleiotropic manifestations of the mutant gene include <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> ; body asymmetry and relatively <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> may be components as well .
The natural history and ophthalmic involvement in childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis at the hospital for sick children .
To characterize signs , symptoms , and the natural history of myasthenic syndromes in pediatric patients .
Retrospective noncomparative case series .
Thirty-four patients with a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> were identified from either the hospital 's or treating physician 's database .
Retrospective chart review , clinical examination , and telephone interview .
Information pertaining to the ophthalmologic and neurologic examination , diagnostic interventions , and treatment was noted .
Patients with active disease , attending during the study period , were examined at their outpatient visits .
Those who no longer attended the hospital were contacted by means of a telephone interview to complete their follow-up .
Thirty-four children were found to have <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> .
Two had transient neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> , which resolved quickly .
Seven (2 0.6% ) patients had congenital myasthenic syndromes ( CMS ) and 25 ( 73 .5% , 19 females ) were affected with autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis ( AMG ) .
In those patients with severe CMS , three showed signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized weakness <END> , including failure to thrive , frequent apneas , and aspirations .
In four patients with mild CMS , eye signs were relatively more prominent .
In all patients with CMS , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , ophthalmoplegia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> were the main ophthalmologic signs and remained relatively constant .
Fourteen ( 56% ) patients with AMG had ocular signs and symptoms , and five of them progressed to systemic involvement in 7. 8 months on average ( range , 1-23 ) .
The remaining nine patients with ocular AMG had either <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> and were treated with pyridostigmine ( nine patients ) and prednisone ( two patients ) .
Patients with ocular AMG were seen at 78 months on average , those with systemic AMG at 85 .6 months .
Systemic AMG was seen in 16 patients .
No thymomas were found in 14 patients who underwent thymectomy .
Of the 25 patients with AMG , 8 are still being treated , 8 are in remission for an average of 65 .2 months and are asymptomatic , 4 patients are receiving long-term immunosuppressants ( 1 has likely sustained permanent damage to her extraocular muscles with complete ophthalmoplegia and <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> ) , and 4 have been lost to follow-up .
Finally , one patient died after aspiration because of <START:PHENOTYPE> bulbar weakness <END> .
Patients with CMS varied in the degree of severity .
Apneic attacks , aspiration , and failure to thrive may obscure the diagnosis .
Compared with AMG , their ophthalmologic signs and symptoms were usually permanent .
Visual signs and symptoms were usually prominent in those patients with active AMG , but those in remission were asymptomatic .
More than half of the patients with juvenile AMG had ocular symptoms .
Generalization occurred in a minority in an average of 7. 8 months .
Patients entered remission after approximately 2 years of treatment and were visually asymptomatic .
This study suggests that long-term permanent damage to the extraocular muscles as a result of juvenile AMG is rare .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myasthenia <END> gravis is a life-threatening disease as evidenced by the death of one of our patients .
Many of these patients are first seen by the ophthalmologist who can aid the diagnosis , screen for amblyopia , and monitor the patient 's response to therapy .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> deafness and <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> .
A new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> syndrome in a Swedish pedigree is described .
Five patients were affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
Four of these patients had symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Optic atrophy <END> , other neurological abnormalities and psychiatric symptoms developed with increasing disease duration .
Three patients had non-neurological disease in addition , including diabetes mellitus in two and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in one .
Autopsy with neuropathological examination was performed in one case .
Molecular studies focused on the short arm of chromosome 6 , including the HLA DR2 locus associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> and the ( CAG )n repeat at the spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 1 ( SCA1 ) locus .
Biochemical investigation of muscle biopsy of one case indicated mitochondrial dysfunction with selective decrease in ATP production for substrates that normally give the highest rates .
The activity of glutamate dehydrogenase was reduced , indicating a low mitochondrial density .
We postulate an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> genetic factor responsible for this syndrome .
Linkage was excluded to HLA DR2 , and a normal sized SCA1 repeat was observed .
We conclude that a locus predisposing to <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , deafness and <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> exists outside this region of chromosome 6 .
Cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts .
Extensive cerebral calcifications and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> have been reported in two rare disorders Coats plus and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> with calcifications and cysts .
In the latter , a progressive formation of parenchymal brain cysts is a special feature , whereas Coats plus is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , bilateral retinal telangiectasias and exudations ( Coats disease) , <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysplastic nails <END> without cyst formation .
We identified 13 patients , including two pairs of siblings , with extensive cerebral calcifications and leukoencephalopathy.
We reviewed clinical , ophthalmologic , radiologic and neuropathologic data of seven deceased patients and studied five patients prospectively .
Eleven patients were small for gestational age ; the other symptoms emerged from infancy to adolescence .
All patients had neurologic symptoms including <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive decline <END> .
Progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> intracerebral calcifications <END> involved deep gray nuclei , brainstem , cerebral and cerebellar white matter , and dentate nuclei and were accompanied by diffuse white matter signal changes and , in five patients , cerebral cysts .
Eleven patients had retinal telangiectasias or angiomas .
Additional features were skeletal and hematologic abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal bleeding <END> , and poor growth .
Neuropathologic examination showed extensive calcinosis and abnormal small vessels with thickened , hyalinized wall and reduced lumen .
Our data suggest that Coats plus syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> with calcifications and cysts belong to the same spectrum .
The primary abnormality seems to be an obliterative cerebral angiopathy involving small vessels , leading to dystrophic calcifications via slow necrosis and finally to formation of cysts and secondary white matter abnormalities .
Severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperaldosteronism <END> type I : relationship to gender and degree of biochemical disturbance .
In familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperaldosteronism <END> type I ( FH-I) , inheritance of a hybrid 11beta-hydroxylase/aldosterone synthase gene causes ACTH-regulated aldosterone overproduction .
In an attempt to understand the marked variability in <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> severity in FH-I , we compared clinical and biochemical characteristics of 9 affected individuals with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> ( normotensive or <START:PHENOTYPE> onset <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> after 15 yr , blood pressure never >16 0/10 0 mm Hg , < or = 1 medication required to control <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , no history of stroke , age >18 yr when studied ) with those of 17 subjects with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> onset <END> before 15 yr , or systolic blood pressure >18 0 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >12 0 mm Hg at least once , or > or = 2 medications , or history of stroke ) .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> was more frequent in males ( 11 of 13 males vs . 6 of 13 females ; P < 0.05 ) .
All 4 subjects still normotensive after age 18 yr were females .
Of 10 other affected , deceased individuals ( 7 males and 3 females ) from a single family , all six who died before 60 yr of age ( 4 by stroke ) were males .
Biochemical studies were conducted in 6 mild and 16 severe subjects .
The 2 groups were similar in terms of urinary sodium excretion .
Mild subjects tended , although not significantly , to have lower urinary 18-oxo-cortisol ( mean +/- SD , 27. 4 +/- 9. 0 vs . 35.2 +/- 12 .9 nmol/mmol creatinine x day ) , higher plasma potassium ( 4. 0 +/- 0.3 vs . 3.6 +/- 0.4 mmol/L ) , and lower recumbent ( 0800 h after overnight recumbency ) plasma aldosterone levels ( 498 +/- 279 vs . 744 +/- 290 pmol/L ) .
Upright ( midmorning after 2-3 h of upright posture ) plasma aldosterone levels were similar ( mild , 485 +/- 15 0 ; severe , 474 +/- 188 pmol/L ) .
In 1 normotensive female , upright PRA was much higher , and the upright aldosterone/PRA ratio was much lower than that in the other subjects .
The remaining mild subjects had similar upright PRA levels ( mild , 2.8 +/- 1.4 ; severe , 3.7 +/- 3.2 pmol/ L x min ) and aldosterone/PRA ratios ( mild , 199.5 +/- 133.4 ; severe , 200.6 +/- 15 0 .9 ) as severe subjects .
During angiotensin II ( AII) infusion studies ( n = 6 mild and 10 severe ) , performed during recumbency , aldosterone levels were lower in the mild group both basally (404 +/- 144 vs . 843 +/- 498 pmol/L ; P < 0.05 ) and after 60 min AII ( 2 ng/kg x min ; 261 +/- 130 vs . 520 +/- 330 pmol/L ; P < 0.05 ) .
Aldosterone was unresponsive ( rose by <5 0% ) to AII in all subjects .
Day curve studies ( blood collected every 2 h for 24 h ; n = 2 mild and 7 severe ) demonstrated abnormal regulation of aldosterone by ACTH rather than by AII in both groups .
In conclusion , in this series of patients with FH-I , males had more severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , and the degree of hybrid gene-induced aldosterone overproduction may have contributed to the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Parkinsonism <END> , premature menopause , and mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma mutations : clinical and molecular genetic study .
Mutations in the gene encoding mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma ( POLG) , the enzyme that synthesises mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) , have been associated with a mitochondrial disease-autosomal dominant or recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia-and multiple deletions of mtDNA .
Mitochondrial dysfunction is also suspected to participate in the pathogenesis of Parkinson 's disease . However , no primary gene defects affecting mitochondrial proteins causing mendelian transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> have been characterised .
We aimed to analyse the gene sequence of POLG in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> and their healthy relatives .
In seven families of various ethnic origins we assessed patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> and unaffected individuals by clinical , biochemical , morphological , and molecular genetic characterisation and positron emission tomography ( PET) .
We recorded mutations in POLG in members of all seven families .
Clinical assessment showed significant cosegregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> with POLG mutations ( p< 0.0001 ) , and PET findings were consistent with dopaminergic neuron loss .
Post-mortem examination in two individuals showed loss of pigmented neurons and pigment phagocytosis in substantia nigra without Lewy bodies .
Furthermore , most women with <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> had early menopause-before age 35 years .
The POLG gene defect resulted in secondary accumulation of mtDNA deletions in patients ' tissues .
Dysfunction of mitochondrial POLG causes a severe progressive multisystem disorder including <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and premature menopause , which are not typical of mitochondrial disease .
Cosegregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and POLG mutations in our families suggests that when defective , this gene can underlie mendelian transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
Awareness that mitochondrial POLG mutations can underlie <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> is important for clinicians working in diagnosis of movement disorders , as well as for studies of the genetics of Parkinson 's disease . Further , <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> with muscle weakness and neuropathy can mask symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , and clinicians should pay special attention to detect and treat <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> in those individuals .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and developmental delay associated with a chemotactic defect and transient hypogammaglobulinaemia in two brothers .
Two brothers presented with unusual facial features , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , developmental delay , and severe postnatal growth retardation .
They both developed <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> in infancy and have had <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> .
Additional physical findings in both boys included <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flexion contractures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic patellae <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
Their facial similarity was striking with sloping foreheads , beaked noses , large , <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding ears <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
Low levels of serum gammaglobulins and defective chemotaxis were present in both boys in infancy .
The hypogammaglobulinaemia was transient and improved , reaching normal levels by 3 1/2 years and 15 months , respectively .
Defective chemotaxis and <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> have persisted to the present .
Both parents were normal .
The mode of inheritance was not clear , as both X linked and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> patterns were possible .
Although patients with congenital malformations who also had immunodeficiency have previously been reported , immune system abnormalities , especially those of a transient nature , may frequently go unrecognised .
Clinical and <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> in keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans .
Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans ( KFSD ) is an uncommon genodermatosis mainly characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> follicular hyperkeratosis <END> , progressive cicatricial <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> .
Although an excess of affected males and linkage studies strongly suggest an X-linked pattern of inheritance , an apparently rarer <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> with prominent follicular inflammation has also been postulated .
We report on a three-generation family with five affected individuals and male-to-male transmission .
In addition to widespread keratosis pilaris , cicatricial <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> and eye involvement , our patients show diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> facial erythema <END> , recurrent folliculitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> enamel hypoplasia <END> , and thickened nails .
A literature review of the last 50 years identified 43 additional KFSD cases .
X-linked inheritance is demonstrated in two pedigrees by linkage studies and suspected in five .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern is confirmed in three families , including ours , by male-to-male transmission and considered likely in four .
Marked <START:PHENOTYPE> facial erythema <END> , extensive folliculitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> caries <END> are frequently reported in the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> variant , while palmo-plantar keratoderma and early onset seem more typical of the X-linked form .
Moreover , three sporadic male patients showing additional multisystemic abnormalities might be explained by an X-linked contiguous-gene syndrome .
An adult patient with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalciuria <END> due to a novel homozygous inactivating mutation of calcium-sensing receptor .
Inactivating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor ( CaSR ) cause familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> ( FHH ) and neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> ( NSHPT) .
Earlier investigations showed patients with FHH are heterozygous , and NSHPT are homozygous for inactivating mutations .
However , one adult patient with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalciuria <END> has been reported to have a homozygous inactivating mutation in CaSR ( Pro39Ala ) .
This suggested that mutant CaSR in this patient had some residual activity and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> was not so severe as to be fatal .
However , the function of this mutant CaSR was not evaluated .
In the present study , we describe a novel homozygous mutation in an adult patient with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalciuria <END> , and evaluate the function of the mutant CaSRs .
The DNA sequence of CaSR gene was determined by direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction product .
The function of mutant CaSR was analysed by creating mutant cDNAs by in vitro mutagenesis , transfection of mutant cDNAs into HEK293 cells and measuring intracellular ionized Ca in response to changes in extracellular Ca . A 26-year-old Japanese woman showed marked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> with an elevated parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) level .
Her consanguineous parents had asymptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> with relative <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalciuria <END> .
The proband had a homozygous mutation at codon 27 of CaSR gene ( CAA-->CGA , Gln27Arg ) .
Her parents were heterozygous for this mutation .
EC50 for Ca of this mutant CaSR ( GIn27Arg ) was 4.9 mM . EC50 of another mutant CaSR ( Pro39Ala ) whose homozygous mutation was discovered in an adult patient was 4.4 mM . These EC50s were significantly higher than that of wild-type CaSR ( 3.7 } 0.1 mM) , but were the lowest among the reported EC50s for inactivating mutations of CaSR .
These results indicate that serum Ca and PTH levels are determined by residual function of mutant CaSR in patients with homozygous mutation in CaSR , and that patients having homozygous mutant CaSRs with mild dysfunction do not suffer from fatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcaemia <END> in infancy and can survive into adulthood .
Recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with ocular apraxia : review of 22 Portuguese patients .
The recessive ataxias are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> associated with a number of different neurologic , ophthalmologic , or general signs .
They are often difficult to classify in clinical terms , except for Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , ataxia-telangiectasia , and a relatively small group of rare conditions for which the molecular basis has already been defined .
To study the clinical presentation and to define diagnostic criteria in a group of Portuguese patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and ocular apraxia , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> without the essential clinical and laboratory features of ataxia-telangiectasia .
We reviewed 22 patients in 11 kindreds , identified through a systematic survey of hereditary ataxias being conducted in Portugal .
Age at onset ranged from 1 to 15 years , with a mean of 4.7 years .
The duration of symptoms at the time of last examination varied from 5 to 58 years .
All patients presented with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , the characteristic ocular apraxia , and a peripheral neuropathy.
Associated neurologic signs included <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> .
Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 16 patients , all of whom showed cerebellar atrophy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> with ocular apraxia may be more frequent than postulated before , and may be identified clinically using the following criteria : (1 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> transmission ; (2 ) early onset ( for most patients in early childhood ) ; (3 ) combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , ocular apraxia , and early <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> , with later appearance of the full picture of peripheral neuropathy ; (4 ) absence of mental retardation , telangiectasia , and immunodeficiency ; and (5 ) the possibility of a long survival , although with severe motor handicap.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dementia <END> in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> but is independent of plaques and neurofibrillary tangles .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> is frequently found in demented and nondemented elderly persons , but its contribution to the causation of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> is unknown .
Therefore , we investigated the relation between the amount of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> and the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> in 19 patients with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type .
The advantage of studying hereditary cerebral hemorrhage in amyloidosis-Dutch type is that patients with this disease consistently have severe <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> with minimal neurofibrillary pathology .
The amount of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> , as quantified by computerized morphometry , was strongly associated with the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> independent of neurofibrillary pathology , plaque density , or age .
The number of cortical amyloid beta-laden severely stenotic vessels , vessel-within-vessel configurations , and cerebral amyloid angiopathy-associated microvasculopathies was associated with the amount of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
A semiquantitative score , based on the number of amyloid beta-laden severely stenotic vessels , completely separated demented from nondemented patients .
These results suggest that extensive ( more than 15 amyloid beta-laden severely stenotic vessels in five frontal cortical sections ) <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral amyloid angiopathy <END> alone is sufficient to cause <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type .
This may have implications for clinicopathological correlations in Alzheimer 's disease and other dementias with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
Identification of a new gene locus for adolescent <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> , on chromosome 3q22 in a large Venezuelan pedigree .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephronophthisis <END> , an autosomal-recessive cystic kidney disease , is the most frequent monogenic cause for <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> in childhood .
Infantile and juvenile forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> are known to originate from separate gene loci .
We describe here a new disease form , adolescent <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> , that is clearly distinct by clinical and genetic findings .
In a large , 340-member consanguineous Venezuelan kindred , clinical symptoms and renal pathology were evaluated .
Onset of terminal <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> was compared with that in a historical sample of <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile nephronophthisis <END> .
Onset of terminal <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> in adolescent <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> occurred significantly later ( median age 19 years , quartile borders 16. 0 and 25. 0 years ) than in <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile nephronophthisis <END> ( median age 13.1 years , quartile borders 11 .3 and 17 .3 years ; Wilcoxon test P=.0069 ) .
A total-genome scan of linkage analysis was conducted and evaluated by LOD score and total-genome haplotype analyses .
A gene locus for adolescent <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> was localized to a region of homozygosity by descent , on chromosome 3q22 , within a critical genetic interval of 2 . 4 cM between flanking markers D3S1292 and D3S1238 .
The maximum LOD score for D3S1273 was 5 .90 ( maximum recombination fraction.035 ) .
This locus is different than that identified for <START:PHENOTYPE> juvenile nephronophthisis <END> .
These findings will have implications for diagnosis and genetic counseling in hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic renal failure <END> and provide the basis for identification of the responsible gene .
Mutations in CUL4B , which encodes a ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit , cause an X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome associated with aggressive outbursts , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> relative macrocephaly <END> , central obesity , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> .
We have identified three truncating , two splice-site , and three missense variants at conserved amino acids in the CUL4B gene on Xq24 in 8 of 250 families with X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) .
During affected subjects ' adolescence , a syndrome emerged with <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed puberty <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> relative macrocephaly <END> , moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , central obesity , unprovoked aggressive outbursts , fine intention <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> , and abnormalities of the toes .
This syndrome was first described by Cazebas et al. , in a family that was included in our study and that carried a CUL4B missense variant .
CUL4B is a ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit implicated in the regulation of several biological processes , and CUL4B is the first XLMR gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase .
The relatively high frequency of CUL4B mutations in this series indicates that it is one of the most commonly mutated genes underlying XLMR and suggests that its introduction into clinical diagnostics should be a high priority .
Variant ataxia-telangiectasia presenting as primary-appearing <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> in Canadian Mennonites . To compare the phenotype of primary-appearing <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> due to variant ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T) with that of other <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> ascertained for genetics research .
Movement disorder specialists examined 20 Canadian Mennonite adult probands with primary-appearing <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , as well as relatives in 4 families with parent-child transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
We screened for the exon 43 c.6200 C> A ( p . A2067D ) ATM mutation and mutations in DYT1 and DYT6 .
Clinical features of the individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> who were harboring ATM mutations were compared with those of individuals without mutations .
Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous founder mutation in ATM in 13 members from 3 of the families , and no one harbored DYT6 or DYT1 mutations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dystonia <END> in ATM families mimicked other forms of early-onset primary torsion <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , especially DYT6 , with prominent cervical , cranial , and brachial involvement .
Mean age at onset was markedly younger in the patients with variant A- T ( n = 12 ) than in patients with other <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> ( n = 23) , ( 12 years vs 40 years , p < 0.05 ) .
The patients with A- T were remarkable for the absence of notable cerebellar atrophy on MRI , lack of frank <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> on examination , and absence of ocular telangiectasias at original presentation , as well as the presence of prominent myoclonus-dystonia in 2 patients .
Many also developed malignancies .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> and telangiectasias may not be prominent features of patients with variant A- T treated for <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> in adulthood , and variant A- T may mimic primary torsion <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> and myoclonus-dystonia .
Clinical and radiological features in young individuals with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome .
Nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterized by multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> , jaw cysts , palmar/plantar pits , spine and rib anomalies , and falx cerebri calcification .
Current diagnostic criteria are suboptimal when applied to pediatric populations , as most common symptoms often do not begin to appear until teenage years .
We studied minor and major clinical features in 30 children/teenagers and compared the findings with 75 adults from 26 families with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome .
Fifty percent of children/teenagers and 82 % of adults had at least one <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> .
Jaw cysts occurred in 60 % of children/teenagers and 81 % of adults .
Palmar/plantar pits were the most frequent feature seen in affected individuals at all ages .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Macrocephaly <END> was seen in 5 0 % of affected and 8 % of unaffected children/teenagers .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Frontal bossing <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel deformity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus deformity <END> , and cleft lip/palate were seen among affected children/teenagers but not among their unaffected siblings .
Falx calcification , the most frequent radiological feature , was present in 37% of individuals <2 0 and 79 % of those >2 0 years .
We report clinical and radiological manifestations of nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome in children/teenagers , many of whom lacked major features such as <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> , jaw cysts , and falx calcification .
Evaluations for palmar/plantar pits , craniofacial features , and radiological manifestations permit early diagnosis and optimum surveillance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ichthyosis <END> follicularis , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> ( IFAP ) syndrome : report of a new family with additional features and review .
Two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis , noncicatricial universal <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , hyerkeratotic psoriasis-like lesions , nails dystrophy , inguineal herniae , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor developmental delay <END> are described .
These features correspond to the <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> follicularis , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> ( IFAP ) syndrome .
The youngest brother had in addition a bilateral absence of 4th fingers and camptodactyly , features never reported in patients with IFAP syndromes .

Clinical variability of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and corneal opacity and novel mutation in the alpha A crystallin gene ( CRYAA ) .
We studied 28 individuals from a four-generation Chilean family ( ADC54 ) including 13 affected individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> and/or corneal opacity .
All individuals underwent a complete ophthalmologic exam .
We screened with a panel of polymorphic DNA markers for known loci that cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , if mutated , and refined the locus using the ABI Prism Linkage Mapping Set Version 2.5 , and calculated two-point lod scores .
Novel PCR primers were designed for the three coding exons , including intron-exon borders , of the candidate gene alpha A crystallin ( CRYAA ) .
Clinically , affected individuals had diverse and novel <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> with variable morphology ( anterior polar , cortical , embryonal , fan-shaped , anterior subcapsular ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcornea <END> and corneal opacity was evident in some .
Marker D21S171 gave a lod score of 4.89 ( theta(m ) = theta(f ) = 0 ) . CRYAA had a G414A transition that segregated with the disease and resulted in an amino acid alteration ( R116H ) .
The phenotypic variability within this family was significant with novel features of the <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> and a corneal opacity .
With the exception of <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> , the clinical features in all six previously reported families with mutations in the CRYAA gene were found in this family .
We identified a novel G414A transition in exon 3 of CRYAA that co-segregated with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> phenotype .
The resulting amino acid change R116H is in a highly conserved region and represents a change in charge .
The genotype-phenotype correlation of this previously unreported mutation provides evidence that other factors , genetic and/or environmental , may influence the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> as a result of this alteration .

COACH syndrome : report of two brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar vermis hypoplasia <END> , oligophrenia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and mental retardation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> ( CHF ) is probably the most common cause of non-icteric hepatosplenomegaly and is encountered mainly in children and young adults .
We describe here two brothers from healthy , non-consanguineous parents .
The patients showed early hepatosplenomegaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> portal hypertension <END> , and no apparent kidney involvement .
Clinical and laboratory findings were similar in both patients .
Liver biopsies showed the presence of broad septa of fibrous tissue containing abundant bile ducts , portal tracts enlarged by fibrosis , and preserved lobular architecture .
The histological findings were suggestive of CHF . Ophthalmological assessment demonstrated <START:PHENOTYPE> visual impairment <END> with mild exotropia , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> .
Neurological examination showed <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
Brain MRI confirmed cerebellar malformation with inferior vermis hypoplasia .
This pattern of defects is consistent with COACH syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia <END> , Oligophrenia , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Coloboma <END> , Hepatic fibrocirrhosis ) which has previously been reported in five other cases .
Our report may contribute to a better delineation of the COACH syndrome phenotype in the spectrum of oculo-encephalohepato-renal disorders .
Linkage of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> to the short arm of chromosome 1 in two families .
At least half of the cases of profound <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> of early onset are caused by genetic factors , but few of the genetic defects have been identified .
This is particularly true of the most common hereditary forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , which occur in the absence of any associated syndrome .
We studied a large Indonesian family in which <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> was inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> first affects the high frequencies during the teens or 20s and becomes profound within 10 years .
To locate the responsible gene , we performed genetic-linkage analysis , using microsatellite markers distributed over the entire genome .
We then performed linkage analyses in an American family and a Dutch family with similar patterns of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> .
In the extended Indonesian family , a gene linked to <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> mapped to chromosome 1p , with a multipoint lod score of more than 7 . In the American family , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> was linked to the same locus on chromosome 1p , with a multipoint lod score of more than 5 .
In the Dutch family , however , this locus was ruled out .
The flanking markers D1S255 and D1S211 defined a region of 6 cM on chromosome 1p that is likely to contain the gene associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> in the first two families .
In some families with early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , the responsible gene is on chromosome 1p .
Primary non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> ( Meige disease ) is not caused by mutations in FOXC2 .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> is a genetic disorder with numerous phenotypic subgroups .
The most common form is the non-syndromic Meige disease , which is primarily of pubertal or later onset , with oedema clinically indistinguishable from that found in the lymphoedema-distichiasis syndrome .
There are also other very rare forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> such as yellow nail syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , which are clinically similar to Meige disease .
The only causative genes so far identified for the non-congenital primary lymphoedemas are the transcription factor FOXC2 , where mutations are known to produce <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> , and SOX18 in the very rare condition hypotrichosis-lymphoedema-telangiectasia .
This study has examined FOXC2 gene by sequence analysis in 23 affected individuals with Meige disease .
A novel truncating mutation ( c.563-584del ) was identified in one family and found to segregate with the disease in eight affected relatives over three generations .
This deletion creates a frameshift that predicts a premature stop at nucleotide 599 and truncating the normal protein by 38 % .
Although the affected patient initially selected for mutation screening from this family had <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> without <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> , all but one of his affected relatives who carried the FOXC2 mutation did have accessory eyelashes originating from their meibomian glands .
This is further confirmation that of the primary lymphoedemas , only <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> is caused by FOXC2 mutations .
All forms of post-pubertal <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> need careful phenotyping for <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> , which may prove difficult to confirm unless several family members are examined , and cannot ever be assumed to be absent from self-report .
Recessive and dominant mutations in retinoic acid receptor beta in cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Anophthalmia <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> , and cardiac defects are the main features of PDAC syndrome .
Recessive mutations in STRA6 , encoding a membrane receptor for the retinol-binding protein , have been identified in some cases with PDAC syndrome , although many cases have remained unexplained .
Using whole-exome sequencing , we found that two PDAC-syndrome-affected siblings , but not their unaffected sibling , were compound heterozygous for nonsense ( c.355 C > T [p.Arg119 ( âˆ— )] ) and frameshift ( c.12 01_1202ins CT [p.Ile403Serfs(âˆ— )15] ) mutations in retinoic acid receptor beta ( RARB ) .
Transfection studies showed that p.Arg119 ( âˆ— ) and p.Ile403Serfs(âˆ— )15 altered RARB had no transcriptional activity in response to ligands , confirming that the mutations induced a loss of function .
We then sequenced RARB in 15 subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and at least one other feature of PDAC syndrome .
Surprisingly , three unrelated subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> showed de novo missense mutations affecting the same codon ; two of the subjects had the c.1159 C> T ( Arg387Cys ) mutation , whereas the other one carried the c.1159 C> A ( p.Arg387Ser ) mutation .
We found that compared to the wild-type receptor , p.Arg387Ser and p.Arg387Cys altered RARB induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in transcriptional activity in response to retinoic acid ligands , suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism .
Our study thus suggests that both recessive and dominant mutations in RARB cause <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> , providing further evidence of the crucial role of the retinoic acid pathway during eye development and organogenesis .

Wilms 's tumour and <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> : clinical and cytogenetic features .
A survey carried out to detect children with aniridia/Wilms 's tumour syndrome identified 8 living and 3 dead children .
The incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> was found to be 1 in 43 among Wilms 's tumour patients in the UK .
The clinical features included complete bilaterial <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , cataracts , glaucoma , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , hyperkinesis , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> .
A high incidence of bilateral tumours ( 36% ) , male sex , presentation at a young age , and advanced maternal age appeared to be associated with the syndrome .
The 8 living children each had a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 11 . In contrast , although 2 patients with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> without Wilms 's tumour had other malformations , neither had genitourinary anomalies , and the only additional problems in patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> were cataracts .
Among 49 children with Wilms 's tumour without <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> ony one had bilateral tumours .
No chromosome abnormalities were detected in patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> , nor were they detected in patients with Wilms 's tumour without <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> or in those with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> without Wilms 's tumour .
While many infants with the Wilms 's tumour/aniridia syndrome are clinically diagnosable at birth , chromosome analysis using the elongated chromosome method is especially valuable to confirm the diagnosis in girls with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> aniridia <END> and in boys who lack the genitourinary malformations .
The presence of an 11p13 deletion confirms the diagnosis of the Wilms 's tumour/aniridia syndrome and indicates a very high risk for the development of Wilms 's tumour .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> syndrome : further delineation of the phenotype .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> ( ARIH) syndrome , which is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital ichthyosis <END> , abnormal hair and corneal involvement , has recently been shown in one consanguineous Israeli Arab family to be caused by a mutation in the ST14 gene , which encodes serine protease matriptase .
No other families have so far been described since the original report .
In this current report we describe a female patient from a second family with ARIH syndrome who carries a homozygous novel mutation , p.M1I .
The patient has <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital ichthyosis <END> , light brown , curly , <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> , improving with age , and sparse body hair , eyebrows and eyelashes .
She does not suffer from <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , but has <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharitis <END> .
The phenotype of this patient closely resembles that of the affected individuals in the previously reported family , although she does not have <START:PHENOTYPE> tooth abnormalities <END> and the <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> is milder .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> transmission of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal respiratory distress <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> caused by a mutation of NKX2-1 .
To study the NKX2-1 gene in two half-siblings with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) on state screen , prolonged <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal respiratory distress <END> despite term gestations , and persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , and developmental delay .
We amplified and sequenced DNA samples from blood or buccal swab for subjects and their unaffected siblings .
The same mutation that prevents splicing together of exons 2 and 3 of the NKX2-1 gene was present in the affected siblings , their mother , and maternal grandmother but not in their unaffected siblings .
The mutation was present in the heterozygous form , thus explaining the disease phenotype .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> transmission of mutations of NKX2-1 may cause <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal respiratory distress <END> at term , and persistent neurologic findings such as <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> in families with affected subjects in multiple generations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , V-esotropia , syndactyly and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
A recessively inherited syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> with weakness of extraocular and frontal muscles is reported in six members of three related kindreds .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Prognathism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> thick eyebrows <END> added to a typical facial appearance .
Additional findings included <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , borderline head circumference and toe syndactyly .
Borderline mental retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> were found in one patient .
The clinical features and the mode of inheritance distinguish this syndrome from other <START:PHENOTYPE> blepharophimosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> syndromes .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( CAHMR ) : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
We have studied 2 Egyptian sibs ( the offspring of normal first cousins ) with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and normal chromosomes .
Review showed that the condition of our patients was not similar to any previously reported entity .
POSSUM lists 84 syndromes with any of the above 3 main traits .
Two disorders with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , Martsolf syndrome and Mollica-Pavone-Anterer syndrome , have overlapping manifestations and therefore are particularly differentiated from our cases .
We suggest that the association of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> observed in this report represents a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
Pattern of familial aggregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Vitiligo <END> is a disorder whose cause is not well understood .
This study was undertaken to clarify whether genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> .
Data on 160 white kindreds living in the United States have been collected .
Each family was ascertained through a proband afflicted with <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> .
The nature and extent of familial aggregation and other relevant epidemiologic features have been determined .
The mean age at onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> is about 19 years in male and about 24 years in female individuals .
The percentage of probands reporting one or more first-degree relatives also afflicted with <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> is 20% .
Children of probands are found to be afflicted about 1.7 times more commonly than other first-degree relatives .
The relative risk ( RR ) for <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> is about 7 for parents , about 12 for siblings , and about 36 for children .
For second-degree relatives , the RR varies between 1 and 16 . Relative risks for all first- and second-degree relatives , except uncles and grandsons , are significant at the 5 % level .
In families in which one or more relatives of the proband are afflicted with <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> , the intrafamilial correlation of ages at onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> is moderate ( 0.6 ) .
No statistically significant effect ( at the 5 % level ) of parental age at first childbirth was seen on the proportion of offspring afflicted with <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> .
No significant association of some commonly related diseases ( eg , thyroid disorder or alopecia areata ) was observed with <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> or with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> .
The extent of familial aggregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> is statistically significant .
The pattern of relationship between RR and degree of kinship indicates involvement of genetic factors , although it is not consistent with single-locus mendelian transmission .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> ( SEMD ) Shohat type .
Recently a distinct <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> ( SEMD ) was reported in three members of a Jewish family .
We present a 3.5-year-old Mexican boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> disproportionate short stature <END> , peculiar face , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , small chest , <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal distension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lumbar lordosis <END> , short limbs , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> genua vara <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> .
Roentgenologic findings include short long bones , wide and <START:PHENOTYPE> flared metaphyses <END> with irregularities , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed epiphyseal ossification <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> and morphological changes of vertebral bodies and <START:PHENOTYPE> fibular overgrowth <END> .
The striking resemblance of this patient to those previously reported confirms this form of SEMD as a distinct entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> is supported and the designation SEMD Shohat type is proposed .
The G and BBB syndromes : case presentations , genetics , and nosology .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertelorism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> are described in four unrelated boys ; bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> were also present in two of the boys and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> in another .
These features are compatible with both the G and BBB syndromes .
When present , laryngotracheoesophageal anomalies or respiratory and <START:PHENOTYPE> swallowing difficulties <END> are characteristic features of the G syndrome ; otherwise facial features may be useful in distinguishing the G and BBB syndromes .
Cases 1 and 2 had anteverted nares and a broad and <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> , and Case 1 had shortened palpebral fissures , all consistent with the G syndrome .
In contrast , Cases 3 and 4 had a high and <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> as previously described in the BBB syndrome .
The father of Case 1 had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> and first-degree <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , demonstrating <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> in the G syndrome .
The mothers of Cases 2 , 3 , and 4 all had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> and partial male-sex limitation , as previously proposed for both the G and BBB syndromes .
Familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> and neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> .
Effects of mutant gene dosage on phenotype .
Neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> is a rare life-threatening disorder characterized by very high serum calcium concentrations ( > 15 mg/dl ) .
Many cases have occurred in families with familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> , a benign condition transmitted as a dominant trait .
Among several hypothesized relationships between the two syndromes is the suggestion that neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> is the homozygous form of familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
To test this hypothesis , we refined the map location of the gene responsible for familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> on chromosome 3q . Analyses in 11 families defined marker loci closely linked to the gene responsible for familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> .
These loci were then analyzed in four families with parental consanguinity and offspring with neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> .
Each individual who was homozygous for loci that are closely linked to the gene responsible for familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> had neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> .
The calculated odds of linkage between these disorders of > 350 ,000:1 ( lod score = 5.56 ) .
We conclude that dosage of the gene defect accounts for these widely disparate clinical phenotypes ; a single defective allele causes familial hypocalciuric <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> , while two defective alleles causes neonatal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> .
Osteochondrodysplasia with <START:PHENOTYPE> rhizomelia <END> , platyspondyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> callosal agenesis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
A female infant born at term to phenotypically normal nonconsanguinous parents had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> callosal agenesis <END> , and nonlethal rhizomelic osteochondrodysplasia .
Her osteochondrodysplasia was characterized roentgenographically by shortening and metaphyseal broadening of long bones , without bowing , and by platyspondyly , with deficient ossification of dorsal and central portions of vertebral bodies .
By light microscopy , the iliac crest growth plate showed expansion of the zone of chondrocyte hypertrophy and degeneration , with faulty columnar alignment , sparse vascular ingrowth , and irregular mineralization at the zone of chondroosseous transformation .
These findings appear to define a novel osteochondrodysplasia , which in association with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> callosal agenesis <END> may constitute a new syndrome .
Oculo-palatal-cerebral syndrome : a second case .
Oculo-palato-cerebral syndrome is an extremely rare disorder consisting of low birth weight , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , small hands and feet , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> , developmental delay , and cerebral atrophy.
There has been one report of a consanguineous family with three affected children , suggesting <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
We report on the second case of this disorder .
Our patient , a 2-year-old boy , had growth delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous <END> with right <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , long ears with <START:PHENOTYPE> thickened helices <END> , small hands and feet , highly arched palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> , hypoplastic nails , frontal cerebral atrophy and thinning of the corpus callosum on brain magnetic resonance imaging , and mild developmental delay .
He has much milder features than those seen in the previously reported cases .

Association of <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> and sudden death in macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita syndrome .
Macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita ( M-CMTC ) constitutes a distinct entity characterized by prenatal <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> , macrosomia , hemihypertrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , nonobstructive <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , generalized or facial capillary malformation with upper philtral nevus flammeus and <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis marmorata <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> , loose skin , <START:PHENOTYPE> toe syndactyly <END> , and postaxial <START:PHENOTYPE> polydactyly <END> .
All but one of the cases reported previously had benign clinical courses without showing an increased risk of early infant death .
We describe three additional cases with poor clinical outcomes including severe postnatal growth failure , intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrhythmia <END> in two cases , and sudden infant death in two cases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Arrhythmia <END> has not been described previously as one of the symptoms of M-CMCT.
Patients with M-CMTC associated with severe postnatal growth failure and <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> may constitute a distinct clinical subtype of M-CMTC with an increased risk of life-threatening episodes or sudden death .
Recognizing this clinical subtype of M-CMTC is important to prevent these serious potential complications .

<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> skeletal dysplasia with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
A syndrome compatible with an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> trait is described , affecting four male cousins in three sibships .
The body had skeletal anomalies , including <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , ridging of the metopic suture , <START:PHENOTYPE> fusion of cervical vertebrae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thoracic hemivertebrae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , sarcral hypoplasia and <START:PHENOTYPE> short middle phalanges <END> .
In addition , they had moderate developmental retardation , and abducens palsies .
Three of the four had <START:PHENOTYPE> glucose intolerance <END> , and one was born with an <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> .
Of five female obligate carriers studied , three had <START:PHENOTYPE> fusion of cervical vertebrae <END> , three had some shortening of the middle phalanges and three had <START:PHENOTYPE> glucose intolerance <END> .
The syndrome in this family was compared to previously reported syndromes , and the conclusion was reached that it represents a previously unreported <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> syndrome with minor manifestations in carrier females .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertrichosis <END> terminalis , <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> , and a characteristic face : a new distinct entity .
Congenital generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> terminalis has been described in association with other features as <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> , osteochondrodysplasia , and a dysmorphic face .
Bondeson and Miles [ 1993 : Am J Med Genet 47 : 198-212 ] described a woman with universal congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> terminalis associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> ; the face of this patient was coarse and different from other forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> described before .
We present an 11-year , 6-month-old girl with universal congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> terminalis , <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> , and a characteristic <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse face <END> resembling the patient described by Bondeson and Miles [ 1993 : Am J Med Genet 47 : 198-212 ] .
We propose that this type of congenital generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> terminalis , associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> and a <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse face <END> , is a distinctive new entity .

" Idiopathic " <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> .
Two phenotypical expressions of a common genetic defect .
Among 59 closely related members of one Bedouin tribe , we identified 9 who had the characteristic features of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemic rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> ( HHRH ) .
We found "idiopathic " <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> in 21 of the 50 asymptomatic members .
The biochemical abnormalities observed in these 21 subjects were qualitatively similar to those in the 9 with HHRH , but were quantitatively milder .
The urinary calcium concentration was 0.43 +/- 0.14 mg per milligram of creatinine ( mean +/- SD ) in the patients with HHRH , 0.34 +/- 0.07 in the subjects with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> , and 0.14 +/- 0.05 in normal subjects from the same tribe .
Tubular reabsorption of phosphorus and serum phosphorus concentrations were 3. 0 and 4.3 SD units below the age-related mean , respectively , in HHRH , and 1 .1 SD units below the normal mean for both variables in idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
Mean serum levels of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D ( 1 ,25- ( OH)2D) were 303 pg per milliliter in HHRH and 145 pg per milliliter in idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> ( upper normal limit , 110 ) .
We conclude that the subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and the patients with HHRH shared a hereditary renal phosphate leak that led to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , elevated serum concentrations of 1 ,25- ( OH)2D , increased intestinal calcium absorption , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
The magnitude of the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> , which regulates 1 ,25- ( OH)2D levels , appears to determine which subjects will have <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> alone and which will also have bone disease .
Variants of DENND1B associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> in children .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Asthma <END> is a complex disease that has genetic and environmental causes .
The genetic factors associated with susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> remain largely unknown .
We carried out a genomewide association study involving children with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
The sample included 793 North American children of European ancestry with persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> who required daily inhaled glucocorticoid therapy and 1988 matched controls ( the discovery set ) .
We also tested for genomewide association in an independent cohort of 917 persons of European ancestry who had <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and 1546 matched controls ( the replication set ) .
Finally , we tested for an association between 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) at chromosome 1q31 and <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> in 1667 North American children of African ancestry who had <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and 2045 ancestrally matched controls .
In our meta-analysis of all samples from persons of European ancestry , we observed an association , with genomewide significance , between <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and SNPs at the previously reported locus on 17q21 and an additional eight SNPs at a novel locus on 1q31 .
The SNP most strongly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> was rs2786098 ( P=8.55x10( -9) ) .
We observed replication of the association of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> with SNP rs2786098 in the independent series of persons of European ancestry ( combined P=9.3x10( -11) ) .
The alternative allele of each of the eight SNPs on chromosome 1q31 was strongly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> in the children of African ancestry ( P=1.6x10( -13 ) for the comparison across all samples ) .
The 1q31 locus contains the 1q31 locus contains DENND1B , a gene expressed by natural killer cells and dendritic cells .
DENND1B protein is predicted to interact with the tumor necrosis factor Î± receptor [corrected ] .
We have identified a locus containing DENND1B on chromosome 1q31 .3 that is associated with susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Renal insufficiency <END> is a component of COACH syndrome .
Two sisters , ages 23 years and 6 years , respectively , were found to have congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , mental retardation and <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal liver function <END> .
Magnetic resonance imaging showed <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar vermis hypoplasia <END> in the younger girl and liver biopsy showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> in the older sister .
This combination of findings suggested a diagnosis of COACH syndrome which is characterized by hypoplasia of cerebellar vermis , oligophrenia , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> .
COACH syndrome is a newly recognized condition .
So far , five cases have been reported from three sibships .
We report two additional cases from one sibship and suggest that several other cases may already exist in literature that were not recognized as having COACH syndrome .
The occurrence of multiple cases in single sibships suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
In addition to previously described findings typical of COACH syndrome , the older of our patients showed progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> renal insufficiency <END> with fibrocystic changes on renal biopsy .
Renal function has not been described consistently in previous reports of COACH syndrome but has been abnormal in all cases in which it has been investigated .
We suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> renal insufficiency <END> should be considered a common manifestation of COACH syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Albinism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> with profound developmental delay : Vici syndrome , evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
We report on two sibs and two other unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of corpus callosum <END> , oculocutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> , repeated infections , and cardiomyopathy.
All manifested postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and profound developmental delay .
Additional central nervous system anomalies present in at least one patient included <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> white matter neuronal heterotopia <END> , or bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> schizencephaly <END> .
Repeated viral , bacterial , and fungal infections were consistent with a primary immunodeficiency .
However , immunological studies showed variable , nonspecific findings .
Cardiomyopathy with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> or infection led to death before age 2 years in three of the patients .
This syndrome was first described by Vici et al . [ 1988 : Am . J . Med . Genet . 29:1-8 ] .
The four patients reported herein confirm this unique disorder .
Affected sibs of both sexes born to unaffected parents provide evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , due to steroid sulphatase deficiency , associated with Kallmann syndrome ( hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> ) : linkage relationships with Xg and cloned DNA sequences from the distal short arm of the X chromosome .
We report a large Italian pedigree in which five out of six males are affected by a syndrome , following an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked inheritance <END> pattern , characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , hypogonadotropic hypogonadism , and <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> .
The concurrence of features of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> ( XLI ) with those of Kallmann syndrome , another disease often inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> trait , prompted us to perform biochemical , cytogenetic , and molecular studies in relation to the short arm of the X chromosome ( Xp ) .
Steroid sulphatase ( STS ) activity was found to be completely deficient in all affected members of the family .
Prometaphase chromosome analyses of two obligate heterozygous women and one affected male showed normal karyotypes .
Xg blood group antigen analysis and molecular studies employing cloned DNA sequences from the distal segment of the Xp ( probes RC8 , 782 , dic56 , and M1A ) , did not provide evidence for deletions or rearrangements of the X chromosome .
The linkage analysis showed no crossovers between the disease , Xg , and DXS143 , the locus defined by probe dic56 , thus suggesting the possibility of a linkage between these two markers of the distal segment of Xp and the <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , hypogonadism , and <START:PHENOTYPE> anosmia <END> syndrome .
Syndrome complex of <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> predicts germline defects in telomerase .
Mutations in the essential telomerase components hTERT and hTR cause dyskeratosis congenita , a <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> syndrome characterized by mucocutaneous features .
Some ( ~ 3% ) sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> aplastic anemia <END> ( AA ) and idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> cases also carry mutations in hTERT and hTR .
Even though it can affect clinical outcome , because the mutation frequency is rare , genetic testing is not standard .
We examined whether the cooccurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> in the same individual or family enriches for the presence of a telomerase mutation .
Ten consecutive individuals with a total of 36 family members who fulfilled these criteria carried a germline mutant telomerase gene (100% ) .
The mean age of onset for individuals with AA was significantly younger than that for those with <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> ( 14 vs 51 ; P < .0001 ) .
Families displayed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> and there was an evolving pattern of genetic anticipation , with the older generation primarily affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> and successive generations by <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> .
The cooccurrence of AA and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary fibrosis <END> in a single patient or family is highly predictive for the presence of a germline telomerase defect .
This diagnosis affects the choice of bone marrow transplantation preparative regimen and can prevent morbidity .
Neurovascular compression at the ventrolateral medulla in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> with brachydactyly features severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> that causes stroke usually before the age of 50 years .
We recently characterized the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> as featuring normal renin , aldosterone , and catecholamine responses and mapped the gene responsible to chromosome 12p.
Since angiography in an affected subject had earlier shown tortuous vessels , we performed magnetic resonance tomography ( MRT) angiography to look for possible neurovascular anomalies ( NVA) , which have been previously associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
NVA can be caused by a looping posterior inferior cerebellar or vertebral artery .
Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that NVA may cause <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> by a compression of the ventrolateral medulla .
We performed MRT in 15 hypertensive affected ( aged 14 to 57 years ) and 12 normotensive nonaffected ( aged 12 to 59 years ) family members .
We then tested for linkage between the hypertension-brachydactyly phenotypes and the presence of NVA .
All 15 affected persons had MRT evidence for NVA .
All had left-sided posterior inferior cerebellar artery or vertebral artery loops , while 6 had bilateral NVA . None of the nonaffected family members had NVA .
The phenotypes were linked with an LOD score of 9.2 given a penetrance of 99 % .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly regularly feature NVA , which is frequently bilateral .
The early age at which NVA was identified suggests that the condition is primary .
We suggest that NVA may be involved in the pathogenesis of this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and perhaps essential <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> as well .
Further studies are necessary to address the question of causation .
Mental retardation , distinct facial changes , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> : a new X-linked mental retardation syndrome .
We describe a 3-year-old boy and his 2 maternal uncles with moderate to <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , a low total finger ridge count , and a distinctive face characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> bitemporal narrowness <END> , almond-shaped palperbral fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> depressed nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , short and inverted-V-shaped upper lip , and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> .
Two other males in this family who had similar facial anomalies and developmental delay died in early infancy and midchildhood .
This apparently new disorder is reminiscent of , but distinct from , the Prader-Willi syndrome , and is likely inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> trait .
Preliminary studies with DNA probes are consistent with an X-linked locus and permit exclusion of distal Xp and Xq regions as the site of this mutation .
Marinesco-SjÃ¶gren syndrome in a male with mild dysmorphism .
Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome ( MSS ) is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , cerebellar ataxia caused by cerebellar hypoplasia , mild to moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , neuromuscular <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism <END> , and skeletal anomalies .
The syndrome was recently mapped to chromosome 5q31 , but there is evidence for genetic heterogeneity , and no gene has been identified .
We report a 5-year-old male with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , ataxia , a progressive cerebellar atrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , seizures , hypotonia , and a sensorimotor <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> consistent with many cases of MSS .
He also had mild craniofacial dysmorphism consisting of hypertrichosis and synophrys , deep-set eyes with epicanthic folds , a flat philtrum , a high palate , short thumbs , and a wide sandal gap between the first and second toes .
Skeletal findings included an increased <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphosis <END> .
We reviewed the literature on MSS to determine if craniofacial dysmorphism and the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> would prove to be diagnostically useful in this phenotypically heterogeneous condition .
The majority of cases of MSS do not have craniofacial dysmorphism , but other cases have been reported with features such as ptosis or a myopathic facies that are likely to reflect the underlying myopathic or neuromuscular processes in MSS . (c ) 2005 Wiley-Liss , Inc .
9q34.3 deletion syndrome in three unrelated children .
We described three unrelated children with cryptic 9q34.3 rearrangements and similar clinical manifestations : two with 9q34.3 terminal deletions and the other with an unbalanced translocation involving 9q34.3-qter monosomy and 6p25-pter trisomy .
Common features among the three we studied and the other six patients with 9q34.3 deletions in the literature include <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MR) , hypotonic , and epileptic <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Their facial characteristics included <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arched eyebrows <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nostrils <END> , carp mouth , <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding tongue <END> , micrognathia , and pointed chin . Other frequent abnormalities were cardiac abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , and abnormal toes .
These findings are characteristic enough to be a clinically recognizable syndrome .

<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> chondrodysplasia with <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> , distinctive brachydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> .
We describe a family with an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> chondrodysplasia .
Four males and six females were affected through four generations .
Identification of skeletal abnormalities and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> during the pregnancy of three male fetuses led to termination of the pregnancies .
A fourth affected male died at 6 days of life .
The four patients had chondrodysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> , and facial features with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> .
Radiographs showed severe <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> and various bone abnormalities including a distinctive metaphyseal cupping of the metacarpals , metatarsals , and phalanges .
The affected females were less affected and showed <START:PHENOTYPE> small stature <END> , sometimes associated with body asymmetry and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
This condition appears to be a previously unrecognized <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> chondrodysplasia .

Characterisation and genetic mapping of a new X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> syndrome .
Hereditary forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> are classified as syndromic , when <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> is associated with other clinical features , or non-syndromic , when <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> occurs without other clinical features .
Many types of syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> have been described , some of which have been mapped to specific chromosomal regions .
Here we describe a family with progressive sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> , facial dysmorphism , and variable other features , transmitted by apparent X linked recessive inheritance .
Haplotype analysis of PCR products spanning the X chromosome and direct sequencing of candidate genes were used to begin characterising the molecular basis of features transmitted in this family .
Comparison to known syndromes involving <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , facial dysmorphism , and other clinical features was performed by review of published reports and personal discussions .
Genetic mapping places the candidate locus for this syndrome within a 48 cM region on Xq1-21 .
Candidate genes including COL4A5 , DIAPH , and POU3F4 were excluded by clinical and molecular analyses .
The constellation of clinical findings in this family (deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> , facial dysmorphism , variable renal and genitourinary abnormalities , and late onset pancytopenia) , along with a shared haplotype on Xq1-21 , suggests that this represents a new form of syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
We discuss our findings in comparison to several other syndromic and non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> loci that have been mapped to the X chromosome .
Autosomal-recessive syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , hypogonadism , progressive extra-pyramidal disorder , white matter disease , sensory neural <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , and low IGF1 .
We explored the manifestations of an autosomal-recessive multisystemic disorder in several Saudi families .
Recognized causes of progressive extra-pyramidal disorder and white matter disease were excluded and the neurological , imaging , endocrine , and skin manifestations of this syndrome described .
The onset of these symptoms in these patients began in early adolescence and progressed more rapidly in males .
All affected patients had total or partial <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , clinical and chemical evidence of hypogonadism ( low levels of estradiol and testosterone ) ; females had clear evidence of hypogonadism ( streak or absent ovaries) , and some patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
The constant biochemical abnormality was the low IGF-1 .
The neurological manifestations included moderate to severe intellectual decline and abnormality of muscle tone and posture with choreo-athetoid and <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonic movements <END> resulting in gait difficulty , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , difficulty swallowing , and scoliosis .
The MRI of brain demonstrated white matter involving cerebellum , brain stem , and cerebral structures , as well as abnormal decreased signal intensity in the basal ganglia with involvement of the substantia nigra .
We conclude that the association of hypogonadism , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , and persistent low IGF-1 is a significant <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome ; it is prevalent in Saudi Arabia .
We also demonstrate that the progressive extra-pyramidal disorder , white matter disease , and abnormal signals of the basal ganglia are common features of this syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Sensorineural deafness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> were recognized features .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> in people with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> is a well-recognized psychiatric disorder of childhood .
Its cause is unknown , but there is evidence of a familial predisposition .
Symptoms suggestive of this disorder have been reported in subjects with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> , a disease caused by mutations in the thyroid receptor-beta gene and characterized by reduced responsiveness of peripheral and pituitary tissues to the actions of thyroid hormone .
We systematically evaluated the presence and severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> in 18 families with a history of generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> .
We studied 49 affected and 55 unaffected family members ; 52 were adults , and 52 were children .
All subjects were evaluated with structured psychiatric questionnaires by interviewers who were unaware of the medical diagnosis .
The number of symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> was calculated for each subject .
Among the adults , 11 of 22 subjects with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> (5 0 percent ) and 2 of 30 unaffected subjects ( 7 percent ) had met the criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> as children ( P < 0.001 ) .
Among the children , 19 of 27 subjects resistant to thyroid hormone (7 0 percent ) and 5 of 25 unaffected subjects (2 0 percent ) met the criteria for the disorder ( P < 0.001 ) .
The odds of having <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> were 3.2 times higher for affected male subjects than for affected female subjects and were 2.7 times higher for unaffected male subjects than for unaffected female subjects .
The mean symptom score was 2.5 times higher in the affected group than in the unaffected group ( 7. 0 vs . 2.8 , P < 0.001 ) .
The frequency of other psychiatric diagnoses was similar in the two groups .
In our study sample , <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder <END> is strongly associated with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance to thyroid hormone <END> .
Connexin 26 mutations in hereditary non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> is the most prevalent inherited sensory disorder , affecting about 1 in 1,000 children .
Most <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> results from peripheral auditory defects that occur as a consequence of either conductive ( outer or middle ear ) or sensorineuronal ( cochlea ) abnormalities .
Although a number of mutant genes have been identified that are responsible for syndromic ( multiple phenotypic disease ) <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> such as Waardenburg syndrome and Usher 1B syndrome , little is known about the genetic basis of non-syndromic (single phenotypic disease ) <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
Here we study a pedigree containing cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and have identified a mutation in the gene encoding the gap-junction protein connexin 26 ( Cx26 ) that segregates with the profound <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> in the family .
Cx26 mutations resulting in premature stop codons were also found in three <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> non-syndromic sensorineuronal <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> pedigrees , genetically linked to chromosome 13q11 -12 ( DFNB1) , where the Cx26 gene is localized .
Immunohistochemical staining of human cochlear cells for Cx26 demonstrated high levels of expression .
To our knowledge , this is the first non-syndromic sensorineural autosomal <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> susceptibility gene to be identified , which implicates Cx26 as an important component of the human cochlea .
A clinical and molecular genetic study of 112 Iranian families with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( MCPH ) is a genetically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> disorder showing an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance .
Affected individuals present with head circumferences more than three SDs below the age - and sex-matched population mean , associated with mild to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Five genes ( MCPH1 , CDK5RAP2 , ASPM , CENPJ , STIL ) and two genomic loci , MCPH2 and MCPH4 , have been identified so far .
In this study , we investigated all seven MCPH loci in patients with primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> from 112 Consanguineous Iranian families .
In addition to a thorough clinical characterisation , karyotype analyses were performed for all patients .
For Homozygosity mapping , microsatellite markers were selected for each locus and used for genotyping .
Our investigation enabled us to detect homozygosity at MCPH1 ( Microcephalin ) in eight families , at MCPH5 ( ASPM ) in thirtheen families .
Three families showed homozygosity at MCPH2 and five at MCPH6 ( CENPJ) , and two families were linked to MCPH7 ( STIL ) .
The remaining 81 families were not linked to any of the seven known loci .
Subsequent sequencing revealed eight , 10 and one novel mutations in Microcephalin , ASPM and CENPJ , respectively .
In some families , additional features such as <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hearing loss <END> were observed in the microcephalic patient , which widens the spectrum of clinical manifestations of mutations in known <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> genes .
Our results show that the molecular basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> is <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> ; thus , the Iranian population may provide a unique source for the identification of further genes underlying this disorder .
A new X linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small testes <END> , muscle wasting , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> localises to Xq24-q25 .
A large family is described in which <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> segregates as an X linked trait .
Six affected males in three generations were studied by linkage and clinical examination .
Characteristic clinical features include <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent lower lip <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small testes <END> , muscle wasting of the lower legs , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hyperextensibility <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal gait <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , and decreased fine motor coordination .
Affected subjects also had impaired speech and decreased attention span .
A carrier female was mildly affected .
A similar disorder was not found on review of our XLMR Database of 124 syndromes .
Linkage analysis of 37 markers resulted in a lod score of 2.8 0 at DXS1212 and 2.76 at DXS425 .
The limiting markers were DXS424 and DXS1047 .
Ten of 124 XLMR syndromes and eight of 58 MRX families overlap this region .
In summary , this family appears to have a new XLMR syndrome localising to Xq24-q25 .
SCA-12 : Tremor with cerebellar and <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical atrophy <END> is associated with a CAG repeat expansion .
To characterize the clinical and neuroradiologic features of a new spinocerebellar ataxia , SCA-12 , in the index family .
The authors recently linked SCA-12 to a novel CAG repeat expansion on chromosome 5q31-33 that is located within the 5 ' region of PPP2R2B , a gene encoding a brain-specific regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. Neurologic features of the proband and nine symptomatic relatives in the first SCA-12 family were compiled and , in some individuals , related to changes found on brain MRI or CT. SCA-12 typically presented in the 4th decade of life with <START:PHENOTYPE> action tremor <END> of the head or arms ( present in 10/1 0 of the affected individuals ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperreflexia <END> ( 8 /10 ) was a common feature , and cerebellar signs ( 8 /10 ) , including ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysmetria <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , developed gradually but were less prominent and disabling than cerebellar dysfunction in other SCA . Subtle parkinsonian features ( 9/10 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ( 2/10 ) were observed in later stages of SCA-12 , and psychiatric symptoms , including <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> delusions <END> , were present in some affected family members ( 4/10 ) .
Two individuals studied had nondisabling neurologic signs neonatally , including nystagmus and lower extremity dystonia .
Brain images of affected individuals revealed cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.
SCA-12 is a slowly progressive , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> , neurodegenerative disorder that differs from other SCA in that it typically presents with <START:PHENOTYPE> action tremor <END> in patients in their mid 30s and usually includes <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperreflexia <END> and subtle parkinsonian signs .
Cerebellar dysfunction , including gait ataxia , is relatively nondisabling , and cognitive or psychiatric disorders may occur .
Neuroradiologic studies reveal atrophy of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex .
Congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> rigid spine <END> syndrome : a clinical , pathological , radiological , and genetic study .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Rigid spine <END> syndrome is a term first proposed by Dubowitz to describe a subset of patients affected by myopathy with early spinal <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures <END> as a prominent feature .
While <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal rigidity <END> is a nonspecific feature , found in Emery-Dreifuss <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> and in some congenital myopathies , it is also a prominent feature in a group of patients with merosin-positive congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> , where it is generally associated with stable or only slowly progressive weakness and early respiratory insufficiency .
Recently , the first locus for congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> in association with <START:PHENOTYPE> rigid spine <END> syndrome was mapped to chromosome 1p35-p36 in consanguineous Moroccan , Turkish , and Iranian families .
We present here a detailed phenotypic description of the familial syndrome linked to this locus , describing 4 siblings ( 3 boys and 1 girl ) of Northern European-American heritage who are the offspring of a nonconsanguineous marriage .
All 4 siblings were affected by hypotonia and prominent neck weakness in infancy , early <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal rigidity <END> , and early <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
After initial improvement , muscle strength stabilizes or slowly declines , and skeletal deformities and respiratory insufficiency supervene .
Muscle biopsy in an affected child at age 9 months revealed minimal , nonspecific myopathic changes , leading to a diagnosis of "minimal change myopathy. "
Muscle biopsy in his sibling , at the age of 14 years , revealed chronic and severe myopathic (dystrophic ) changes , with normal staining for laminin-2 and for proteins of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex .
A possible explanation for these biopsy findings is that magnetic resonance imaging of the thighs reveals stereotyped selective muscle involvement , with the selectivity more pronounced early in the disease course followed by widespread muscular signal abnormalities in the late stages of the disease .
In this family , linkage to the chromosome 1p <START:PHENOTYPE> rigid spine <END> syndrome locus ( RSMD1 ) is supported by maximum LOD scores for several markers of 1.81 at theta = 0 , representing the maximum statistical power possible for this family .
In combination with the previous report , this syndrome is linked to the RSMD1 locus with a summated maximum LOD score of 6.29 , and analysis of recombination events in our family narrows the previously reported RSMD1 locus to 3 centiMorgans .
Mutations in the gene for the granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor receptor in patients with acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> preceded by severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
In severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> the maturation of myeloid progenitor cells is arrested .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> myelodysplastic syndrome <END> and acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> develop in some patients with severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Abnormalities in the signal-transduction pathways for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) may play a part in the progression to acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> .
We isolated genomic DNA and RNA from hematopoietic cells obtained from two patients with acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> and histories of severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
The nucleotide sequences encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the G-CSF receptor were amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced .
Murine myeloid 32D.C1 0 cells were transfected with complementary DNA encoding the wild-type or mutant G-CSF receptors and tested for their responses to G-CSF . Point mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor were identified in both patients .
The mutations , a substitution of thymine for cytosine at the codon for glutamine at position 718 ( Gln718 ) in one patient and at the codon for glutamine at position 731( Gln731 ) in the other , caused a truncation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of the receptor .
Both mutant and wild-type genes for the G-CSF receptor were present in leukemic cells from the two patients .
In one patient , the mutation was also found in the neutropenic stage , before the progression to acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> .
The 32D.C1 0 cells expressing mutant receptors had abnormally high proliferative responses but failed to mature when cultured in G-CSF .
The mutant G-CSF receptors also interfered with terminal maturation mediated by the wild-type G-CSF receptor in the 32D.C1 0 cells that coexpressed the wild-type and mutant receptors .
Mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor that interrupt signals required for the maturation of myeloid cells are involved in the pathogenesis of severe congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> and associated with the progression to acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> .
Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome : a novel marker of kidney <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> .
Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome ( BHD ) is a dominantly inherited predisposition for development of fibrofolliculomas , trichodiscomas , and acrochordons .
Concurrent internal tumors , such as colonic polyps and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal carcinoma <END> , have been described in patients with BHD . To evaluate kindreds with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> for cutaneous manifestations of BHD .
One hundred fifty-two patients from 49 families underwent complete oral and skin examination .
Skin lesions were identified by their clinical appearance , and the diagnosis was confirmed by results of histologic examination .
Individuals underwent screening for familial renal neoplasms .
A tertiary referral research hospital .
Individuals with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> and their asymptomatic at-risk relatives .
We determined whether any form of renal <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> is associated BHD .
We identified 3 extended kindreds in whom renal neoplasms and BHD appeared to segregate together .
Two kindreds had renal oncocytomas and a third had a variant of papillary <START:PHENOTYPE> renal cell carcinoma <END> .
Thirteen patients exhibited BHD . Seven individuals , including a set of identical twins , had renal neoplasms and BHD .
An additional 4 patients ( 3 deceased and not examined ) in these families had renal neoplasms but not BHD . Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome without renal neoplasms was present in 6 individuals .
Thirteen patients with fibrofolliculomas and trichodiscomas presented clinically with multiple smooth skin-colored to grayish-white papules located on the face , auricles , neck , and upper trunk .
Oral papules were present in 9 of 28 and achrochordons in 11 of 28 patients .
Features of BHD not previously appreciated included deforming <START:PHENOTYPE> lipomas <END> in 5 , collagenomas in 4 , and pulmonary cysts in 4 of 28 patients .
Families with BHD did not display germline mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau gene or in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET proto-oncogene .
Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome may be associated with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> .
Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> segregate together in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion .
Patients with BHD and their relatives are at risk for development of <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> .
Therefore , patients with BHD and their relatives should undergo abdominal computed tomography and renal ultrasound screening for <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tumors <END> .
New phenotype of the cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy mapped to chromosome 19 : <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> as the prominent clinical feature .
A survey was carried out on a large family presenting the symptoms of familial arteriopathy ( CADASIL ) recently mapped to chromosome 19 . This is characterised clinically by <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent subcortical infarcts <END> developing into <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudobulbar palsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> subcortical dementia <END> , and radiologically by early MRI abnormalities . To characterise this familial condition , 43 members older than 20 years and spreading over four generations were studied clinically ( 31 living , 12 deceased ) , genetically , and radiologically by MRI ( n = 31 ) . Twenty out of 43 were found to be clinically symptomatic and of these 13 out of 31 had MRI abnormalities .
Genetic studies mapped this condition to the locus of CADASIL ( lod score > 3 ) .
The natural history suggests a chronological clinicoradiological staging of this phenotype of CADASIL : stage I between 20 and 40 years with frequent migraine-like episodes and well delineated lesions of the white matter ; stage II between 40 and 60 years with stroke-like episodes , bipolar or monopolar-like psychotic disorders , coalescent lesions of the white matter , and well delineated lesions of the basal ganglia ; and stage III over 60 years with <START:PHENOTYPE> subcortical dementia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudobulbar palsy <END> , diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> , and multiple well delineated lesions of the basal ganglia .
This phenotype differs from the other two previously described by high frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , frequency of psychotic disorders , and early neurological manifestations .
The new acronym " cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts , <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> " ( CADASILM ) is proposed to better describe this particular subvariety of CADASIL .
Alport syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse leiomyomatosis <END> .
Alport syndrome ( AS ) is a hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> progressing to <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal failure <END> ( ESRF) , sensorineural deafness , and specific eye signs ( lenticonus , macular flecks , and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> ) .
Inheritance is <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> in about 85 % of the cases , caused by different mutations in the COL4A5 gene .
Rarely AS is seen in combination with <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse leiomyomatosis <END> ( DL ) .
DL is a tumorous process involving smooth muscle cells , mostly of the esophagus , but also of the tracheobronchial tree and the female genital tract .
Characteristically , the patients have deletions of the 5 ' -end of both the COL4A5 and the COL4A6 genes , respectively .
We here present a 9-year-old boy who was admitted because of a newly diagnosed sensorineural deafness .
He was born with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> and presented symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> and bronchial irritation in the first year of life .
Macroscopic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> was first noticed at 2 years during a febrile infection .
Since early childhood the boy suffered from severe <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> .
Taking together these symptoms , the diagnosis of Alport syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse leiomyomatosis <END> ( AS-DL ) has to be considered .
Genetic analysis demonstrated the predicted deletion of the COL4A5 / COL4A6 genes .

We report on 4 boys ( 3 in one family ) who have a remarkably constant syndrome of childhood-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> with later <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal microcephaly <END> , growth and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> external ophthalmoplegia <END> and varying degrees of <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
The pedigrees are consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked inheritance <END> .
The syndrome is compared and contrasted with others comprising basal ganglion dysfunction in childhood .
It is concluded that clinically and genetically the condition is unique .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephromegaly <END> in infancy and early childhood : a risk factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome .
Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome ( BWS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> syndrome associated with macrosomia , <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macroglossia <END> , visceromegaly and <START:PHENOTYPE> Wilms tumor <END> ( WT) .
We conducted a case-control study in children with BWS to examine whether <START:PHENOTYPE> nephromegaly <END> increases the risk of WT.
The BWS Registry was used to identify control and case patients .
Control patients were defined as children with BWS who were older than 6 years and had no imaging evidence of renal disease or previous WT and for whom complete records were available ; 31 patients met these criteria .
Case patients were defined as children with BWS who had WT and screening renal imaging before the diagnosis of WT; 12 of these patients had serial screening images before diagnosis of WT and comprised the study population .
Only renal images obtained before the diagnosis of WT was made were used to assess renal length .
All 12 patients with WT had <START:PHENOTYPE> nephromegaly <END> ( > or =95th percentile of age adjusted renal length ) on serial screening studies .
Only four of 31 control patients ( specificity = 86% ) had <START:PHENOTYPE> nephromegaly <END> resulting in an odds ratio of 72 ( 95 % confidence interval = 13-391 ) for the risk of WT with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephromegaly <END> .
In patients with BWS , persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> nephromegaly <END> is a strong risk factor for the development of WT. If screening for WT is done in this population , infants with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephromegaly <END> should be considered those at greatest risk for WT, and screening may be best targeted at this group .
DOOR syndrome : clinical report , literature review and discussion of natural history .
DOOR syndrome (deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> , osteodystrophy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ) is a rarely described disorder with less than 35 reports in the literature .
The hallmarks of the syndrome , represented in the DOOR acronym , include sensorineural hearing loss , hypoplastic or <START:PHENOTYPE> absent nails <END> on the hands and feet , small or absent distal phalanges of the hands and feet , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The purpose of our communication is to report on an additional patient with DOOR syndrome , delineate common as well as less frequent manifestations of DOOR syndrome , bring attention to the under appreciated facial features in DOOR syndrome , document the natural history of this disorder , and propose a suggested workup of those suspected of DOOR syndrome .
DOOR syndrome is associated with characteristic , <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse facial features <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> large nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> wide nasal bridge <END> , bulbous tip and <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , a long prominent philtrum and <START:PHENOTYPE> downturned corners of the mouth <END> .
The natural history is one of a deteriorative course , with progressive neurological manifestations including <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> from infancy , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and a peripheral polyneuropathy.
The majority of patients with DOOR syndrome have elevated levels of 2-oxoglutarate in the urine and plasma .
In this report , we present a newborn with manifestations consistent with DOOR syndrome and a progressive clinical course .
A comprehensive literature review reveals 32 patients with DOOR syndrome .
In conclusion , DOOR syndrome is a neurometabolic disorder with recognizable facial features and a progressive natural history .

IMAGe , a new clinical association of <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> adrenal hypoplasia <END> congenita , and genital anomalies .
We report three boys with <START:PHENOTYPE> adrenal hypoplasia <END> congenita ( AHC ) and additional findings that represent a new syndrome , IMAGe : <START:PHENOTYPE> Intrauterine growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Metaphyseal dysplasia <END> , AHC , and Genital anomalies .
Each presented shortly after birth with growth retardation and severe adrenal insufficiency .
Each of the three patients had mild dysmorphic features , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> small penis <END> , and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism .
Skeletal surveys revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal dysplasia <END> in all three and <START:PHENOTYPE> epiphyseal dysplasia <END> in two .
The patients had documented or suspected <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> , resulting in nephrocalcinosis in one and in prenatal liver and spleen calcifications in another .
AHC presents most often either as an isolated abnormality , caused by mutations in the DAX1 gene , or as part of an Xp21 contiguous gene syndrome , caused by a deletion of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy , glycerol kinase , and DAX1 genes .
All three patients with the IMAGe association had normal creatine kinase levels and no evidence of glycerol kinase deficiency .
Sequence analysis of DNA from these patients revealed no mutation in the DAX1- or steroidogenic factor-1-coding sequences , nor was a deletion of DAX1 detected .
Identification of the molecular basis of the IMAGe association will give new insight into the pathogenesis of this syndromic relationship involving bone , adrenal cortical , and pituitary development .
Neuroacanthocytosis .
A clinical , haematological and pathological study of 19 cases .
Nineteen cases are described , including 12 cases from three different families and 7 nonfamilial cases , in which multisystem neurological disease was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> in peripheral blood and normal plasma lipoproteins .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> can easily be overlooked , and scanning electron microscopy may be helpful .
Some neurologically asymptomatic relatives with significant <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> were identified during family screening , including some who were clinically affected .
The mean age of onset was 32 ( range 8-62 ) yrs and the clinical course was usually progressive but there was marked phenotypic variation .
Cognitive impairment , psychiatric features and organic <START:PHENOTYPE> personality change <END> occurred in over half the cases , and more than one-third had <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Orofaciolingual involuntary movements and pseudobulbar disturbance commonly caused <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> that was sometimes severe , but biting of the lips or tongue was rarely seen .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Chorea <END> was seen in almost all symptomatic cases but <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tics <END> , involuntary vocalizations and akinetic-rigid features also occurred .
Two cases had no movement disorder at all . Computerized tomography often demonstrated cerebral atrophy.
<START:PHENOTYPE> Caudate atrophy <END> was seen less commonly , and nonspecific focal and symmetric signal abnormalities from the caudate or lentiform nuclei were seen by magnetic resonance imaging in 3 out of 4 cases .
Depression or absence of tendon reflexes was noted in 13 cases and neurophysiological abnormalities often indicated an axonal neuropathy.
Sural nerve biopsies from 3 cases showed evidence of a chronic axonal <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> with prominent regenerative activity , predominantly affecting the large diameter myelinated fibres .
Serum creatine kinase activity was increased in 11 cases but without clinical evidence of a myopathy.
Postmortem neuropathological examination in 1 case revealed extensive neuronal loss and gliosis affecting the corpus striatum , pallidum , and the substantia nigra , especially the pars reticulata .
The cerebral cortex appeared spared and the spinal cord showed no evidence of anterior horn cell loss .
Two examples of the McLeod phenotype , an X-linked abnormality of expression of Kell blood group antigens , were identified in a single family and included 1 female .
The genetics of neuroacanthocytosis are unclear and probably heterogeneous , but the available pedigree data and the association with the McLeod phenotype suggest that there may be a locus for this disorder on the short arm of the X chromosome .
Warburg Micro syndrome in a Turkish boy .
We report a 4-year-old Turkish boy with Warburg Micro syndrome born to consanguineous parents .
He had <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deep-set eyes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , prominent ears and nasal root , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , hypertrichosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic diplegia <END> , skin hyperextensibility and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogenitalism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral atrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of corpus callosum <END> and cerebellum .
Sequence analysis of exon 8 of the RAB3GAP gene has confirmed the presence of a splice donor mutation ( 748 +1G>A ) in the homozygous state .
Skin hyperextensibility and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> in the affected child have not been reported in Warburg Micro syndrome cases to date .
This report compares the symptoms and features of the case with previously reported cases of Warburg Micro syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> : a distinctive clinical syndrome .
We report on two patients who have a <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and recurrent cerebral insults that resemble strokes ( MELAS ) .
These two and nine other reported patients share the following features : ragged red fibers evident on muscle biopsy , normal early development , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , seizures , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hemiparesis <END> , hemianopia , or <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical blindness <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lactic acidemia <END> is a common finding .
We believe that MELAS represents a distinctive syndrome and that it can be differentiated from two other clinical disorders that also are associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> and cerebral disease : Kearns-Say re syndrome and the myoclonus epilepsy ragged red fiber syndrome .
Existing information suggests that MELAS is transmitted by maternal inheritance .
The ragged red fibers suggest an abnormality of the electron transport system , but the precise biochemical disorders in these three clinical syndromes remain to be elucidated .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizure <END> frequency in adults with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> is a characteristic feature of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome ( WHS ) with onset usually in the first 2 years of life .
There have been several reports of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ceasing as children get older .
We have inspected a register of WHS cases from the UK and identified 27 adults with the condition ; their mean age was 24.8 years ( range 17-40 years ) .
We conducted a telephone survey and asked parents to comment on their experience of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in WHS .
In 18 patients ( 66% ) a <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> had not occurred within 3 years .
The mean age of those who have been <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> free for over 3 years was 23.7 years ( range 17-33 years ) whereas for those who had a recent <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> their mean age was 27. 1 years ( range 17-40 years ) .
The mean age of the last <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> for those who were <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> free for 3 years was 11 .3 years ( range 2-28 years ) ; in the majority of patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ceased within childhood years .
Many parents commented that <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were precipitated by fever .
Individuals with WHS who had a deletion were more likely to be <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> free than those with a translocation .
This reached statistical significance : chi(2 ) = 4.6 , P = 0.03 , odds ratio = 6.5 ( 95 % CI 1 .1-38 .6 ) .
Data from this survey may be helpful when counseling families with a very young child with WHS .

Autosomal recessively inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> .
A new form of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> affecting females as severely as males .
A new form of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> , autosomal recessively inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> ( AROA) , was studied in seven females and two males from five unrelated Caucasian kindreds .
Affected patients have the <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired vision <END> , translucent irides , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , albinotic fundi with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia of the fovea <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> that are also found in X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> ( XOA ) .
Unlike XOA , however , this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait , with females affected as severely as males .
Obligate heterozygotes of AROA lack the ocular abnormalities that are present in females heterozygous for XOA .
Also , skin and hairbulb biopsy specimens do not reveal any abnormalities in patients with AROA , whereas giant pigment granules are found in patients heterozygous and hemizygous for XOA .
The recognition of this disorder is imperative for proper diagnosis and responsible genetic counseling .
Neuroserpin mutation S52R causes neuroserpin accumulation in neurons and is associated with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Mutations in the Neuroserpin gene have been reported to cause familial presenile <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
We describe a new family in which the S52R Neuroserpin mutation is associated with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in 2 siblings .
The proband presented <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> at age 24 , his brother and mother presented a similar disorder when they were 25 .
A clinical diagnosis of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> was made on the proband and his brother .
Skin and liver biopsies did not reveal the presence of cytological alterations in the proband .
His neurological status worsened over the subsequent 19 yr during which he became demented and had uncontrollable <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
He died at 43 yr of age from aspiration pneumonia .
Neuropathologically , eosinophilic bodies , which were positive for periodic acid-Schiff and immunoreactive with antibodies against human neuroserpin , were present in the perikarya and cell processes of the neurons .
They were found in large numbers in the cerebral cortex and substantia nigra and to a lesser extent , in most subcortical gray areas , spinal cord , and dorsal root ganglia .
By electron microscopy , the intracytoplasmic bodies were contained within the membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum .
Occasionally neuroserpin immunopositivity was seen throughout the cytoplasm , even without the presence of well-defined bodies .
Our study characterizes for the first time the neuropathologic phenotype associated with hereditary progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> caused by the S52R Neuroserpin mutation .
Cohen syndrome resulting from a novel large intragenic COH1 deletion segregating in an isolated Greek island population .
Cohen syndrome , caused by mutations in the COH1 gene , is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , growth delay , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> chorioretinal dystrophy <END> , facial anomalies , slender limbs with <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow hands <END> and feet , <START:PHENOTYPE> tapered fingers <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphosis <END> and/or scoliosis , pectus carinatum , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> , pes calcaneovalgus , and , variably , truncal <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .
Here , we describe the clinical and molecular findings in 14 patients from an isolated Greek island population .
The clinical phenotype was fairly homogeneous , although <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> was not constant , and some patients had severe visual disability .
All patients were homozygous for a novel intragenic COH1 deletion spanning exon 6 to exon 16 , suggesting a founder effect .
The discovery of this mutation has made carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis possible in this population .

Diagnostic value of ophthalmologic findings in myotonic dystrophy : comparison with risks calculated by haplotype analysis of closely linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms .
To determine diagnostic value of <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> in myotonic dystrophy ( DM) , we examined 98 at-risk members of 9 DM kindreds .
Haplotype analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLPs ) using ApoC2 , CKMM , and pEFD4.2 supported the diagnosis of DM in 33 and excluded the diagnosis in 51 members .
The sensitivities of bilateral iridescent <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> , posterior cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> , orbicularis oculi weakness , low intraocular pressure , ptosis , and ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> were 46 .7 , 5 0.0 , 60.6 , 59 .3 , 51 .5 , and 3.0% , while their specificities were 10 0.0 , 10 0.0 , 98.0 , 94 .1 , 96 .1 , and 10 0.0% , respectively .
A peripheral pigmentary degeneration and central macular lesions of retina were not found on indirect fundoscopy .
In 86.2% of DM patients , bilateral iridescent <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> , posterior cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> , or both were present .
Unilateral iridescent <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> occurred in only 3 of our DM patients , and 2 of non-DM relatives showed a few unilateral iridescent particles .
Posterior cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> in DM patients always affected both eyes in this series .
We conclude that 1 ) bilateral iridescent <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> and posterior cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> are highly specific for DM and useful for establishing clinical diagnosis of DM , 2 ) unilateral iridescent <START:PHENOTYPE> lens opacities <END> are infrequent in DM and are seen in some non-DM members , and 3 ) ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myotonia <END> and clinical retinopathies are rare in DM .
Oculopharyngodistal myopathy is a distinct entity : clinical and genetic features of 47 patients .
Oculopharyngodistal myopathy ( OPDM ) has been reported as a rare , adult-onset hereditary muscle disease with putative <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Patients with OPDM present with progressive ocular , pharyngeal , and distal limb muscle involvement .
The genetic defect causing OPDM has not been elucidated .
Clinical and genetic findings of 47 patients from 9 unrelated Turkish families diagnosed with OPDM at the Department of Neurology , Istanbul Faculty of Medicine , between 1982 and 2009 were evaluated .
The mean age at onset was around 22 years .
Both <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> traits were observed , without any clear difference in clinical phenotype or severity .
The most common initial symptom was <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , followed by oropharyngeal symptoms and distal weakness , which started after the fifth disease year .
Intrafamilial variability of disease phenotype and severity was notable in the largest <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> family .
Atypical presentations , such as absence of limb weakness in long-term follow-up in 9 , proximal predominant weakness in 4 , and asymmetric <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> in 3 patients , were observed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Swallowing difficulty <END> was due to oropharyngeal <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> with myopathic origin .
Serum creatine kinase levels were slightly increased and EMG revealed myopathic pattern with occasional myotonic discharges .
Myopathologic findings included rimmed and autophagic vacuoles and chronic myopathic changes .
Importantly , a considerable proportion of patients developed <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory muscle weakness <END> while still ambulant .
Linkage to the genetic loci for all known muscular dystrophies , and for distal and myofibrillar myopathies , was excluded in the largest <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> OPDM families .
We suggest that OPDM is a clinically and genetically distinct myopathy.
Salmeterol for the prevention of high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> .
Pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> results from a persistent imbalance between forces that drive water into the air space and the physiologic mechanisms that remove it .
Among the latter , the absorption of liquid driven by active alveolar transepithelial sodium transport has an important role ; a defect of this mechanism may predispose patients to pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> .
Beta-adrenergic agonists up-regulate the clearance of alveolar fluid and attenuate pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> in animal models .
In a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled study , we assessed the effects of prophylactic inhalation of the beta-adrenergic agonist salmeterol on the incidence of pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> during exposure to high altitudes ( 455 9 m , reached in less than 22 hours ) in 37 subjects who were susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> .
We also measured the nasal transepithelial potential difference , a marker of the transepithelial sodium and water transport in the distal airways , in 33 mountaineers who were prone to high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> and 33 mountaineers who were resistant to this condition .
Prophylactic inhalation of salmeterol decreased the incidence of high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> in susceptible subjects by more than 50 percent , from 74 percent with placebo to 33 percent ( P= 0.02 ) .
The nasal potential-difference value under low-altitude conditions was more than 30 percent lower in the subjects who were susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> than in those who were not susceptible ( P< 0.001 ) .
Prophylactic inhalation of a beta-adrenergic agonist reduces the risk of high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> .
Sodium-dependent absorption of liquid from the airways may be defective in patients who are susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> .
These findings support the concept that sodium-driven clearance of alveolar fluid may have a pathogenic role in pulmonary <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> in humans and therefore represent an appropriate target for therapy .
Homozygosity mapping of spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> and peripheral neuropathy to 9q33-34 , and with <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> and optic atrophy to 6p21-23.
With the availability of a simple molecular test that distinguishes Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , the most frequent form of inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , from other recessive ataxias , it now becomes possible to unravel the genetic heterogeneity of the latter .
We have now localised two genes causing <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> in two consanguineous families .
In the first family , the four affected Japanese sibs had spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> associated with elevated levels of serum creatine kinase , gamma-globulin , and alpha-foetoprotein .
Homozygosity over a 20 cM region allowed to demonstrate linkage at 9q33.3-34.3 with a lod score of 3.0 . Genotyping two unrelated Japanese patients from first degree consanguineous parents revealed that one was homozygous for the same region but did not share the biochemical features .
In the second family , an Israeli uncle and a niece were affected by an early-onset recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and subsequently developed <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> and optic atrophy.
Homozygosity over a 17 cM region allowed demonstration of linkage at 6p21-23 with a lod score of 3.25 . These two localisations of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> genes represent a first step toward the identification of genetically homogenous , non-Friedreich , ataxic patients and subsequent cloning of the genes .
Glomerular basement membrane attenuation in familial nephritis and " benign " <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Lamination of the basement membrane has been considered to be the lesion characteristic of familial nephritis and attenuation to be the lesion of " Benign " familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Electron micrographs were reviewed of 57 children who had renal biopsies for persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Attenuation or lamination of the glomerular capillary basement membrane was found in each .
Twenty of the 57 children had familial nephritis ; 20 had familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> ; and 17 had no involved relatives .
Follow-up data were available for 14 of 20 children with familial nephritis , 12 of 20 with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , and 12 of 17 with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> for 13.6 +/- 6.3 , 6.7 +/- 4.6 , and 7. 0 +/- 4.8 years , respectively , after discovery of <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Five children developed end-stage renal disease : three with familial nephritis , one with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> , and one with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Only two no longer had <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> .
Attenuation of the glomerular capillary basement membrane was seen in every biopsy , whereas lamination was not .
Because <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> and ultrastructural abnormalities were findings shared by all the children , we suggest the possibility that familial nephritis , and familial or sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> hematuria <END> as defined in this study , may be variations in a spectrum of inherited abnormality or abnormalities in the formation of the glomerular capillary basement membrane .
Familial renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> : a genetic reappraisal of hexose transport by kidney and intestine .
Renal glucose titration studies were carried out in 10 members of two pedigrees with familial renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> to test the accepted hypothesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> and to investigate the genetic significance of " type A " and " type B " renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> .
In one family , a brother and sister each had a moderately reduced threshold and tubular maximum for glucose ( type A) , but both of their parents reabsorbed glucose normally .
In the second family , two brothers had severe type A renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> , their mother and one brother had a mild type A defect , and another brother demonstrated a reduced threshold , an exaggerated splay , and a normal tubular maximum , indicative of type B glycosuria.Hexose transport by intestinal mucosa was also investigated in controls and in the three brothers with the most severe renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> .
D-glucose-(14 ) C and 3-O-methylglucose-(14 ) C were accumulated by jejunal mucosa from controls by processes which were saturable and concentrative .
No differences in hexose transport were observed in the patients with renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> .
We conclude that familial renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> can be inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait ; that mild and severe type A renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> and type B renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> can occur in the same pedigree ; and that defective reabsorption of glucose by the kidney need not be accompanied by abnormalities in intestinal glucose transport .
These findings indicate that glucose transport in the gut and kidney are not mediated by identical mechanisms , and that several different mutations are responsible for the phenotypic variability in familial renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> .
The clinical picture of the BÃ¶rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome in males and heterozygous females with PHF6 mutations .
The usual description of the BÃ¶rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome ( BFLS ) is that of a rare , X-linked , partially dominant condition with severe intellectual disability , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse facial features <END> , long ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tapering fingers <END> , and shortened toes .
Recently , mutations have been identified in the PHF6 gene in nine families with this syndrome .
The clinical history and physical findings in the affected males reveal that the phenotype is milder and more variable than previously described and evolves with age .
Generally , in the first year , the babies are floppy , with failure to thrive , big ears , and small external genitalia .
As schoolboys , the picture is one of learning problems , moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , with emerging <START:PHENOTYPE> truncal obesity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> .
Head circumferences are usually normal , and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> may be seen .
Big ears and small genitalia remain .
The toes are short and fingers tapered and malleable .
In late adolescence and adult life , the classically described heavy facial appearance emerges .
Some heterozygous females show milder clinical features such as <START:PHENOTYPE> tapering fingers <END> and shortened toes .
Twenty percent have significant learning problems , and 95 % have skewed X inactivation .
We conclude that this syndrome may be underdiagnosed in males in their early years and missed altogether in isolated heterozygous females .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> tRNA( Leu( UUR) ) mutation in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ( MELAS ) : genetic , biochemical , and morphological correlations in skeletal muscle .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ( MELAS ) has recently been associated with an A----G transition at position 3243 within the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> tRNA( Leu( UUR) ) gene .
Besides altering the tRNA( Leu( UUR) ) sequence , this point mutation lies within a DNA segment responsible for transcription termination of the rRNA genes .
We have studied the distribution and expression of mutant mtDNAs in muscle biopsies from MELAS patients .
Histochemical , immunohistochemical , and single-fiber PCR analysis showed that <START:PHENOTYPE> ragged-red fibers <END> ( RRF ) are associated both with high levels of mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genomes ( greater than 85 % mutant mtDNA ) and with a partial cytochrome c oxidase deficiency .
By quantitative in situ hybridization , the steady-state ratios of mRNAs :rRNAs were found to be similar to controls in six of eight patients studied .
In two other patients the relative levels of heavy-strand mRNAs were slightly increased , but a patient with myoclonic epilepsy and RRF also exhibited a similar increase .
These results directly correlate the A----G transition at mtDNA position 3243 with muscle <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> proliferation , partial respiratory-chain impairment , decreased mitochondrially synthesized protein content , and no specific alterations in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> ratios of mRNAs :rRNAs .
The Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome in fetuses .
Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome ( WHS ) with partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4 has been exceptionally diagnosed in fetuses .
We report prenatal diagnosis of five cases of monosomy 4p .
The fetuses were karyotyped for severe <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> ( IUGR ) diagnosed on routine ultrasound ( US ) .
In addition , cleft-lip and palate and <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> respectively were found in two cases .
The quantity of amniotic fluid was normal in all cases .
At autopsy , the fetuses showed the typical craniofacial dysmorphy but without <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
Major renal hypoplasia was the only constant visceral anomaly .
Midline fusion defects were observed in all the fetuses , ranging from minor abnormalities such as <START:PHENOTYPE> scalp defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , pulmonary isomerism , common mesentery , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sacral dimple <END> , to <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> corpus callosum agenesis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> .
On post-mortem X-rays , a <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> was always observed .
All the placentae were hypotrophic , and two exhibited vascular lesions , although there was no maternal hypertension .
Chromosomal studies showed that the breakpoints were within the 4p16 band in three cases , the 4p15 band in one case , and the 4p14 band in one case .
The deletion was de novo in four cases , and resulted from a paternal translocation in one case .
This study emphasizes the importance of karyotyping all fetuses with IUGR , especially when the quantity of amniotic fluid is normal , and suggests the possibility of recognizing on US the particular phenotype of WHS in utero .
Clinical phenotype of juvenile-onset primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> linked to chromosome 1q . Recent reports have suggested that a gene responsible for juvenile-onset primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> exists on the long arm of chromosome 1 ( 1q ) .
This report describes a previously unpublished family ( UM:JG3 ) in which juvenile-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is segregating in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> manner .
The clinical features in this family were compared with those seen in other pedigrees with this condition .
Linkage analysis was performed to evaluate whether a glaucoma-causing gene in UM:JG3 is linked to genetic markers on chromosome 1q . Affected family members , their siblings , children , and spouses were examined to identify the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Linkage studies were performed using short tandem repeat polymorphisms from chromosome 1q . Results of these studies were compared with those found for other families in which juvenile-onset primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is linked genetically to the same chromosome 1q region .
The UM:JG3 family includes 22 affected individuals over five generations , including 12 still living .
The average age at diagnosis for living affected individuals was 26 years .
An association between <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> was observed in this family , but the <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> was not associated with iris processes or other structural anomalies .
The clinical course of disease and response to treatment were similar to other families with this disease .
The disease phenotype in this family is linked to markers on chromosome 1q with a maximum lod score of 3.52 at a recombination fraction of 0.00 for marker D1S433 .
Haplotype analysis suggests the gene responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in this family is located in an 8-cM region between markers D1S445 and D1S218 .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in UM:JG3 is linked to markers on chromosome 1q , with a candidate interval smaller than that in previous reports .
In individuals with juvenile-onset open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> linked to chromosome 1q , the phenotype can range from mild ocular hypertension to blindness , resulting from marked elevations in intraocular pressure , with age at diagnosis ranging from 6 to 62 years .
However , most affected individuals display a characteristic phenotype that includes onset in the first three decades of life , unusually high intraocular pressures , and the need for surgical therapy to prevent loss of vision .
Whether differences in expression among families is due to allelic heterogeneity remains to be determined .
A family with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> linked to the OPA2 locus Xp11 .4-Xp11 .2 .
Autosomal dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( ADOA ) is the most common inherited optic atrophy.
Clinical features of ADOA include a slowly progressive bilateral loss of visual acuity , constriction of peripheral visual fields , central scotomas , and color vision abnormalities .
Although ADOA is the most commonly inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , autosomal recessive , <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> , mitochondrial , and sporadic forms have also been reported .
Four families with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( XLOA ) were previously described .
One family was subsequently linked to Xp11 .4-Xp11 .2 ( OPA2 ) .
This investigation studied one multi-generation family with an apparently <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked form <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and compared their clinical characteristics with those of the previously described families , and determined whether this family was linked to the same genetic locus .
Fifteen individuals in a three-generation Idaho family underwent complete eye examination , color vision testing , automated perimetry , and fundus photography.
Polymorphic markers were used to genotype each individual and to determine linkage .
Visual acuities ranged from 20/30 to 20/10 0 .
All affected subjects had significant optic nerve pallor .
Obligate female carriers were clinically unaffected .
Preliminary linkage analysis ( LOD score = 1.8 ) revealed that the disease gene localized to the OPA2 locus on Xp11 .4-Xp11 .2 .
Four forms of inherited optic neuropathy , ADOA , autosomal recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> ( Costeff Syndrome ) , Leber hereditary optic neuropathy , and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction .
Future identification of the XLOA gene will reveal whether this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> is also associated with a mitochondrial defect .
Identification of the XLOA gene will advance our understanding of the inherited optic neuropathies and perhaps suggest treatments for these diseases .
An improved understanding of inherited optic neuropathies may in turn advance our understanding of acquired optic nerve diseases , such as glaucoma and ischemic optic neuropathy.

Congenital generalized lipodystrophy , type 4 ( CGL4 ) associated with myopathy due to novel PTRF mutations .
Congenital generalized lipodystrophy ( CGL ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by near total absence of body fat since birth with predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , diabetes , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> .
Three CGL loci , AGPAT2 , BSCL2 , and CAV1 , have been identified previously .
Recently , mutations in polymerase I and transcript release factor ( PTRF ) were reported in five Japanese patients presenting with myopathy and CGL ( CGL4 ) .
We report novel PTRF mutations and detailed phenotypes of two male and three female patients with CGL4 belonging to two pedigrees of Mexican origin ( CGL71 0 0 and CGL178 ) and one pedigree of Turkish origin ( CGL180 ) .
All patients had near total loss of body fat and congenital myopathy manifesting as weakness , percussion-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle mounding <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> high serum creatine kinase <END> levels .
Four of them had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> .
Three of them had atlantoaxial instability .
Two patients belonging to CGL178 pedigree required surgery for <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> in the first month of life .
None of them had <START:PHENOTYPE> prolonged QT interval <END> on electrocardiography but both siblings belonging to CGL7100 had exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias .
Three of them had mild <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthosis nigricans <END> but had normal glucose tolerance .
Two of them had <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> .
All patients had novel null mutations in PTRF gene .
In conclusion , mutations in PTRF result in a novel phenotype that includes generalized lipodystrophy with mild metabolic derangements , myopathy , cardiac arrhythmias , atlantoaxial instability , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> .
It is unclear how mutations in PTRF , which plays an essential role in formation of caveolae , affect a wide variety of tissues resulting in a variable phenotype .

Mutations in CIZ1 cause <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> primary <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> .
Primary dystonia is usually of <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> , can be familial , and frequently involves the cervical musculature .
Our goal was to identify the causal mutation in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> , primary <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> .
Linkage and haplotype analyses were combined with solution-based whole-exome capture and massively parallel sequencing in a large Caucasian pedigree with <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> , primary <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> to identify a cosegregating mutation .
High-throughput screening and Sanger sequencing were completed in 308 Caucasians with familial or sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> and matching controls for sequence variants in this mutant gene .
Exome sequencing led to the identification of an exonic splicing enhancer mutation in exon 7 of CIZ1 ( c.79 0A>G , p.S264G ) , which encodes CIZ1 , Cip1-interacting zinc finger protein 1 . CIZ1 is a p21( Cip1/ Waf1 ) -interacting zinc finger protein expressed in brain and involved in DNA synthesis and cell-cycle control .
Using a minigene assay , we showed that c.79 0A> G altered CIZ1 splicing patterns .
The p.S264 G mutation also altered the nuclear localization of CIZ1 .
Screening in subjects with adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> identified 2 additional CIZ1 missense mutations ( p.P47S and p.R672M ) .
Mutations in CIZ1 may cause <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> , primary <START:PHENOTYPE> cervical dystonia <END> , possibly by precipitating neurodevelopmental abnormalities that manifest in adults and/or G1/ S cell-cycle dysregulation in the mature central nervous system .

Skeletal muscle contractile gene ( TN NT3 , MYH3 , TPM2 ) mutations not found in <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical talus <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
Arthrogryposis presents with lower limb contractures that resemble <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical talus <END> .
Recently , mutations in skeletal muscle contractile genes MYH3 ( myosin heavy chain 3) , TNNT3 ( troponin T3 ) , and TPM2 ( tropomyosin 2 ) were identified in patients with distal arthrogryposis DA2A ( Freeman-Sheldon syndrome ) or DA2B ( Sheldon-Hall syndrome ) .
We asked whether the contractile genes responsible for distal arthrogryposis are also responsible for cases of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical talus <END> .
We determined the frequency of MYH3 , TN NT3 , and TPM2 mutations in patients with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical talus <END> , and distal arthrogryposis type 1 ( DA1 ) .
We resequenced the coding exons of the MYH3 , TN NT3 , and TPM2 genes in 31 patients ( five with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical talus <END> , 20 with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> , and six with DA1 ) .
Variants were evaluated for segregation with disease in additional family members , and the frequency of identified variants was determined in a control population .
In one individual with DA1 , we identified a de novo TNNT3 mutation ( R63H ) previously identified in an individual with DA2 B.
No other causative mutations were identified , though we found several previously undescribed single-nucleotide polymorphisms of unknown importance .
Although mutations in MYH3 , TN NT3 , and TPM2 are frequently associated with distal arthrogryposis syndromes , they were not present in patients with familial <START:PHENOTYPE> vertical talus <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
The TNNT3 R63H recurrent mutation identified in two unrelated individuals may be associated with either DA1 or DA2 B.

Expanding the clinical and neuroradiologic phenotype of primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> due to ASPM mutations .
To determine the spectrum of clinical , neuropsychological , and neuroradiologic features in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> primary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( MCPH ) due to ASPM gene mutations .
ASPM was sequenced in 52 unrelated MCPH probands .
In patients with ASPM mutations , we evaluated the clinical phenotype , cognition , behavior , brain MRI , and family .
We found homozygous or compound heterozygous ASPM loss-of-function mutations in 11 ( 22% ) probands and 5 siblings .
The probands harbored 18 different mutations , of which 16 were new .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> was severe after 1 year of age in all 16 patients , although in 4 patients the occipital-frontal circumference ( OFC ) at birth was decreased by only 2 SD .
The OFC Z score consistently decreased after birth .
Late-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> occurred in 3 patients and significant pyramidal tract involvement in 1 patient .
Intellectual quotients ranged from borderline-normal to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> motor delay <END> was noted in 7/16 patients .
Language development was delayed in all patients older than 3 years .
Brain MRI ( n = 12 ) showed a simplified gyral pattern in 9 patients and several malformations including ventricle enlargement ( n = 7) , partial <START:PHENOTYPE> corpus callosum agenesis <END> ( n = 3) , mild cerebellar hypoplasia ( n = 1 ) , focal <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical dysplasia <END> ( n = 1 ) , and unilateral polymicrogyria ( n = 1 ) . Non-neurologic abnormalities consisted of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> ( n = 1 ) , idiopathic premature puberty ( n = 1 ) , and renal dysplasia ( n = 1 ) .
We provide a detailed description of features associated with ASPM mutations .
Borderline <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> at birth , borderline-normal intellectual efficiency , and brain malformations can occur in ASPM-related primary hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , and renal disease in relatives of Bardet-Biedl syndrome sibs .
The Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by pigmentary retinopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , polydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Renal abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , acquired heart disease , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic fibrosis <END> also occur in homozygotes .
Two adult Bardet-Biedl sibs , a man with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and cardiomegaly and a woman with biliary cirrhosis , and 75 relatives in 5 generations of the extended family were identified .
Hospital records for major illnesses , death certificates , and autopsy reports were examined .
The frequent observation of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , and renal disease in first-degree relatives , obligate gene carriers , and other blood relatives raise the possibility that Bardet-Biedl heterozygotes are also predisposed to these disorders .
Puberty and genetic susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in a case-control study in twins .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Breast cancer <END> is thought to result from excessive cumulative exposure to ovarian hormones .
Different predictors of hereditary and sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> suggest different pathogenic mechanisms .
Affected twin pairs may help to illustrate such differences .
We obtained information from 1811 pairs of female twins , one or both of whom had <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
The pairs were stratified according to concordance or discordance for <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , zygosity , the presence or absence of a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , and the presence of bilateral or unilateral disease .
Disease-concordant monozygotic pairs were assumed to have a higher genetic susceptibility than other subgroups of pairs .
Paired twins were compared with respect to age at puberty and other factors .
We calculated adjusted odds ratios for the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> when only one twin was affected and for the first of the two diagnoses when both were affected .
Within disease-discordant monozygotic pairs , the twin with an earlier onset of puberty did not have an increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> ( adjusted odds ratio , 0.8 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.6 to 1.2 ) .
Within disease-concordant monozygotic pairs , the twin with earlier puberty was much more likely to receive the diagnosis first ( adjusted odds ratio , 5.4 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 2.0 to 14.5 ) .
In contrast , a later first pregnancy , lower parity , and later menopause within the pair were associated with an increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> when one twin was affected but did not predict an earlier diagnosis when both were affected .
Within the most genetically susceptible subgroup of twin pairs , the strong influence of earlier puberty on the age at the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and the absence of linkage to hormonal milestones later in life suggest that most cases of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> are not related to cumulative hormone exposure and that they may instead result from an unusual sensitivity to pubertal hormones .
Associations between <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> and early menarche and those with reproductive milestones in adulthood may reflect different genotypes .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> nocturnal frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> : demonstration of focal frontal onset and intrafamilial variation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> nocturnal frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ( ADNFLE ) is a newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
We studied <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> localization and intrafamilial variation using video-EEG monitoring ( VEM ) and functional neuroimaging in two pairs of subjects from unrelated families .
The clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were similar from <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> to <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> in each individual , but varied between individuals .
As is often found in frontal lobe epilepsies , ictal EEG localization was imprecise in three of four cases .
One patient showed a consistent left fronto-polar onset that was corroborated by congruent focal hypometabolism on interictal PET and focal hyperperfusion on ictal single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) .
A second case studied with ictal SPECT showed a right parasagittal , midfrontal focus .
We conclude that this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> syndrome , which in one of the two families was due to a known neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mutation , causes frontal lobe foci that are unilateral and in variable locations in different individuals .
Hypophosphataemic <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> and Fanconi syndrome of adult onset with dominant inheritance .
Possible relationship with diabetes mellitus .
Adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> with multiple renal tubular defects and generalized aminoaciduria is uncommon , and where familial it is characteristically an autosomal recessive disorder .
This paper describes a kindred in which the syndrome has appeared in four successive generations , apparently inherited in a dominant manner , and possibly associated with diabetes mellitus .
The proposita had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> , renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> and generalized aminoaciduria , and at the age of 22 developed symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> osteomalacia <END> which responded to treatment with oral phosphate .
Her father had been similarly affected : renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> was first noted when he was 24 , and 12 years later he developed diabetes mellitus from which he died .
One sister , aged 31 , has renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> , aminoaciduria and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> without bone disease .
In the three preceding generations at least seven other individuals had crippling bone disease and profound <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> of early adult onset ; in four , preterminal polydipsia was recorded , and others had renal <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> or diabetes mellitus .
Three of the five children in the latest generation have slight <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> but not other detectable abnormality .
The possible association between these renal tubular defects and diabetes mellitus is discussed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> granulomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> skin rash <END> , and synovial cysts .
In 1985 , Blau reported a family with 11 members in four generations affected by granulomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> iritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> skin rash <END> , and periarticular synovial cysts .
We report a second family with these abnormalities , thereby confirming this syndrome as a distinct familial entity with transmission compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Affected members in our family included a mother and two daughters .
Disease onset was at 10 months to 8 years of age .
Each had <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> , symmetric polyarthritis , and synovial cysts overlying the ankle and wrist joints .
In addition , both daughters had an <START:PHENOTYPE> intermittent generalized erythematous papular rash <END> that on biopsy revealed noncaseating granulomatous infiltration .
All three patients improved during alternate-day steroid therapy .
Recognition of this disorder as distinct from other , more common causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> is important because of the apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission and because of the excellent responses to low-dose steroid therapy .
Course of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> ( ARPKD ) in siblings : a clinical comparison of 20 sibships .
Forty-two children out of 20 sibships with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> were observed pro- and retrospectively over a mean period of 3.7 years in a long-term study on cystic kidney diseases in children .
The intra- and interfamilial variability in terms of age at diagnosis , administration of antihypertensive therapy , liver affection , and renal function were evaluated .
According to the 1971 subclassification of Blyth & Ockenden , defining different grades of severity , 12 patients were assigned to the perinatal , nine to the neonatal , 13 to the infantile , and eight to the juvenile subtype of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
In 11 of the 20 families different subtypes were observed among affected siblings .
In seven families , affected sibs belonged to adjacent subtypes , while major intrafamilial differences were observed in only four families .
The defined subtypes , therefore , cannot be regarded as appropriate in distinguishing genetic groups of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
With respect to the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> , there is a wide spectrum of phenotypic manifestations , ranging from stillbirths to mildly affected of phenotypic manifestations , ranging from stillbirths to mildly affected adults , while intrafamilial variability of the clinical picture is generally small with multiple allelism as the most likely genetic explanation .
Age at death , however , showed gross variation in eight sibships .
Differences in the clinical course between several siblings cannot be explained by a sex influence in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Neuroblastoma <END> screening at one year of age .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Neuroblastoma <END> is the second most common type of childhood tumor .
It is not known whether screening for <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> at one year of age reduces the incidence of metastatic disease or mortality due to <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> .
We offered urine screening for <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> at approximately one year of age to 2,581 ,188 children in 6 of 16 German states from 1995 to 2000 .
A total of 2 ,117 ,60 0 eligible children in the remaining states served as controls .
We compared the two groups in terms of the incidence of disseminated disease and mortality from <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> .
A total of 1 ,475 ,773 children ( 61 .2 percent of those who were born between July 1 , 1994 , and October 31 , 1999 ) underwent screening .
In this group , <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> was detected by screening in 149 children , of whom 3 have died .
Fifty-five children who had negative screening tests were subsequently given a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> ; 14 of these children have died .
The screened group and children in the control area had a similar incidence of stage 4 <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> ( 3.7 cases per 100,000 screened children [95 percent confidence interval , 2.7 to 4.7 ] and 3.8 per 100,000 controls [95 percent confidence interval , 2 .9 to 4.6] ) and a similar rate of death among children with <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> ( 1.3 deaths per 100,000 screened children [95 percent confidence interval , 0.7 to 1.8 ] and 1.2 per 100,000 controls [95 percent confidence interval , 0.7 to 1.7] ) . Comparison of the screened group and the children in the control area revealed substantial overdiagnosis in the former group ( an estimated rate of 7 cases per 100,000 children [95 percent confidence interval , 4.6 to 9.2] ) ; the overdiagnosis rate represents children who had <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> that was diagnosed by screening but who would not benefit from earlier diagnosis and treatment .
The present findings do not support the usefulness of general screening for <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> at one year of age .
Association between family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> in Parkinson disease . To identify familial risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> in patients with Parkinson disease ( PD ) .
Two hundred seventy-six outpatients with PD participated in the study .
The presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> was determined using a validated questionnaire , including items regarding the occurrence of visual , auditory , or other types of <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> .
Family history of PD and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> was determined by a structured interview and examination of medical records and affected family members .
Patients with young-onset PD ( <5 0 years ) who reported another PD patient among their siblings were tested for parkin mutations .
Stepwise logistic regression was applied for the detection of risk factors .
The regression model included a set of family history-related variables ( family history of PD and of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ) and a set of disease-related variables ( age , age at onset of PD , stage , duration of PD and of l-dopa therapy , l-dopa dose , and number of antiparkinsonian drugs ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hallucinations <END> were present in 32 % of the 276 patients .
Risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> included Mini-Mental State Examination score ( p < 0.0001 ) and positive family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> ( p = 0.0005 ) .
Family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores are risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> hallucinations <END> in Parkinson disease .
Emberger syndrome-primary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> myelodysplasia <END> : report of seven new cases .
Four reports have been published on an association between acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) and primary <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> , with or without congenital deafness .
We report seven new cases , including one extended family , confirming this entity as a genetic syndrome .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> typically presents in one or both lower limbs , before the hematological abnormalities , with onset between infancy and puberty and frequently affecting the genitalia .
The AML is often preceded by <START:PHENOTYPE> pancytopenia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> myelodysplasia <END> with a high incidence of monosomy 7 in the bone marrow ( five propositi and two relatives ) .
Associated anomalies included <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> , long <START:PHENOTYPE> tapering fingers <END> and/or neck webbing ( four patients) , recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> cellulitis <END> in the affected limb ( four patients) , generalized warts ( two patients) , and congenital , high frequency <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> ( one patient ) .
Children with lower limb and genital <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> should be screened for hematological abnormalities and immunodeficiency .

A variant of Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> characterized by recovery of vision and by an unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genetic etiology .
The Tas2 and Vic2 Australian families are affected with a variant of Leber hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> ( LHON ) .
The risk of developing the <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> shows strict maternal inheritance , and the ophthalmological changes in affected family members are characteristic of LHON .
However , in contrast to the common form of the disease , members of these two families show a high frequency of vision recovery .
To ascertain the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genetic etiology of the LHON in these families , both (a ) the the nucleotide sequences of the seven <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genes encoding subunits of respiratory-chain complex I and (b ) the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> cytochrome b gene were determined for representatives of both families .
Neither family carries any of the previously identified primary <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> LHON mutations : ND4/11778 , ND1/3460 , or ND1/416 0 .
Instead , both LHON families carry multiple nucleotide changes in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> complex I genes , which produce conservative amino acid changes .
From the available sequence data , it is inferred that the Vic2 and Tas2 LHON families are phylogenetically related to each other and to a cluster of LHON families in which mutations in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> cytochrome b gene have been hypothesized to play a primary etiological role .
However , sequencing analysis establishes that the Vic2 and Tas2 LHON families do not carry these cytochrome b mutations .
There are two hypotheses to account for the unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genetic etiology of the LHON in the Tas2 and Vic2 LHON families .
One possibility is that there is a primary LHON mutation within the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> genome but that it is at a site that was not included in the sequencing analyses .
Alternatively , the disease in these families may result from the cumulative effects of multiple secondary LHON mutations that have less severe phenotypic consequences .
Dermatosparaxis in children .
A case report and review of the newly recognized phenotype .
Dermatosparaxis is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> connective tissue disorder in animals that is caused by abnormal processing of type I procollagen and results in skin laxity and fragility .
Only three humans with characteristic biochemical and electronmicroscopic findings have been recognized to date .
We describe the clinical and electronmicroscopic findings in an affected boy who presented at birth with large full-thickness groin fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , large fontanelles , <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> , and dental laminal cysts .
He subsequently exhibited marked <START:PHENOTYPE> skin fragility <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> , increased <START:PHENOTYPE> bruisability <END> , and growth retardation .
The diagnosis of dermatosparaxis was made by electron-microscopic findings consisting of characteristic small , irregular , and circular collagen fibers in the skin .
His phenotype is strikingly similar to two other reported children with the disorder , which is now classified in humans as Ehlers-Danlos VII-C .
The newly recognized phenotype of Ehlers-Danlos VII-C is a distinct connective tissue disorder characterized by marked <START:PHENOTYPE> skin fragility <END> and laxity , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , increased <START:PHENOTYPE> bruisability <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> , and growth retardation .
A suspected clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by electron-microscopic and biochemical studies of connective tissue .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Encephalopathy <END> with intracerebral calcification , white matter lesions , <START:PHENOTYPE> growth hormone deficiency <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> : two sibs confirming a probably distinct entity .
Two sibs with an <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , including intracerebral calcification and white matter lesions , <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> owing to <START:PHENOTYPE> growth hormone deficiency <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> are reported .
The onset of the disease in both patients occurred with retardation of motor development during the first year of life .
Later , <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> , mental retardation , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> became apparent .
These cases probably represent some form of connatal leucodystrophy.
The differential diagnosis is discussed .
Familial hemiplegic <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> ( CADASIL ) .
Cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> ( CADASIL ) is a recently described familial cerebrovascular disorder shown to map to chromosome 19q12 .
Familial hemiplegic <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> has also been shown in some families to map close to the CADASIL locus .
The fully developed CADASIL phenotype consists of recurrent strokes developing in the fourth decade , progressing to a <START:PHENOTYPE> pseudobulbar palsy <END> , spastic quadriparesis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> subcortical dementia <END> .
In an Irish family 15 members were fully investigated by magnetic resonance scanning ; 10 had typical magnetic resonance features of CADASIL .
Five members of this family had familial hemiplegic <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> and 4 of these had magnetic resonance evidence of CADASIL .
Two other members had <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> with and without aura as a presenting clinical symptom of CADASIL .
This disorder has been shown by linkage analysis to map to the CADASIL locus at chromosome 19 .
The phenotype at presentation of CADASIL in this family was variable and age related and included familial hemiplegic <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine <END> with and without aura , transient ischemic attacks , strokes , and spinal cord infarction .
This family study increases our understanding of the spectrum of clinical manifestations of this underrecognized familial cerebrovascular disorder .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> with renal failure .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephrolithiasis <END> may occur as a consequence of a number of hereditary disorders .
We describe a large kindred from northern New York with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> accompanied by urinary concentrating defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , renal insufficiency , and renal wasting of potassium , phosphate , calcium , and uric acid .
The pattern of inheritance was established by examining the patients and their records and interviewing family members .
Selected members of the family were evaluated in detail , with measurements of erythrocyte cation fluxes and carbonic anhydrase ( carbonate dehydratase ) activity .
The kindred consisted of 162 family members from six generations .
All nine affected persons were male and appeared to have inherited the disease from their mothers .
No affected man transmitted the gene to a son , but the daughters of affected men were carriers .
The patients presented in childhood with calcium <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> and proteinuria , with progression to <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , urinary concentrating defects , and renal insufficiency .
Renal biopsies revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> tubular atrophy <END> , interstitial fibrosis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulosclerosis <END> ; the characteristic features of other forms of hereditary nephritis were absent .
Abnormalities in the renal excretion of calcium , phosphate , potassium , and uric acid were found only in the adult members of the kindred , although renal biopsies were abnormal even in younger members .
In one patient who has had a renal transplant for seven years , the disease has not recurred .
This kindred manifested an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> with renal failure , a new form of hereditary renal disease .
Most of the identifiable physiologic abnormalities occurred after the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrolithiasis <END> and renal insufficiency and may not be of pathogenetic importance .
Pitx1 haploinsufficiency causes <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> in humans and a clubfoot-like phenotype in mice .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Clubfoot <END> affects 1 in 1000 live births , although little is known about its genetic or developmental basis .
We recently identified a missense mutation in the PITX1 bicoid homeodomain transcription factor in a family with a spectrum of lower extremity abnormalities , including <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
Because the E130K mutation reduced PITX1 activity , we hypothesized that PITX1 haploinsufficiency could also cause <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
Using copy number analysis , we identified a 241 kb chromosome 5q31 microdeletion involving PITX1 in a patient with isolated familial <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
The PITX1 deletion segregated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> over three generations .
To study the role of PITX1 haploinsufficiency in <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> pathogenesis , we began to breed Pitx1 knockout mice .
Although Pitx1( + /- ) mice were previously reported to be normal , <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> was observed in 20 of 225 Pitx1( + /- ) mice , resulting in an 8 .9% penetrance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Clubfoot <END> was unilateral in 16 of the 20 affected Pitx1( + /- ) mice , with the right and left limbs equally affected , in contrast to right-sided predominant hindlimb abnormalities previously noted with complete loss of Pitx1 .
Peroneal artery hypoplasia occurred in the <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> limb and corresponded spatially with small lateral muscle compartments .
Tibial and fibular bone volumes were also reduced .
Skeletal muscle gene expression was significantly reduced in Pitx1( -/- ) E12 .5 hindlimb buds compared with the wild-type , suggesting that muscle hypoplasia was due to abnormal early muscle development and not disuse atrophy.
Our morphological data suggest that PITX1 haploinsufficiency may cause a developmental field defect preferentially affecting the lateral lower leg , a theory that accounts for similar findings in human <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
Fraser syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> : review of the diagnostic criteria and evidence for phenotypic modules in complex malformation syndromes .
Fraser syndrome is characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cutaneous syndactyly <END> , malformations of the larynx and genitourinary tract , craniofacial dysmorphism , orofacial clefting , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and musculoskeletal anomalies .
The inheritance is <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
No diagnostic cytogenetic abnormalities have been documented in affected patients , and no molecular genetic studies have been reported .
We have reviewed 117 cases diagnosed as Fraser syndrome or <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> published since the comprehensive review of Thomas et al in 1986 in order to validate the published diagnostic criteria and to delineate the phenotype associated with this syndrome .
Our series showed more females ( 57 / 117 ) than males and consanguinity was present in 29/119 ( 24.8% ) .
Eighty-eight patients satisfied the diagnostic criteria for Fraser syndrome ( 75% ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cryptophthalmos <END> was present in 103/117 ( 88% ) , syndactyly in 72 /117 ( 61 .5% ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> in 20/117 ( 17 .1% ) .
Ear malformations were recorded in 69 /117 ( 59% ) , and renal agenesis in 53 /117 ( 45 .3% ) .
Use of the published diagnostic criteria excluded several patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> and one or more physical feature(s ) consistent with Fraser syndrome .
The frequency of additional anomalies in our series was also higher than previously reported ( for example , imperforate anus or anal stenosis were found in 34/117 ( 29% ) compared with 2/124 ( 2% ) in the series of Thomas et al ( 1986 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal stenosis <END> or atresia was present in 7/ 117 ( 6% ) compared to 0/124.
These findings emphasise the clinical variability associated with Fraser syndrome and support genetic heterogeneity of the syndrome .
We also noted patterns of anomalies ( for example , <START:PHENOTYPE> bicornuate uterus <END> with imperforate anus or anal stenosis and renal malformations ) that are found in other syndromes and associations without <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptophthalmos <END> , suggesting that common modifier genes may explain some of the phenotypic variation in Fraser syndrome .
Further delineation of the C ( <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> ) syndrome .
This communication brings the number of recognized cases of the C ( <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> ) syndrome to 11 .
The pattern of findings includes an anomaly of the anterior cranium and frontal cortex ( trigonocephaly) , the root of the nose ( <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus <END> , and short nose) , and palate ( <START:PHENOTYPE> thick anterior alveolar ridges <END> ) ; abnormalities of the limbs ( polysyndactyly , bridged palmar creases , short limbs , and joint <START:PHENOTYPE> dislocations <END> and/or contractures ) ; visceral defects ( <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defects <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and abnormal lobulations of the lungs and kidneys ) .
Auricular , mandibular , skin , and genital abnormalities also occur .
Consistent neurological findings are hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> have been reported .
Normal chromosomes , normal parents with multiple affected offspring , equal sex ratio of affected individuals , and consanguineous matings all support <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> of the C syndrome .
In autopsied cases , there has been a suggestion of defective central nervous system myelination .
About 1/2 of the case have died within the first year .
All survivors have severe to profound mental retardation except for one child who has moderate retardation .
Familial cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> with a mutation in NOL3 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Myoclonus <END> is characterized by sudden , brief involuntary movements , and its presence is debilitating .
We identified a family suffering from <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> , cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> without associated seizures .
We performed clinical , electrophysiological , and genetic studies to define this phenotype .
A large , 4-generation family with a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> underwent careful questioning , examination , and electrophysiological testing .
Thirty-five family members donated blood samples for genetic analysis , which included single nucleotide polymorphism mapping , microsatellite linkage , targeted massively parallel sequencing , and Sanger sequencing .
In silico and in vitro experiments were performed to investigate functional significance of the mutation .
We identified 11 members of a Canadian Mennonite family suffering from <START:PHENOTYPE> adult onset <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> , disabling , multifocal <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> .
Somatosensory evoked potentials indicated a cortical origin of the <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> .
There were no associated seizures .
Some severely affected individuals developed signs of progressive cerebellar ataxia of variable severity late in the course of their illness .
The phenotype was inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion .
We demonstrated linkage to chromosome 16q21-22.1 .
We then sequenced all coding sequence in the critical region , identifying only a single cosegregating , novel , nonsynonymous mutation , which resides in the gene NOL3 .
Furthermore , this mutation was found to alter post-translational modification of NOL3 protein in vitro .
We propose that familial cortical <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> is a novel movement disorder that may be caused by mutation in NOL3 .
Further investigation of the role of NOL3 in neuronal physiology may shed light on neuronal membrane hyperexcitability and pathophysiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and related disorders .

Rare dental abnormalities seen in oculo-facio-cardio-dental ( OFCD ) syndrome : three new cases and review of nine patients .
Oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome is a very rare condition .
So far , only nine cases have been documented .
We report on three additional female patients representing the same entity .
The clinical findings were : <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , microphthalmia/microcornea , secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , vision impairment , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , long <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal tip <END> with separated cartilages , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , and skeletal anomalies .
The following dental abnormalities were found : radiculomegaly , delayed dentition , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> , root dilacerations ( extension ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> malocclusion <END> .
For the first time , fusion of teeth and hyperdontia of permanent upper teeth were seen .
In addition , structural and morphological dental changes were noted .
These findings expand the clinical spectrum of the syndrome .
Epidermal growth factor gene functional polymorphism and the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> in patients with cirrhosis .
Overexpression of epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) in the liver induces transformation to <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> in animal models .
Polymorphisms in the EGF gene modulate EGF levels .
To assess the relationship among human EGF gene single-nucleotide polymorphism , EGF expression , and risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> .
Molecular mechanisms linking the 61 * G allele polymorphism to EGF expression were examined in human <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> cell lines and human liver tissue .
A case-control study involving 207 patients with cirrhosis was conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital ( 1999-2006 ) and a validation case-control study involving 121 patients with cirrhosis was conducted at HÃ´pital Paul Brousse ( 1993-2006 ) .
Restriction fragment-length polymorphism was used to determine the EGF gene polymorphism genotype .
Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between the EGF polymorphism and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> risk .
Mechanisms by which the EGF gene polymorphism modulates EGF levels and associations among EGF gene polymorphism , EGF levels , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> .
Transcripts from the EGF 61 * G allele exhibited more than a 2-fold longer half-life than those from the 61 * A allele , and EGF secretion was 2.3-fold higher in G/G <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> cell lines than A/ A cell lines .
Serum EGF levels were 1.8-fold higher in G/G patients than A/ A patients , and liver EGF levels were 2.4-fold higher in G/G patients than A/ A patients .
Among the 207 patients with cirrhosis in the Massachusetts study population , 59 also had <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> .
Analysis of the distribution of allelic frequencies revealed that there was a 4-fold odds of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> in G/G patients compared with A/ A patients in the Massachusetts study population ( odds ratio , 4.0 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI] , 1.6-9.6 ; P = .002 ) .
Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the number of copies of G was significantly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> after adjusting for age , sex , race , etiology , and severity of cirrhosis ( G/G or A/ G vs A/ A ; hazard ratio , 3.49 ; 95 % CI , 1.29-9.44 ; P = .01 ) .
The significant association was validated in the French patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> .
The EGF gene polymorphism genotype is associated with risk for development of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> in liver cirrhosis through modulation of EGF levels .
Clinical characterization of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and recessive variants of Robinow syndrome .
Robinow syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> mesomelic limb shortening <END> associated with facial and genital anomalies that can be inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> or recessive mode .
We characterized these two variants clinically , with the aim of establishing clinical criteria to enhance the differential diagnosis between them or other similar conditions .
The frequencies of clinical signs considered important for the discrimination of the dominant or recessive variants were estimated in a sample consisting of 38 patients personally examined by the authors and of 50 affected subjects from the literature .
Using the presence of rib fusions as diagnostic of the recessive variant , and also based on the inheritance pattern in familial cases , we classified 37 patients as having the recessive form and other 51 as having the dominant form .
The clinical signs present in more than 75 % of patients with either form , and therefore the most important for the characterization of this syndrome were <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , nasal features ( large nasal bridge , short <START:PHENOTYPE> upturned nose <END> , and anteverted nares) , <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mesomelic limb shortening <END> , brachydactyly , clinodactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> .
Hemivertebrae and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> were present in more than 75 % of patients with the recessive form , but in less than 25% of patients with the dominant form .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Umbilical hernia <END> (32.3% ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> supernumerary teeth <END> (1 0.3% ) were found exclusively in patients with the dominant form .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Thrombocytopenia <END> identifies a severe familial phenotype of <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> and reveals genetic linkages at 1q22 and 11p13 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( SLE ) is a complicated autoimmune disease with a definite genetic predisposition .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Thrombocytopenia <END> predicts severe disease and death in SLE , making the identification of the related genetic risk factors especially important .
We selected the 38 pedigrees that had an SLE patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> ( platelets , < 10 x 10(9 ) / L [ < 100,000/microL] ) from a collection of 184 pedigrees multiplex for SLE .
Linkages were established at 1q22-23 ( maximum logarithm of odds [lod(max) ] = 3.71 ) in the 38 pedigrees and at 11p13 ( lod(max ) = 5.72 ) in the 13 African American pedigrees .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephritis <END> , serositis , neuropsychiatric involvement , autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic anemia <END> , anti-double-stranded DNA , and <START:PHENOTYPE> antiphospholipid antibody <END> were associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> .
Other results show that SLE is more severe in the families with a thrombocytopenic SLE patient , whether or not <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> in an individual patient is considered .
These results are consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> being a component of a severe familial form of SLE and with genes at 1q22-23 and 11p13 contributing to this severe phenotype and to the subsequent high mortality associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> in SLE .
G syndrome : an unusual family .
The G syndrome is a multiple congenital anomaly ( MCA ) syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , stridor , and <START:PHENOTYPE> swallowing difficulties <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cleft lip <END> and palate , cardiac defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> cranial asymmetry <END> , and bowel obstruction are occasional manifestations .
Family data suggest <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Males appear to have more serious manifestations , whereas most females with the G syndrome have a benign course and are ascertained through affected male relatives .
In the family reported here , the proposita was first seen at age 7 weeks because of <START:PHENOTYPE> swallowing difficulties <END> , stridor , and unusual facial appearance , reminiscent of the G syndrome .
Evaluation of the family showed striking facial changes in her father and all four of his sibs .
These five individuals had megalencephaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and a broad prominent nasal root and bridge , reminiscent of the facial appearance in the BBB syndrome .
There was no evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> , respiratory abnormality , or hoarse voice in any other relative .
These individuals with the G syndrome display two unusual manifestations .
There are no males with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> ; the proposita has the most severe laryngotracheoesophageal symptoms .
Although <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> is not an invariable manifestation of the G syndrome and although six females with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> or respiratory abnormalities have been reported previously , the manifestations in this family underline the variability of this condition and provide further support that the G syndrome can be expressed with equal severity in both males and females .
Although phenotypic overlap between the BBB and G syndromes has long been recognized , many still consider them to be distinct nosologic entities .
The occurrence of both BBB and G syndrome in different members of the same family has been observed previously.( ABSTR ACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Self-limited <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome of skin ulceration , arthroosteolysis with pseudoacromegaly , <START:PHENOTYPE> keratitis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> in a Kirghizian family .
We report on a previously apparently undescribed Puretic syndrome-like self-limited <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder with <START:PHENOTYPE> onset in infancy <END> and running its course by 11 yr in five sibs in a Kirghizian family with recurrent skin ulceration , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthralgias <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , fistulous <START:PHENOTYPE> osteolysis <END> around joints , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dystrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> keratitis <END> with visual impairment or blindess in three of the five affected sibs .
Affected hands and feet acquire a pseudoacromegalic appearance ; fingers become clawed ; involvement of growth plates around knees may lead to asymmetrical shortness with secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
Slow but normal healing during and after the course of the disease leaves severe cicatrization and chronic arthroses .
No other organ system is involved , intellect is normal , and health and reproductive capacity are otherwise unimpaired .
We propose the name Kirghizian dermatoosteolysis for this condition .
New phenotype associated with an Arg116Cys mutation in the CRYAA gene : nuclear <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> .
To describe a new phenotype with an arginine-to-cysteine mutation at position 116 ( Arg116 Cys ) in the CRYAA gene .
We investigated a 4-generation French family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and performed a genetic linkage analysis using microsatellite DNA markers encompassing 15 known <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> loci .
Exons 1 , 2 , and 3 and flanking intronic sequences of the CRYAA gene were amplified and analyzed using direct sequencing .
All of the affected individuals had nuclear <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> .
Genetic analysis revealed the previously described Arg116Cys mutation in the CRYAA gene in the heterozygous state in all of the affected members of the family but not in unaffected individuals .
To our knowledge , this is the first case to date in which an Arg116Cys mutation in the CRYAA gene was associated with nuclear <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> .
This study indicates that an Arg116Cys mutation in the CRYAA gene could be associated with an unusual phenotype in affected individuals .
In this family , the clinical observation of <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> allows for the possibility of identifying individuals carrying the mutation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Iris coloboma <END> is particularly important in terms of perinatal diagnosis because its detection in the newborn requires a careful and regular examination of the lens .
Long-term outcome in treated combined <START:PHENOTYPE> methylmalonic acidemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinemia <END> .
To describe the clinical and biochemical features and long-term outcome of a cohort of eight patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> methylmalonic acidemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> ( cblC ) .
Documentation of clinical features at birth and longitudinal follow-up of the biochemical and clinical response to treatment with daily oral carnitine and intramuscular hydroxocobalamin observed during continuous follow-up for an average of 5.7 years .
Our patients had an increased incidence of congenital malformations including <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> ( <5% ) at birth ( 2 of 8 ) , congenital heart disease ( 2 of 8 ) , dysmorphic facial features ( 1 of 8 ) , and thyroglossal duct cyst ( 1 of 8 ) .
Postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> ( 2 of 8 ) and hip dislocation caused by ligament laxity ( 1 of 8 ) were also noted .
One patient had profound <START:PHENOTYPE> visual impairment <END> before 6 months of age secondary to cblC <START:PHENOTYPE> retinopathy <END> , and two patients had abnormal retinal pigmentation with normal visual function .
All patients presented with poor growth , feeding problems , and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
No patients had acute acidotic crises before or after treatment .
All patients had dramatic reduction of plasma free homocystine and urine methylmalonic acid excretion after initiation of therapy with carnitine , intramuscular ( IM) hydroxocobalamin ( OHcbl ) and , in two cases , oral betaine .
Growth was significantly improved in most cases after the initiation of therapy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> was resolved in one patient .
All patients were developmentally delayed regardless of age of treatment onset , although two patients had relatively mild <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
cblC patients may have an increased incidence of congenital malformations suggesting prenatal effects of abnormal cbl metabolism .
Treatment with IM OHcbl and carnitine successfully corrects the biochemical abnormalities and improves growth .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Developmental delay <END> of variable severity is always present regardless of age at diagnosis or treatment onset .
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIB with characteristic facies , decreased curvatures of the spinal column , and joint contractures in two unrelated girls .
Two unrelated girls , aged 11 and 14 years , with clinical manifestations of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ( EDS ) type VIB , characteristic facies , skeletal abnormalities , and other features are described .
They had Marfanoid habitus with <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> ; fragile , hyperextensible , and readily bruisable skin with widened , atrophic scars ; recurrent hematomas ; <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized joint laxity <END> ; hypotonia ; <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ; and mild delay of gross motor development .
Lysyl hydroxylase deficiency was ruled out in Patient 1 . Parental consanguinity was present in Patient 2 . They both had , in early childhood , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , drooping lower eyelids , short nose , small mouth , and <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> .
Facial features that persisted included thick eyebrows , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blue sclerae <END> , low-set , and slanted ears , hypoplastic columella , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> thin upper lip <END> .
They had tubular stenosis of the phalanges , metacarpals , and metatarsals ; decreased physiological curvatures of the spinal column with tall vertebrae ; and joint contractures including <START:PHENOTYPE> talipes equinovarus <END> and progressive talipes valgus .
Their hearing of high-pitched sounds was impaired .
They had <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> and recurrent cystitis with an enlarged bladder .
In view of these findings , we propose that these two girls represent a clinically recognizable subgroup of EDS type VIB.
Clinical and molecular findings of ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 2 in 4 families .
Ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 2 ( AOA2 ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disease caused by SETX mutations in 9q34 resulting in cerebellar ataxia in association with peripheral neuropathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> on imaging , an <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated alpha-fetoprotein <END> ( AFP ) serum level , and occasional <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> .
To describe the clinical and molecular findings of 7 patients with a clinical presentation of AOA2 and their relatives .
Case report .
Projet Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique .
Seven patients with AOA2 and their family members .
Linkage analysis and direct sequencing of all exons of SETX were performed in all patients .
Magnetic resonance imaging and electroneuromyography were performed and the patients ' AFP serum levels were tested .
We identified 7 patients with AOA2 from 4 unrelated families .
Three novel SETX mutations were found .
The clinical picture of the patients reported is fairly homogeneous and in accordance with the classic AOA2 presentation : onset from 13 to 18 years of progressive cerebellar ataxia and <START:PHENOTYPE> areflexia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Oculomotor apraxia <END> was detected in 1 patient .
Predominant <START:PHENOTYPE> axonal neuropathy <END> and a diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar atrophy <END> were found in the 4 patients tested .
All patients had elevated AFP serum levels and 5 of 8 nonsymptomatic heterozygous relatives had moderately increased AFP serum levels as well .
Ataxia with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> type 2 is a homogeneous form of cerebellar ataxia with occasional <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> .
Most nonsymptomatic heterozygous carriers present with increased AFP serum levels .
A form of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> marfanoid habitus <END> .
A kindred has been studied in which <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and marfanoid clinical features are present in several individuals .
The pedigree is consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive inheritance <END> .
Four affected males aged 12-18 years and four obligate carriers have been identified .
Clinical findings in the 4 affected males included a tall slender habitus (3 ) ( the fourth was tall but muscular) , a long-narrow face (3) , <START:PHENOTYPE> large head <END> (4) , highly arched palate (4) , <START:PHENOTYPE> small mandible <END> (4) , abnormal speech (4) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypernasal voice <END> (3) , joint hyperextensibility (3) , borderline to large testes (3) , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> (2 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> (1 ) , and a double row of teeth (1 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> (4 ) ranged from mild to severe ; abnormal behavior included hyperactive and <START:PHENOTYPE> aggressive behavior <END> (2 ) , autistic-like (1 ) and jovial behavior (1 ) .
One and possibly two , males had absence of the corpus callosum .
Chromosome studies on all were normal; no marker X was observed .
We believe this family probably represents a new form of X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
SUCLA2 mutations are associated with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> methylmalonic aciduria <END> , Leigh-like encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
One pedigree with four patients has been recently described with mitochondrial DNA depletion and mutation in SUCLA2 gene leading to succinyl-CoA synthase deficiency .
Patients had a Leigh-like encephalomyopathy and <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> but besides the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , the profile of urine organic acid was not reported .
We have studied 14 patients with mild 'unlabelled ' <START:PHENOTYPE> methylmalonic aciduria <END> ( MMA ) from 11 families .
Eight of the families are from the Faroe Islands , having a common ancestor , and three are from southern Italy .
Since the reaction catalysed by succinyl-CoA synthase in the tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle represents a distal step of the methylmalonic acid pathway , we investigated the SUCLA2 gene as a candidate gene in our patients .
Genetic analysis of the gene in the 14 patients confirmed the defect in all patients and led to the identification of three novel mutations ( p.Gly118 Arg ; p.Arg284Cys ; c.534 + 1G --> A ) .
The defect could be convincingly shown at the protein level and our data also confirm the previously described mitochondrial DNA depletion .
Defects in SUCLA2 can be found at the metabolite level and are defined by mildly elevated methylmalonic acid and C4-dicarboxylic carnitine concentrations in body fluids in association with variable <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> .
Clinically the diagnosis should be considered in patients with early/neonatal onset encephalomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> and Leigh-like MRI abnormalities mainly affecting the putamen and the caudate nuclei .
The frequency of the mutated allele in the Faroese population amounted to 2% , corresponding with an estimated homozygote frequency of 1 : 250 0 .
Our data extend knowledge on the genetic defects causing MMA .
Our patients present with an early infantile Leigh-like encephalomyopathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , and later on a progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> .
Mild MMA , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and specific abnormalities in the carnitine ester profile are the biochemical hallmarks of the disease .
In view of the frequency of the mutated allele on the Faroe Islands , measures become feasible to prevent the occurrence of the disease on the islands .
We confirm and extend the findings on this inborn error of metabolism in the TCA cycle that must be carefully investigated by accurate metabolite analyses .
FACL4 , encoding fatty acid-CoA ligase 4 , is mutated in nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) is an inherited condition that causes failure to develop cognitive abilities , owing to mutations in a gene on the X chromosome .
The latest XLMR update lists up to 136 conditions leading to 'syndromic ' , or 'specific ' , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MRXS ) and 66 entries leading to 'nonspecific ' <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MRX ) .
For 9 of the 66 MRX entries , the causative gene has been identified .
Our recent discovery of the contiguous gene deletion syndrome ATS-MR ( previously known as Alport syndrome , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , midface hypoplasia , elliptocytosis , OMIM #300194 ) , characterized by Alport syndrome ( ATS ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MR) , indicated Xq22.3 as a region containing one <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> gene .
Comparing the extent of deletion between individuals with ATS-MR and individuals with ATS alone allowed us to define a critical region for <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> of approximately 380 kb , containing four genes .
Here we report the identification of two point mutations , one missense and one splice-site change , in the gene FACL4 in two families with nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Analysis of enzymatic activity in lymphoblastoid cell lines from affected individuals of both families revealed low levels compared with normal cells , indicating that both mutations are null mutations .
All carrier females with either point mutations or genomic deletions in FACL4 showed a completely skewed X-inactivation , suggesting that the gene influences survival advantage .
FACL4 is the first gene shown to be involved in nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and fatty-acid metabolism .
Genetically increasing Myoc expression supports a necessary pathologic role of abnormal proteins in <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Despite the importance of MYOC for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , the protein 's normal function(s ) and the pathogenic mechanism(s ) of MYOC mutations are not clear .
Elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> are sometimes induced by corticosteroids , and corticosteroid use can result in substantially increased MYOC expression .
It has been suggested , therefore , that steroid-induced MYOC protein levels cause steroid-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and that protein level-increasing mutations in MYOC contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> not associated with steroid use .
A causative role of elevated MYOC levels in steroid-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is controversial , however , and it is not clear if elevated MYOC levels can result in IOP elevation .
To directly test if increased levels of MYOC can cause IOP elevation and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , we generated bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice that overexpress Myoc at a level similar to that induced by corticosteroid use .
These mice do not develop elevated IOP or <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Our present findings , along with the absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in mice completely lacking MYOC , show that changing the level of MYOC is not pathogenic ( from absent to approximately 15 times normal ) .
These findings suggest that noncoding sequence variants are unlikely to influence <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and that disease pathogenesis in primary open-angle <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> patients is dependent upon the expression of abnormal mutant proteins .
This work does not support a causative role for increased MYOC levels or the MYOC gene in steroid-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> .
Apparently new osteodysplastic and primordial short stature with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microdontia <END> , opalescent teeth , and rootless molars in two siblings .
A Thai man and his sister affected with a newly recognized syndrome of proportionate primordial short stature are reported .
The patients had severe intrauterine and <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent nose <END> and nasal bridge , <START:PHENOTYPE> small pinnae <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large sella turcica <END> , areas of hypo- and hyperpigmentation of skin , dry and <START:PHENOTYPE> thin scalp hair <END> , and long and <START:PHENOTYPE> straight clavicles <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ivory epiphyses <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cone-shaped epiphyses <END> of the hands were found when they were young , but most of them disappeared as they grew up . Scaphoid and trapezium had angular appearance .
The second toes were unusually long .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Distal symphalangism <END> of toes and barchymesophalangy of fingers were noted .
The findings that appear to distinguish this syndrome from the previously reported syndromes are long second toes , opalescent and rootless teeth , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> microdontia <END> , severely hypoplastic alveolar process , and unerupted tooth .
The mode of inheritance is suspected to be <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .

TH2 cytokine-associated transcription factors in atopic and nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> : evidence for differential signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 expression .
The expression of IL-4 and IL-5 is increased in patients with atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> compared with control subjects and correlates with indices of pulmonary function .
In nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> the expression of IL-4 , unlike IL-5 , fails to correlate with pulmonary function , and compared with their atopic counterparts , these patients have fewer cells expressing IL-4 receptor ( IL-4R ) .
As such , a deficiency in the IL-4 signaling pathway may be implicated in nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
The transcription factors GATA-3 and cMAF mediate IL-4 and IL-5 synthesis , whereas signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 ( STAT-6 ) is critical for IL-4R signaling .
This study examines the expression profile of these transcription factors in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , according to atopic status .
With immunocytochemistry , the expression of GATA-3 , cMAF , and STAT- 6 protein was determined in sections of bronchial biopsy specimens from patients with atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( n = 7) , patients with nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( n = 8 ) , and control subjects ( n = 8 ) .
Higher numbers of cells expressing GATA-3 and cMAF were observed in patients with atopic and those with nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> than in control subjects and patients with tuberculosis ( P <.001 ) .
There were also more STAT-6-immunoreactive cells in patients with atopic and those with nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> than in control subjects ( P <.0001 , P <.05 ) .
Notably , however , fewer cells expressing STAT- 6 protein were observed in nonatopic versus atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( P <.0001 ) .
These results demonstrate the upregulation of GATA-3 and cMAF in both variants of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and indicate that reduced IL-4R signaling , because of lower STAT- 6 expression , may be a feature of nonatopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome : fourteen new patients and a clinical analysis .
The Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome ( SGS ) is a disorder of unknown cause comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> marfanoid habitus <END> and skeletal , neurological , cardiovascular , and connective-tissue anomalies .
There are no pathognomonic signs of SGS and diagnosis depends on recognition of a characteristic combination of anomalies .
Here , we describe 14 persons with SGS and compare their clinical findings with those of 23 previously reported individuals , including two families with more than one affected individual .
Our analysis suggests that there is a characteristic facial appearance , with more than two thirds of all individuals having <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , and apparently low-set and posteriorly rotated ears . Other commonly reported manifestations include hypotonia in at least the neonatal period , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and inguinal or <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> .
The degree of reported <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual impairment <END> ranges from mild to severe .
The most common skeletal manifestations in SGS were <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , pectus deformity , camptodactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> .
None of the skeletal signs alone is specific for SGS .
Our study includes 14 mainly German individuals with SGS evaluated over a period of 10 years .
Given that only 23 other persons with SGS have been reported to date worldwide , we suggest that SGS may be more common than previously assumed .
Clinical spectrum of steroid sulfatase deficiency : <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , birth complications and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> .
When boys affected with steroid sulfatase deficiency are delivered , the lack of the enzyme in the placenta may cause birth complications .
In postnatal life this gene defect gives rise to <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> .
In a series of 25 patients birth complications were reported in 9 cases .
Of these boys , 4 displayed bilateral inguinal <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> and one was affected unilaterally .
In a further boy we observed unilateral inguinal <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> without a history of birth complications .
In one patient who had been delivered by forceps , abdominal bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> resulted in severe hypogenitalism .
A review of the literature revealed 30 cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> displaying hypogenitalism or <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> or both .
In conclusion , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> should be considered as a further clinical manifestation of steroid sulfatase deficiency .
PAK3 related mental disability : further characterization of the phenotype .
We report clinical , neuropsychological and molecular findings in affected males and carrier females in the fourth reported family with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> caused by mutation in the PAK3 gene ( Xq22.3-q23) , W446 S .
In contrast to previous reports , carrier females manifested learning problems and mild mental disability .
Skewed X-inactivation was observed here for the first time in carriers of PAK3 mutation .
Neuropsychological tests in affected males and carrier females suggested a common neuropsychological profile of impaired spatial cognitive abilities and defects in attentional and executive functions .
The five affected males examined herein had a proportionally small head size or <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , oral motor hypotonia with <START:PHENOTYPE> drooling <END> and inarticulate speech and <START:PHENOTYPE> short attention span <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> , restlessness , and <START:PHENOTYPE> aggression <END> .
Brain imaging showed signs of chronic non-progressive hydrocephalus in one patient who manifested <START:PHENOTYPE> psychosis <END> and fluctuant gait deterioration , while two other patients showed no abnormalities .
EEG recordings were available from four affected males and one carrier female , and all showed similar posterior slow wave activity without epileptic discharges .
Only one affected male in the family suffered from <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
When comparing the affected males in this family and the three previously reported families with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> due to a PAK3 mutation , similarities in their characteristics were small head size or <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> large ears <END> , speech defects , behavioral abnormalities , and psychiatric disease .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> chorea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Pathologic features of a newly defined familial disorder .
Five generations of a family exhibit a unique <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> neurologic disorder characterized by the development ( usually between 15 and 30 years of age ) of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> choreiform movements <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive dementia <END> , and death after 15 to 25 years of illness .
Neuropathologic findings in two deceased family members revealed remarkably similar findings , including marked neuronal loss of the dentate nucleus , microcalcification of the globus pallidus , neuroaxonal dystrophy of the nucleus gracilis , and demyelination of the centrum semiovale .
The clinical and pathologic findings are closely correlated .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> chorea <END> are related to severe neuronal loss in the dentate nucleus with calcification in the globus pallidus .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Dementia <END> occurs with progressive demyelination of the centrum semiovale , and loss of posterior column function occurs with neuroaxonal dystrophy of the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus .
A new syndrome with distinct facial and auricular malformations and dominant inheritance .
We report on a mother and son with <START:PHENOTYPE> high forehead <END> ; elongated and flattened face ; arched , <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse eyebrows <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> long nose <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nostrils <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> microstomia <END> ; high , narrow palate ; <START:PHENOTYPE> nasal speech <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> chin dimples <END> ; and a highly unusual bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> auricular malformation <END> .
Intelligence and hearing are normal , and there is no " whistling " face or deviation of fingers .
Although resembling in some ways the Freeman-Sheldon syndrome , this phenotype most likely represents a new malformation syndrome , either <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> or X-linked dominant .
Clinical characterisation of 29 neurofibromatosis type-1 patients with molecularly ascertained 1.4 Mb type-1 NF1 deletions . Large deletions of the NF1 gene region occur in approximately 5 % of patients with neurofibromatosis type-1 ( NF1 ) and are associated with particularly severe manifestations of the disease .
However , until now , the genotype-phenotype relationship has not been comprehensively studied in patients harbouring large NF1 gene deletions of comparable extent ( giving rise to haploinsufficiency of the same genes ) .
We have performed the most comprehensive clinical/neuropsychological characterisation so far undertaken in NF1 deletion patients , involving 29 patients with precisely determined type-1 NF1 ( 1.4 Mb ) deletions .
Novel clinical features found to be associated with type-1 NF1 deletions included <START:PHENOTYPE> pes cavus <END> ( 17 % of patients) , <START:PHENOTYPE> bone cysts <END> (5 0% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit <END> ( 73% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> ( 45% ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> speech difficulties <END> ( 48% ) .
Type-1 NF1 deletions were found to be disproportionately associated with facial dysmorphic features (90 % of patients) , <START:PHENOTYPE> tall stature <END> ( 46% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> large hands <END> and feet ( 46% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ( 43% ) , joint hyperflexibility ( 72%) , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed cognitive development <END> and/or learning disabilities ( 93% ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( IQ<70 ; 38% ) , as compared with the general NF1 patient population .
Significantly increased frequencies ( relative to the general NF1 population ) of plexiform neurofibromas ( 76% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> subcutaneous neurofibromas <END> ( 76% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal neurofibromas <END> ( 64% ) and MPNSTs ( 21% ) were also noted in the type-1 deletion patients .
Further , 5 0 % of the adult patients exhibited a very high burden of cutaneous neurofibromas ( N>or=1000 ) .
These findings emphasise the importance of deletion analysis in NF1 since frequent monitoring of tumour presence and growth could potentiate early surgical intervention thereby improving patient survival .
Exclusion of the dymeclin and PAPSS2 genes in a novel form of <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasias ( SEMD ) represent a heterogeneous group of conditions composed of at least 15 well-defined entities .
The classification is based on clinical , radiological and molecular findings .
Among them , several conditions also include a <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( MR ) syndrome , namely Wolcott-Rallison syndrome , Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome ( DMC ) and lysosomal storage disorders .
Here , we report on a novel form of SEMD with MR in two Pakistani sisters born to first-cousin parents .
SEMD , MR , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , facial dysmorphism and <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> of back and legs were noted in the two children .
Skeletal findings included <START:PHENOTYPE> flat vertebral bodies <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> irregular vertebral plates <END> , irregular and flared metaphyses with vertical striations , small and <START:PHENOTYPE> irregular epiphyses <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small carpal bones <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow iliac wings <END> without lacy pelvis iliac crest .
Similarities with DMC prompted us to test and eventually exclude the DMC gene , dymeclin , by direct sequencing .
Similarly , we excluded the PAPSS2 gene ( 3 ' -alpha phosphoadenosine 5 ' -phosphosulphate synthase 2 ) responsible for SEMD Pakistani type .
The combination of features observed in the two sisters does not fit with any previously reported SEMD and represents therefore a novel form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> SEMD with MR .
Familial isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> is associated with recurrent chromosome 17q23.1q23.2 microduplications containing TBX4 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Clubfoot <END> is a common musculoskeletal birth defect for which few causative genes have been identified .
To identify the genes responsible for isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> , we screened for genomic copy-number variants with the Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP Array 6. 0 . A recurrent chromosome 17q23.1q23.2 microduplication was identified in 3 of 66 probands with familial isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
The chromosome 17q23.1q23.2 microduplication segregated with autosomal-dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> in all three families but with reduced penetrance .
Mild <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> was common and one female had developmental <START:PHENOTYPE> hip dysplasia <END> .
Subtle skeletal abnormalities consisted of broad and shortened metatarsals and calcanei , small distal tibial epiphyses , and thickened ischia .
Several skeletal features were opposite to those described in the reciprocal chromosome 17q23.1q23.2 microdeletion syndrome associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and cardiac and limb abnormalities .
Of note , during our study , we also identified a microdeletion at the locus in a sibling pair with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> .
The chromosome 17q23.1q23.2 region contains the T-box transcription factor TBX4 , a likely target of the bicoid-related transcription factor PITX1 previously implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> etiology .
Our result suggests that this chromosome 17q23.1q23.2 microduplication is a relatively common cause of familial isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> and provides strong evidence linking <START:PHENOTYPE> clubfoot <END> etiology to abnormal early limb development .

Genotype-phenotype studies in three families with mutations in the polyglutamine-binding protein 1 gene ( PQBP1 ) .
Recently , the polyglutamine-binding protein 1 ( PQBP1 ) gene was found to be mutated in five of 29 families studied with X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( XLMR ) linked to Xp.
The reported mutations include duplications or deletions of AG dinucleotides in the fourth coding exon that resulted in shifts of the open reading frame .
Three of the five families with mutations in this newly identified XLMR gene have been reported previously .
We characterized the phenotypic and neuropsychological features in the two unpublished families with aberrations in PQBP1 and in a family reported 10 years ago .
In total , seven patients diagnosed with aberrations in this gene were examined , including a newly identified patient at 18 months of age .
Additionally , the features were compared to those reported in the literature of three other families , comprising MRXS3 ( Sutherland-Haan syndrome ) MRX55 and MRXS8 ( Renpenning syndrome ) .
Characteristics seen in these patients are <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , lean body habitus , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , striking facial appearance with long narrow faces , upward slant of the eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> malar hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prognathism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nasal speech <END> .
In addition , <START:PHENOTYPE> small testes <END> and midline defects as <START:PHENOTYPE> anal atresia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , clefting of palate and/or uvula , <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Tetralogy of Fallot <END> are seen in several patients .
These observations contribute to the phenotypic knowledge of patients with PQBP1 mutations and make this XLMR syndrome well recognizable to clinicians .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> leptodactylic form : clinical course and phenotypic variations in four patients .
We describe a 5-year-old boy and a 33-year-old woman with <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> leptodactylic form ( <START:PHENOTYPE> spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia <END> with multiple dislocations ) ( MIM 6003546 ) , and two 12-year-old girls with the disorder who were previously reported as examples of a variant of sponatrime dysplasia .
Their clinical manifestations included <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , micromelic <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> that caused multiple joint problems , including thoracolumbar <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , hip subluxation , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> genu valgum <END> with knee and patellar subluxation , elbow subluxation , and malalignment of the wrist .
Laryngotracheomalacia was present in two individuals , and myopathy was noted in one .
The radiological findings in the four individuals included mild <START:PHENOTYPE> platyspondyly <END> most conspicuous in infancy , narrow interpediculate distances of the lumbar spine evident in infancy , retarded epiphyseal ossification that evolved to epiphyseal dysplasia and later to degenerative joint disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> metaphyseal irregularities <END> and striations present in early childhood , and leptodactylic appearance ( slender short tubular bones ) of the hand .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> nocturnal frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
A distinctive clinical disorder .
The disorder of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> nocturnal frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> has recently been identified , and is now delineated in detail .
A phenotypically homogeneous group of five families from Australia , Britain and Canada , containing 47 affected individuals , was studied .
The largest family contained 25 affected individuals spanning six generations .
This disorder is characterized by clusters of brief nocturnal motor <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , with hyperkinetic or tonic manifestations .
Subjects often experienced an aura , and remained aware throughout the attacks .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> occurred in clusters ( mean eight attacks/night ) typically as the individual dozed , or shortly before awakening .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> usually began in childhood , and persisted through adult life , with considerable intra-family variation in severity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> were often misdiagnosed as benign nocturnal parasomnias , psychiatric and medical disorders .
Interictal EEG studies were unhelpful .
Ictal video-EEG studies showed that the attacks were <START:PHENOTYPE> partial seizures <END> with frontal lobe <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> semiology .
Neuro-imaging was normal .
Carbamazepine monotherapy was frequently effective .
This disorder showed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
Recognition of this entity is clinically important for diagnosis , appropriate therapy and genetic counselling .
Moreover , this disorder now offers an opportunity to identify a gene for partial <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
Differential contributions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes predispose women to <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
BRCA1 mutations are found in approximately 12 percent of women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> of early onset , and the specific mutation causing a deletion of adenine and guanine ( 185delAG ) , which is present in 1 percent of the Ashkenazi Jewish population , contributes to 21 percent of breast cancers among young Jewish women .
The contribution of BRCA2 mutations to <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> of early onset is unknown .
Lymphocyte specimens from 73 women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> diagnosed by the age of 32 were studied for heterozygous mutations of BRCA2 by a complementary-DNA-based protein-truncation assay , followed by automated nucleotide sequencing .
In addition , specimens from 39 Jewish women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> diagnosed by the age of 40 were tested for specific mutations by an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction .
Definite BRCA2 mutations were found in 2 of the 73 women with early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> ( 2.7 percent ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.4 to 9.6 percent ) , suggesting that BRCA2 is associated with fewer cases than BRCA1 ( P= 0.03 ) .
The specific BRCA2 mutation causing a deletion of thymine ( 6174delT) , which is found in 1.3 percent of the Ashkenazi Jewish population , was observed in 1 of the 39 young Jewish women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> ( 2.6 percent ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.09 to 13.5 percent ) , indicating that it has a small role as a risk factor for early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Among young women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , there are BRCA2 mutations that cause truncation of the extreme C terminus of the protein and that may be functionally silent , along with definite truncating mutations .
Germ-line mutations in BRCA2 contribute to fewer cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> among young women than do mutations in BRCA1 .
Carriers of BRCA2 mutations may have a smaller increase in the risk of early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Prognosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in a rural African community : a 30-year follow-up of 164 patients in an outpatient clinic in rural Tanzania .
While working as a physician in Tanzania in the early 1960s , Dr . Louise Jilek-Aall founded an outpatient clinic for <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> among the Pogoro people of Mahenge mountains where <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> ( locally termed Kifafa ) had brought misery and death to an unusually high percentage of the population .
With local assistance and overseas donations of phenobarbital ( PB) , this clinic treated approximately 200 patients for less than or equal to 10 years .
The area was revisited 30 years later to trace these patients .
Of the 164 patients who had started treatment , 86 (52 .4% ) achieved complete <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> suppression , 59 ( 36. 0% ) experienced reduction in <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> frequency , 13 ( 7 .9% ) experienced no change , and in 1 ( 0.6% ) <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were worse .
The effect of treatment could not be assessed in 5 ( 3.0% ) patients .
After 30 years , only 36 ( 21.9% ) of the 164 patients were known to be alive .
Of the patients , 110 ( 67 .1% ) had died , and the whereabouts of 18 ( 11% ) could not be traced .
The causes of death were <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> related ( status epilepticus , drowning , burns , dying in or after a <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> ) in greater than 5 0 % of the patients .
Epilepsy-related deaths were proportionately higher after drug supply was stopped and among patients who were receiving drugs irregularly or who had only partial <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> control .
Patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> showed an increased mortality rate , which was twice that of the general rural Tanzanian population of similar age .
Management of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> in rural Africans should also emphasize methods to prevent epilepsy-related causes of death among patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal lymphangiectasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> , with facial anomalies and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We report on two male and two female relatives with <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal lymphangiectasia <END> ; severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> of limbs , genitalia , and face ; facial anomalies ; <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ; mild growth retardation ; and moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Main facial anomalies are a <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , small mouth , tooth anomalies , and ear defects .
Their parents are consanguineous .
This disorder probably is an hitherto undescribed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Heterogeneity <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital retinal non-attachment <END> , falciform folds and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dysplasia <END> .
A guide to genetic counselling .
The heritable falciform folds and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital retinal non-attachment <END> reported in the literature are here divided into monosymptomatic and complex types .
Of the former , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> and recessive disorders are known .
The complex types comprise several syndromes , both <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> and X-linked .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Retinal dysplasia <END> is sometimes seen in histological sections from these affections , but it is an unspecific histological reaction , and not a disease sui generis .
Attention is drawn to the syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and falciform detachment which , though previously described , has not so far been delineated .
It is hypothesized that <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital retinal non-attachment <END> with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> and persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous constitute yet another 'new ' syndrome , mainly seen in females .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> frontotemporal <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pachygyria <END> is a cortical malformation that results from the abnormal migration of neurons .
Regions of the brain with <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> have an abnormally thick cortex that lacks normal folding and has deficient layering .
We describe three siblings , born to nonconsanguineous Mexican parents , who have bilateral frontotemporal <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> without polymicrogyria .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> is accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> moderate mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> esotropia <END> , and either <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> .
They are otherwise morphologically normal and do not have microcephaly .
Two experienced a single <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> in infancy .
The characteristic phenotype present in this family suggests a new genetic syndrome that is likely inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Primary biliary cirrhosis <END> associated with HLA , IL12A , and IL12RB2 variants .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Primary biliary cirrhosis <END> is a chronic granulomatous cholangitis , characteristically associated with antimitochondrial antibodies .
Twin and family aggregation data suggest that there is a significant genetic predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> , but the susceptibility loci are unknown .
To identify genetic loci conferring a risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> , we carried out a genomewide association analysis in which DNA samples from 2072 Canadian and U.S . subjects ( 536 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> and 1536 controls ) were genotyped for more than 300,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) .
Sixteen of the SNPs most strongly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> were genotyped in two independent replication sets .
We carried out fine-mapping studies across three loci associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> .
We found significant associations between <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> and 13 loci across the HLA class II region ; the HLA-DQB1 locus (encoding the major histocompatibility complex class II , DQ beta chain 1 ) had the strongest association ( P=1.78 x10( -19 ) ; odds ratio for patients vs . controls , 1.75 ) . <START:PHENOTYPE> Primary biliary cirrhosis <END> was also significantly and reproducibly associated with two SNPs at the IL12A locus (encoding interleukin-12alpha) , rs6441286 ( P=2.42x10( -14 ) ; odds ratio , 1.54 ) and rs574808 ( P=1.88x10( -13 ) ; odds ratio , 1.54 ) , and one SNP at the IL12RB2 locus (encoding interleukin-12 receptor beta2) , rs3790567 ( P=2.76 x10( -11 ) ; odds ratio , 1.51 ) . Fine-mapping analysis showed that a five-allele haplotype in the 3 ' flank of IL12A was significantly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> ( P=1 .15x10( -34) ) .
We found a modest genomewide association ( P<5. 0x10( -5) ) with the risk of disease for SNPs at the STAT4 locus (encoding signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 ) and the CTLA4 locus (encoding cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ) and 10 other loci .
Our data show significant associations between <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> and common genetic variants at the HLA class II , IL12A , and IL12RB2 loci and suggest that the interleukin-12 immunoregulatory signaling axis is relevant to the pathophysiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> .

Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> in the Japanese population is frequently located at the cardiac region .
The clinical features of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> are still unknown .
To approach this question , we investigated the clinicopathological characteristics of 16 cases of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> .
In this study the criteria used to define familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> was the existence of three or more family members with <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> in at least two successive generations .
The clinicopathological characteristics of cases who fulfilled this criteria were studied .
This study contained 16 familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> probands .
Seven cases ( 44% ) of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> had developed at the cardiac region of the stomach .
This frequency was significantly higher than for <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> in the general population in Japan ( 15 .4% , p < 0.01 ) .
Undifferentiated types were dominant in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> ( 69% , p < 0.05 ) .
Furthermore , the frequency of disseminated peritoneal (40% ) and liver metastases (20% ) in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> was also significantly higher than for <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> in the general population in Japan (1 0 .9% , p < 0.01 , and 4.4% , p < 0.05 , respectively ) .
Familial gastric cancers were frequently located at the cardiac region and appeared to be more aggressive than sporadic gastric cancers .
The unique characteristics of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> suggest a genetic background in their etiology .
The Hunter-MacDonald syndrome with expanded phenotype including risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> meningioma <END> : an update and review .
Hunter-MacDonald syndrome ( HMS ) is a rare , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> skeletal dysplasia with multiple malformations .
The skeletal manifestations of HMS include <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epiphyseal dysplasia <END> with early osteoarthritis leading to joint replacement , prominent humeral insertions for the deltoids , <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , subluxation of the thumbs , and malformed feet .
Craniofacial manifestations include normal head circumference , tall forehead , <START:PHENOTYPE> bitemporal narrowing <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> .
Decreased hearing acuity , transient <START:PHENOTYPE> cranial nerve palsies <END> , congenital heart defects , and <START:PHENOTYPE> meningioma <END> are also reported .
Herein , we present two cases , and , through review of the manifestations of HMS in affected and at-risk family members , we have observed that predisposition to brain tumor is a cardinal feature of this condition .

Homozygous frameshift mutation in TMCO1 causes a syndrome with craniofacial dysmorphism , skeletal anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We identified an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition in 11 individuals in the Old Order Amish of northeastern Ohio .
The syndrome was characterized by distinctive craniofacial dysmorphism , skeletal anomalies , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The typical craniofacial dysmorphism included <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , highly arched <START:PHENOTYPE> bushy eyebrows <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long eyelashes <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , microdontism of primary teeth , and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hyperplasia <END> , whereas <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel deformity <END> of scapula , fusion of spine , rib abnormities , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pes planus <END> represented skeletal anomalies .
The genome-wide homozygosity mapping using six affected individuals localized the disease gene to a 3.3-Mb region on chromosome 1q23.3-q24.1 .
Candidate gene sequencing identified a homozygous frameshift mutation , c.139_140delAG , in the transmembrane and coiled-coil domains 1 ( TM CO1 ) gene , as the pathogenic change in all affected members of the extended pedigree .
This mutation is predicted to result in a severely truncated protein ( p.Ser47Ter ) of only one-fourth the original length .
The TMCO1 gene product is a member of DUF841 superfamily of several eukaryotic proteins with unknown function .
The gene has highly conserved amino acid sequence and is universally expressed in all human tissues examined .
The high degree of conservation and the ubiquitous expression pattern in human adult and fetal tissues suggest a critical role for TM CO1 .
This report shows a TMCO1 sequence variant being associated with a genetic disorder in human .
We propose " TM CO1 defect syndrome " as the name of this condition .
Coloboma , congenital heart disease , and <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> with multiple anomalies : CHARGE association .
We report 21 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> choanal atresia <END> or ocular coloboma or both who have certain other associated anomalies , including congenital heart disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth deficiency <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and/or CNS anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphallus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and ear anomalies and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Facial palsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> swallowing difficulties <END> were also common .
It has not been possible to define a single etiology or a syndrome in these patients .
We propose the mnemonic CHARGE ( C-coloboma , H-heart disease , A-atresia choanae , R-retarded growth and retarded development and/or CNS anomalies , G-genital hypoplasia , and E-ear anomalies and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> ) to describe the features of this association .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> enteropathy <END> with villous <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> and immunoglobulin G2 subclass deficiency .
We describe a familial form of recurrent acute , life-threatening secretory <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> associated with distinctive jejunal histologic changes and IgG2 subclass deficiency .
Symptoms begin abruptly with <START:PHENOTYPE> anorexia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , and progress within hours to massive secretory <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> and shock with profound <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoproteinemia <END> , including <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> and hypogammaglobulinemia .
Affected survivors recover quickly and thereafter grow and develop normally .
Biopsy specimens obtained during remission from 3 adults and 11 children show club-shaped jejunal villi broadened by <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> and histiocytes with imbibed fluid ; the overlying intestinal epithelium and brush border appear normal , but the basement membrane is interrupted in some areas .
No characteristic microorganisms have been identified in association with the syndrome .
Clinical manifestations cease in the second decade , but the abnormal jejunal histologic pattern persists into adult life .
Female and male patients are equally affected , although all fatal cases have been in female subjects .
Inheritance appears dominant with variable penetrance : one family member without a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> has characteristic biopsy findings and another appears to be an obligate carrier with normal biopsy findings .
Affected individuals have a reduced serum concentration of IgG2 .
We believe that this familial <START:PHENOTYPE> enteropathy <END> is a unique entity , not previously described .
CblE type of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> due to methionine synthase reductase deficiency : clinical and molecular studies and prenatal diagnosis in two families .
The cblE type of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder , which manifests with megaloblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay in early childhood <END> .
This disease is caused by a defect in reductive activation of methionine synthase ( MTR ) .
Our study was directed at clinical , biochemical , enzymatic and molecular characterization of two Czech patients with the cblE type of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> .
Case 1 involves a 20-year-old mentally retarded patient who presented with megaloblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> at 10 weeks of age .
She was treated with folates and vitamin B12 , and subsequent attempts to cease administration of folates led to recurrence of megaloblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> .
Biochemical features included severe hyperhomocysteinaemia and hypomethioninaemia and in fibroblasts defective formation of methionine from formate , and no complementation with cblE cells .
Subsequent molecular analysis of the methionine synthase reductase ( MTRR ) gene revealed compound heterozygosity for a transition c.1459 G>A ( G487R ) and a 2bp insertion ( c.1623-1624ins TA ) .
Case 2 involves an 8-year-old girl with <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> in whom megaloblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> was detected at 11 weeks of age .
Severe hyperhomocysteinaemia with normal methionine levels was found and enzymatic and complementation studies confirmed the cblE defect .
This patient is homozygous for a 140 bp insertion ( c.903-904ins140 ) .
The insertion is caused by a T> C transition within intron 6 of the MTRR gene , which presumably leads to activation of an exon splicing enhancer .
In the families of both patients , enzymatic and mutation analyses were successfully used for prenatal diagnosis .
Our study expands the knowledge of the phenotypic and genotypic variability of the cblE type of <START:PHENOTYPE> homocystinuria <END> and supports the concept that this disorder is caused by mutations in the MTRR gene .
Fryns syndrome : two further cases without lateral diaphragmatic defects .
We report on two unrelated infants with Fryns syndrome but without lateral diaphragmatic defects .
In case 1 , a female <START:PHENOTYPE> stillborn <END> , pertinent findings included a <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse facies <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> with a broad pterygium , heart defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> lung hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , urogenital malformations , <START:PHENOTYPE> anal atresia <END> , and distal digital hypoplasia .
Case 2 showed a <START:PHENOTYPE> coarse facies <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate , para-oesophageal hernia with herniation of the stomach into the thoracic cavity , <START:PHENOTYPE> malrotation <END> of the intestine , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> anal atresia <END> .
At age 14 months she was developmentally severely retarded .
These observations represent the 11th and 12th reports of probable Fryns syndrome without lateral diaphragmatic defect .
Teebi <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> syndrome : report of a family with previously unrecognized findings .
We present a family consisting of a mother , a daughter , and a son with Teebi <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> syndrome , including some previously unrecognized manifestations .
The clinical findings include a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arched eyebrows <END> , pronounced <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , mild interdigital webbing , fifth-finger clinodactyly , umbilical anomalies , and hypotonia .
The mother and daughter also had <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> requiring surgical correction .
The daughter has bilateral iridochorioretinal colobomas with high hyperopia and a small <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> .
The son has less striking facial features but was born with a small <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , large ASD secundum , PDA , bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> right hydronephrosis , and a cystic left kidney .
The mother had an <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> requiring surgical correction as a child and a history of heart murmur .
Both children have normal hearing and mild developmental delay .
Their high-resolution karyotypes were normal and the FISH for 22q11 microdeletion was negative in the daughter .
We conclude that cardiac defects in Teebi <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> syndrome are not rare findings and that eye colobomas and renal anomalies were previously unrecognized .

Variable genotype of Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> patients .
Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> is caused by a single nucleotide change in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> deoxyribonucleic acid ( mtDNA ) .
Each cell contains thousands of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA molecules .
We demonstrated that in certain isolated instances , the proband and close maternal lineage relatives can have mixtures of mutant and normal <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA molecules ( heteroplasmy ) .
The proportion of mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA molecules was found to shift markedly across generations and within the tissues of an individual .
One unaffected mother had 65 % mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA molecules whereas her affected son had essentially 100% mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA molecules .
Two affected individuals had predominantly mutant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA in their blood , but significant normal <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA in their hair .
The demonstration of heteroplasmy within maternal lineages and affected individuals means that the successful determination of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA genotype of a family or patient with Leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> requires testing of more than one family member and more than one tissue from each individual .
Localization of a novel <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> locus ( LAH3 ) to chromosome 13q14 .11-q21.32 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> is a rare form of alopecia characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> sparse hair <END> on scalp , sparse to absent eyebrows and eyelashes , and sparse auxiliary and body hair .
Previously , for this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> , two loci LAH ( localized hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> ) and AH ( <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> ) have been mapped on chromosome 18q12 .1 and 3q27.2 , respectively .
In the study presented here , we report the localization of a third locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> in two large Pakistani families .
The patients in the two families exhibited typical features of the hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> .
Genome scan using polymorphic microsatellite markers mapped the gene on chromosome 13q14 .11-q21.32 .
A maximum combined two-point logarithm of odds ( LOD ) score of 4.79 at theta= 0.0 was obtained for several markers .
Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in a maximum LOD score of 5 .9 , which further supports the linkage .
Haplotype analysis defined the linkage interval of 17 .35 cM flanked by markers D13S325 and D13S1231 according to the Rutgers combined linkage -physical map.
This region contains 24.41 Mb according to the build 36 of the human genome sequence-based physical map.
Frequency analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxias in Japanese patients and clinical characterization of spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 6 . Using a molecular diagnostic approach , we investigated 101 kindreds with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> cerebellar ataxias ( ADCAs ) from the central Honshu island of Japan , including spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 1 ( SCA1 ) , spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 2 ( SCA2 ) , Machado-Joseph disease ( MJD) , dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy ( DRPLA ) and spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> type 6 ( SCA6 ) .
In our unselected series , MJD was the most common type of ADCA , accounting for 33.7% followed by DRPLA ( 19.8% ) , SCA2 ( 5 .9% ) and SCA6 ( 5 .9% ) .
No SCA1 mutations were identified .
We analysed the clinical features of six molecular confirmed SCA6 kindreds : in each family , there was an expanded allele in the alpha1A-voltage dependent calcium channel comprising between 23 and 25 CAG repeats .
The mean age at onset of symptoms was 43+ /-13 years .
The clinical features consisted predominantly of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and horizontal <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , which was generally consistent with ADCA type 3 . However several new clinical features were found in some patients : dramatic anticipation , rapid disease progression , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> action tremor <END> or action <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> , and very early onset , which are not described as the classical features of ADCA type 3 .
Clinical variability in a Noonan syndrome family with a new PTPN11 gene mutation .
Noonan syndrome ( NS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , facial dysmorphism , short and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> webbed neck <END> , heart defects , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> in males .
The gene responsible for the disorder ( PTP N11 ) was recently identified , and explains 30-5 0 % of the cases clinically diagnosed as NS . Cardiofaciocutaneous ( CFC ) syndrome , a similar but distinct entity , is characterized by relative macrocephaly , characteristic facial appearance , ectodermal abnormalities ( sparse and friable hair , sparse eyebrows , hyperkeratotic skin) , congenital heart defects , and growth and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We describe on a young woman who presents clinical features of NS ( <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> triangular facies <END> , with <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> and apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> webbed neck <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary stenosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bleeding diathesis <END> , prominent corneal nerves) , but with a more prominent ectodermal involvement ( sparse and very coarse hair , sparse eyebrows and eyelashes ) and developmental delay/mental retardation , which are characteristic of CFC patients .
Sequencing of the PTPN11 gene showed a T411M substitution , not previously described in patients with NS .
The same mutation was found in her mother and older sister , not initially considered to be affected by NS , but with very subtle clinical findings compatible with this diagnosis .
Molecular dynamic studies indicate that this new mutation , similar to other previously described mutations , favors a more active protein conformation .
However , the main disruptive effect is not directly in the catalytic domain , suggesting that the location of this mutation could make the protein more susceptible to gene-gene or gene-environment interactions .
Atypical cases of NS should be screened for mutations in the PTPN11 gene and in the case of a positive result , first-degree relatives should also be tested for the specific mutation .
The distal arthrogryposes : delineation of new entities--review and nosologic discussion .
We report on 44 patients ( 18 with additional affected family members ) , with congenital distal limb contractures identified from a large study of over 350 patients with congenital joint contractures .
Fourteen propositi ( seven familial cases , seven isolated cases ) had a newly recognized form of arthrogryposis , which we have designated <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> type 1 , with the predominant manifestations of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> ; tightly clenched fists at birth , with medially overlapping fingers , ulnar deviation , and camptodactyly in adults ; and positional foot deformities .
Contractures at other major joints are variable .
There are no associated visceral anomalies ; intelligence is normal .
There can be marked intrafamilial and interfamilial variability .
Twenty-two propositi with similar distal contractures had additional findings and were classified into five subcategories of <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> ( type IIA-E ) .
Among type II patients <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , cleft lip , small tongue , <START:PHENOTYPE> trismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthal folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , a unique hand position , and dull normal intelligence were seen .
These characteristics were seen in various combinations and patterns and allowed sorting into groups that were the basis for the categorization .
The remaining eight propositi were recognized to have previously described conditions with distal contractures and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> , ie , the Freeman-Sheldon syndrome , trismus-pseudo-camptodactyly syndrome , congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , and familial camptodactyly .
Pathogenetically we postulate similar underlying defects of abnormal tendon attachments , attenuation , and absence ; careful nosologic comparisons are important for prognostic counseling and habilitative management .
Association of tumor necrosis factor polymorphisms with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and serum total IgE . Tumor necrosis factors ( TN F ; TNFA and TN FB ) are major pro-inflammatory cytokines that are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
However , the functions of genetic polymorphisms in these cytokines have not been thoroughly examined in the context of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> pathology .
In an effort to discover polymorphism(s ) in genes whose variant(s ) have been implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> phenotypes , we examined the genetic effects of TNF ( TN FA and TN FB ) polymorphisms on <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and total serum IgE level .
Seven common single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) in TNF genes were genotyped in a Korean <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> cohort ( asthmatics n=55 0 , normal controls n=171 ) .
Six common haplotypes could be constructed in the TNF gene cluster due to very strong LD between TNFA and TN FB , located 13 kb apart on chromosome 6p21 .
One SNP ( TN FA-308G>A ) showed a significant association with the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( P= 0.0004 ) .
The frequency of TN FA-308 A allele-containing genotype in asthmatics ( 9.8% ) was much lower than that in normal controls ( 22.9% ) .
The protective effects of this polymorphism on <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> were also evident in separated subgroups by atopic status ( P= 0.05 in non-atopic subjects and P= 0.003 in atopic subjects ) .
The most common haplotype of the TNF gene ( TN F-ht1[ GGTC CGG] ) was associated with total serum IgE ( immunoglobulin E ) levels in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> patients , especially in non-atopic patients ( P= 0.004 ) .
Genetic variants of TNF might be involved in development of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and total serum IgE level in <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchial asthma <END> patients .
The results of this study could be helpful to understand the function of important TNF genes in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and IgE production .
Prevalence and characteristics of foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> without macular hole in <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> .
To report the prevalence of foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> without macular hole in a large number of highly myopic eyes using optical coherence tomography ( OCT) , and to clarify the demographic characteristics associated with foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> in these eyes .
A consecutive , prospective , observational case series .
In 134 eyes of 78 consecutive patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> ( refractive error of -8 diopters or more ) , we performed complete ophthalmic examinations and studied cross-sectional images of the macula with OCT.
The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence ( group 1 , n = 78 eyes of 45 patients ) or absence ( group 2 , n = 56 eyes of 33 patients ) of posterior staphyloma .
Slit-lamp examination with a Goldmann three-mirror lens indicated that none of the eyes had a macular hole .
In seven of 78 eyes ( 9. 0% ) with posterior staphyloma ( group 1 ) , OCT revealed foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> .
Two of the seven eyes had foveal retinoschisis .
Optical coherence tomography revealed no <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> or retinoschisis in any eye without posterior staphyloma ( group 2 ) . Visual acuity of the seven eyes with foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> ranged from 20/40 to 20/200 .
Two of the seven eyes had visual acuity 20/5 0 or better .
No patients complained of recent , progressive visual impairment .
All seven eyes with foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> had severe myopic fundus changes ( focal chorioretinal atrophy or bare sclera ) .
In highly myopic eyes with posterior staphyloma , the prevalence of foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> without macular hole was 9. 0% .
In eyes with this type of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> , visual acuity varies and foveal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> tends to be missed on routine examination .
Periodic examination using OCT is recommended for highly myopic eyes with severe myopic degenerative changes and posterior staphyloma .

Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> .
We describe the first cases of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> , a disorder in which capillaries in the lungs proliferate .
Three siblings died from <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> .
One developed pulmonary congestion preterminally after vasodilator treatment .
The inheritance pattern seems <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> .
Lung specimens obtained in two siblings showed extensive <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> , with normal capillaries proliferating into veins and alveoli .
Including our patients , four of the nine patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> have presented with the clinical picture of <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> .
Thus , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> should be considered as a histologic pattern of <START:PHENOTYPE> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> .
Most other cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> have been similar to pulmonary veno-occlusive disease .
Recently , disorders involving the proliferation of cytologically normal capillaries have been termed angiogenic diseases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis <END> may be an angiogenic disease .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> and endosteal sclerosis : a newly recognized syndrome .
We describe a brother and sister and an unrelated boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cerebellar hypoplasia <END> and endosteal sclerosis .
All 3 children presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , and were found to have <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hip dislocation <END> .
A previously published case is reviewed .
The disorder appears to represent a newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
Alpha-mannosidosis .
Alpha-mannosidosis is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder characterized by immune deficiency , facial and skeletal abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> .
It occurs in approximately 1 of 500,000 live births .
The children are often born apparently normal , and their condition worsens progressively .
Some children are born with ankle equinus or develop hydrocephalus in the first year of life .
Main features are immune deficiency ( manifested by recurrent infections , especially in the first decade of life) , skeletal abnormalities ( mild-to-moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> dysostosis multiplex <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> and deformation of the sternum) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing impairment <END> ( moderate-to-severe sensorineural <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> ) , gradual impairment of mental functions and speech , and often , periods of psychosis .
Associated motor function disturbances include muscular weakness , joint abnormalities and ataxia .
The facial trait include <START:PHENOTYPE> large head <END> with prominent forehead , rounded eyebrows , <START:PHENOTYPE> flattened nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macroglossia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> widely spaced teeth <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> prognathism <END> .
Slight strabismus is common .
The clinical variability is significant , representing a continuum in severity .
The disorder is caused by lysosomal alpha-mannosidase deficiency .
Alpha-mannosidosis is inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> fashion and is caused by mutations in the MAN2B1 gene located on chromosome 19 ( 19 p13.2-q12 ) .
Diagnosis is made by measuring acid alpha-mannosidase activity in leukocytes or other nucleated cells and can be confirmed by genetic testing .
Elevated urinary secretion of mannose-rich oligosaccharides is suggestive , but not diagnostic .
Differential diagnoses are mainly the other lysosomal storage diseases like the mucopolysaccharidoses .
Genetic counseling should be given to explain the nature of the disease and to detect carriers .
Antenatal diagnosis is possible , based on both biochemical and genetic methods .
The management should be pro-active , preventing complications and treating manifestations .
Infections must be treated frequently .
Otolaryngological treatment of fluid in the middle ear is often required and use of hearing aids is invariably required .
Early educational intervention for development of social skills is needed and physiotherapy is important to improve bodily function .
Orthopedic surgery may be necessary .
The long-term prognosis is poor .
There is an insidiously slow progression of neuromuscular and skeletal deterioration over several decades , making most patients wheel-chair dependent .
No patients manage to be completely socially independent .
Many patients are over 50 years of age .
Phenotypic overlap of the BBB and G syndromes .
Three males with similar malformations including <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , have been evaluated .
One also had a laryngotracheoesophageal cleft and therefore was considered to have the G syndrome .
The other two had no stridor , <START:PHENOTYPE> aspiration <END> , or difficulty swallowing , and were considered to have the BBB syndrome .
Both disorders are associated with multiple malformations and can be most readily distinguished by the presence of laryngoesophageal abnormalities in the G syndrome and differences in facial features evident later in childhood .
The BBB syndrome appears to be inherited as an X-linked disorder with the affected female showing only <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> .
The G syndrome exhibits <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> with males more severely affected , although a few few females have had serious malformations in addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> .
In the family with the G syndrome evaluated for this report , the mother of the affected infant had <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , and anosmia , the latter a feature not previously noted in this disorder .
The Gardner-Silengo-Wachtel or genito-palato-cardiac syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> male pseudohermaphroditism <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and conotruncal cardiac defect .
We report on two sib fetuses with similar abnormalities detected prenatally by ultrasound .
The first fetus had <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , was without <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and had <START:PHENOTYPE> low-set ears <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> double outlet right ventricle <END> with a <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , and 46 , XY gonadal dysgenesis .
The second sib fetus was born with cleft lip and palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , transposition of the great vessels , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , a right-sided aorta arch , and bilateral cystic kidneys with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> .
We were able to identify 11 additional cases in the literature with similar findings .
We think this set of defects is a recognizable syndrome that appears to be inherited either as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> or as an X-linked recessive and may overlap with the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome .
Case report and delineation of the congenital hypothalamic hamartoblastoma syndrome ( Pallister-Hall syndrome ) .
We report one new case of congenital hypothalamic hamartoblastoma syndrome ( Pallister-Hall syndrome ) and one case of a diencephalic nodule associated with craniofacial malformations .
Based on a review of 11 cases of Pallister-Hall syndrome documented by pathological examination , two cases presumed by phenotype , three cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothalamic hamartoma <END> with craniofacial anomalies only , and several cases of related interest , we delineate the clinical , neuroradiologic , and neuropathologic manifestations which aid in differential diagnosis .
Clinical manifestations in infants with Pallister-Hall syndrome included postaxial polydactyly with <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dysplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> , apparently low-set , posteriorly angulated ears , kidney and lung anomalies , congenital heart defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> imperforate anus <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micropenis <END> with undescended or <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic testes <END> in males .
These manifestations were associated with varying degrees of <START:PHENOTYPE> panhypopituitarism <END> and pituitary aplasia .
In three cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothalamic hamartoma <END> associated with craniofacial anomalies only , the face resembled that of <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> . Other cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothalamic hamartoma <END> have had associated palate or heart defects or presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> precocious puberty <END> .
Of the infants with a hypothalamic hamartoblastoma at autopsy , neuropathologic findings were consistent with a primitive neuroectodermal tumor .
Surgical tissue from our sole survivor suggested such tumors might mature , and the tumor has not recurred .
Neuroradiologic diagnosis may be difficult but should be attempted in infants with these clinical manifestations ; due to the need for prompt initiation of appropriate therapy .
SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> syndrome , premature centromere separation , and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cranial nerve paralysis <END> in two sisters , one with malignant melanoma .
Two middle age sisters had most manifestations of the SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> syndrome including <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> , symmetric limb deficiencies with <START:PHENOTYPE> radial aplasia <END> and absent thumbs , facial anomalies with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic nasal alae <END> , and borderline to mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Unusual findings included congenital paralysis of some cranial nerves in both patients and malignant melanoma in the proposita .
Cultured lymphocytes from both patients , and skin fibroblasts , Epstein Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes , and tumor cells from the proposita demonstrated <START:PHENOTYPE> premature separation of centromeric heterochromatin <END> ( PCS ) of many chromosomes , a finding noted previously in the SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> syndrome and the similar but more severe Roberts syndrome .
Extensive overlap of the phenotypes of the sisters and 15 other patients with either syndrome and PCS confirms that these are either allelic conditions or the same disease--designated Roberts-SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> syndrome .
The role of PCS in the syndrome(s ) remains uncertain since some patients with the characteristic clinical phenotypes are reported to lack it .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperekplexia <END> : pedigree studies in two families .
We report on 2 unrelated Japanese families , each with several individuals affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperekplexia <END> , a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> exaggerated startle response <END> of neonatal onset .
In the first family , affected relatives included a 4-week-old boy , his mother , grandmother , a maternal uncle , and 2 maternal cousins .
In the second family , affected were a 4-week-old boy , his father , and an elder brother .
These 9 individuals had various combinations of transient infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertonia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokinesia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> exaggerated startle response <END> with falling episodes , nocturnal <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonus <END> and an easily elicited head retraction reflex , <START:PHENOTYPE> hip dislocation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> umbilical hernia <END> .
Treatment with clonazepam was effective in relieving these manifestations in the affected infants and children .
Genetic analysis of these 2 families and 4 others in the literature suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> with considerable variability but complete penetrance .
Another 3 families in the literature were reported , suggesting the existence of startle disorder with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
A sporadic case is also known , presumably representing a fresh mutation of a dominantly inherited trait .
X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> : clinical heterogeneity at a single gene locus .
X-linked hydrocephalus-stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius sequence ( H-SAS , MIM number 30007 ) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of corpus callosum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We confirm here the localisation of the mutant gene on Xq ( Xq 2.8 ) by linkage analysis in a 5-generation pedigree ( maximum lod score of Z = 4.57 at theta = 0.04 with probe St14 at locus DXS52 ) and emphasise the phenotypic variability of the disease .
Ventricular dilatation in affected males was either severe and diagnosed antenatally or moderate and consistent with a long survival with little or no <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> .
Since other X-linked syndromes of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> and flexion deformities of the thumbs have previously been shown to map to the Xq 2.8 region as well ( e.g . MASA syndrome and spastic paraplegia) , the present results raise the question of whether H-SAS syndrome , MASA syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> might represent different phenotypic expression of various mutations at the same locus .
Long-term outcome in Desbuquois dysplasia : a follow-up in four adult patients .
Desbuquois dysplasia is a rare chondrodysplasia characterized by short stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint laxity <END> , and specific radiographic findings .
We report the natural history of four patients ( three boys and one girl ) with Desbuquois dysplasia ages 16-22 years .
The mean height in adulthood was 114 cm ( -8.5 SD ) with progressive deceleration of the growth curve from birth ( -4 SD ) to adulthood .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> was noted consistently and facial abnormalities were still present but less obvious than in childhood .
Three of four patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> of varying degree .
Hyperlaxity was persistent but limited motion of various joints was also noted .
Orthopedic complications included <START:PHENOTYPE> coxa vara <END> or valga ( 3/4) , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ( 3/4) , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> lordosis <END> ( 3/4) , and ambulatory difficulties ( 3/4 ) .
Surgical treatment was necessary for all four patients , involving large joints , spine and hands . Other complications included acute open-angle glaucoma secondary to a congenital malformation of the angle in one case .
In addition to consistent radiological findings , elevated greater trochanter , <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized osteoporosis <END> especially of the spine , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> lordosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> wide metaphyses <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat epiphyses <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> coxa vara <END> or valga were part of the natural history of the disorder .
Our study emphasizes the care of older patients with Desbuquois dysplasia .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Nonprogressive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> maps to chromosome 9q34-9qter in a large consanguineous Lebanese family .
Congenital ataxias are a heterogeneous group of predominantly <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive <END> disorders characterized by hypotonia , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> followed by the appearance of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and often associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and atrophy of the cerebellum .
We performed a genome-wide screen on a large inbred Lebanese family presenting a <START:PHENOTYPE> nonprogressive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> ( MIM 213200) , already described by MÃ©garbanÃ© and colleagues .
The disease locus was assigned to a 12 .1 cM interval on chromosome 9q34-9qter between D9S67 and D9S312 .
Differential diagnosis with other hereditary ataxias linked to the same region is discussed .
Muscle excitability abnormalities in Machado-Joseph disease . To estimate the frequency of and to characterize muscle excitability abnormalities in Machado-Joseph disease ( MJD ) .
Machado-Joseph disease is a common <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> caused by an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Muscle cramps <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> are frequent and sometimes disabling manifestations .
However , their frequency and pathophysiological mechanisms remain largely unknown .
Symptomatic patients with MJD ( hereinafter MJD patients ) with molecular confirmation were assessed prospectively .
A standard questionnaire addressing clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle cramps <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> was used .
The Cramps Disability Scale was used to quantify cramps-related disability .
Patients underwent neurophysiological testing with routine techniques .
F waves of the right median nerves were obtained , and persistence indexes were calculated .
Four muscles (deltoid , first dorsal interossei , tibialis anterior , and vastus lateralis ) were examined by needle electromyography.
A semiquantitative scale ( from 0 [no activity ] to 4 [continuous activity] ) was used to determine the frequency of rest <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> in each muscle .
Fifty MJD patients ( 29 men ) were included in the study .
Their mean age at examination was 46 .3 years , their mean age at onset of the disease was 35 years , and the mean duration of disease was 11 .2 years .
Abnormal CAG(n ) varied from 59 to 75 repeats .
Forty-one patients presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle cramps <END> ; in 10 , this was their first symptom .
The frequency of cramps varied between 1 and 90 episodes a week .
For 15 patients , cramps were the chief complaint , frequently disturbing sleep or work ( Cramps Disability Scale score , 2 or 3 ) . Lower limbs were affected in 37 individuals , but unusual regions , such as the face and abdominal muscles , were also involved .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Fasciculations <END> were found in 25 individuals ; in 8 patients , they included facial muscles .
However , <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> were not a significant complaint for any of these patients .
The clinical and neurophysiological profile of MJD patients with and without cramps was not significantly different .
However , MJD patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> had more severe damage to their peripheral nerves .
Muscle excitability abnormalities were found in 41 MJD patients ( 82%) , and they were the presenting complaint in 10 (20% ) .
They are related to altered excitability of peripheral motor axons , but mechanisms underlying cramps and <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> are possibly distinct in MJD patients .
Delineation of the male phenotype in carniofrontonasal syndrome .
We are reporting on a 4-generation family in which 6 individuals had frontonasal dysplasia with variable extracranial abnormalities .
All affected persons had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , bifid or broad nose , and highly arched palate .
Associated abnormalities included <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and palate ( 1/6 ) , webbed neck ( 2/6 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> Sprengel anomaly <END> ( 2/6 ) , pseudoarthrosis of the clavicle ( 2/6 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> ( 3/6 ) , narrow , <START:PHENOTYPE> sloping shoulders <END> ( 3/6 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> ( 2/6 ) , broad first toe ( 4/6 ) , brachydactyly ( 3/6 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> fifth finger clinodactyly <END> ( 5/6 ) , longitudinal grooves of nails ( 5/6 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> shawl scrotum <END> ( 2/3 males) , first degree <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> ( 1/3) , and mild mental retardation ( 1/6 ) .
Only one affected female had <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> and right coronal synostosis .
Four other affected relatives had varying degrees of <START:PHENOTYPE> facial asymmetry <END> , but normal skull contour .
No male to male transmission is observed , and both daughters of an affected male were affected .
Based on the phenotype of the 3 affected females , craniofrontonasal syndrome ( CFNS ) is the likely diagnosis .
However , there are 3 affected males in this kindred , and 2 of the 3 had significant anomalies .
Affected males also had genital abnormalities and pectus deformity of the chest , not previously reported in this condition .
Two of the 3 males have posterolateral <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphragmatic hernia <END> .
This family expands the phenotype of affected males .
A population genetic study of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
We present epidemiological data for 5197 families with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
Errors in reporting have been analysed .
Analysis of the data provides indications of random mating with respect to whether the partner has the skin disease or not . Data on <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> among parents , siblings and children are provided , and particular attention has been paid to the age at onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Psoriasis <END> was present in the parents of about 36 % of the probands .
In families in which one or both parents have <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> , the occurrence of the disease among the siblings does not provide any information which differentiates between a dominant and recessive mode of inheritance , but is compatible with both .
In families in which neither parent had <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> , provided there was a proband with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> , the probability of the siblings suffering from <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> was close to 0.25 , indicating a recessive mode of inheritance .
The distribution of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> among the parents of all probands , and among the children of probands , was also compatible with this mode of inheritance .
The prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> in the elderly was estimated to be about 5% , and the gene frequency in the whole population 25% .
These findings show that , with regard to first-degree relatives , the inheritance of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> can fit an autosomal recessive model .
The concept of a recessive mode of inheritance may be used as a basis for genetic counselling .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly in a unique Turkish kindred maps to human chromosome 12 .
Finding genes that cause human <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> is not straightforward , since the determinants of blood pressure in primary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> are multifactorial .
One approach to identifying relevant genes is to elucidate rare forms of monogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
A relevant mutation may provide a rational starting point from which to analyse the pathophysiology of a condition affecting 20% of the world 's population .
In 1973 a family with autosomal dominantly inherited brachydactyly and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , where the two traits cosegregated completely , was described .
We have now re-examined this kindred , and localized the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly locus to chromosome 12p in a region defined by markers D12S364 and D12S87 .
As the renin-angiotensin-system and sympathetic nervous system respond normally in this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , the condition resembles essential <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> .
This feature distinguishes this form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> from glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism and Liddle 's syndrome , which are salt-sensitive forms of monogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> with very low plasma renin activity .
We suggest that identification of the gene involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and brachydactyly and its mutation will be of great relevance in elucidating new mechanisms leading to blood pressure elevation .
Autosomal dominant <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> with elevated serum 1 ,25 dihydroxyvitamin D and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
A 14-year-old boy presented with the clinical and radiological features of <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> .
Serum inorganic phosphate levels were constantly low , whereas serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were within the normal range .
Laboratory investigation did not show any evidence for vitamin-D deficiency , chronic renal insufficiency , Fanconi syndrome , tubular acidosis , hepatic disease or intestinal malabsorption .
A family study comprising 34 members over four generations revealed 10 other individuals to be affected and the mode of inheritance to be autosomal dominant .
In addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> and normocalcaemia , the disease is characterized by elevated serum 1 ,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
This hereditary syndrome of renal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> differs from the common familial X-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphataemia <END> and the recently described <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> hypophosphataemic <START:PHENOTYPE> rickets <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> by its dominant mode of inheritance ; it differs from hypophosphataemic non-rachitic bone disease by the elevated serum 1 ,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> .
The desmosterolosis phenotype : <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> with agenesis of corpus callosum and loss of white matter .
Desmosterolosis is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder of elevated levels of the cholesterol precursor desmosterol in plasma , tissue and cultured cells .
With only two sporadic cases described to date with two very different phenotypes , the clinical entity arising from mutations in 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase ( DHCR24) has yet to be defined .
We now describe consanguineous Bedouin kindred with four surviving affected individuals , all presenting with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> with variable degree of hand contractures .
Convulsions near birth , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> were found in most .
Brain MRI demonstrated significant reduction in white matter and near agenesis of corpus callosum in all .
Genome-wide linkage analysis and fine mapping defined a 6.75 cM disease-associated locus in chromosome 1 ( maximum multipoint LOD score of six) , and sequencing of candidate genes within this locus identified in the affected individuals a homozygous missense mutation in DHCR24 leading to dramatically augmented plasma desmosterol levels .
We thus establish a clear consistent phenotype of desmosterolosis ( MIM 602398 ) .
Genetic aspects of early childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> .
Eighty-seven families with early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> were evaluated .
These were divided into 3 groups : resolving infantile idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ( 15 families) , progressive infantile idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ( 21 families) , and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> due to vertebral malformations ( 51 families ) .
The children with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> were subdivided into those who had closed neural arch defects ( 19 families ) and those who did not (32 families ) .
Resolving infantile idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> was usually associated with plagiocephaly , and both deformations tended to show spontaneous recovery .
These children were otherwise normal .
Seven ( 33% ) of the children with progressive infantile idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> were mentally retarded , but only 2 had a congenital malformation .
In contrast , 18 ( 33% ) of the children with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> had other malformations , but only 2 were mentally retarded .
The recurrence risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> was low in each group studied .
However , there was an increased risk ( 4% for sibs ) of neural tube defects in the families with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ( with or without neural arch defects ) .
This sib risk was apparent for probands with only a single hemivertebrum in addition to probands with more extensive vertebral defects and would support an etiological relationship between neural tube defects and other vertebral malformations .
Delineation of an estimated 6.7 MB candidate interval for an <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> gene at 3q26.33-q28 and description of the syndrome associated with visible chromosome deletions of this region .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Anophthalmia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> occur in approximately one in 10 children who have severe <START:PHENOTYPE> visual impairment <END> .
These eye malformations are often of unknown aetiology , but can be inherited in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> , recessive or X-linked forms , and can also occur in association with specific chromosome abnormalities .
Four children are described in the medical literature with <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> in association with chromosome rearrangements involving distal 3q , suggesting the presence of a micro/anophthalmia gene in this region .
We have identified two further patients with micro/anophthalmia and chromosome rearrangements involving 3q26-->3q27 and identified a 6.7 MB common deleted region .
Patient 1 had multiple abnormalities including bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> , abnormalities of the first and second cranial nerves and partial absence of the corpus callosum .
His karyotype was 46 , XY,del(3 ) (q26.33q28 ) .
Patient 2 had right <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> and left extreme <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> .
Her karyotype was 46 , XX,del(3 ) (q26.33q28)t(3;7 ) (q28;q21.1 ) .
Both patients had intrauterine growth retardation ( IUGR ) and strikingly similar dysmorphic facies consisting of bossed forehead , downward-slanting palpebral fissures , grooved bridge of the nose , prominent low-set ears , small down-turned mouth and small mandible .
We identified BAC clones mapping to distal 3q from the ENSEMBL and NCBI Entrez databases .
These BAC clones were used as fluorescence in situ hybridisation ( FISH ) probes to identify the minimum deleted region common to both patients .
This interval , between clones RPC11 -134F2 and RPC11 -132N15 , was estimated to be 6.7 MB .
We conclude that there is an <START:PHENOTYPE> anophthalmia <END> locus within this interval .
Candidate genes mapping to this region include Chordin and DVL3 , a homologue of the Drosophila Dishevelled gene .
Germ-line BRCA1 mutations in Jewish and non-Jewish women with early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> .
Mutations in a germ-line allele of the BRCA1 gene contribute to the familial <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> syndrome .
However , the prevalence of these mutations is unknown in women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> who do not have the features of this familial syndrome .
We sought BRCA1 mutations in women who were given a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> at an early age , because early onset is characteristic of a genetic predisposition to cancer .
Clinical information and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 418 women from the Boston metropolitan area in whom <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> was diagnosed at or before the age of 40 .
A comprehensive BRCA1 mutational analysis , involving automated nucleotide sequencing and a protein-truncation assay , was undertaken in 30 of these women , who had <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> before the age of 30 .
In addition , the BRCA1 mutation 185delAG , which is prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population , was sought with an allele-specific polymerase-chain-reaction assay in 39 Jewish women among the 418 women who had <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> at or before the age of 40 . Among 30 women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> before the age of 30 , 4 ( 13 percent ) had definite , chain-terminating mutations and 1 had a missense mutation .
Two of the four Jewish women in this cohort had the 185delAG mutation .
Among the 39 Jewish women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> at or before the age of 40 , 8 ( 21 percent ) carried the 185delAG mutation ( 95 percent confidence interval , 9 to 36 percent ) .
Germ-line BRCA1 mutations can be present in young women with <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> who do not belong to families with multiple affected members .
The specific BRCA1 mutation known as 185delAG is strongly associated with the onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> in Jewish women before the age of 40 .
Distinctive anthropometric characteristics of women with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> .
We examined the hypothesis that <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> is often associated with an inherited , anthropometrically distinct habitus .
Using standard echo- and phonocardiographic techniques , we identified 60 subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> , 21 first-degree relatives ( 12 with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> and nine normal ) and a control group of 57 normal women .
Patients with "silent " ( echo only ) <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> or the Marfan syndrome were excluded .
Analysis of measurements taken of the first 39 patients and 46 control subjects revealed that , in relation to their height , patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> had narrower anteroposterior chest diameters and longer arm spans than did the women in the control group .
Linear discriminant analysis produced the equation : Z = 17.51 1 + 98 .6 ( anteroposterior chest diameter /height )--27.3 ( arm span /height ) .
Those with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> tended to score below zero ( mean , --0.62 ) , whereas normal subjects tended to score above zero ( mean , --0.39 ; p less than 0.001 ) .
The equation was tested prospectively on 53 subjects , including the 21 family members , and correctly classified 75 percent of all unrelated subjects and 86 percent of the family members as normal or having <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> .
Both <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> and discriminant classification followed an autosomally dominant pattern of inheritance .
We conclude that a significant proportion of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> have an autosomally dominant , inherited , anthropometrically distinct habitus , suggesting that <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> is only one component of a generalized developmental syndrome .
A novel syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular hypoplasia <END> , deafness , and progeroid features associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> , and male <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadism <END> .
Mandibuloacral dysplasia ( MAD ) is an autosomal recessive progeroid disorder associated with type A ( partial ) or B ( generalized ) <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> and is due to mutations in lamin A/ C ( LMNA ) or zinc metalloproteinase ( ZMPSTE24) genes .
The objective of the study was to report a novel syndrome with some overlapping features with MAD .
We report seven patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> mandibular hypoplasia <END> , deafness , progeroid features ( MDP) , and associated lipodystrophy.
These patients have similar features to MAD patients such as <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic mandible <END> , beaked nose , stiff joints , and sclerodermatous skin .
However , the patients did not harbor any disease causing variants in LMNA or ZMPSTE24 and showed distinct characteristics such as sensorineural hearing loss and absence of clavicular hypoplasia and acroosteolysis .
All males with MDP had <START:PHENOTYPE> undescended testes <END> and were hypogonadal .
One adult female showed lack of breast development .
Skinfold thickness , dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging for body fat distribution revealed a lack of <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> in a prepubertal female but a progressive loss of sc fat presenting with partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> in young adults and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> in older patients .
Patients with MDP syndrome have a few overlapping but some distinct clinical features as compared with MAD , suggesting that it is a novel syndrome .
The molecular basis of MDP syndrome remains to be elucidated .
Wolfram syndrome : hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> with brainstem and optic atrophy.
Wolfram syndrome was originally described as a combination of familial juvenile-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> and optic atrophy. Other neurological features subsequently emerged , and " DIDMOAD " ( <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , and deafness ) became a commonly accepted acronym .
Here , we describe 4 further cases from 2 families , in whom there occurred previously unrecognized neurological features , central apnea and neurogenic upper airway collapse , together precipitating primary respiratory failure ( fatal in 1 case) , startle myoclonus ( in 2 unrelated cases) , axial rigidity , and Parinaud 's syndrome .
Magnetic resonance images revealed striking brainstem atrophy affecting , in particular , the pons and midbrain .
The mitochondrial DNA from 3 cases ( and relatives ) showed no evidence of any of the previously reported abnormalities .
These neurological and neuroradiological features , in conjunction with (1 ) analyses showing the neurodegenerative origin of <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , deafness , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes insipidus <END> , and incontinence , (2 ) other previously reported neurological complications ( including anosmia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and neuropsychiatric and cognitive abnormalities) , and (3 ) the very small number of published postmortem studies , indicate that Wolfram syndrome should be reemphasized as a unique hereditary neurodegenerative disorder with prominent <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> .
A distinctive triad of malformations of the central nervous system in the Meckel-Gruber syndrome .
A distinct triad of central nervous system ( CNS ) malformations ( prosencephalic dysgenesis , occipital exencephalocele and rhombic roof dysgenesis ) was present in seven cases of the Meckel-Gruber syndrome examined at autopsy .
We compared our findings with those previously described .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sloping forehead <END> , posterior occipital exencephalocele , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> Chiari malformation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> , polymicrogyria , arhinencephaly , holoprosencephaly and <START:PHENOTYPE> anencephaly <END> constituted a broad spectrum of the reported CNS anomalies .
Few reports contained a comprehensive description of the observed CNS malformations .
In those reports , and in our cases , features of prosencephalic dysgenesis included agenesis of olfactory bulbs and tracts ( arhinencephaly) , hypoplasia of optic nerves and chiasm , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of corpus callosum <END> , fused thalami or complete holoprosencephaly .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> occipital encephalocele <END> has consisted of a displacement of rhombic roof elements , including caudal third ventricle , cerebellar vermis and fourth ventricle , extruded through an enlarged posterior fontanelle rather than through an occipital <START:PHENOTYPE> cranium bifidum <END> and is thus more precisely labeled an exencephalocele .
Different degrees of dysgenesis of posterior fossa structures , described by some as a variant of <START:PHENOTYPE> Dandy-Walker cyst <END> with features of a <START:PHENOTYPE> Chiari malformation <END> , were often associated with this occipital exencephalocele .
This pattern of CNS anomalies represents a triad of malformations probably associated with defective ventral induction of the developing CNS by the prechordal mesoderm .
Further delineation of the Toriello-Carey syndrome : a report of two siblings .
Toriello-Carey is a rare multiple malformation/mental retardation syndrome characterized by dysmorphic features , including <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> /hypertelorism , <START:PHENOTYPE> short palpebral fissures <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> small nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nares <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malformed ears <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> Pierre Robin sequence <END> .
Affected patients also show several other important signs of midline field disruption : <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> laryngeal anomalies <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defects <END> .
Hypotonia and developmental delay are present in most reported cases .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> was proposed , but an X-linked or sex-influenced gene disorder was also suspected .
We report on two siblings , a brother and sister , supporting further an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> type of inheritance .
Both patients had severe clinical presentation with death in early infancy .
Besides clinical findings typical for this condition , they showed additional traits , expanding further the phenotypic spectrum .
A specific malformation pattern observed in the patients presented and , in the previously reported cases , suggests an early midline developmental field disruption , presumably caused by a developmental regulatory gene mutation .

Self-limited neonatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalciuria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> in three siblings .
Three siblings with neonatal familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperparathyroidism <END> diagnosed at age 4 months , 2 months , and 5 days , respectively , were treated .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypercalciuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> were present in each child .
In all three , there were higher responses of serum parathyroid hormone to serum calcium and higher elevation of serum calcium with oral calcium loading .
The metabolism of vitamin D and calcitonin seemed to be intact .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypercalcemia <END> associated with the abnormal response of parathyroid hormone secretion disappeared when the children passed the age of approximately 2 years , although <START:PHENOTYPE> renal tubular acidosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> remained .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> seems likely .
Defining the phenotype in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndrome with a combined congenital defect of glycosylation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> is a genetically heterogeneous condition .
Its molecular basis is largely unknown .
Recently , a combined disorder of N- and O-linked glycosylation was described in children with congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> in association with severe central nervous system involvement , brain migration defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and hearing loss .
We report on seven additional patients with similar clinical features in combination with congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIx .
On the basis of phenotype in 10 patients , we define an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> syndrome .
The patients have a complex phenotype of neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis laxa <END> , transient feeding intolerance , late closure of the fontanel , characteristic facial features including <START:PHENOTYPE> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short nose <END> and small mouth , and developmental delay .
There is a variable degree of the central nervous system involvement and variable systemic presentation .
The biochemical analysis using transferrin isoelectric focusing gives false negative results in some of the youngest patients .
Analysis of the apolipoprotein C-III isoelectric focusing , however , is diagnostic in all cases .
Mutations in MKKS cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome .
Bardet-Biedl syndrome ( BBS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder with locus heterogeneity .
None of the ' responsible ' genes have previously been identified .
Some BBS cases ( approximately 10% ) remain unassigned to the five previously mapped loci .
McKusick-Kaufma syndrome ( MKS ) includes hydrometrocolpos , postaxial polydactyly and congenital heart disease , and is also inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> manner .
We ascertained 34 unrelated probands with classic features of BBS including <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> ( RP) , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and polydactyly .
The probands were from families unsuitable for linkage because of family size .
We found MKKS mutations in four typical BBS probands ( Table 1 ) .
The first is a 13-year-old Hispanic girl with severe RP , PAP , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ( BMI >40 ) .
She was a compound heterozygote for a missense (1042GA , G52D) and a nonsense ( 1679 TA , Y264stop ) mutation in exon 3 . Cloning and sequencing of the separate alleles confirmed that the mutations were present in trans .
A second BBS proband ( from Newfoundland) , born to consanguineous parents , was homozygous for two deletions ( 1316delC and 1324-1326delGTA ) in exon 3 , predicting a frameshift .
An affected brother was also homozygous for the deletions , whereas an unaffected sibling had two normal copies of MKKS .
Both the proband and her affected brother had RP , PAP , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , morbid <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ( BMI >5 0 and 37 , respectively) , lobulated kidneys with prominent calyces and <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> ( diagnosed at ages 33 and 30 , respectively ) .
A deceased sister ( DNA unavailable ) had similar phenotypic features ( RP with blindness by age 13 , BMI >45 , abnormal glucose tolerance test and IQ=64 , <START:PHENOTYPE> vaginal atresia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> of both feet ) .
Both parents and the maternal grandfather were heterozygous for the deletions .
Genotyping with markers from the MKKS region confirmed homozygosity at 20p12 in both affected individuals .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> disorder with muscle contractions resembling neonatal tetanus , characteristic face , <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> , hyperthermia , and sudden death : a new syndrome ?
This work describes an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome observed over the past 25 years in 17 newborn babies ( 8 males , 9 females) , from 12 different families in Southern Sardinia .
This disorder is evident at birth and is characterized by marked muscular contraction of the facial muscles in response to tactile stimuli or during crying , with trismus and abundant salivation simulating a tetanic spasm .
The contractions slowly disappear as the infant calms .
There is also neck muscle hypertonia with a tendency to <START:PHENOTYPE> opisthotonus <END> .
All patients present facial anomalies such as <START:PHENOTYPE> large face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> chubby cheeks <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nose <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nostrils <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> .
The hands show bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> camptodactyly <END> .
The clinical course in all patients was characterized by marked feeding difficulties and appearance of variable fever at about 38 degrees C , with peaks of irregular hyperthermia of over 42 degrees C , with onset ranging from birth to a few weeks .
In some patients these symptoms were accompanied by generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Death occurred after a period of a few weeks to some months and coincided with fever above 42 degrees C . Laboratory investigations performed in all of these cases did not give any useful pathogenetic indications .
Only patients 10 and 16 are still alive today .
Patient 10 is now 14 years old .
She presents slow regression of the dystonic symptomatology , while dysthermia and mild psychomotor delay persist .
Apparently novel genetic syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnoid cysts <END> .
We report on an apparently new syndrome in a consanguineous family with seven members , three of whom have cerebral anomalies including <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnoid cysts <END> along with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
The two patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> disorders also had multiple enlarged perivascular spaces seen in the white matter of the centrum semiovale .
Our data provide a contribution to the accumulating knowledge on familial cerebral anomalies including <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnoid cysts <END> and lissencephaly .
Given the lack of mutation in known lissencephaly genes such as LIS1 , 14-3-3epsilon , and DCX , this syndrome may constitute a new phenotype with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
An oculocerebrofacial syndrome .
A syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> mongoloid slant <END> to the palpebral fissures , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> optic atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> preauricular skin tags <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> small mandible <END> is described in four ( including one set of twins ) of seven sibs born to unaffected , nonconsanguineous parents of German ancestry .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> mode of inheritance seems most likely .
A newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome with short stature and oculo-skeletal involvement .
This report describes a young girl and her cousin presenting with postnatal short stature , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , rhizomelic shortening of the long bones , short and slightly bowed humeri with <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent deltoid tuberosities <END> , short and <START:PHENOTYPE> wide ribs <END> and clavicles , dorso-lumbar <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> biconcave vertebral bodies <END> of the thoraco-lumbar spine , and narrowed lumbar canal .
In addition , in the girl there were <START:PHENOTYPE> amelogenesis imperfecta <END> of the hypomaturation type , and the radiographs showed short distal ulnae , sloping epiphyses of the radii , <START:PHENOTYPE> short femoral necks <END> , and slightly flat uncovered femoral heads .
The children 's parents are first cousins .
Differential diagnoses are discussed and the possibility of a newly recognized oculo-skeletal syndrome is raised .

Di George anomaly and velocardiofacial syndrome .
The velocardiofacial syndrome is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , cardiac anomalies , characteristic facies , and learning disabilities .
The Di George anomaly involves developmental defects of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches , resulting in thymic and <START:PHENOTYPE> parathyroid hypoplasia <END> and cardiac defects .
The cases of individuals in two families help substantiate the notion that the Di George anomaly occurs as a feature of the velocardiofacial syndrome .
The proband in family 1 was a male infant with persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> and cardiac defects consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> truncus arteriosus <END> , atrial septal defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , and abnormal aortic arch vessels .
Autopsy revealed absence of thymic and parathyroid tissue , and the Di George anomaly was diagnosed .
His father had a submucous <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , T cell dysfunction , and facial features consistent with the velocardiofacial syndrome .
This is the third case of male-to-male transmission of velocardiofacial syndrome .
The proband of family 2 was a 4-year-old girl with <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , persistent neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , T cell dysfunction , and facial features of the velocardiofacial syndrome .
The Di George anomaly has been reported to occur in at least 18 different disorders .
The observation that the Di George anomaly is a component manifestation of the velocardiofacial syndrome in these two families provides further evidence that the Di George anomaly is not a distinct syndrome of a single origin but rather a heterogeneous developmental field defect .
It is proposed that all previously reported cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> Di George anomaly are examples of the velocardiofacial syndrome .
Elevated plasma 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations in infants with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> and an <START:PHENOTYPE> elfin facies <END> .
We measured plasma concentrations of 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D ( 1 ,25- ( OH)2D) in the course of a 6-to-37-month survey of four children with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> and an <START:PHENOTYPE> elfin facies <END> ( Williams syndrome ) .
Levels of 1 ,25- ( OH)2D were elevated ( 16 0 to 470 pg per milliliter ) during the hypercalcemic phase of the disease , when the children were five to nine months old , and they decreased thereafter .
Plasma 1 ,25 ( OH)2D levels were higher than those found in three children ( 16 to 60 months old ) with the <START:PHENOTYPE> elfin facies <END> syndrome and no <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> ( 42 to 71 pg per milliliter ) and eight children ( 1 to 36 months old ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> and no dysmorphy ( 12 to 140 pg per milliliter ) , including two children with vitamin D intoxication . <START:PHENOTYPE> Hypercalcemia <END> in the three children with <START:PHENOTYPE> elfin facies <END> was controlled by a low-calcium diet .
Serum calcium levels fell to the normal range , and plasma 1 ,25- ( OH)2D levels were normal for age ( 18 to 105 pg per milliliter ) at 14 to 47 months of age , even after appropriate therapy had been discontinued .
These observations suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercalcemia <END> may be the consequence of abnormal synthesis or degradation of 1 ,25- ( OH)2D in children with the <START:PHENOTYPE> elfin facies <END> syndrome .
A new feature of the <START:PHENOTYPE> ablepharon <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> syndrome : zygomatic arch absence .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> ablepharon <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> syndrome is an extremely rare congenital anomaly .
It is characterised by bilateral absence or hypoplasia of lower eyelids , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> and multiple other congenital anomalies .
Three cases have been reported ( McCarthy and West , 1977 ; Hornblass and Reifler , 1985 ) .
In addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> ablepharon <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> , other anomalies common to all patients include auricular deformity , nasal alar deformity , absence of lanugo hair , dry , ichthyotic skin and <START:PHENOTYPE> ambiguous genitalia <END> .
A new feature of the syndrome is described--absence of the zygomatic arches .
In addition , an expanded and revised classification of the <START:PHENOTYPE> ablepharon <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> macrostomia <END> syndrome and related disorders is presented .
Skin graft <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> in this black patient has been prevented by prolonged application of sun block .
E-cadherin germline mutations in familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
The identification of genes predisposing to familial <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> is an essential step towards understanding the molecular events underlying tumorigenesis and is critical for the clinical management of affected families .
Despite a declining incidence , gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> remains a major cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> death worldwide , and about 10 % of cases show familial clustering .
The relative contributions of inherited susceptibility and environmental effects to familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> are poorly understood because little is known of the genetic events that predispose to gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Here we describe the identification of the gene responsible for early-onset , histologically poorly differentiated , high grade , diffuse gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> in a large kindred from New Zealand ( Aotearoa ) .
Genetic linkage analysis demonstrated significant linkage to markers flanking the gene for the calcium-dependent cell-adhesion protein E-cadherin .
Sequencing of the E-cadherin gene revealed a G --> T nucleotide substitution in the donor splice consensus sequence of exon 7 , leading to a truncated gene product .
Diminished E-cadherin expression is associated with aggressive , poorly differentiated carcinomas .
Underexpression of E-cadherin is a prognostic marker of poor clinical outcome in many tumour types , and restored expression of E-cadherin in tumour models can suppress the invasiveness of epithelial tumour cells .
The role of E-cadherin in gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> susceptibility was confirmed by identifying inactivating mutations in other gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> families .
In one family , a frameshift mutation was identified in exon 15 , and in a second family a premature stop codon interrupted exon 13 . These results describe , to our knowledge for the first time , a molecular basis for familial gastric <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> , and confirm the important role of E-cadherin mutations in <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> .
Association between deletion size and important phenotypes expands the genomic region of interest in Phelan-McDermid syndrome ( 22q13 deletion syndrome ) .
The clinical features of Phelan-McDermid syndrome ( also known as 22q13 deletion syndrome ) are highly variable and include hypotonia , speech and other developmental delays , autistic traits and mildly dysmorphic features .
Patient deletion sizes are also highly variable , prompting this genotype-phenotype association study .
Terminal deletion breakpoints were identified for 71 individuals in a patient cohort using a custom-designed high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridisation platform with a resolution of 100 bp . Patient deletion sizes were highly variable , ranging from 0.22 to 9.22 Mb , and no common breakpoint was observed .
SHANK3 , the major candidate gene for the neurologic features of the syndrome , was deleted in all cases .
Sixteen features ( <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal hypotonia <END> , neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> hyporeflexia <END> , neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> feeding problems <END> , speech/language delay , delayed age at crawling , delayed age at walking , severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , male genital anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysplastic toenails <END> , large or fleshy hands , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tall stature <END> , facial asymmetry , full brow , atypical reflexes and <START:PHENOTYPE> dolichocephaly <END> ) were found to be significantly associated with larger deletion sizes , suggesting the role of additional genes or regulatory regions proximal to SHANK3 .
Individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) were found to have smaller deletion sizes ( median deletion size of 3.39 Mb ) than those without ASDs ( median deletion size 6.03 Mb , p= 0.0144 ) .
This may reflect the difficulty in diagnosing ASDs in individuals with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
This genotype-phenotype analysis explains some of the phenotypic variability in the syndrome and identifies new genomic regions with a high likelihood for causing important developmental phenotypes such as <START:PHENOTYPE> speech delay <END> .
Variability of expression of the orofaciodigital syndrome type I in black females : six cases . Orofaciodigital syndrome type I ( OFD I ) includes striking orodental , facial , digital , renal , and central nervous system ( CNS ) abnormalities .
Frequently associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , OFD I is inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked dominant <END> trait , lethal in males .
Here , we report the variable expressivity of OFD I in 6 black U.S . females and review findings in 2 previously reported black patients .
Only these 8 of over 160 reported cases involve blacks .
Abnormalities observed in black patients are similar to those observed in whites , but with specific differences .
Only 25% of the blacks had <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and none was observed with midline cleft of the upper lip .
Among whites , 80% have <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and 45 % midline cleft of the upper lip .
These findings suggest that racial genetic factors may protect lip and palate development in blacks , even in the presence of the OFD I gene .
CNS abnormalities , including <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephaly <END> , cystic brain lesions , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , were present in 5 0 % of our the cases .
This figure is greater than previously reported .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Polycystic kidneys <END> were present in 3 of our patients .
Including a previously reported patient , 5 0 % of the black OFD I patients show <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidneys <END> .
Hyperplastic and supernumerary frenula , with or without brachydactyly , have been shown to be strong diagnostic criteria in our patients .
New findings reported here include intracranial berry <START:PHENOTYPE> aneurysm <END> , periodontal disease , and lip pits .
Clinicians treating these patients should be aware of the pleiotropic manifestations of the syndrome , which may include renal and CNS anomalies .
Ultrasonic and computed tomography scan studies are indicated in patients diagnosed with OFD I .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cataracts <END> , radiculomegaly , septal heart defects and hearing loss in two unrelated adult females with normal intelligence and similar facial appearance : confirmation of a syndrome ?
Two unrelated , adult females with normal intelligence are described .
They show a similar clinical picture with a long and <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcornea <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> , a short nose , a <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal tip <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> long philtrum <END> , bilateral hearing loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> persistent primary teeth <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> oligodontia <END> , variable root length including dental radiculomegaly , heart defects and cutaneous syndactyly of the 2nd-3rd toes .
Abnormalities present in only one of the two patients were a <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> and a transverse vaginal septum , respectively .
There are numerous similarities between our two patients and the family described by Wilkie et al . ( ( 1993 ) : Clin Dysmorphol 2 : 114-119 ) and all may be examples of the same entity .
Craniofacial dysostosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , genital hypoplasia , ocular , dental , and digital defects : confirmation of the Gorlin- Chaudhry-Moss syndrome .
We report clinical , orofacial and radiological manifestations in a 4-year-old girl and a 33-year-old female with the Gorlin- Chaudhry-Moss ( GCM ) syndrome .
Typical findings in the GCM syndrome are <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , stocky body build , <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , small eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> , highly arched and <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malocclusion <END> , abnormally shaped teeth , oligodontia , <START:PHENOTYPE> microdontia <END> , low scalp hairline , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> of scalp , face , trunk and limbs and genital hypoplasia .
Radiological features include premature synostosis of the coronal suture , <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , and maxillary under-development .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypoplasia of the distal phalanges <END> of fingers and toes ( also present in the 2 original cases ) represents a further manifestation of the GCM syndrome .
Hypoprebetalipoproteinemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pallidal degeneration <END> ( HARP syndrome ) .
We describe the clinical and laboratory studies of an 11-year-old girl with prominent <START:PHENOTYPE> orofacial dyskinesia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive dementia <END> .
Investigations revealed hypoprebetalipoproteinemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> , atypical <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , and evidence of iron deposition in the pallidal nuclei .
Electroneuromyography and skin and sural nerve biopsies were normal .
The "eye-of-the-tiger " sign , used to describe the pallidal nuclei in Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome , was present on T2-weighted MRIs ( GE Signa , 1.5 T) . Phase-contrast microscopy of whole blood showed 80 to 90 % <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytes <END> whose morphology was confirmed by electron microscopy .
High-resolution lipoprotein electrophoresis demonstrated an absence of the pre-beta fraction .
This case differs phenotypically from the previous reports of Hallervorden-Spatz disease with <START:PHENOTYPE> acanthocytosis <END> by the presence of prominent <START:PHENOTYPE> orofacial dyskinesia <END> and abnormal serum lipoproteins .
Prediction of the risk of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , using DNA polymorphisms within the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> gene .
Using molecular cloning , we earlier isolated the " <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> gene " ; mutations or deletions at this locus are associated with the hereditary predisposition to some human cancers , especially <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> . To develop diagnostic tests for such a predisposition , we identified restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms ( RFLPs ) within the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> gene and tested their usefulness in predicting the risk of cancer in 20 families with members who had hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
We were able to make predictions in 19 of the 20 kindreds .
In 18 kindreds , we demonstrated a consistent association of marker RFLPs with the mutation predisposing to <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
In the 19th kindred , there may be a lack of cosegregation of the DNA polymorphisms within the gene and the site of the mutation predisposing to <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> .
However , there is uncertainty about the clinical diagnosis of the retinal lesion in a key member of this kindred ; if the lesion is not a <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , there is no discrepancy between the DNA polymorphisms and the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> trait .
We conclude that it is feasible and clinically useful to use these DNA polymorphisms to determine the risk of cancer .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> : evidence for an X chromosome <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> locus .
A family of 5 affected male infants in 2 generations with an <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> pattern of inheritance is described .
All affected infants manifested intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , severe psychomotor retardation , growth failure , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphallus <END> , and death during infancy .
Three of the affected patients had radiological studies that demonstrated findings consistent with pachygyria-agyria and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> .
We believe that this family represents a form of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> pachygyria-agyria ( <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> ) that has not been described previously and suggests a locus for <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> on the X chromosome .
Clinical heterogeneity in lymphoedema-distichiasis with FOXC2 truncating mutations .
Hereditary lymphoedema-distichiasis ( LD ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder that classically presents as <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> of the limbs , with variable age of onset , and extra aberrant growth of eyelashes from the Meibomian gland ( <START:PHENOTYPE> distichiasis <END> ) . Other major reported complications include cardiac defects , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , and extradural cysts .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Photophobia <END> , exotropia , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , congenital ectropion , and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> are additional eye findings .
Recently , we reported that truncating mutations in the forkhead transcription family member FOXC2 resulted in LD in two families .
The clinical findings in seven additional families with LD , including the original family described by Falls and Kertesz , were determined and mutational analyses were performed .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Distichiasis <END> was the most common clinical feature followed by age dependent <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoedema <END> .
There is a wide variation of associated secondary features including <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> .
The mutational analyses identified truncating mutations in all of the families studied ( two nonsense , one deletion , three insertion , and one insertion-deletion ) , which most likely result in haploinsufficiency of FOXC2 .
FOXC2 mutations are highly penetrant with variable expressivity which is not explicable by the pattern of mutations .
Natural history of symptomatic partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency .
We reviewed the natural history and differential diagnosis of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency ( an X-linked inborn error of urea synthesis ) in 13 symptomatic female heterozygotes .
The patients presented as early as the first week of life or as late as the sixth year .
The most common symptoms before diagnosis were nonspecific : episodic extreme <START:PHENOTYPE> irritability <END> (10 0 percent ) , episodic <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> (10 0 percent ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> protein avoidance <END> (92 percent ) , ataxia ( 77 percent ) , Stage II <START:PHENOTYPE> coma <END> ( 46 percent ) , delayed physical growth ( 38 percent ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> ( 38 percent ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( 23 percent ) .
Including the proband , 42 percent of the female members of the 13 families studied had symptoms .
The median interval between the onset of major symptoms ( <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> coma <END> ) and diagnosis was 16 months ( range , 1 to 142 ) .
Five patients had IQ scores below 70 at the time of diagnosis .
We suggest that careful evaluation of the family history , the dietary history , the episodic nature of the nonspecific symptoms , the response of these symptoms to the withdrawal of protein , and their frequent onset at the time of weaning from breast milk will permit early diagnosis and might thereby reduce the risk of death or neurologic impairment in female patients with partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency .
Association of IL12B promoter polymorphism with severity of atopic and non-atopic <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> in children .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> is a frequent cause of hospital admission , especially among children .
The main environmental triggers of airway inflammation in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> are viruses and aeroallergens .
These agents elicit reciprocal immune responses , characterised by production of T helper 1 and T helper 2 cytokines , respectively .
There is no genetic explanation for how hyper-responsiveness to these disparate environmental stimuli develops among individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Our aim was to assess relation between an IL12B promoter polymorphism and <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
We did a cohort study in which we initially genotyped 411 6-year olds for the IL12B promoter polymorphism .
We then assessed the relation between this polymorphism and <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> severity .
A further 85 asthmatic children in an additional sample of 433 children from the same cohort were then assessed to confirm these findings .
We also examined in-vitro interleukin-12 responses in a subgroup of individuals .
Heterozygosity for the IL12B promoter polymorphism was observed in 76 % ( 16 ) of atopic and non-atopic individuals with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> in the initial sample .
By comparison , heterozygotes comprised only 31 % ( 17 ) of the moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> group , and 48 % (20) of individuals with mild <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> were heterozygous , as were unaffected controls .
These findings were confirmed in the second sample ( overall p< 0.0001 ) .
Our data suggest that IL12B promoter heterozygosity contributes to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> severity rather than susceptibility per se .
The severity-predisposing genotype was associated with reduced interleukin 12 p40 gene transcription and decreased interleukin 12 p70 secretion .
Interleukin 12 plays a key part in antagonism of T helper 2 differentiation , and in induction of antiviral host defense .
Genetically determined attenuation of interleukin-12 response capacity would , therefore , provide a plausible common immunological pathway to disease severity for the two major forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> .
Novel mutations in G protein-coupled receptor gene ( P2RY5 ) in families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> ( LAH3 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> ( LAH3 ) is a rare hair disorder characterized by sparse hair on scalp and the rest of the body of affected individuals .
Recently mutations in a G protein-coupled receptor gene , P2RY5 , located at LAH3 locus , have been reported in several families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> simplex and <START:PHENOTYPE> woolly hair <END> .
For the present study , 22 Pakistani families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> were enrolled .
Genotyping using microsatellite markers linked to three <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> ( LAH1 , LAH2 , LAH3 ) showed the linkage of 2 families to the LAH2 locus and 14 to the LAH3 locus .
The remaining 6 families were not linked to any of the three loci .
Families linked to LAH3 locus were further subjected to screening of the P2RY5 gene with direct DNA sequencing .
Three previously reported variants , c.69ins CATG ( p.24ins Hfs52 ) , c.188 A > T ( p.D63V ) and c.565 G > A ( p.E189K ) were observed in eight families .
Four novel nonsynonymous sequence variants , c.8 G > C ( p.S3T) , c.36ins A ( p.D13RfsX16 ) , c.16 0ins A ( p.N54TfsX58 ) and c.436 G > A ( p.G146R ) were found to segregate within six families .
Evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> in Romano-Ward <START:PHENOTYPE> long QT syndrome <END> .
Analysis of 23 families .
The Romano-Ward long-QT Syndrome ( LQTS ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> inherited trait characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> prolonged QT interval <END> on ECG , life-threatening arrhythmias , <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , and sudden death in affected individuals .
A gene responsible for this disorder has been shown to be linked to the Harvey ras-1 locus ( H-ras-1 ) DNA marker on the short arm of chromosome 11 ( 11p ) in 7 families .
The purpose of this study was to determine , by analyzing 23 families with LQTS for linkage to chromosome 11p , whether evidence exists for more than one gene causing LQTS ( ie , locus <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> ) .
Twenty-three families ( 262 family members ) were clinically evaluated using medical histories , ECGs , and Holter recordings .
Each corrected QT interval ( QTc ) were determined using Bazett 's formula .
Blood for DNA extraction and cell line immortalization was obtained after informed consent .
Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction were performed , and linkage analysis carried out using the LINKAGE computer program ( v 5. 03 ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Genetic heterogeneity <END> was determined using the HOMOG 2 ( v 2.51 ) computer program .
Twenty-three families were studied for evidence of linkage to chromosome 11p using the H-ras-1 locus probe pTB B-2 and multiple flanking markers , including tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) .
Two-point linkage analysis using pTB B-2 and TH markers was consistent with linkage in 15 of 23 families , with the maximum single-family LOD score of +3.038 occurring at theta = 0 . However , 8 of 23 families had negative LOD scores , with the values in 4 families being less than -2 at theta = 0 , consistent with exclusion of linkage .
Analysis with the HOMOG program was consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> ( P < .0001 ) .
Multipoint linkage data using pTB B-2 and TH were also examined for evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> .
HOMOG analysis of multipoint LOD scores from 100 cM surrounding the H-ras-1 locus also supported <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> ( P < .001 ) .
In the 23 families with LQTS analyzed for linkage to the H-ras-1 locus on chromosome 11p15 .5 , 15 of 23 families had LOD scores consistent with linkage .
The remaining 8 of 23 families had negative LOD scores , 4 of which were definitively excluded from linkage .
Thus , <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> is definitively ( P < .001 ) demonstrated for this disorder .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypertrichosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> , abnormal corpus callosum , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and dysmorphic features in three unrelated females .
We report three unrelated patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , mild to moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and dysmorphic facial features including <START:PHENOTYPE> low anterior hairline <END> , thick <START:PHENOTYPE> arched eyebrows <END> , nose with broad tip and columella below alae nasi , <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , thick drooping lower lip and simple <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated ears <END> .
They also had rough skin with hyperkeratotic plaques .
Feet and finger tips were broad .
All of them had personality problems like <START:PHENOTYPE> aggressiveness <END> , stubborn temperament or tendency to withdraw .
Brain MRI showed thick and <START:PHENOTYPE> short corpus callosum <END> .
We believe that these patients represent a new syndrome of unknown aetiology .
A distinct dysmorphic syndrome with spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and probable <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
Two brothers and their sister aged 8 , 13 , and 7 years were found to have unusual facies ( gross , rough and abundant hair , <START:PHENOTYPE> wide forehead <END> , mild palpebral <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> small nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anteverted nostrils <END> , thick lips , and down-slanting corners of the mouth) , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed psychomotor development <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , feet deformities , and limb and gait <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
The characteristic clinical picture in the three sibs , once compared with other ataxic syndromes , allowed one to conclude that this could correspond to a distinct entity probably inherited as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder .
Multipoint linkage analysis of loci in the proximal long arm of the human X chromosome : application to mapping the <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> locus .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Choroideremia <END> ( McK30310 ) , an X-linked retinal dystrophy , causes progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> night blindness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> visual field constriction <END> , and eventual central blindness in affected males by the third to fourth decade of life .
The biochemical basis of the disease is unknown , and prenatal diagnosis is not available .
Subregional localization of the <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> locus to Xq13-22 was accomplished initially by linkage to two restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms ( RFLPs ) , DXYS1 ( Xq13-q21.1 ) and DXS3 ( Xq21.3-22 ) .
We have now extended our linkage analysis to 12 families using nine RFLP markers between Xp11 .3 and Xq26 .
Recombination frequencies of 0%-4% were found between <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> and five markers ( PGK , DXS3 , DXYS12 , DXS72 , and DXYS1 ) located in Xq13-22 .
The families were also used to measure recombination frequencies between RFLP loci to provide parameters for the program LINKMAP .
Multipoint analysis with LINKMAP provided overwhelming evidence for placing the <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> locus within the region bounded by DXS1 ( Xq11 -13 ) and DXS17 ( Xq21.3-q22 ) .
At a finer level of resolution , multipoint analysis suggested that the <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> locus was proximal to DXS3 ( 384 :1 odds ) rather than distal to it .
Data were insufficient , however , to distinguish between a gene order that puts <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> between DXS3 and DXYS1 and one that places <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> proximal to both RFLP loci .
These results provide linkage mapping of <START:PHENOTYPE> choroideremia <END> and RFLP loci in this region that will be of use for further genetic studies as well as for clinical applications in this and other human diseases .
Pheochromocytomas , multiple endocrine <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> type 2 , and von Hippel-Lindau disease . <START:PHENOTYPE> Pheochromocytoma <END> is a feature of two disorders with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> pattern of inheritance--multiple endocrine <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> type 2 ( MEN-2 ) ( with medullary thyroid carcinoma and hyperparathyroidism ) and von Hippel-Lindau disease ( with angioma of the retina , hemangioblastoma of the central nervous system , renal-cell carcinoma , pancreatic cysts , and epididymal cystadenoma ) .
The frequency of these syndromes in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> is not known .
In an unselected group of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> , we performed pentagastrin tests , parathyroid hormone assays , computed tomography ( CT) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of the brain , ophthalmoscopy , CT imaging of the abdomen , and ultrasonography of the testes .
We also screened members of families with MEN-2 or von Hippel-Lindau disease for <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> by measuring plasma and urine catecholamines and plasma chromogranin A and by performing abdominal ultrasonography , CT and MRI , and metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy.
Nineteen of 82 unselected patients with pheochromocytomas ( 23 percent ) were carriers of familial disorders ; 19 percent had von Hippel-Lindau disease and 4 percent had MEN-2 .
Prospectively , in 36 of 79 subjects at risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> ( 46 percent ) , 42 unsuspected pheochromocytomas were found .
Overall , there were 130 patients with 185 pheochromocytomas ; 43 had von Hippel-Lindau disease , 24 had MEN-2 , and 63 had sporadic tumors .
The patients with familial and those with sporadic pheochromocytomas differed in mean age at diagnosis (32 vs . 46 years , P < 0.001 ) , multifocal localization (55 vs . 8 percent , P < 0.001 ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> ( 0 vs . 11 percent , P = 0.005 ) ; but not in the frequency of extraadrenal tumors ( 24 vs . 16 percent ) .
Thirty-eight percent of carriers of von Hippel-Lindau disease and 24 percent of carriers of MEN-2 had <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> as the only manifestation of their syndrome .
All patients with pheochromocytomas should be screened for MEN-2 and von Hippel-Lindau disease to avert further morbidity and mortality in the patients and their families .
All patients in families with MEN-2 or von Hippel-Lindau disease should be screened for <START:PHENOTYPE> pheochromocytoma <END> , even if they are asymptomatic .
Is <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperprolinemia <END> type I actually a benign trait ?
Report of a case with severe neurologic involvement and vigabatrin intolerance .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperprolinemia <END> type I is a deficiency of proline oxidase ( McKusick 23950 ) , leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperprolinemia <END> and iminoglycinuria , usually with renal involvement .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hyperprolinemia <END> type I is considered a benign trait .
We reported a case of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperprolinemia <END> type I with a severe neurologic disorder and without renal involvement .
The patient had marked <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor delay <END> and right hemiparesis .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> was characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> status epilepticus <END> or a cluster of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Laboratory findings revealed elevated levels of proline in the serum , urine , and cerebrospinal fluid without delta1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate dehydrogenase in the plasma or urine .
Fluorescence in situ hybridization excluded a chromosome 22q11 deletion .
Vigabatrin inhibits ornithine transaminase .
Thus , vigabatrin could lead to a depletion of the normal pool of pyrroline 5-carboxylate dehydrogenase and could aggravate the clinical condition of the child .
In this study , vigabatrin was discontinued .
In the following months , the patient had marked psychomotor improvement , without modification of the <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> .
We suggest that vigabatrin should be avoided in <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperprolinemia <END> type I .
Borate transporter SLC4A11 mutations cause both Harboyan syndrome and non-syndromic corneal endothelial dystrophy.
Harboyan syndrome , or <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal dystrophy <END> and perceptive <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> ( CDPD) , consists of congenital corneal endothelial dystrophy and progressive perceptive <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , and is transmitted as an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> trait .
CDPD and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> , non-syndromic congenital hereditary endothelial <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal dystrophy <END> ( CHED2 ) both map at overlapping loci at 20p13 , and mutations of SLC4A11 were reported recently in CHED2 .
A genotype study on six families with CDPD and on one family with either CHED or CDPD , from various ethnic backgrounds ( in the seventh family , <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> could not be assessed because of the proband 's young age ) , is reported here .
Novel SLC4A11 mutations were found in all patients .
Why some mutations cause <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> in addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal dystrophy <END> is presently unclear .
These findings extend the implication of the SLC4A11 borate transporter beyond <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal dystrophy <END> to perceptive <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> .
Fronto-ocular syndrome : newly recognized <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> syndrome .
We describe an apparently unique disorder , Fronto-Ocular syndrome , present in a mother and her two daughters , and comprising <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> due to coronal and metopic craniosynostosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypotelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular proptosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthal folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic supraorbital ridges <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated nasal bridge <END> , thin philtrum , <START:PHENOTYPE> high-arched palate <END> and a narrow bifrontal region .
Both daughters have glabellar <START:PHENOTYPE> capillary hemangiomas <END> , a congenital heart defect and mild developmental disabilities .
Review of the literature failed to disclose any syndrome with similar findings .
It is likely that this disorder represents an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> condition , that arose as a new mutation in the mother .
Mutational analysis of fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) 1 and FGFR2 failed to identify the molecular basis of the disorder .

Evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic heterogeneity <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital stationary night blindness <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital stationary night blindness <END> ( CSNB ) is a nonprogressive retinal disorder characterized by disturbed or absent night vision ; its clinical features may also include myopia , nystagmus , and impaired visual acuity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> CSNB is clinically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> , and it may also be genetically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> .
We have studied 32 families with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> CSNB , including 11 families with the complete form of CSNB and 21 families with the incomplete form of CSNB , to identify genetic-recombination events that would refine the location of the disease genes .
Critical recombination events in the set of families with complete CSNB have localized a disease gene to the region between DXS556 and DXS8083 , in Xp11 .4-p11 .3 . Critical recombination events in the set of families with incomplete CSNB have localized a disease gene to the region between DXS722 and DXS8023 , in Xp11 .23.
Further analysis of the incomplete-CSNB families , by means of disease-associated-haplotype construction , identified 17 families , of apparent Mennonite ancestry , that share portions of an ancestral chromosome .
Results of this analysis refined the location of the gene for incomplete CSNB to the region between DXS722 and DXS255 , a distance of 1.2 Mb .
Genetic and clinical analyses of this set of 32 families with <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> CSNB , together with the family studies reported in the literature , strongly suggest that two loci , one for complete ( CSNB1 ) and one for incomplete ( CSNB2 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> CSNB , can account for all reported mapping information .
Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene mutation ( c.319C>T) presents with clinical heterogeneity and is candidate founder mutation in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish origin .
We report 10 children ( 7 male , 3 female) , 3 homozygous for c.319C> T mutation and 7 heterozygous for c.319C> T on one allele and c.625G >A variant on the other in the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( SCAD ) gene ( ACADS ) .
All were of Ashkenazi Jewish origin in which group we found a c.319C> T heterozygote frequency of 1 :15 suggesting the presence of a founder mutation or selective advantage .
Phenotype was variable with onset from birth to early childhood .
Features included hypotonia ( 8 /10 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> ( 8 /10 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> ( 4/10 ) with multicore changes in two and lipid storage in one , <START:PHENOTYPE> facial weakness <END> ( 3/10 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> ( 5 /10 ) , feeding difficulties ( 4/10 ) and congenital abnormalities ( 3/7 ) .
One female with multiminicore <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> had progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> external ophthalmoplegia <END> , ptosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> with pneumonia and respiratory failure .
Two brothers presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> psychosis <END> , pyramidal signs , and multifocal <START:PHENOTYPE> white matter abnormalities <END> on MRI brain suggesting additional genetic factors .
Two other infants also had white matter changes .
Elevated butyrylcarnitine ( 4/8 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> ethylmalonic aciduria <END> ( 9/9) , methylsuccinic aciduria ( 6/7) , decreased butyrate oxidation in lymphoblasts ( 2/4 ) and decreased SCAD activity in fibroblasts or muscle ( 3/3 ) were shown .
Expression studies of c.319C> T in mouse liver mitochondria showed it to be inactivating .
c.625G >A is a common variant in ACADS that may confer disease susceptibility .
Five healthy parents were heterozygous for c.319C> T and c.625G >A , suggesting reduced penetrance or broad clinical spectrum .
We conclude that the c.319C> T mutation can lead to wide clinical and biochemical phenotypic variability , suggesting a complex multifactorial/polygenic condition .
This should be screened for in individuals with multicore <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , particularly among the Ashkenazim .
The telomere of human chromosome 1p contains at least two independent <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> genes .
Multiple genetic causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> have been identified , both as a component of syndromes and in families that present with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> .
Linkage analysis was used to map the genetic locus in a six generation Australian family presenting with total <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> .
Microsatellite markers located across all known <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> loci were genotyped in all recruited family members of the Tasmanian family .
Both two point and multipoint linkage analysis were used to assess each locus under an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model .
Significant linkage was detected at the telomere of the p arm of chromosome 1 , with a maximum two point LOD of 4.21 at marker D1S507 , a maximum multipoint exact LOD of 5.44 , and an estimated location score of 5.61 at marker D1S507 .
Haplotype analysis places the gene inside a critical region between D1S228 and D1S199 , a distance of approximately 6 megabases .
The candidate gene PAX7 residing within the critical interval was excluded by direct sequencing in affected individuals .
This is the third report of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> linkage to 1ptel .
The critical region as defined by the shared haplotype in this family is clearly centromeric from the Volkmann cataract locus identified through study of a Danish family , indicating that two genes causing <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataract <END> map to the telomeric region of chromosome 1p .
Kartagener 's syndrome .
Kartagener 's syndrome , characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> , paranasal <START:PHENOTYPE> sinusitis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> , is part of a more generalized syndrome characterized by sterility in men , chronic bronchitis or <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic sinusitis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic otitis media <END> ; it is referred to as the immotile-cilia syndrome .
Those patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> will give a typical radiological appearance allowing an early diagnosis ; however , in those patients with immotile-cilia syndrome who have normal visceral situs , a high index of suspicion and early electron microscopic examination of respiratory tract cilia will be necessary for early diagnosis and therapy to prevent irreversible <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> and lung destruction .
We describe a young woman with <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> situs inversus <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic sinusitis <END> , found to have abnormal respiratory epithelium cilia .
Secretory <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> protein-losing enteropathy <END> , enterocolitis cystica superficialis , intestinal lymphangiectasia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> : a new syndrome .
Four infants had noninfectious intractable <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , anasarca , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> , and malnutrition within the first 3 months of life .
Their parents originated from the same Northeastern part of Quebec , and consanguinity was found in two kindreds .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Diarrhea <END> was secretory in three infants ( mean stool volume 87 ml/kg/day , Na+ 108 mEq/L , Cl- 85 mEq/L ) .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Hypoalbuminemia <END> ( mean 2.0 gm/dl) , present in all infants , appeared to be secondary to a <START:PHENOTYPE> protein-losing enteropathy <END> , which was documented in two infants .
Histologic examination of the upper small intestine showed only mild to moderate villous atrophy.
The remarkable findings were those of cystic dilation of the crypts and acute inflammation of crypts and lamina propria , all of which were most prominent in the colon and terminal ileum ; the changes were progressive over time .
Mild lymphangiectasia was found in all of the patients .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> , present in all , was associated in one patient with a nonfunctional multicystic kidney .
Prolonged total parenteral nutrition , intravenously administered albumin , antisecretory agents , and antibiotics were unsuccessful in controlling the disease .
Although a total colectomy was followed by a temporary decrease in stool output and normalization of serum albumin concentration in one infant , the patients died between 4 and 21 months of age .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cleft lip <END> and palate , characteristic facial appearance , <START:PHENOTYPE> malrotation <END> of the intestine , and lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> in two sibs : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition ?
A chromosomally normal brother and sister shared a lethal pattern of anomalies including <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral cleft lip and palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , flat facial profile , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat occiput <END> , complex <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> malrotation <END> of the intestine .
The male was <START:PHENOTYPE> large for gestational age <END> , while his sister was normally grown .
The girl had bifid thumbs , but the boy had only minor hand anomalies .
These findings are not consistent with any previously recognized syndrome and represent a new condition with probable <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mental retardation <END> , congenital heart defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and facial anomalies : a new X-linked multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome : clinical description and molecular studies .
We report on two brothers and their two maternal uncles with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , congenital heart defect , cleft or highly arched palate , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> and craniofacial anomalies consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , abnormal ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> bulbous nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> malar hypoplasia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> .
Three of the four patients died at an early age .
The mother of the two brothers had an <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> .
She is assumed to be a manifesting carrier of a mutant gene , which is expressed in her two sons and two brothers .
By multipoint linkage analysis it is found that the most likely location of the responsible gene is the pericentromeric region Xp21.3-q21.3 with DMD and DXS3 as flanking markers .
Maximum information is obtained with marker DXS453 ( Z = 1.2 0 at theta = 0.0 ) .
Mutations in DNMT1 cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , deafness and <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , deafness and <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> ( ADCA-DN ) is characterized by late onset (30-40 years old ) <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> , sensory neuronal deafness , narcolepsy-cataplexy and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
We performed exome sequencing in five individuals from three ADCA-DN kindreds and identified DNMT1 as the only gene with mutations found in all five affected individuals .
Sanger sequencing confirmed the de novo mutation p.Ala57 0Val in one family , and showed co-segregation of p.Val606Phe and p.Ala57 0Val , with the ADCA-DN phenotype , in two other kindreds .
An additional ADCA-DN kindred with a p.GLY605Ala mutation was subsequently identified .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Narcolepsy <END> and deafness were the first symptoms to appear in all pedigrees , followed by <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
DNMT1 is a widely expressed DNA methyltransferase maintaining methylation patterns in development , and mediating transcriptional repression by direct binding to HDAC2 .
It is also highly expressed in immune cells and required for the differentiation of CD4+ into T regulatory cells .
Mutations in exon 20 of this gene were recently reported to cause hereditary sensory neuropathy with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> and hearing loss ( HSAN1 ) .
Our mutations are all located in exon 21 and in very close spatial proximity , suggesting distinct phenotypes depending on mutation location within this gene .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , deafness/malformed ears , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> and peculiar facies in a mother and son .
We report a mother and son who have a <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> with a characteristic dysmorphic face .
Prominent manifestations include <START:PHENOTYPE> facial asymmetry <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent glabella <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , low-set , <START:PHENOTYPE> cup-shaped ears <END> , thick , <START:PHENOTYPE> protruding lower lip <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We conclude that these patients have a previously undescribed type of genetic <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
The mother has become normocephalic and we would not have been able to diagnose her condition without her childhood photographs .
Such photographs are essential in the recognition of familial syndromes .
Schinzel-Giedion syndrome : report of splenopancreatic fusion and proposed diagnostic criteria .
We report on the 46th patient with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome ( SGS ) and the first observation of splenopancreatic fusion in this syndrome .
In the antenatal period , a male fetus was found to have bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> .
Postnatally , in keeping with a diagnosis of SGS , there were large fontanelles , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular hypertelorism <END> , a wide , broad forehead , midface retraction , a short , <START:PHENOTYPE> upturned nose <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macroglossia <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> . Other anomalies included cardiac defects , widened and dense long bone cortices , cerebral <START:PHENOTYPE> ventriculomegaly <END> , and abnormal fundi .
Splenopancreatic fusion , usually encountered in trisomy 13 , was found on autopsy .
Schinzel-Giedion syndrome is likely a monogenic condition for which neither the heritability pattern nor pathogenesis has yet been determined .
A clinical diagnosis may be made by identifying the facial phenotype , including <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , midface retraction , and short , <START:PHENOTYPE> upturned nose <END> , plus one of either of the two other major distinguishing features : typical skeletal abnormalities or <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> .
Typical skeletal anomalies include a sclerotic skull base , wide supraoccipital-exoccipital synchondrosis , increased cortical density or thickness , and <START:PHENOTYPE> broad ribs <END> . Other highly supportive features include neuroepithelial tumors ( found in 17% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrichosis <END> , and brain abnormalities .
Severe developmental delay and poor survival are constant features in reported patients .

<START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> recessive inheritance of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> : clinical features and preliminary linkage analysis .
Three generations of a family exhibit a unique syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyramidal tract signs <END> , and adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> .
Initial signs , manifested by 2 to 3 years of age , are delayed walking and <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> .
During their teens , the patients develop mild but progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pyramidal tract signs <END> .
Memory problems in the third decade initiate a <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive dementia <END> , leading to death in the sixth decade .
Laboratory investigations failed to disclose a biochemical basis for the syndrome .
Preliminary molecular linkage studies have been conducted , and although the specific position of the responsible gene on the X chromosome has not yet been determined , the q26-qter region and much of the p arm are unlikely sites for this gene .
The linkage studies are continuing .
Differences in the gyral pattern distinguish chromosome 17-linked and <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> or "smooth brain " is a human brain malformation that consists of diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> agyria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> .
Two genes associated with classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> have recently been cloned-LIS1 from chromosome 17p13.3 and XLIS ( also called DCX ) from Xq22.3-q23.
We performed genotype-phenotype analysis in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> associated with mutations of different genes .
We compared the phenotype , especially brain imaging studies , in a series of 48 children with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , including 12 with Miller-Dieker syndrome ( MDS) , which is associated with large deletions of LIS1 and other genes in the region , 24 with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> sequence caused by smaller LIS1 deletions or mutations , and 12 with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> sequence caused by XLIS mutations .
We found consistent differences in the gyral patterns , with the malformation more severe posteriorly in individuals with LIS1 mutations and more severe anteriorly in individuals with XLIS mutations .
Thus , mutations of LIS1 are associated with a posterior-to-anterior gradient of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , whereas mutations of XLIS are associated with an anterior-to-posterior gradient .
We also confirmed differences in severity between MDS and ILS17 .
Hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis proved to be more common with XLIS mutations .
It is often possible to predict the gene mutation from careful review of brain imaging studies .
Mutations in the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger gene AE1 cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> but not <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> distal renal tubular acidosis <END> .
Primary <START:PHENOTYPE> distal renal tubular acidosis <END> (dRTA ) is characterized by reduced ability to acidify urine , variable hyperchloremic hypokalemic metabolic acidosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> , and nephrolithiasis .
Kindreds showing either <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> or recessive transmission are described .
Mutations in the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger AE1 have recently been reported in four <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> dRTA kindreds , three of these altering codon Arg589 .
We have screened 26 kindreds with primary dRTA for mutations in AE1 .
Inheritance was <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> in seventeen kindreds , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> in one , and uncertain due to unknown parental phenotype or sporadic disease in eight kindreds .
No mutations in AE1 were detected in any of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> kindreds , and analysis of linkage showed no evidence of linkage of recessive dRTA to AE1 .
In contrast , heterozygous mutations in AE1 were identified in the one known dominant dRTA kindred , in one sporadic case , and one kindred with two affected brothers .
In the dominant kindred , the mutation Arg-589/ Ser cosegregated with dRTA in the extended pedigree .
An Arg-589/His mutation in the sporadic case proved to be a de novo mutation .
In the third kindred , affected brothers both have an intragenic 13-bp duplication resulting in deletion of the last 11 amino acids of AE1 . These mutations were not detected in 80 alleles from unrelated normal individuals .
These findings underscore the key role of Arg-58 9 and the C terminus in normal AE1 function , and indicate that while mutations in AE1 cause <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> dRTA , defects in this gene are not responsible for recessive disease .
Respiration-deficient cells are caused by a single point mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> tRNA-Leu ( UUR ) gene in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ( MELAS ) .
MELAS ( <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial myopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> strokelike episodes <END> ) is a major subgroup of heterogeneous <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> diseases .
For identifying a mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> gene , we isolated , from the same muscle tissue from a patient with MELAS , cell lines with distinctly different phenotypes : one was respiration-deficient , and the other was apparently normal .
Compared with the normal cells , only one A-to-G nucleotide transition at nucleotide 3243 in the tRNA-Leu ( UUR ) gene was found in whole mtDNA of the respiration-deficient cells .
This mutation was also found in eight patients , from unrelated families , who had MELAS in a heteroplasmic manner but was not found in control individuals .
Therefore , the single point mutation causes the functional abnormality in the respiratory chain of mitochondria .
Hydrometrocolpos and polydactyly : a common neonatal presentation of Bardet-Biedl and McKusick-Kaufman syndromes .
McKusick-Kaufman syndrome ( MKKS ) is a rare , recessively inherited syndrome reported mainly in young children and is characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> vaginal atresia <END> with hydrometrocolpos , postaxial polydactyly , and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> .
Bardet-Biedl syndrome ( BBS ) is the generic name for a genetically heterogeneous group of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorders characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> ( appearing usually between 10 and 20 years of age ) , postaxial polydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , nephropathy , and mental disturbances , or , occasionally , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
Typically , MKKS is diagnosed ( and reported ) in very young children , whereas the diagnosis of BBS often is delayed to the teenage years .
We report here a series of nine patients diagnosed in infancy with MKKS because of the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> vaginal atresia <END> and postaxial polydactyly , who later developed <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dystrophy <END> , thus turning out to be instances of BBS .
The overlap of BBS and MKKS is a real diagnostic pitfall and its importance has to be stressed , for genetic counselling , for clinical management and follow up , and for molecular approaches .
The diagnosis of MKKS should be considered with caution in all published cases described exclusively in the neonatal period and in those with <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
We strongly recommend all children seen in infancy with a diagnosis of MKKS to be re-evaluated for RP and other signs of BBS .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> ( ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome ) is linked to chromosome 9q34 .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> ( ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome [ AOA] ; MIM 208920) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> choreoathetosis <END> .
These neurological features resemble those of ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT) , but in AOA there are none of the extraneurological features of AT , such as immunodeficiency , neoplasia , chromosomal instability , or sensitivity to ionizing radiation .
It is unclear whether these patients have a true disorder of chromosomal instability or a primary neurodegenerative syndrome , and it has not been possible to identify the defective gene in AOA , since the families have been too small for linkage analysis .
We have identified a new family with AOA , and we show that the patients have no evidence of chromosomal instability or sensitivity to ionizing radiation , suggesting that AOA in this family is a true primary <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar ataxia <END> .
We have localized the disease gene , by linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping , to a 15 .9-cM interval on chromosome 9q34 .
This work will ultimately allow the disease gene to be identified and its relevance to other types of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> cerebellar ataxias to be determined .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Macrocephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis marmorata <END> , haemangioma and syndactyly--a distinctive <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> syndrome .
We describe nine children with a similar pattern of features including <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cutis marmorata <END> telangiectatica congenita .
All were large at birth and had a distinctive capillary haemangioma involving the philtrum and upper lip .
The seven who survived all developed <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrocephalus <END> and had <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> .
Six developed body asymmetry and three had internal arteriovenous malformations .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Syndactyly <END> of the second and third toes and/or the third and fourth fingers or toes was commonly seen .
All of the cases were <START:PHENOTYPE> sporadic <END> .
This condition is easily recognizable and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> overgrowth <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> .
Recurrent reciprocal 16p11 .2 rearrangements associated with global developmental delay , behavioural problems , dysmorphism , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , and abnormal head size .
Deletion and the reciprocal duplication in 16p11 .2 were recently associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and developmental delay .
We indentified 27 deletions and 18 duplications of 16p11 .2 were identified in 0.6 % of all samples submitted for clinical array-CGH ( comparative genomic hybridisation ) analysis .
Detailed molecular and phenotypic characterisations were performed on 17 deletion subjects and ten subjects with the duplication .
The most common clinical manifestations in 17 deletion and 10 duplication subjects were speech/language delay and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> .
Other phenotypes in the deletion patients included motor delay (5 0% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( approximately 40% ) , behavioural problems ( approximately 40% ) , congenital anomalies ( approximately 30% ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> ( approximately 20% ) .
The phenotypes among duplication patients included motor delay ( 6/10 ) , behavioural problems ( especially <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <END> ( ADHD) ) ( 6/10 ) , congenital anomalies ( 5 /10 ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( 3/10 ) .
Patients with the 16p11 .2 deletion had statistically significant <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> ( p< 0.0017 ) and 6 of the 10 patients with the duplication had microcephaly .
One subject with the deletion was asymptomatic and another with the duplication had a normal cognitive and behavioural phenotype .
Genomic analyses revealed additional complexity to the 16p11 .2 region with mechanistic implications .
The chromosomal rearrangement was de novo in all but 2 of the 10 deletion cases in which parental studies were available .
Additionally , 2 de novo cases were apparently mosaic for the deletion in the analysed blood sample .
Three de novo and 2 inherited cases were observed in the 5 of 10 duplication patients where data were available .
Recurrent reciprocal 16p11 .2 deletion and duplication are characterised by a spectrum of primarily neurocognitive phenotypes that are subject to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> observed with deletion and ADHD and microcephaly seen in duplication patients support a diametric model of <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> spectrum and psychotic spectrum behavioural phenotypes in genomic sister disorders .
Genetic analysis of PSORS1 distinguishes guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> and palmoplantar pustulosis .
The PSORS1 locus in the major histocompatibility complex region is the major genetic determinant for <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> vulgaris .
Within the PSORS1 region reside at least three potential candidate genes for <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> susceptibility .
Specific allelic variants of the genes HLA-Cw*6 , HCR*WWCC , and CDSN*5 are strongly associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> vulgaris and are in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other .
We have genotyped the three <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> vulgaris susceptibility alleles of the PSORS1 locus in two clinical variants of <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> ( guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> and palmoplantar pustulosis ) to study whether PSORS1 is also involved in the pathogenesis of these variants .
We also asked whether these two clinical subgroups could help us to distinguish the causative gene within the high-risk PSORS1 haplotype .
The association of guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> with the three PSORS1 susceptibility alleles was similar and even stronger than seen with <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> vulgaris .
Palmoplantar pustulosis , however , did not show association with any of the three candidate genes at this locus .
Finally , no correlation with the age of onset for disease was observed .
Our results show conclusively that <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> vulgaris and guttate <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> have a similar genetic basis for their association to PSORS1 , whereas palmoplantar pustulosis appears to be a distinct disorder .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> : overview and guidelines for management .
Families with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> inherited predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> have been described .
More recently , germline E-cadherin/CDH1 mutations have been identified in hereditary diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> kindred .
The need to have protocols to manage and counsel these families in the clinic led a group of geneticists , gastroenterologists , surgeons , oncologists , pathologists , and molecular biologists to convene a workshop to produce consensus statements and guidelines for familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> .
Review of the available <START:PHENOTYPE> cancer <END> pathology from people belonging to families with documented germline E-cadherin/CDH1 mutations confirmed that the gastric cancers were all of the diffuse type .
Criteria to define the different types of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> syndromes were agreed .
Foremost among these criteria was that review of histopathology should be part of the evaluation of any family with aggregation of <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> cases .
Guidelines for genetic testing and counselling in hereditary diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> were produced .
Finally , a proposed strategy for clinical management in families with high penetrance <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> predisposition to <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric cancer <END> was defined .
Mutant GlialCAM causes megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts , benign familial <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> with retardation and autism .
Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts ( MLC ) is a leukodystrophy characterized by early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and delayed-onset neurological deterioration .
Recessive MLC1 mutations are observed in 75 % of patients with MLC .
Genetic-linkage studies failed to identify another gene .
We recently showed that some patients without MLC1 mutations display the classical phenotype ; others improve or become normal but retain <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> . To find another MLC-related gene , we used quantitative proteomic analysis of affinity-purified MLC1 as an alternative approach and found that GlialCAM , an IgG-like cell adhesion molecule that is also called HepaCAM and is encoded by HEPACAM , is a direct MLC1-binding partner .
Analysis of 40 MLC patients without MLC1 mutations revealed multiple different HEPACAM mutations .
Ten patients with the classical , deteriorating phenotype had two mutations , and 18 patients with the improving phenotype had one mutation .
Most parents with a single mutation had <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , indicating dominant inheritance .
In some families with dominant HEPACAM mutations , the clinical picture and magnetic resonance imaging normalized , indicating that HEPACAM mutations can cause benign familial <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> .
In other families with dominant HEPACAM mutations , patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with or without autism .
Further experiments demonstrated that GlialCAM and MLC1 both localize in axons and colocalize in junctions between astrocytes .
GlialCAM is additionally located in myelin .
Mutant GlialCAM disrupts the localization of MLC1- GlialCAM complexes in astrocytic junctions in a manner reflecting the mode of inheritance .
In conclusion , GlialCAM is required for proper localization of MLC1 .
HEPACAM is the second gene found to be mutated in MLC .
Dominant HEPACAM mutations can cause either <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> with or without autism or benign familial <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> .

A missense mutation in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein as a cause of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Narcolepsy <END> is a rare sleep disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> excessive daytime sleepiness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> accounts for less than 10 % of all <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> cases .
However , documented multiplex families are very rare and causative mutations have not been identified to date . To identify a causative mutation in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> , we performed linkage analysis in the largest ever reported family , which has 12 affected members , and sequenced coding regions of the genome ( exome sequencing ) of three affected members with <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataplexy <END> .
We successfully mapped a candidate locus on chromosomal region 6p22.1 ( LOD score Â¼ 3.85 ) by linkage analysis .
Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation in the second exon of MOG within the linkage region .
A c.398 C> G mutation was present in all affected family members but absent in unaffected members and 775 unrelated control subjects .
Transient expression of mutant myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( MOG ) in mouse oligodendrocytes showed abnormal subcellular localization , suggesting an altered function of the mutant MOG . MOG has recently been linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders and is considered as a key autoantigen in multiple sclerosis and in its animal model , experimental autoimmune encephalitis .
Our finding of a pathogenic MOG mutation highlights a major role for myelin and oligodendrocytes in <START:PHENOTYPE> narcolepsy <END> and further emphasizes glial involvement in neurodegeneration and neurobehavioral disorders .

TUBA1A mutations : from isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> to familial <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> .
Mutations in the TUBA1A gene have been reported in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> and perisylvian <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> .
Twenty-five patients with malformations of cortical development ranging from <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> to <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> were screened for mutations in TU BA1 A .
Two novel heterozygous missense mutations in TUBA1A were identified : c.629A> G ( p.Tyr210Cys ) occurring de novo in a boy with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> , and c.13A> C ( p.Ile5Leu ) affecting 2 sisters with <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> whose mother presented somatic mosaicism for the mutation .
Mutations in TUBA1A have been described in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> .
We report a mutation in TUBA1A as a cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> polymicrogyria <END> .
So far , all mutations in TUBA1A have occurred de novo , resulting in isolated cases .
This article describes familial recurrence of TUBA1A mutations due to somatic mosaicism in a parent .
These findings broaden the phenotypic spectrum associated with TUBA1A mutations and have implications for genetic counseling .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal recessive inheritance <END> of a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> ?
We report on 3 brothers with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> .
Parents are first cousins once removed ; the father has apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> .
An apparently normal paternal uncle who is married to a second cousin also has a daughter with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of Fallot <END> .
All similarly affected relatives have mild or borderline mental retardation .
The combination of anomalies may represent a previously undescribed <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder .
Clinical and molecular characterization defines a broadened spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> ( ARPKD ) .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic kidney disease <END> ( ARPKD ) is generally considered an infantile disorder with the typical presentation of greatly enlarged echogenic kidneys detected in utero or within the neonatal period , often resulting in neonatal demise .
However , there is an increasing realization that survivors often thrive into adulthood with complications of the ductal plate malformation , manifesting as <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> and Caroli disease , becoming prominent .
Previous natural history studies have concentrated almost exclusively on the infantile presenting group .
However , developments in understanding the genetic basis of ARPKD , through identification of the disease gene , PKHD1 , have allowed exploration of the etiology in patients with ARPKD-like disease or <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> presenting later in childhood or as adults .
In the current study we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records , and where possible performed PKHD1 mutation screening , in patients diagnosed with ARPKD or <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> at the Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , from 1961 to 2004 .
Of a total of 133 cases reviewed , 65 were considered to meet the diagnostic criteria with an average duration of follow-up of 8.6 +/- 6.4 years .
Fifty-five cases had ARPKD and 10 had isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> with no or minimal renal involvement .
The patients were analyzed as 3 groups categorized by the age at diagnosis ; <1 years ( n = 22) , 1-20 years ( n = 23) , and >2 0 years ( n = 20) .
The presenting feature in the neonates was typically associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal enlargement <END> , but in the older groups , more often involved manifestations of liver disease , including hepatosplenomegaly , hypersplenism , variceal bleeding , and cholangitis .
During follow-up , 22 patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> renal insufficiency <END> and 8 developed end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) , most from the neonatal group .
Liver disease was evident on follow-up in all diagnostic groups but particularly prevalent in those diagnosed later in life .
A total of 12 patients died , 6 in the neonatal period , but 86 % of patients were alive at 40 years of age .
The likelihood of being alive without ESRD differed significantly between the diagnostic groups with 36% , 80% , and 88 % survival in the 3 diagnostic groups , respectively , 20 years after the diagnosis .
Considerable evidence of intrafamilial phenotype variability was observed .
Mutation analysis was performed in 31 families and at least 1 mutation was detected in 25 ( 81% ) , with 76 % of mutant alleles detected in those cases .
Consistent with the relatively mild disease manifestations in this population , the majority of changes were missense ( 79% ) and no case had 2 truncating changes .
Mutations were detected in all diagnostic groups , indicating that <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hepatic fibrosis <END> with minimal kidney involvement can result from PKHD1 mutation .
The finding of 6 cases with no detected mutations may represent missed mutations or possible evidence of genetic heterogeneity .
The current study indicates a broadened spectrum for the ARPKD phenotype and that later presenting cases with predominant liver disease should be considered part of ARPKD .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Restless legs syndrome <END> : diagnostic criteria , special considerations , and epidemiology .
A report from the <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> diagnosis and epidemiology workshop at the National Institutes of Health .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Restless legs syndrome <END> is a common yet frequently undiagnosed sensorimotor disorder .
In 1995 , the International <START:PHENOTYPE> Restless Legs Syndrome <END> Study Group developed standardized criteria for the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> .
Since that time , additional scientific scrutiny and clinical experience have led to a better understanding of the condition .
Modification of the criteria is now necessary to better reflect that increased body of knowledge , as well as to clarify slight confusion with the wording of the original criteria .
The <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> diagnostic criteria and epidemiology workshop at the National Institutes of Health .
Members of the International <START:PHENOTYPE> Restless Legs Syndrome <END> Study Group and authorities on epidemiology and the design of questionnaires and scales .
To modify the current criteria for the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> , to develop new criteria for the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> in the cognitively impaired elderly and in children , to create standardized criteria for the identification of augmentation , and to establish consistent questions for use in epidemiology studies .
The essential diagnostic criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> restless legs syndrome <END> were developed and approved by workshop participants and the executive committee of the International <START:PHENOTYPE> Restless Legs Syndrome <END> Study Group . Criteria were also developed and approved for the additional aforementioned groups .
A novel KIT mutation results in <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> with progressive depigmentation .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Piebaldism <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder of melanocyte development characterized by white skin ( leukoderma ) and white hair ( poliosis ) .
In general , <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> has been distinguished from vitiligo by the presence of lesions from birth , the <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperpigmented macules <END> of depigmented and normal skin , and the static course .
We hypothesized that an 8-year-old girl and her mother who had unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> of a progressive nature would have a novel mutation of the KIT gene , the gene that is altered in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> , or of the MITF ( microphthalmia activating transcription factor ) gene , which would be expected to cause type II Waardenburg syndrome , but is associated with a phenotype of progressive depigmentation in mice .
Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood of affected and unaffected family members , and the KIT and MITF genes were sequenced .
Genetic analysis of genomic DNA from both the mother and daughter with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> revealed a novel Val620Ala ( 1859 T>C ) mutation in the KIT gene , which was not detected in family members without progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> or in 52 normal control individuals .
This KIT mutation affects the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and thus predicts a severe phenotype , as was the case in this family .
Although other KIT mutations in the vicinity of codon 620 lead to the standard phenotype of static <START:PHENOTYPE> piebaldism <END> , the Val620Ala mutation is novel and may result in a previously undescribed phenotype with melanocyte instability , leading to progressive loss of pigmentation as well as the progressive appearance of the <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperpigmented macules <END> .
Genotype-phenotype analysis of TCF4 mutations causing Pitt-Hopkins syndrome shows increased <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> activity with missense mutations .
Pitt-Hopkins syndrome is characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , characteristic dysmorphic features , and susceptibility to childhood-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and intermittent episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperventilation <END> .
This syndrome is caused by haploinsufficiency of TCF4 , which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor .
Missense , nonsense , splice-site mutations , and gene deletions have been found in individuals with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome .
Previous reports have suggested that the Pitt-Hopkins syndrome phenotype is independent of mutation or deletion type .
We screened 13 ,186 individuals with microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization .
We also conducted a review of the literature and statistical analysis of the phenotypic features for all individuals with confirmed mutations or deletions of TCF4 .
We identified seven individuals with TCF4 deletions .
All patients have features consistent with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome , although only three have breathing anomalies , and none has <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
Our review of previously reported cases with TCF4 mutations and deletions showed that all patients with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome reported to date have severe psychomotor retardation , the onsets of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperventilation <END> episodes are limited to the first decade in most reported patients with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperventilation <END> episodes are more common than <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and are seen in the oldest patients , and individuals with missense TCF4 mutations are more likely to develop <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> .
On the basis of an analysis of published cases , we propose a genotype-phenotype correlation of increased <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> activity with missense TCF4 mutations .
Fatal infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy and renal dysfunction due to cytochrome-c-oxidase deficiency .
A 1-month-old boy was admitted because of <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> .
He was floppy and had bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , diminished reflexes , and poor suck .
He had aspiration pneumonia , developed <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and died at age 3 1/2 months .
Laboratory data showed <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> glycosuria <END> and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> aminoaciduria <END> .
He was an only child , and family history was negative .
Muscle biopsy showed large clumps of granules positive with oxidative enzyme stains and increased lipid droplets .
Ultrastructural studies showed large aggregates of mitochondria , many of which were greatly enlarged and contained disoriented or concentric whorls of cristae and paracrystalline inclusions .
Cytochrome c oxidase was absent in fresh frozen sections by histochemical staining .
By biochemical assay , cytochrome c oxidase ( cytochrome aa3 ) was 6% of normal in muscle biopsy and undetectable in autopsy muscle ; spectra and content of cytochromes showed lack of cytochrome aa3 , decreased cytochrome b and normal cytochrome cc1 .
In kidney , cytochrome-c-oxidase activity was 38 % of normal and spectra showed decreased cytochromes aa3 and b .
The association of fatal infantile <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and renal dysfunction was previously reported by Van Biervliet et al and appears to be a distinct nosologic entity , one of the few biochemically defined <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> myopathies .
Clinical and molecular genetic spectrum of congenital deficiency of the leptin receptor .
A single family has been described in which <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> results from a mutation in the leptin-receptor gene ( LEPR) , but the prevalence of such mutations in severe , early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> has not been systematically examined .
We sequenced LEPR in 300 subjects with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphagia <END> and severe early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , including 90 probands from consanguineous families , and investigated the extent to which mutations cosegregated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and affected receptor function .
We evaluated metabolic , endocrine , and immune function in probands and affected relatives .
Of the 300 subjects , 8 ( 3% ) had nonsense or missense LEPR mutations--7 were homozygotes , and 1 was a compound heterozygote .
All missense mutations resulted in impaired receptor signaling .
Affected subjects were characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphagia <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , alterations in immune function , and <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed puberty <END> due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism .
Serum leptin levels were within the range predicted by the elevated fat mass in these subjects .
Their clinical features were less severe than those of subjects with congenital leptin deficiency .
The prevalence of pathogenic LEPR mutations in a cohort of subjects with severe , early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> was 3% . Circulating levels of leptin were not disproportionately elevated , suggesting that serum leptin cannot be used as a marker for leptin-receptor deficiency .
Congenital leptin-receptor deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis in any child with <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphagia <END> and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in the absence of developmental delay or dysmorphism .

Plasma lipoproteins in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> and monogenic familial hypertriglyceridemia .
Plasma lipoprotein concentration , composition , and size were evaluated in two common familial forms of hypertriglyceridemia and compared with those in normal subjects .
The very low density lipoproteins ( VLDL ) were triglyceride-enriched in familial hypertriglyceridemia ( triglyceride/apoprotein B ratio : 25.7 +/- 8 .9 ) as compared to normal ( 9.6 +/- 12 .2 , P < 0.001 ) or familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> ( 9.7 +/- 3.3 , P < 0.001 ) .
The diameter of VLDL was larger in familial hypertriglyceridemia ( 3.27 +/- 0.28 pm ) than in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> ( 2.87 +/- 0.16 pm , P < 0.02 ) .
Although in familial hypertriglyceridemia VLDL tended to be larger , and in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> VLDL tended to be smaller than normal ( 3.08 +/- 0.48 pm) , neither of these differences were significant .
While VLDL was normally distributed in the control population , the size was skewed to larger particles in familial hypertriglyceridemia with fewer small particles ( P < 0.05 ) and skewed to smaller particles in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> with fewer large particles ( P < 0.05 ) .
VLDL was reciprocally related to low density lipoproteins ( LDL ) in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> ( r = -0.8 0 to -0.87 ) suggesting that the concentrations of these individual lipoprotein groups were somehow interrelated .
There was no significant relationship between these two lipoprotein classes in familial hypertriglyceridemia or in normals .
In familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> , the apoprotein A-I/A-II ratio was below normal ( P < 0.01 ) suggestive of low HDL(2 ) levels .
This change in apoprotein composition was independent of VLDL or LDL concentration .
In familial hypertriglyceridemia , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol was reduced ( 33% below mean normal ) and HDL triglyceride was increased ( by 46% ) , while the concentration of apoA- I and apoA-II was normal .
VLDL triglyceride was inversely related to HDL cholesterol in familial hypertriglyceridemia ( r = -0.74 , P < 0.005 ) , but not in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> .
The large , triglyceride-enriched VLDL observed in familial hypertriglyceridemia is compatible with the reported increase in VLDL triglyceride synthesis seen in this disorder .
The increase in VLDL apoprotein B synthesis previously reported in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> was associated with VLDL of normal composition .
The changes in HDL cholesterol in these two disorders might reflect exchange of triglyceride between VLDL and HDL or could be related to transfer of surface components during the catabolism of VLDL .
The reciprocal relationship between various components of VLDL and LDL seen in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> combined hyperlipidemia <END> , but not in familial hypertriglyceridemia or in normal subjects , might provide some insight into the pathological abnormalities in these disorders .
The differences between these two common familial forms of hypertriglyceridemia provide further support that they are distinct entities .-Brunzell , J . D. , J . J . Albers , A . Chait , S . M . Grundy , E . Groszek , and G . B . McDonald .

Gender , genotype , and phenotype differences in Smith-Magenis syndrome : a meta-analysis of 105 cases .
Smith-Magenis syndrome ( SMS ) is a multisystem disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , a distinctive behavioral phenotype , and <START:PHENOTYPE> sleep disturbance <END> .
We undertook a comprehensive meta-analysis to identify genotype-phenotype relationships to further understand the clinical variability and genetic factors involved in SMS .
Clinical and molecular information on 105 patients with SMS was obtained through research protocols and a review of the literature and analyzed using Fisher 's exact test with two-tailed p values .
Several differences in these groups of patients were identified based on genotype and gender .
Patients with RAI1 mutation were more likely to exhibit overeating , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , polyembolokoilamania , self-hugging , muscle cramping , and dry skin and less likely to have <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , hearing loss , frequent ear infections , and heart defects when compared with patients with deletion , while a subset of small deletion cases with deletions spanning from TNFRSF13B to MFAP4 was less likely to exhibit <START:PHENOTYPE> brachycephaly <END> , dental anomalies , iris abnormalities , <START:PHENOTYPE> head-banging <END> , and hyperactivity .
Significant differences between genders were also identified , with females more likely to have <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , eating/appetite problems , cold hands and feet , and frustration with communication when compared with males .
These results confirm previous findings and identify new genotype-phenotype associations including differences in the frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , hearing loss , ear infections , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , overeating , heart defects , self-injury , self-hugging , dry skin , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and hyperactivity among others based on genotype .
Additional studies are required to further explore the relationships between genotype and phenotype and any potential discrepancies in health care and parental attitudes toward males and females with SMS .
Clinical features distinguish childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> associated with tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) from <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> in the general paediatric population .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Chordoma <END> , an age-dependent rare cancer , arises from notochordal remnants .
Fewer than 5 % of chordomas occur in children .
Tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> neurocutaneous syndrome characterised by abnormal tissue growths in multiple organ systems .
Reports of <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> in children with TSC suggest that TSC1 and TSC2 mutations may contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> aetiology .
To determine whether the 10 TS C-associated childhood chordomas reported in the literature are representative of <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> in the general paediatric population , the authors compared age at diagnosis , primary site and outcome in them with results from a systematic assessment of 65 paediatric <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> cases reported to the US population-based cancer registries contributing to the SEER Program of the National Cancer Institute . TS C-associated paediatric chordomas differed from chordomas in the general paediatric population : median age at diagnosis ( 6.2 months , TSC , vs 12 .5 years , SEER) ; anatomical site (40% sacral , TSC , vs 9.4% sacral , SEER) ; and site-specific age at diagnosis ( all four sacral chordomas diagnosed during the fetal or neonatal period , TSC , vs all six sacral chordomas diagnosed at >15 years , SEER ) .
Finally , three of four patients with TS C-associated sacral <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> were alive and tumour-free at 2.2 , 8 and 19 years after diagnosis versus a median survival of 36 months among paediatric patients with sacral <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> in SEER .
These results strengthen the association between paediatric <START:PHENOTYPE> chordoma <END> and TS C . Future clinical and molecular studies documenting the magnitude and clinical spectrum of the joint occurrence of these two diseases should provide the basis for delineating the biological relationship between them .
A new congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> structural abnormalities .
We report a new form of congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> ( CMD ) in 4 patients from three unrelated families with probable autosomal-recessive inheritance .
All patients had the clinical characteristics of merosin-positive congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> , but had marked <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
The disease was <START:PHENOTYPE> slowly progressive <END> and 1 patient died from <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> at the age of 13 years .
In addition to dystrophic changes with necrosis and regeneration in muscle , the most striking finding was <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> depletion in the center of the sarcoplasm .
Mitochondria at the periphery of fibers were markedly enlarged ( "megaconial " appearance ) with complicated cristae , and contained a normal amount of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> DNA by in situ hybridization .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Mitochondrial <END> enlargement may represent functional compensation for <START:PHENOTYPE> mitochondrial <END> depletion in the central sarcoplasm , where myofibrillar degeneration occurred .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> cranium bifidum <END> and symmetric <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> are the same entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Cranium bifidum <END> is literally " cleft skull. " Numerous reports describe the anatomy of this defect , and crude estimates of the population prevalence suggest it is a relatively infrequent occurrence .
McKusick 's catalog contains only one family with <START:PHENOTYPE> cranium bifidum <END> but several familial reports of symmetrical <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> .
Available information indicates that <START:PHENOTYPE> cranium bifidum <END> and symmetrical <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> are inherited in an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> fashion and occur in orientals , blacks , whites , and native Americans .
Here we report on a family with serial radiographs that document ontogenic development of <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> in late childhood and adulthood from apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> cranium bifidum <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> parietal foramina <END> during infancy and early childhood .
We conclude that these are the same entity , differentiated only by the time during life in which the defect is demonstrated .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Maturity-onset diabetes of the young <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> ) .
This review summarized aspects of the widening scope , phenotypic expression , natural history , recognition , pathogeneses , and heterogenous nature of <START:PHENOTYPE> maturity-onset diabetes of the young <END> ( MODY) , an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> inherited subtype of NIDDM , which can be recognized at a young age .
There are differences in metabolic , hormonal , and vascular abnormalities in different ethnic groups and even among Caucasian pedigrees .
In <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> patients with low insulin responses , there is a delayed and decreased insulin and C-peptide secretory response to glucose from childhood or adolescence , even before glucose intolerance appears ; it may represent the basic genetic defect .
The nondiabetic siblings have had normal insulin responses for decades .
The fasting hyperglycemia of some <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> has been treated successfully with sulfonylureas for more than 30 years .
In a few , after years or decades of diabetes , the insulin and C-peptide responses to glucose are so low that they may resemble those of early Type I diabetes .
The rate of progression of the insulin secretory defect over time does distinguish between these two types of diabetes .
In contrast are patients from families who have very high insulin responses to glucose despite glucose intolerance and fasting hyperglycemia similar to those seen in patients with low insulin responses .
In many of these patients , there is in vivo and in vitro evidence of insulin resistance .
Whatever its mechanism , the compensatory insulin responses to nutrients must be insufficient to maintain normal carbohydrate tolerance .
This suggests that diabetes occurs only in those patients who have an additional islet cell defect , i.e. , insufficient beta cell reserve and secretory capacity .
In a few <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> pedigrees with high insulin responses to glucose and lack of evidence of insulin resistance , an insulin is secreted which is a structurally abnormal , mutant insulin molecule that is biologically ineffective .
No associations have been found between specific HLA antigens and <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> in Caucasian , black , and Asian pedigrees .
Linkage studies of the insulin gene , the insulin receptor gene , the erythrocyte/Hep G2 glucose transporter locus , and the apolipoprotein B locus have shown no association with <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> .
Vascular disease may be as prevalent as in conventional NIDDM .
Because of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> transmission and penetrance at a young age , <START:PHENOTYPE> MODY <END> is a good model for further investigations of etiologic and pathogenetic factors in NIDDM , including the use of genetic linkage strategies to identify diabetogenic genes .
Infantile onset spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with sensory neuropathy : a new inherited disease .
We report the clinical findings in 19 Finnish patients , including six pairs of siblings , with a new , early onset spinocerebellar <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> .
The slowly progressive clinical symptoms manifested between one and two years of age in previously healthy infants .
The first manifestation of children at that age was <START:PHENOTYPE> clumsiness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of ability to walk <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> athetosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle hypotonia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of deep tendon reflexes <END> were discovered on clinical examination .
By school age <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoplegia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> were diagnosed , while sensory neuropathy developed by adolescence .
In addition , an acute crisis with <START:PHENOTYPE> status epilepticus <END> was a late manifestation .
We found a marked decrease in sensory nerve condition velocities , a progressive loss of myelinated fibers in sural nerve specimen , and abnormal background activity in EEG with advancing age .
The main finding in neuroradiological investigations was cerebellar atrophy.
The occurrence of the disease in siblings and lack of manifestations in parents indicate recessive inheritance .
Clinical progression and genetic analysis in hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic gait <END> gene 11 ( SPG11 ) .
Hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( HSP ) with <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> ( CC ) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder classified as a complicated form of <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> .
Some patients with HSP with thin CC have previously been described in Japanese families , and the genetic locus was linked to chromosome 15q13-15 .
Our objective was to further clinically and genetically characterize HSP with thin CC .
We describe the clinical , structural , and functional follow-up and the genetic characterization of 2 sisters aged 26 and 31 years who had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> and cognitive impairment .
Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a thin CC with progressing frontoparietal <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical atrophy <END> paralleled by <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive decline <END> .
Using transcranial magnetic stimulation , we delineated a lack of transcallosal inhibition .
Images obtained with(18 )fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed reduced cortical and thalamic hypometabolism that decreased further within 4 years .
Additionally , combined axonal loss and demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy were present .
Because other family members were not affected , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> was considered likely .
Genetic analysis of this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> HSP was consistent with the linkage to 15q13-15 ( markers D15 S971 , D15 S118 , D15 S994 , and D15 S659 ) .
No mutation was found within the SLC12A6 gene .
Progressive axonal degeneration occurs in the corticocortical projections , corticospinal tract , and peripheral nerves in HSP with thin CC linking to chromosome 15q13-15 in a German pedigree .
Mapping of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> chronic distal <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> to chromosome 11q13 .
Distal <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> is a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders caused by progressive anterior horn cell degeneration and characterized by progressive motor weakness and muscular atrophy , predominantly in the distal parts of the limbs .
Here we report on chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> distal <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> in a large , inbred family with onset at various ages .
Because this condition had some of the same clinical features as <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> with respiratory distress , we tested the disease gene for linkage to chromosome 11q and mapped the disease locus to chromosome 11q13 in the genetic interval that included the <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> with respiratory distress gene ( D11 S1889-D11 S1321 , Z(max ) = 4.59 at theta = 0 at locus D11S4136 ) .
The sequencing of IGHMBP2 , the human homologue of the mouse neuromuscular degeneration gene ( nmd ) that accounts for <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> with respiratory distress , failed to detect any mutation in our chronic distal <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> patients , suggesting that <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> with respiratory distress and chronic distal <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> are caused by distinct genes located in the same chromosomal region .
In addition , the high intrafamilial variability in age at onset raises the question of whether nonallelic modifying genes could be involved in chronic distal spinal muscular atrophy.
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> with ubiquitin-positive , tau-negative inclusions .
To describe the clinical features , neuropathology , and genetic studies in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> ( FTD ) .
Clinical Pick 's disease , or FTD with <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> , has been described in several families linked to chromosome 17 ( FTD P-17 ) .
Most of these have shown tau protein mutations .
The clinical and pathologic variations in these families resemble the spectrum of sporadic FTD or " Pick complex. " Clinical and behavioral analysis of the affected members with extensive histochemical and neuropathologic description of three cases , genetic analysis of three clinically affected members and seven at risk members to assess linkage to chromosome 17 , and sequencing of the tau gene in two patients were performed .
The clinical pattern shows a highly stereotypic <START:PHENOTYPE> disinhibition <END> dementia with late extrapyramidal features , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> mutism <END> , and terminal dysphagia in three generations of affected individuals .
Neuropathology showed frontotemporal atrophy , and microscopically tau- and synuclein-negative and ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions , in the background of superficial cortical spongiosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> .
Tau expression was restricted to oligodendroglia .
All exons and surrounding introns of the tau gene were sequenced , and no mutation or disease-related polymorphisms were detected in either of two affected pedigree members .
This family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> ( FTD ) shows no tau expression in neurons .
The ubiquitin-positive , tau-negative inclusions have been described before in FTD with and without motor neuron disease , but not in a familial form .
The clinical and some pathologic features are similar to those of several of the families included in descriptions of FTD with <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> linked to chromosome 17 , but the linkage to tau has been excluded .
The defect in this family , however , could be functionally related to tau mutations .
Optiz <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> syndrome : report of two cases .
We report two patients with Opitz <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> syndrome .
Both children showed the pattern of abnormal findings characteristic of this syndrome , including <START:PHENOTYPE> trigonocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> upslanted palpebral fissures <END> , inner <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthic folds <END> , broad alveolar ridges , small chin , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> loose skin <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular hypotonia <END> and cardiac defect .
An 8-week-old girl had multiple gingival frenula , brachydactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly of toes <END> and anal stenosis in addition , while a boy who died at 28 h from cardiac failure showed multiple joint contractures , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal cortical cysts <END> .
Genetic and phenotypic <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneity <END> in patients with mandibuloacral dysplasia-associated lipodystrophy.
Mandibuloacral dysplasia ( MAD ) is a phenotypically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> , rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by mandibular and <START:PHENOTYPE> clavicular hypoplasia <END> , acroosteolysis , delayed closure of cranial sutures , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint contractures <END> , and mottled cutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> .
Patients with MAD develop two patterns of <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> : type A pattern , with loss of sc fat from the extremities and normal or slight excess in the neck and truncal regions ; and type B pattern , with a more generalized loss of sc fat involving the face , trunk , and extremities .
Recently , affected patients from five consanguineous Italian pedigrees with partial <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> ( type A ) were reported to have a homozygous R527H mutation in LMNA ( lamin A/C ) gene .
We carried out mutational analysis of LMNA in affected patients from six pedigrees . Affected patients from two pedigrees with type A <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> had the homozygous R527H mutation in LMNA .
The other four affected subjects who had type B <START:PHENOTYPE> lipodystrophy <END> did not have any mutation in the exons and splice site junctions of LMNA ; RNA extracted from lymphoblasts of two of these patients also revealed normal sequence .
In these four subjects , sequencing of other known genes implicated in lipodystrophies , i.e . AGPAT2 , Seipin , and PPARG also revealed no substantial alterations .
We conclude that MAD is a genetically and phenotypically <START:PHENOTYPE> heterogeneous <END> disorder .
Besides LMNA gene , other as yet unmapped loci could be linked to MAD .
Early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular motor apraxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> is caused by mutations in a new HIT superfamily gene .
Friedreich <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> ( FRDA) , the most common <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> neurodegenerative disease among Europeans and people of European descent , is characterized by an early onset ( usually before the age of 25) , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , sensory loss , absence of tendon reflexes and pyramidal <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of the legs .
We have recently identified a unique group of patients whose clinical presentations are characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> , early age of onset , FRDA-like clinical presentations and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> .
Linkage to the FRDA locus , however , was excluded .
Given the similarities of the clinical presentations to those of the recently described <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> oculomotor apraxia <END> ( AOA ) linked to chromosome 9p13 , we confirmed that the disorder of our patients is also linked to the same locus .
We narrowed the candidate region and have identified a new gene encoding a member of the histidine triad ( HIT) superfamily as the 'causative ' gene .
We have called its product aprataxin ; the gene symbol is APTX .
Although many HIT proteins have been identified , aprataxin is the first to be linked to a distinct phenotype .
Positional cloning uncovers mutations in PLCE1 responsible for a <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> variant that may be reversible .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Nephrotic syndrome <END> , a malfunction of the kidney glomerular filter , leads to <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> and , in steroid-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> , end-stage kidney disease .
Using positional cloning , we identified mutations in the phospholipase C epsilon gene ( PLCE1 ) as causing early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> with end-stage kidney disease .
Kidney histology of affected individuals showed <START:PHENOTYPE> diffuse mesangial sclerosis <END> ( DMS ) .
Using immunofluorescence , we found PLCepsilon1 expression in developing and mature glomerular podocytes and showed that DMS represents an arrest of normal glomerular development .
We identified IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 as a new interaction partner of PLCepsilon1 .
Two siblings with a missense mutation in an exon encoding the PLCepsilon1 catalytic domain showed histology characteristic of <START:PHENOTYPE> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> .
Notably , two other affected individuals responded to therapy , making this the first report of a molecular cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> that may resolve after therapy .
These findings , together with the zebrafish model of human <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> generated by plce1 knockdown , open new inroads into pathophysiology and treatment mechanisms of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Novel compound heterozygous TULP1 mutations in a family with severe early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
To describe the clinical characteristics and determine the genetic defect in a Surinamese family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
Family members underwent blood sampling and ophthalmologic examinations .
After exclusion of all known mutations in all genes involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , a genome-wide linkage scan was performed using 11 ,55 5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms spread throughout the genome .
Mutation analysis of the TULP1 gene was performed by direct sequencing .
All affected family members had a severe retinal dystrophy with a history of nystagmus , low visual acuity , and nyctalopia since infancy .
The scotopic and photopic responses were nonrecordable on electroretinography.
A genome-wide scan suggested linkage to the chromosomal region containing the TULP1 gene .
Mutation analysis of TULP1 identified novel compound heterozygous mutations ( p.Arg482Trp and p.Leu504fsX140 ) in all affected family members .
The affected members of the Surinamese family have a severe early-onset form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> , which is caused by compound heterozygous mutations in the TULP1 gene .
Clinical Relevance Clinical and molecular genetic characterization of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> may help to provide a more accurate prognosis in individual patients .
This study confirms that TULP1 mutations cause a severe early-onset form of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Epilepsy <END> , ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , tubulopathy , and KCNJ10 mutations .
Five children from two consanguineous families presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> beginning in infancy and severe ataxia , moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , and a renal salt-losing tubulopathy with normotensive <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis <END> .
We investigated the genetic basis of this <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disease , which we call the EAST syndrome ( the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , and tubulopathy ) .
Whole-genome linkage analysis was performed in the four affected children in one of the families .
Newly identified mutations in a potassium-channel gene were evaluated with the use of a heterologous expression system .
Protein expression and function were further investigated in genetically modified mice .
Linkage analysis identified a single significant locus on chromosome 1q23.2 with a lod score of 4.98 .
This region contained the KCNJ10 gene , which encodes a potassium channel expressed in the brain , inner ear , and kidney .
Sequencing of this candidate gene revealed homozygous missense mutations in affected persons in both families .
These mutations , when expressed heterologously in xenopus oocytes , caused significant and specific decreases in potassium currents .
Mice with Kcnj10 deletions became dehydrated , with definitive evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> renal salt wasting <END> .
Mutations in KCNJ10 cause a specific disorder , consisting of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , ataxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> , and tubulopathy.
Our findings indicate that KCNJ10 plays a major role in renal salt handling and , hence , possibly also in blood-pressure maintenance and its regulation .

Evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
A family-history cancer survey was conducted on 5 ,486 men who underwent a radical prostatectomy , for clinically localized <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> , in the Department of Urology at the Mayo Clinic during 1966 -95 ; 4,288 men responded to the survey .
Complex segregation analysis was performed to assess the genetic basis of age at diagnosis and the familial clustering of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> .
For the total group , no single-gene model of inheritance clearly explained familial clustering of disease , which could be partly explained by lack of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium , with an excess of homozygotes .
After accounting for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium , the best-fitting model that explained the familial aggregation and age at diagnosis was a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> susceptibility gene , and this model fitted best when probands were diagnosed at <6 0 years of age .
The model predicts that the frequency of the susceptibility gene in the population is .006 and that the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> by age 85 years is 89% among carriers of the gene and 3% among noncarriers .
A strength of our study is its large size , such that genetic models could be fitted within strata defined by the age of the proband .
Although the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model was consistently the best model , the parameter estimates differed somewhat ( P=.03 ) across the different age groups , suggesting genetic heterogeneity .
Additional evidence that the hereditary basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> is likely to be genetically complex was provided by the following : (1 ) there was a significantly elevated age-adjusted risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> among brothers of probands , compared with their fathers ( relative risk 1.5 [95 % confidence interval 1.4-1.7] ) ; (2 ) the <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> model predicted an excess of homozygotes , over that predicted by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ; and (3 ) the model-predicted risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> among relatives was inadequate when probands were diagnosed at age >=70 years .
Syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , microphthalmia , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcification <END> .
We present two sisters with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> , marked microphthalmia , congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , cerebral and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcification <END> .
No evidence of intrauterine infection was found .
There have been previous reports of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> intracranial calcification <END> , and an intrauterine infection-like <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> condition , but the sibs in this report appear to represent a more severe form of such a condition or a previously undescribed entity .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> syndrome caused by mutated TAF2 .
The combination of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , pyramidal signs , abnormal corpus callosum , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> presents a diagnostic challenge .
We describe an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , pyramidal signs , <START:PHENOTYPE> thin corpus callosum <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> .
We previously mapped the locus for this disorder to 8q23.2-q24.12 ; the candidate region included 22 genes .
We performed Sanger sequencing of 10 candidate genes ; to ensure other genes in the candidate region do not harbor mutations , we sequenced the exome of one affected individual .
We identified two homozygous missense changes , p.Thr186Arg and p.Pro416His in TAF2 , which encodes a multisubunit cofactor for TFIID-dependent RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription , in all affected individuals .
We propose that the disorder is caused by the more conserved mutation p.Thr186Arg , with the second sequence change identified , p.Pro416His , possibly further negatively affecting the function of the protein .
However , it is unclear which of the two changes , or maybe both , represents the causative mutation .
A single missense mutation in TAF2 in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> intellectual disability <END> was described in a large-scale study reporting on the identification of 50 novel genes .
We suggest that a mutation in TAF2 can cause this syndrome .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Microcephaly <END> : genetic counselling and antenatal diagnosis after the birth of an affected child .
We describe the clinical and genetic details of a series of microcephalic patients who were referred to the Genetic Counselling Service for the West of Scotland .
There were 29 isolated cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and 9 families with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
The sib recurrence risk was 19% , which reflects the high incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> in this series .
There was evidence for several varieties of recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> .
The most frequent , affecting 5 sib pairs , was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic quadriplegia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and profound mental handicap.
In 15 families with one microcephalic child , prenatal diagnosis by serial ultrasound scans was undertaken in 21 subsequent pregnancies .
Four recurrences of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> were detected in the third trimester and one recurrence was missed because no scans were performed after 24 wk gestation when the ultrasound measurements indicated satisfactory head growth .
The main reason for late diagnosis of affected fetuses was that head growth did not slow appreciably until the last trimester .
The high recurrence risk in this prospective series emphasizes the contribution of <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> amongst patients of our Genetic Counselling Service .
Monosomy 1p36 .
We have reviewed published reports on patients with segmental aneusomy for chromosome 1p36 to help geneticists and other health professionals in the recognition of this emerging chromosomal syndrome .
Terminal deletions of the short arm of chromosome 1 are associated with hypotonia and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> ( usually severe ) , growth abnormalities ( <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ) , and craniofacial dysmorphism with a <START:PHENOTYPE> large anterior fontanelle <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent forehead <END> , deep set eyes , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> midface hypoplasia <END> , ear asymmetry , a <START:PHENOTYPE> pointed chin <END> , and orofacial clefting .
Minor cardiac malformations , cardiomyopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular dilatation <END> are the more common additional findings .
Sensorineural hearing loss and variable ophthalmological anomalies have also been frequently observed .
Although the deletions can be detected by high resolution cytogenetic studies , confirmation by fluorescence in situ hybridisation is required in most cases .
The majority of deletions are maternally derived .
Molecular characterisation of 1p36 deletions has been undertaken in several cases , and it is likely that this condition is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> and parkinsonism-dementia complex of the Kii Peninsula of Japan : clinical and neuropathological study and tau analysis .
We report the first case of neuropathologically verified parkinsonism-dementia complex of the Kii peninsula , together with the patient 's brother , who had <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> .
The propositus woman developed <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> at 63 years of age and died at 70 without displaying clinical features of <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> .
The brain exhibited marked atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes .
Microscopically , there were many neurofibrillary tangles in the central nervous system , most markedly in the mesial temporal lobe and deep nuclei , as well as changes of <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> but no senile plaques or Lewy bodies .
Neurofibrillary tangles exhibited twisted tubule structures on electon microscopic examination , and an analysis of insoluble tau protein extracted from the fresh brain revealed a 60- , 64- , 68-kD triplet .
The tau gene exhibited no mutations .
Her brother developed progressive bulbar palsy-type <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> at 45 years of age and died at 49 without presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> dementia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> parkinsonism <END> .
Neuropathological examination revealed not only pathologic features of <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> but also a moderate number of neurofibrillary tangles in the temporal cortex and deep nuclei .
The siblings were neuropathologically similar despite their different clinical manifestations .
These findings suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> and parkinsonism-dementia complex of this family may be phenotypic variants of a tauopathy caused by genetic abnormalities .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Anaemia <END> and macrocytosis--unrecognized features in cartilage -hair hypoplasia .
Cartilage -hair hypoplasia is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> osteo-chondrodysplasia which results in <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , sparse hair and impaired cell-mediated immunity .
In a study of 88 Finnish patients we found episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> and/or macrocytosis during childhood in 86 % of the patients .
The reticulocyte index was always low in relation to <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> .
Bone marrow examination revealed decreased erythropoiesis in six of eight anaemic patients studied .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Anaemia <END> was most prevalent and severe during infancy .
Spontaneous recovery occurred before adulthood in all patients except in three infants with fatal hypoplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> .
Sixty-two percent of the patients had had <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphopenia <END> and 24% <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> significantly correlated to severity of immunodeficiency and growth failure and to presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> neutropenia <END> .
Disordered erythrogenesis is an integral feature of cartilage -hair hypoplasia and may , together with growth failure and immunodeficiency , reflect a generalized defect in cellular proliferation .
Severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal lymphangiectasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> : further case of Hennekam syndrome with a severe phenotype .
We report on an Italian patient affected by severe <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphedema <END> of lower limbs , genitalia and face , <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal lymphangiectasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> .
He has a <START:PHENOTYPE> flat face <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> flat nasal bridge <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> .
We propose that he presents with a severe form of Hennekam syndrome .

Congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> ( Beals syndrome ) .
Congenital contractural <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> ( CCA ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> disorder akin to , but usually less severe than , Marfan syndrome .
The clinical features are <START:PHENOTYPE> marfanoid habitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> , crumpled ears , camptodactyly of the fingers and <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures of the elbows <END> , knees , and hips , and mild muscle hypoplasia especially of the calf muscles .
Many patients have <START:PHENOTYPE> kyphoscoliosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> and , very occasionally , <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic root dilatation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopia lentis <END> have been described .
Linkage to a gene coding for fibrillin on chromosome 5q23-31 has been shown in several kindreds .
The prognosis for a normal lifespan is good and improvement in joint contractures is usual .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Lissencephaly <END> .
A human brain malformation associated with deletion of the LIS1 gene located at chromosome 17p13 .
We review the clinical phenotype , pathological changes , and results of cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies in 90 probands with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> ( smooth brain ) with emphasis on patients with the classical form ( type I ) .
We also describe the recent discovery of the <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> gene ( LIS1 ) , deletions of which have been implicated as the cause of this disorder in many patients .
We have performed clinical , cytogenetic , and molecular genetic studies of 25 probands with Miller-Dieker syndrome and 65 probands with isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> sequence ( ILS ) .
We have further subdivided patients with ILS into those with classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> and those with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> variants .
We consider primarily our own published and unpublished data , but include references to studies of other series of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Visible cytogenetic deletions of 17p13.3 were detected in 14 of 25 Miller-Dieker syndrome probands , and either visible cytogenetic or submicroscopic deletions in 23 (92% ) of 25 .
Submicroscopic deletions were detected in eight of 45 patients with all types of ILS . If only ILS patients with the classical form are considered , we detected deletions in eight ( 38% ) of 21 . Deletions of the <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> critical region in chromosome 17p13.3 , including LIS1 , appear to be the most frequent cause of classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> .
Molecular cytogenetic studies , particularly fluorescence in situ hybridization , should be performed in all such patients .
LIS1 shows homology to genes involved in signal transduction , which may be its function in development of the telencephalon .
Other genetic causes of classical <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> and genetic and nongenetic causes of other types of <START:PHENOTYPE> lissencephaly <END> exist and are under study .
Agonadism in two sisters with XY gonosomal constitution , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , severely retarded bone age , and multiple extragenital malformations : a new <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> syndrome .
We report on 12 - and 14-year old sisters with a 46 , XY chromosome constitution , normal female external genitalia , and absence of gonadal tissue .
Except for <START:PHENOTYPE> omphalocele <END> , right <START:PHENOTYPE> renal agenesis <END> and malrotation of the colon in the elder sister , the internal organs were normal .
Both were mentally retarded , of <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , and had extremely retarded bone age .
In addition , they had an almost identical pattern of minor anomalies : peculiar face , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypodontia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short neck <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> inverted nipples <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thoracolumbar scoliosis <END> , "dysplastic " hips , partial clino-/syndactyly of toes .
The occurrence of a basically similar set of malformations in two sisters and the first cousin consanguinity of the parents suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
The conserved region of the SRY gene ( [high mobility group ] HMG box ) was sequenced in the elder sib and was normal .
No consistent malformations are observed at present in agonadal patients .
This supports the idea that several autosomal genes have the potential of influencing the sequence of events of sex determination .
Clinical delineation and localization to chromosome 9p13.3-p12 of a unique dominant disorder in four families : hereditary inclusion body <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , Paget disease of bone , and <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , Paget disease of bone , and dementia constitute a unique disorder ( MIM 605382 ) .
Here we describe the clinical , biochemical , radiological , and pathological characteristics of 49 affected ( 23 male , 26 female ) individuals from four unrelated United States families .
Among these affected individuals 90 % have <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> , 43 % have Paget disease of bone , and 37% have premature <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> .
EMG shows <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathic changes <END> and muscle biopsy reveals nonspecific <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathic changes <END> or blue-rimmed vacuoles .
After candidate loci were excluded , a genome-wide screen in the large Illinois family showed linkage to chromosome 9 ( maximum LOD score 3.64 with marker D9S301 ) .
Linkage analysis with a high density of chromosome 9 markers generated a maximum two-point LOD score of 9.29 for D9S1791 , with a maximum multipoint LOD score of 12 .24 between D9S304 and D9S178 8 .
Subsequent evaluation of three additional families demonstrating similar clinical characteristics confirmed this locus , refined the critical region , and further delineated clinical features of this unique disorder .
Hence , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> inclusion body <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> ( HIBM) , Paget disease of bone ( PDB) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> frontotemporal dementia <END> ( FTD ) localizes to a 1.08-6.46 cM critical interval on 9p13.3-12 in the region of autosomal recessive IBM2 .

Clinical spectrum of infantile free sialic acid storage disease .
Infantile free sialic acid storage disease ( ISSD ) is a rare <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> metabolic disorder caused by a lysosomal membrane transport defect , resulting in accumulation of free sialic acid within lysosomes .
Only a few cases have been described .
We report on three new cases of ISSD with different modes of presentation : an infant with <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrotic syndrome <END> , a case of fetal and neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> , and a case of fetal <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> with esophageal atresia type III. From these patients and a review of the literature ( 27 cases total ) we draw the following conclusions .
1 ) " Coarse facies, " fair complexion , hepatosplenomegaly , and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor retardation <END> are constant findings in this disorder .
2 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> Nephrotic syndrome <END> occurred in most cases ( four in seven ) in which renal evaluation was performed .
Therefore , ISSD is an important cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrosis <END> in infants with a storage disorder phenotype .
3 ) Fetal/neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> or hydrops was the mode of presentation in 13 (6 0% ) of 21 cases .
Thus , ISSD enters in the differential diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops fetalis <END> with a storage disease phenotype .
4 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> Cardiomegaly <END> was evident in nine cases .
5 ) Corneae were always clear , and albinoid fundi were reported in five cases .
6 ) Dysostosis multiplex was not prominent .
7 ) Bone marrow aspiration could be negative .
8 ) Death ensued in early infancy with a mean age of 13.1 months .
All reported deaths were caused by respiratory infections .
Melorheostosis in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopoikilosis <END> .
We describe a 19-year-old woman with melorheostosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopoikilosis <END> ( mixed sclerosing bone dysplasia ) .
Her sister and mother had <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopoikilosis <END> , but no evidence of melorheostosis .
Isolated melorheostosis and melorheostosis with <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopoikilosis <END> are sporadic disorders .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Osteopoikilosis <END> is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> trait .
Mixed sclerosing bone dysplasia in a family with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopoikilosis <END> raises the possibility that the two bone disorders may be related .
This family and that of Butkus et al . [ 1997 : Am J Med Genet 72 :43-46 ] suggest that the melorheostosis could be due to a second mutation at the same locus as that which causes <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopoikilosis <END> .
Mutation of TRPM6 causes familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> with secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> .
Familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> with secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> ( OMIM 602014 ) is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> disease that results in electrolyte abnormalities shortly after birth .
Affected individuals show severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> , which lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> tetany <END> .
The disorder has been thought to be caused by a defect in the intestinal absorption of magnesium , rather than by abnormal renal loss of magnesium .
Restoring the concentrations of serum magnesium to normal values by high-dose magnesium supplementation can overcome the apparent defect in magnesium absorption and in serum concentrations of calcium .
Life-long magnesium supplementation is required to overcome the defect in magnesium handling by these individuals .
We previously mapped the gene locus to chromosome 9q in three large inbred kindreds from Israel .
Here we report that mutation of TRPM6 causes <START:PHENOTYPE> hypomagnesemia <END> with secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> and show that individuals carrying mutations in this gene have abnormal renal magnesium excretion .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Ptosis <END> of eyelids , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diastasis recti <END> , hip defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> in two sibs .
We report a distinct syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> eyelid ptosis <END> , convergent <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , abdominal muscle defect , <START:PHENOTYPE> hip dislocation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> in two brothers .
Consanguinity in their parents suggests <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> .
A syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> monocytosis <END> .
We describe three siblings with <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent infections <END> , and increased peripheral blood monocytes .
These children were born to apparently healthy parents in a family with one unaffected child .
Affected individuals had <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , severe developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> , and brachydactyly .
The clinical courses were complicated by endocrine dysfunction , multiple respiratory , and <START:PHENOTYPE> skin infections <END> .
Laboratory studies showed normal karyotypes , normal lymphocyte function , and a peripheral blood <START:PHENOTYPE> monocytosis <END> with markedly abnormal morphology .
Mutation analysis of the seven genes ( SHH , ZIC2 , SIX3 , TGI , FTD GF1 , GLI2 , and PTCH ) known to be involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> was normal .
This is the first report demonstrating an association between abnormal mononuclear phagocytes and <START:PHENOTYPE> holoprosencephaly <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Keratitis <END> , hepatitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> , and deafness : report and review of KID syndrome .
A 14-year-old girl with <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> and severe liver disease is compared to 35 reported cases of KID or Senter syndrome .
Common manifestations such as <START:PHENOTYPE> ichthyosis <END> ( 35/35 patients) , <START:PHENOTYPE> sensorineural deafness <END> ( 33/34) , "ectodermal dysplasia " ( 25/28) , corneal abnormality ( 26/31 ) were present in the proposita , while less common manifestations such as chronic infections ( 15 /20) and neuromuscular disease ( 12/35 ) were absent .
Two families with vertical transmission and 28 sporadic cases are compatible with an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant form <END> of KID syndrome , while one inbred sibship with liver disease suggests the existence of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive form <END> .
The proposita was similar to the latter patients in having progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> necessitating liver transplantation ; she also had <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> (1 0/35 patients ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( 3/35 ) .
Hepatic findings included micronodular <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> , cholestasis , hyperplastic Kupffer cells , abundant Mallory 's hyaline , copper accumulation without steatosis , and normal peroxisomes .
An <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> adducted thumb-club foot syndrome observed in Turkish cousins .
Male and female cousins , the offspring of consanguineous Turkish parents , have been affected by a hitherto unreported combination of problems comprising moderate to severe psychomotor developmental delay , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular anterior chamber abnormality <END> , facial dysmorphisms ( broad , bossed forehead , <START:PHENOTYPE> late-closing fontanelle <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated ears <END> , downturned angles of mouth) , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnodactyly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> distal arthrogryposis <END> with severely <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> club feet <END> .
This striking phenotype has some similarities with the multiple pterygium syndrome ( Escobar syndrome ) , but it most likely represents a distinct condition caused by an <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive <END> gene defect .
Limb/pelvis hypoplasia/aplasia with <START:PHENOTYPE> skull defect <END> ( Schinzel <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> ) : distinctive features and prenatal detection .
Schinzel <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> syndrome is characterized by limb/pelvis hypoplasia/aplasia : specifically , intercalary limb deficiencies and absent or hypoplastic pelvic bones .
The phenotype is similar to that described in a related multiple malformation syndrome known as Al-Awadi/Raas-Rothschild syndrome .
The additional important feature of large parietooccipital skull defects without <START:PHENOTYPE> meningocele <END> , encephalocele , or other brain malformation has thus far been reported only in children with Schinzel <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> syndrome .
We recently evaluated a boy affected with Schinzel <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> born to nonconsanguineous healthy parents of Mexican origin .
A third-trimester fetal ultrasound scan showed severe limb deficiencies and an absent pelvis .
The infant died shortly after birth .
Dysmorphology examination , radiographs , and autopsy revealed quadrilateral intercalary limb deficiencies with preaxial toe polydactyly ; an absent pelvis and a 7 x 3-cm <START:PHENOTYPE> skull defect <END> ; and extraskeletal anomalies including microtia , telecanthus , micropenis with <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , renal cysts , stenosis of the colon , and a cleft alveolar ridge .
A normal 46 , XY karyotype was demonstrated , and <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal recessive inheritance <END> was presumed on the basis of previously reported families .
This case report emphasizes the importance of recognizing severe pelvic and skull deficiencies ( either post- or prenatally ) in differentiating infants with Schinzel <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> from other multiple malformation syndromes that feature intercalary limb defects , including thalidomide embryopathy and Roberts-SC <START:PHENOTYPE> phocomelia <END> .

Phenotypic spectrum and management issues in Kabuki syndrome .
To report the phenotypic spectrum and management issues of children with Kabuki syndrome ( Niikawa-Kuroki syndrome ) from North America .
A case series of children ( n = 18 ) with clinical findings of Kabuki syndrome .
Medical genetics clinics in Washington , Alaska , and Arizona .
Most patients had <START:PHENOTYPE> postnatal growth retardation <END> , and all had <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> and hypotonia .
Feeding difficulties , with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> , were common ; 5 patients required gastrostomy tube placement .
Developmental quotients/IQs in all but 2 were 60 or less .
<START:PHENOTYPE> Seizures <END> were seen in less than half of the patients , but ophthalmologic and otologic problems were common , particularly <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent otitis media <END> .
Congenital heart defects were present in 7 ( 39% ) ; 3 patients underwent repair of <START:PHENOTYPE> coarctation of the aorta <END> .
Other features included urinary tract anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> malabsorption <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint hypermobility <END> and dislocation , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital hypothyroidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura <END> , and in one patient , autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> hemolytic anemia <END> and hypogammaglobulinemia .
All patients had negative family histories for Kabuki syndrome .
Kabuki syndrome is a mental retardation-malformation syndrome affecting multiple organ systems , with a broad spectrum of neuromuscular dysfunction and mental ability .
Given that 18 ethnically diverse patients were identified from 2 genetics programs , it appears that this syndrome is more common in North American non-Japanese patients than previously appreciated .
