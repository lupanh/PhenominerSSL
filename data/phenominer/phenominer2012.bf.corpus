Heterozygous C2 deficiency associated with angioedema , myasthenia gravis , and systemic lupus erythematosus .

We describe a patient with myasthenia gravis , systemic lupus erythematosus , and angioedema associated with heterozygous complement factor 2 ( C2 ) deficiency .

The significance of this association is controversial, though the association of C2 deficiency with certain histocompatibility antigens suggests possible linkage to immune response genes .

To our knowledge this is the first report of heterozygous C2 deficiency in association with this combination of 'autoimmune' disorders , and we discuss the aetiological implications.

An <START:PHENOTYPE> IgG subclass imbalance <END> in connective tissue disease .

A group of 16 patients with a disproportionate polyclonal increase in their <START:PHENOTYPE> serum IgG1 <END> , resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> raised concentrations of total IgG immunoglobulin <END> , has been discovered.

The other IgG subclasses in these patients are either normal or slightly reduced, resulting in an IgG1 : IgG2 ratio of at least 10:1.

Most cases are marked by the presence of anti-extractable nuclear antigen ( anti-ENA ) antibodies and high titres of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody .

All but one patient has a connective tissue disease , nearly twice the prevalence found in similarly hypergammaglobulinaemic patients without this <START:PHENOTYPE> IgG subclass imbalance <END> .

Among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ), those with the <START:PHENOTYPE> IgG1 disorder <END> have a higher prevalence of high titre rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody , but a lower prevalence of anti-double-stranded DNA ( anti-dsDNA ) antibodies above 30 U/ml.

It is suggested that this <START:PHENOTYPE> immunoglobulin abnormality <END> may reflect a unique <START:PHENOTYPE> immunoregulatory dysfunction <END> in these patients .

Familial Felty's syndrome .

A family is described in which the mother and 2 of the 5 children had Felty's syndrome , a pattern of <START:PHENOTYPE> inheritance <END> suggesting a <START:PHENOTYPE> dominant defect <END> and one which has not previously been reported.

The family is also of interest in that the other sib had rheumatoid arthritis .

Hereditary Factors in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis 

Complement factor 2 deficiency : a clinical and serological family study.

<START:PHENOTYPE> Inherited complement deficiencies <END> are associated with a variety of connective tissue diseases .

A family with <START:PHENOTYPE> inherited deficiency of complement factor 2 ( C2 ) <END> is described in which two family members with homozygous C2 deficiency developed cutaneous vasculitis and sicca syndrome .

The other family members had heterozygous C2 deficiency and each member had the HLA-A25, B18, DR2 ( w15 ) haplotype .

The mother had seropositive rheumatoid arthritis .

Further studies showed the presence of cryoglobulins , antibodies against endothelial cells , and anticardiolipin antibodies .

Frontometaphyseal dysplasia : autosomal dominant or X-linked ? 

The clinical and radiographic manifestations in a 45-year-old male with frontometaphyseal dysplasia ( FMD ) are documented and depicted.

<START:PHENOTYPE> Deafness <END> and degenerative osteoarthropathy in <START:PHENOTYPE> weight-bearing joints <END> were the main clinical problems.

<START:PHENOTYPE> Widespread patchy cranial sclerosis <END> was reminiscent of Paget's disease , while <START:PHENOTYPE> digital deformity <END> resembled rheumatoid arthritis .

On the basis of a review and tabulation of published reports, evidence emerges to support the concept of <START:PHENOTYPE> X-linked inheritance <END> .

The relationship between FMD and osteodysplasty remains a matter for speculation.

Confirmation of genetic heterogeneity in familial psoriasis .

Psoriasis affects approximately 2% of the European population and is often familial.

Linkage of a subset of psoriasis families to loci on chromosome 17q has recently been reported.

We have studied members of a large multiply affected family from the north east of England and analysed genotypes for markers from 17q , including the polymorphic microsatellite markers AFM210xa5 , AFM163yg1 , AFM044xg3 , AFMa353yg1 , and AFM217yd19 .

Two point and multipoint analysis clearly show exclusion of linkage between the telomeric region of 17q and psoriasis in this family .

This confirms the genetic heterogeneity of psoriasis and the existence of at least one other major psoriasis locus .

Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia : report of a family and review.

Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia is an inherited skeletal dysplasia with <START:PHENOTYPE> radiographic changes notably in the spine <END> , similar to spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda .

There is also <START:PHENOTYPE> articular cartilage involvement <END> which gives it some clinical resemblance to rheumatoid arthritis .

We report here on six subjects from one inbred family from Jordan.

Based on previously published reports and this one, we review the clinical and radiological features and discuss the genetics and differential diagnosis of the disorder.

We suggest the addition of the word " spondyloepiphyseal " to the name adopted by the International Working Group on Constitutional Diseases of Bone , to become " progressive pseudorheumatoid spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia " .

We also speculate on candidate genes for this disorder.

A polymorphism of the CC16 gene is associated with an increased risk of asthma .

Several <START:PHENOTYPE> quantitative traits <END> associated with the <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma phenotype <END> have been linked to markers on chromosome 11q13 , although the gene responsible has yet to be well established.

The gene for Clara cell secretory protein ( CC16 ) is an ideal candidate for involvement in an inherited predisposition to asthma because of its chromosomal location, the role of the CC16 protein in controlling <START:PHENOTYPE> airway inflammation <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> differences in levels of the protein <END> between asthmatics and healthy controls .

All three CC16 exons were screened in an unselected population of 266 subjects from 76 families and a cohort of 52 severely asthmatic children .

A combination of single strand conformational polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis, heteroduplex analysis, DNA sequencing, and restriction digestion was used.

Mutation detection methods identified an adenine to guanine substitution in the CC16 gene at position 38 ( A38G ) downstream from the transcription initiation site within the non-coding region of exon 1 .

In the unselected population , 43.6% were homozygous for the polymorphic sequence ( 38GG ) and 46.2% were heterozygous ( 38AG ).

All the asthmatic and unaffected children from both populations were selected for an unmatched case control analysis consisting of 67 asthmatic and 46 unaffected subjects .

Those homozygous for the published sequence ( 38AA ) had a 6.9-fold increased risk of developing asthma ( p=0.049 ) and heterozygotes ( 38AG ) a 4.2-fold increased risk ( p=0.028 ).

Modelling of genotype as a continuous covariate indicated evidence of a significant linear trend across the three genotypes ( odds ratio=2.84 per unit increase in genotype code, p=0.018 ).

These associations were independent of age, gender, and tobacco smoke exposure.

These data and the known anti-inflammatory role of CC16 in the respiratory tract suggest that alteration to the gene at position 38 may contribute to asthma .

Maternal systemic lupus erythematosus and chondrodysplasia punctata in two sibs : phenocopy or coincidence? 

Two sibs with chondrodysplasia punctata in whom the mother was suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus are presented and the radiological features described.

Comparison with other forms of chondrodysplasia punctata with a review of the relevant publications is presented and the possible association with maternal systemic lupus erythematosus is highlighted.

Neonatal lupus syndrome : a case with chondrodysplasia punctata and other unusual manifestations.

We report a case of a newborn infant whose mother had systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) diagnosed before <START:PHENOTYPE> pregnancy <END> .

The child had clinical manifestations of neonatal lupus as well as chondrodysplasia punctata and other findings that resemble the <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital anomalies <END> associated with the use of oral anticoagulants , with no history of exposure.

We speculate that the combined action of the different maternal autoantibodies may produce the whole spectrum of manifestations.

Chondrodysplasia punctata and maternal systemic lupus erythematosus .

Citrullinated proteins have increased immunogenicity and arthritogenicity and their presence in arthritic joints correlates with <START:PHENOTYPE> disease severity <END> 

Autoantibodies directed against citrulline-containing proteins have an impressive specificity of nearly 100% in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and have been suggested to be involved in the <START:PHENOTYPE> disease pathogenesis <END> .

The targeted epitopes are generated by a <START:PHENOTYPE> post-translational modification <END> catalysed by the calcium-dependent enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase ( PAD ), which converts positively charged arginine to polar but uncharged citrulline .

The aim of this study was to explore the effects of <START:PHENOTYPE> citrullination <END> on the immunogenicity of autoantigens as well as on potential arthritogenicity.

Thus, <START:PHENOTYPE> immune responses <END> to citrullinated rat serum albumin ( Cit- RSA ) and to unmodified rat serum albumin ( RSA ) were examined as well as arthritis development induced by immunisation with citrullinated rat collagen type II ( Cit- CII ) or unmodified CII .

In addition, to correlate the presence of citrullinated proteins and the enzyme PAD4 with different stages of arthritis , synovial tissues obtained at different time points from rats with collagen-induced arthritis were examined immunohistochemically.

Our results demonstrate that <START:PHENOTYPE> citrullination <END> of the endogenous antigen RSA broke <START:PHENOTYPE> immunological tolerance <END> , as was evident by the <START:PHENOTYPE> generation <END> of antibodies directed against the modified protein and cross-reacting with the native protein .

Furthermore we could demonstrate that Cit- CII induced arthritis with higher incidence and earlier onset than did the native counterpart .

Finally, this study reveals that clinical signs of arthritis precede the presence of citrullinated proteins and the enzyme PAD4 .

As disease progressed into a more severe and chronic state, products of <START:PHENOTYPE> citrullination <END> appeared specifically in the joints.

Citrullinated proteins were detected mainly in extracellular deposits but could also be found in infiltrating cells and on the cartilage surface.

PAD4 was detected in the cytoplasm of infiltrating mononuclear cells, from day 21 after immunisation and onwards.

In conclusion, our data reveal the potency of <START:PHENOTYPE> citrullination <END> to break <START:PHENOTYPE> tolerance against the self antigen <END> RSA and to increase the arthritogenic properties of the cartilage antigen CII .

We also show that citrullinated proteins and the enzyme PAD4 are not detectable in healthy joints, and that the appearance and amounts in arthritic joints of experimental animals are correlated with the <START:PHENOTYPE> severity of inflammation <END> .

Genetic Evidence for Interaction of the 5q31 Cytokine Locus and the CARD15 Gene in Crohn Disease 

A common haplotype spanning 250 kb in the cytokine gene cluster on chromosome 5q31 has recently been reported to be strongly associated with Crohn disease ( CD ) in Canadian families .

We have replicated this finding by both the transmission-disequilibrium test ( TDT ) ( P =.016 ) and in a case - control association study ( P =.008 ) in a large European cohort of patients with CD , although the increase in disease risk was small ( odds ratio 1.49 for homozygotes , 95% CI 1.11?2.0 ).

No association was detected in families or individuals with ulcerative colitis ( UC ).

Stratification of offspring with CD in the TDT sample by mutation status in the CD susceptibility gene CARD15 showed that the association with the 5q31 risk haplotype was present only in offspring with at least one of the known CARD15 disease susceptibility alleles ( P =.044 ).

The 5q31 risk haplotype frequency was 53.1% in unrelated individuals with CD who had one or two CARD15 mutations versus 43.7% in control subjects ( P =.0001 ) but was not significantly elevated in individuals with CD who had no CARD15 mutations ( 45.4%, P =.41 ).

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of age at disease onset showed a significantly earlier onset in homozygotes for the 5q31 risk haplotype ( P =.0019 ).

These findings suggest that genetic variants at the 5q31 ( IBD5 ) locus may hasten the onset of Crohn disease and cooperate with CARD15 in disease causation.

Combined Analysis of Genome Scans of Dutch and Finnish Families Reveals a Susceptibility Locus for High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol on Chromosome 16q 

Several genomewide screens have been performed to identify novel loci predisposing to <START:PHENOTYPE> unfavorable serum lipid levels <END> and coronary heart disease ( CHD ).

We hypothesized that the accumulating data of these screens in different study populations could be combined to verify which of the identified loci truly harbor susceptibility genes .

The power of this strategy has recently been demonstrated with other complex diseases , such as inflammatory bowel disease and asthma .

We assessed the largely unknown genetic background of CHD by investigating the most common dyslipidemia predisposing to CHD , familial combined hyperlipidemia ( FCHL ), affecting 1%?2% of Western populations and 10%?20% of families with premature CHD .

To be able to perform a combined data analysis, we unified the diagnostic criteria for FCHL and its <START:PHENOTYPE> component traits <END> and combined the data from two genomewide scans performed in two populations , the Finns and the Dutch .

As a result of our pooled data analysis, we identified three chromosomal regions , on chromosomes 2p25.1 , 9p23 , and 16q24.1 , exceeding the statistical significance level of a LOD score >2.0.

The 2p25.1 region was detected for the <START:PHENOTYPE> FCHL trait <END> , and the 9p23 and 16q24.1 regions were detected for the <START:PHENOTYPE> low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) trait <END> .

In addition, the previously recognized 1q21 region also obtained additional support in the other study sample, when the <START:PHENOTYPE> triglyceride trait <END> was used.

Analysis of the 16q24.1 region resulted in a statistically significant LOD score of 3.6 when the data from Finnish families with <START:PHENOTYPE> low HDL-C <END> were included in the analysis.

To search for the underlying gene in the 16q24.1 region , we investigated a novel functional and positional candidate gene , helix/forkhead transcription factor ( FOXC2 ), by sequencing and by genotyping of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the families .

MDR1 Ala893 Polymorphism Is Associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease 

Crohn disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis ( UC ) are overlapping chronic inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBDs ).

Suggestive evidence for linkage at chromosome 7q has been reported for both CD and UC .

Contained within this region is the gene for MDR1 ( m ulti d rug r esistance ), a membrane transport protein for which human polymorphisms have been reported in Ala893Ser/Thr and C3435T that alter pharmacokinetic profiles for a variety of drugs .

Because mdr1 knockout mice spontaneously develop colitis , exonic regions were resequenced and tested for IBD association in a large, multicenter North American cohort .

Two missense mutations, Asn21Asp and Ala893Ser/Thr, as well as the <START:PHENOTYPE> expression <END> -associated polymorphism C3435T, described elsewhere, were genotyped in the entire cohort .

Significant association of Ala893 with IBD was observed by both case - control analysis ( P =.002 ) and the pedigree disequilibrium test ( PDT [ P =.00020?.00030 ] ) but not for the Asn21Asp or C3435T polymorphisms.

Significant association by PDT was observed within the subset with CD ( P =.0014?.00090 ), with similar, nonsignificant trends in a smaller subset with UC .

The Ala893Ser/Thr variant is triallelic, and the associated, common allele is Ala893 , with undertransmission of the 893Ser ( common ) and the 893Thr ( rare ) variants .

The Ala893 variant has decreased activity compared with the 893Ser variant ; therefore, the association with human IBD is consistent with the murine model of <START:PHENOTYPE> mdr1 deficiency <END> .

Taken together, these data support the association of the common Ala893 polymorphism with IBD specifically and, more broadly, provides additional support for its contribution to interindividual pharmacogenetic variation.

IBD5 is a General Risk Factor for Inflammatory Bowel Disease : Replication of Association with Crohn Disease and Identification of a Novel Association with Ulcerative Colitis 

Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) refers to complex chronic relapsing autoimmune disorders of the gastrointestinal tract that have been traditionally classified into Crohn disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis ( UC ).

We have previously reported that genetic variation within a 250-kb haplotype ( IBD5 ) in the 5q31 cytokine gene cluster confers <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility to CD <END> in a Canadian population .

In the current study, we first replicated this association by examining 368 German trios with CD and demonstrating, by transmission/disequilibrium testing ( TDT ), that the same haplotype is associated with CD ( ? 2 =5.97 ; P =.007 ).

Our original association study focused on the role of IBD5 in CD ; we next explored the potential contribution of this locus to <START:PHENOTYPE> UC susceptibility <END> in 187 German trios .

Given the TDT results in the present cohort with UC , IBD5 may also act as a susceptibility locus for UC ( ? 2 =8.10 ; P =.002 ).

We then examined locus - locus interactions between IBD5 and CARD15 , a locus reported elsewhere to confer risk exclusively to CD .

Our current results indicate that the two loci act independently to confer risk to CD but that these two loci may behave in an epistatic fashion to promote the development of UC .

Moreover, IBD5 was not associated with particular clinical manifestations upon phenotypic stratification in the current cohort with CD .

Taken together, our results suggest that IBD5 may act as a general risk factor for IBD , with loci such as CARD15 modifying the clinical characteristics of disease.

Common and Unique Susceptibility Loci in Graves and Hashimoto Diseases : Results of Whole-Genome Screening in a Data Set of 102 Multiplex Families 

The autoimmune thyroid diseases ( AITDs ), comprising Graves disease ( GD ) and Hashimoto thyroiditis ( HT ), develop as a result of a complex interaction between predisposing genes and environmental triggers.

Previously, we identified six loci that showed evidence for linkage with AITD in a data set of 56 multiplex families .

The goals of the present study were to replicate/reject the previously identified loci before fine mapping and sequencing the candidate genes in these regions .

We performed a whole-genome linkage study in an expanded data set of 102 multiplex families with AITD ( 540 individuals ), through use of 400 microsatellite markers .

Seven loci showed evidence for linkage to AITD .

Three loci , on chromosomes 6p , 8q , and 10q , showed evidence for linkage with both GD and HT ( maximum multipoint heterogeneity LOD scores [HLOD] 2.0, 3.5, and 4.1, respectively ).

Three loci showed evidence for linkage with GD : on 7q ( HLOD 2.3 ), 14q ( HLOD 2.1 ), and 20q ( LOD 3.3, in a subset of the families ).

One locus on 12q showed evidence of linkage with HT , giving an HLOD of 3.4.

Comparison with the results obtained in the original data set showed that the 20q ( GD-2 ) and 12q ( HT-2 ) loci continued to show evidence for linkage in the expanded data set; the 6p and 14q loci were located within the same region as the previously identified 6p and 14q loci ( AITD-1 and GD-1 , respectively ), but the Xq ( GD-3 ) and 13q ( HT-1 ) loci were not replicated in the expanded data set.

These results demonstrated that multiple genes may predispose to GD and HT and that some may be common to both diseases and some are unique.

The loci that continue to show evidence for linkage in the expanded data set represent serious candidate regions for gene identification.

CARD15 : a Pleiotropic Autoimmune Gene That Confers <START:PHENOTYPE> Susceptibility to Psoriatic Arthritis <END> 

A recent genomewide scan in psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) revealed a susceptibility locus at 16q .

This region overlaps CARD15 , a susceptibility gene in Crohn disease .

The possibility of a common susceptibility gene between PsA and Crohn disease is further supported by epidemiological studies that note an increased incidence of psoriasis in subjects with Crohn .

We screened 187 patients with PsA and 136 healthy controls , all from Newfoundland, for the three common, independent sequence variants of CARD15 ( R702W , leu1007fsinsC , and G908R ), which were detected by polymerase chain reaction by use of allele-specific primers and visualized through gel electrophoresis.

In total, 53/187 ( 28.3% ) probands with PsA had at least one variant of the CARD15 gene , compared with 16/136 ( 11.8% ) controls ( odds ratio 2.97; 95% confidence interval 1.61?5.47; P =.0005 ).

Allele frequencies of R702W , leu1007fsinsC , and G908R were 10.43%, 3.21%, and 1.61%, respectively, in patients with PsA , compared with 3.31%, 2.57%, and 0.37%, respectively, in the control patients .

CARD15 conferred <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility to PsA <END> independent of HLA-Cw*0602 .

Thus, CARD15 represents a pleiotropic autoimmune gene and is the first non-MHC gene to be associated with PsA .

A stop codon polymorphism of Toll-like receptor 5 is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> resistance <END> to systemic lupus erythematosus 

Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is an autoimmune disease with a complex genetic basis that includes susceptibility gene( s ) within the chromosome 1q41?1q42 region .

Toll-like receptor 5 ( TLR5 ), the innate immune receptor for bacterial flagellin , maps to chromosome 1q41 and contains a common stop codon polymorphism that abrogates <START:PHENOTYPE> signaling <END> ( allele C1174T ) and is associated with an increased risk of infection .

By using transmission disequilibrium testing in a cohort containing 199 affected patients and their 75 unaffected siblings and 326 parents , we found that allele 1174C , but not 1174T ( with the stop codon ), was preferentially transmitted to SLE-affected offspring ( a 19:6 transmitted/not transmitted ratio, P = 0.009 ).

In contrast, the alleles of the other three TLR5 SNPs did not exhibit <START:PHENOTYPE> preferential transmission <END> .

In addition, we found that allele 1174C was not preferentially transmitted to unaffected offspring ( 3:6 transmitted/not transmitted ratio, P value not significant ).

The allele frequency of 1174T in the probands was 3.2% compared with 5.8% in unaffected individuals , which was consistent with a protective association ( odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.26?0.98; P = 0.041 ).

Subjects with the TLR5 stop codon produced <START:PHENOTYPE> significantly lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines <END> in comparison with individuals with the wild-type genotype .

Together, these results indicate that the TLR5 stop codon polymorphism is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> protection <END> from the development of SLE .

These data support a role for f lagellated bacteria and the <START:PHENOTYPE> innate immune response <END> in the development of SLE with implications for novel immunomodulatory treatment strategies.

Linkage at 12q24 with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) Is Established and Confirmed in Hispanic and European American Families 

Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is a chronic, complex, and systemic human autoimmune disease , with both an environmental component and a heritable predisposition.

Clinical studies, reinforced by epidemiology and genetics, show impressive variation in <START:PHENOTYPE> disease severity <END> , expression, prevalence, and incidence by ethnicity and sex.

To identify the novel SLE susceptibility loci , we performed a genomewide scan with 318 markers on 37 multiplex Hispanic families , using a nonparametric penetrance-independent affected-only allele -sharing method.

Three chromosomal regions ( 12q24 , 16p13 , and 16q12-21 ) exceeded our predetermined threshold ( Z lr >2.32 ; nominal P <.01 ) for further evaluation.

Suspected linkages at 12q24 , 16p13 , and 16q12-21 were tested in an independent data set consisting of 92 European American ( EA-1 ) and 55 African American ( AA ) families .

The linkage at 12q24 was replicated in EA-1 ( Z lr =3.06 ; P =.001 ) but not in AA ( Z lr =0.37 ; P =.35 ).

Although neither the 16p13 nor the 16q12-21 was confirmed in EA-1 or AA , the suggestive linkage ( Z lr =3.06 ; P =.001 ) at 16q12-21 is sufficient to confirm the significant linkage, reported elsewhere, at this location.

The evidence for linkage at 12q24 in the 129 combined ( Hispanic and EA-1 ) families exceeded the threshold for genomewide significance ( Z lr =4.39 ; P =5.7×10 -6 ; nonparametric LOD =4.19 ).

Parametric linkage analyses suggested a low-penetrance, dominant model ( LOD =3.72 ).

To confirm the linkage effect at 12q24 , we performed linkage analysis in another set of 82 independent European American families ( EA-2 ).

The evidence for linkage was confirmed ( Z lr =2.11 ; P =.017 ).

Therefore, our results have detected, established, and confirmed the existence of a novel SLE susceptibility locus at 12q24 ( designated ? SLEB4 ? ) that may cause lupus , especially in Hispanic and European American families .

Whole-Genome Scan, in a Complex Disease , Using 11,245 Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms: Comparison with Microsatellites 

Despite the theoretical evidence of the utility of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) for linkage analysis, no whole-genome scans of a complex disease have yet been published to directly compare SNPs with microsatellites .

Here, we describe a whole-genome screen of 157 families with multiple cases of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ), performed using 11,245 genomewide SNPs.

The results were compared with those from a 10-cM microsatellite scan in the same cohort .

The SNP analysis detected HLA*DRB1 , the major RA susceptibility locus ( P =.00004 ), with a linkage interval of 31 cM, compared with a 50-cM linkage interval detected by the microsatellite scan.

In addition, four loci were detected at a nominal significance level ( P <.05 ) in the SNP linkage analysis; these were not observed in the microsatellite scan.

We demonstrate that variation in information content was the main factor contributing to observed differences in the two scans, with the SNPs providing significantly higher information content than the microsatellites .

Reducing the number of SNPs in the marker set to 3,300 ( 1-cM spacing ) caused several loci to drop below nominal significance levels, suggesting that decreases in information content can have significant effects on linkage results.

In contrast, differences in maps employed in the analysis, the low detectable rate of genotyping error, and the presence of moderate linkage disequilibrium between markers did not significantly affect the results.

We have demonstrated the utility of a dense SNP map for performing linkage analysis in a late-age-at-onset disease , where DNA from parents is not always available.

The high SNP density allows loci to be defined more precisely and provides a partial scaffold for association studies, substantially reducing the resource requirement for gene -mapping studies.

Genetic Association of the R620W Polymorphism of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase PTPN22 with Human SLE 

We genotyped 525 independent North American white individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) for the PTPN22 R620W polymorphism and compared the results with data generated from 1,961 white control individuals .

The R620W SNP was associated with SLE ( genotypic P =.00009 ), with estimated minor ( T ) allele frequencies of 12.67% in SLE cases and 8.64% in controls .

A single copy of the T allele ( W620 ) increases risk of SLE ( odds ratio [ OR ]=1.37 ; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07?1.75 ), and two copies of the allele more than double this risk ( OR =4.37 ; 95% CI 1.98?9.65 ).

Together with recent evidence showing association of this SNP with type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis , these data provide compelling evidence that PTPN22 plays a fundamental role in regulating the immune system and the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmunity <END> .

The IL12B Gene Is Associated with Asthma 

The IL12B gene on chromosome 5q31-33 encodes the p40 subunit of interleukin 12 , an immunomodulatory cytokine .

To test the hypothesis that the IL12B gene contains polymorphisms associated with asthma , we genotyped six haplotype -tagging polymorphisms in the IL12B gene , both in 708 children enrolled in the Childhood Asthma Management Program ( CAMP ) and in their parents .

Using the family -based association test ( FBAT ) program and its haplotype ( HBAT ) and phenotype ( PBAT ) options, we tested each polymorphism and haplotype for association with asthma and <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma-related phenotypes <END> .

We tested positive associations for replication in a case - control study comparing 177 adult moderate-to-severe asthmatics with 177 nonasthmatic controls .

In whites in the CAMP cohort , the A allele of the IL12B G4237A polymorphism was undertransmitted to asthmatic children ( P =.0008 , recessive model ), the global test for haplotypes for affection status was positive ( P =.009 , multiallelic ? 2 ), and two polymorphisms were associated with different <START:PHENOTYPE> atopy phenotypes <END> .

In addition, we found a strong association between the IL12B_4237 and IL12B_6402 polymorphisms and an <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma-severity phenotype <END> in whites , which we also found in the independent population of white adult asthmatics .

IL12B may be an important asthma gene .

Fine Mapping and Positional Candidate Studies Identify HLA-G as an Asthma Susceptibility Gene on Chromosome 6p21 

Asthma affects nearly 14 million people worldwide and has been steadily increasing in frequency for the past 50 years.

Although environmental factors clearly influence the onset, progression, and <START:PHENOTYPE> severity <END> of this disease, family and twin studies indicate that genetic variation also influences <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility <END> .

Linkage of asthma and <START:PHENOTYPE> related phenotypes <END> to chromosome 6p21 has been reported in seven genome screens, making it the most replicated region of the genome.

However, because many genes with individually small effects are likely to contribute to risk, identification of asthma susceptibility loci has been challenging.

In this study, we present evidence from four independent samples in support of HLA-G as a novel asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness susceptibility gene in the human leukocyte antigen region on chromosome 6p21 , and we speculate that this gene might contribute to risk for other inflammatory diseases that show linkage to this region.

Polymorphisms in the Tyrosine Kinase 2 and Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 Genes Are Associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 

Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is a complex systemic autoimmune disease caused by both genetic and environmental factors.

Genome scans in families with SLE point to multiple potential chromosomal regions that harbor SLE susceptibility genes , and association studies in different populations have suggested several susceptibility alleles for SLE .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Increased production of type I interferon <END> ( IFN ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> expression of IFN-inducible genes <END> is commonly observed in SLE and may be pivotal in the <START:PHENOTYPE> molecular pathogenesis <END> of the disease.

We analyzed 44 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 13 genes from the type I IFN pathway in 679 Swedish, Finnish, and Icelandic patients with SLE , in 798 unaffected family members , and in 438 unrelated control individuals for joint linkage and association with SLE .

In two of the genes?the tyrosine kinase 2 ( TYK2 ) and IFN regulatory factor 5 ( IRF5 ) genes ?we identified SNPs that displayed strong signals in joint analysis of linkage and association ( unadjusted P <10 -7 ) with SLE .

TYK2 binds to the type I IFN receptor complex and IRF5 is a regulator of <START:PHENOTYPE> type I IFN gene expression <END> .

Thus, our results support a disease mechanism in SLE that involves key components of the type I IFN system.

Regression Mapping of Association between the Human Leukocyte Antigen Region and Graves Disease 

The human leukocyte antigen class II genes DRB1 , DQB1 , and DQA1 are associated with Graves disease ( GD ), but, because of strong linkage disequilibrium within this region, the primary etiological variant( s ) remains unknown.

In the present study, 871 patients with GD and 621 control subjects were genotyped at the DRB1 , DQB1 , and DQA1 loci .

All three loci were associated with GD ( P =1.45×10 -12 , P =3.20×10 -5 , and P =9.26×10 -12 , respectively ).

Stepwise logistic-regression analysis showed that the association could be explained by either DRB1 or DQA1 but not by DQB1 .

To extend previous results, the amino acid sequence of the exon 2?encoded peptide-binding domain of DRB1 was predicted for each subject , and, by use of logistic regression, each position was analyzed for association with GD .

Of 102 amino acids , 70 were uninformative; of the remaining 32 amino acids , 13 were associated with GD ( P values ranged from 2.20×10 -4 to 1.2×10 -12 ).

The strongest association was at position ?74 .

This analysis is consistent with the possibility that position ?74 of exon 2 of the DRB1 molecule may have a specific and central role in <START:PHENOTYPE> autoantigen presentation <END> by DRB1 to T lymphocytes .

However, we cannot yet exclude a primary role for DQA1 or for other polymorphisms that affect DRB1 function or <START:PHENOTYPE> expression <END> .

Analysis of Families in the Multiple Autoimmune Disease Genetics Consortium ( MADGC ) Collection: the PTPN22 620W Allele Associates with <START:PHENOTYPE> Multiple Autoimmune Phenotypes <END> 

Autoimmune disorders constitute a diverse group of phenotypes with overlapping features and a tendency toward familial aggregation.

It is likely that common underlying genes are involved in these disorders.

Until very recently, no specific alleles ?aside from a few common human leukocyte antigen class II genes ?had been identified that clearly associate with multiple different autoimmune diseases .

In this study, we describe a unique collection of 265 multiplex families assembled by the Multiple Autoimmune Disease Genetics Consortium ( MADGC ).

At least two of nine ?core? autoimmune diseases are present in each of these families .

These core diseases include rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ), systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ), type 1 diabetes ( T1D ), multiple sclerosis ( MS ), autoimmune thyroid disease ( Hashimoto thyroiditis or Graves disease ), juvenile RA , inflammatory bowel disease ( Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis ), psoriasis , and primary Sjögren syndrome .

We report that a recently described functional single-nucleotide polymorphism ( rs2476601, encoding R620W ) in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase ( PTPN22 ) confers risk of four separate <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune phenotype <END> s in these families : T1D , RA , SLE , and Hashimoto thyroiditis .

MS did not show association with the PTPN22 risk allele .

These findings suggest a common underlying etiologic pathway for some, but not all, autoimmune disorders , and they suggest that MS may have a <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis <END> that is distinct from RA , SLE , and T1D .

DNA and clinical data for the MADGC families are available to the scientific community; these data will provide a valuable resource for the dissection of the complex genetic factors that underlie the various <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune phenotypes <END> .

Gene -Environment Interaction Effects on the Development of <START:PHENOTYPE> Immune Responses <END> in the 1st Year of Life 

Asthma is a common disease that results from both genetic and environmental risk factors.

Children attending day care in the 1st year of life have lower risks for developing asthma , although the mechanism for this ?day care? effect is largely unknown.

We investigated the interactions between day care exposure in the 1st 6 mo of life and genotypes for 72 polymorphisms at 45 candidate loci and their effects on <START:PHENOTYPE> cytokine response <END> profiles and on the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic phenotypes <END> in the 1st year of life in the C hildhood O nset of Ast hma ( COAST ) cohort of children .

Six interactions ( at four polymorphisms in three loci ) with ?day care? that had an effect on <START:PHENOTYPE> early-life immune phenotypes <END> were significant at P <.001 .

The estimated false-discovery rate was 33%, indicating that an estimated four P values correspond to true associations.

Moreover, the ?day care? effect at some loci was accounted for by the increased number of viral infections among COAST children attending day care, whereas interactions at other loci were independent of the number of viral infections , indicating the presence of additional risk factors associated with day care environment.

This study identified significant gene -environment interactions influencing the early patterning of the immune system and the subsequent development of asthma and highlights the importance of considering environmental risk factors in genetic analyses.

Localization of a Type 1 Diabetes Locus in the IL2RA/CD25 Region by Use of Tag Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms 

As part of an ongoing search for genes associated with type 1 diabetes ( T1D ), a common autoimmune disease , we tested the biological candidate gene IL2RA ( CD25 ), which encodes a subunit ( IL-2R? ) of the high-affinity interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor complex .

We employed a tag single-nucleotide polymorphism ( tag SNP ) approach in large T1D sample collections consisting of 7,457 cases and controls and 725 multiplex families .

Tag SNPs were analyzed using a multilocus test to provide a regional test for association.

We found strong statistical evidence in the case-control collection ( P =6.5×10 -8 ) for a T1D locus in the CD25 region of chromosome 10p15 and replicated the association in the family collection ( P =7.3×10 -3 ; combined P =1.3×10 -10 ).

These results illustrate the utility of tag SNPs in a chromosome -regional test of disease association and justify future fine mapping of the causal variant in the region .

A Missense Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism in a Gene Encoding a Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase ( PTPN22 ) Is Associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis 

Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is the most common systemic autoimmune disease , affecting ?1% of the adult population worldwide, with an estimated heritability of 60%.

To identify genes involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> RA susceptibility <END> , we investigated the association between putative functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and RA among white individuals by use of a case - control study design; a second sample was tested for replication.

Here we report the association of <START:PHENOTYPE> RA susceptibility <END> with the minor allele of a missense SNP in PTPN22 ( discovery-study allelic P =6.6×10 -4 ; replication-study allelic P =5.6×10 -8 ), which encodes a hematopoietic-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase also known as ? Lyp .? We show that the risk allele , which is present in ?17% of white individuals from the general population and in ?28% of white individuals with RA , disrupts the P1 proline-rich motif that is important for interaction with Csk , potentially altering these proteins ' normal function as negative regulators of <START:PHENOTYPE> T-cell activation <END> .

The minor allele of this SNP recently was implicated in type 1 diabetes , suggesting that the variant phosphatase may increase overall reactivity of the immune system and may heighten an individual carrier ?s risk for autoimmune disease .

International Collaboration Provides Convincing Linkage Replication in Complex Disease through Analysis of a Large Pooled Data Set: Crohn Disease and Chromosome 16 

Numerous familial, non-Mendelian ( i.e., complex ) diseases have been screened by linkage analysis for regions harboring susceptibility genes .

Except for rare, high-penetrance syndromes showing <START:PHENOTYPE> Mendelian inheritance <END> , such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 , most attempts have failed to produce replicable linkage findings.

For example, in multiple sclerosis and other complex diseases , there have been many reports of significant linkage, followed by numerous failures to replicate.

In inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ), linkage to two regions has elsewhere been reported at genomewide significance levels: the pericentromeric region on chromosome 16 ( IBD1 ) and chromosome 12q ( IBD2 ).

As with other complex diseases , the subsequent support for these localizations has been variable.

In this article, we report the results of an international collaborative effort to investigate these putative localization by pooling of data sets that do not individually provide convincing evidence for linkage to these regions .

Our results, generated by the genotyping and analysis of 12 microsatellite markers in 613 families , provide unequivocal replication of linkage for a common human disease: a Crohn disease susceptibility locus on chromosome 16 ( maximum LOD score 5.79 ).

Despite failure to replicate the previous evidence for linkage on chromosome 12 , the results described herein indicate the need to further investigate the potential role of this locus in <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility to ulcerative colitis <END> .

This report provides a convincing example of the collaborative approach necessary to obtain the sample numbers required to achieve statistical power in studies of <START:PHENOTYPE> complex human traits <END> .

Genomewide Screen and Identification of Gene - Gene Interactions for Asthma-Susceptibility Loci in Three U.S.

Populations: Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Asthma 

The genomewide screen to search for asthma-susceptibility loci , in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Asthma ( CSGA ), has been conducted in two stages and includes 266 families ( 199 nuclear and 67 extended pedigrees ) from three U.S. populations : African American , European American , and Hispanic .

Evidence for linkage with the <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma phenotype <END> was observed for multiple chromosomal regions , through use of several analytical approaches that facilitated the identification of multiple disease loci .

Ethnicity-specific analyses, which allowed for different frequencies of asthma-susceptibility genes in each ethnic population , provided the strongest evidence for linkage at 6p21 in the European American population , at 11q21 in the African American population , and at 1p32 in the Hispanic population .

Both the conditional analysis and the affected-sib-pair two- locus analysis provided further evidence for linkage, at 5q31 , 8p23 , 12q22 , and 15q13 .

Several of these regions have been observed in other genomewide screens and linkage or association studies, for asthma and <START:PHENOTYPE> related phenotypes <END> .

These results were used to develop a conceptual model to delineate asthma-susceptibility loci and their genetic interactions, which provides a promising basis for initiation of fine-mapping studies and, ultimately, for gene identification.

Use of Closely Related Affected Individuals for the Genetic Study of Complex Diseases in Founder Populations 

We propose a method, the maximum identity length contrast ( MILC ) statistic, to locate genetic risk factors for complex diseases in founder populations .

The MILC approach compares the identity length of parental haplotypes that are transmitted to affected offspring with the identity length of those that are not transmitted to affected offspring .

Initially, the statistical properties of the method were assessed using randomly selected affected individuals with unknown relationship.

Because both nuclear families with multiple affected sibs and large pedigrees are often available in founder populations , we performed simulations to investigate the properties of the MILC statistic in the presence of closely related affected individuals .

The simulation showed that the use of closely related affected individuals greatly enhances the power of the statistic.

For a given sample size and type I error, the use of affected sib pairs , instead of affected individuals randomly selected from the population , could increase the power by a factor of two.

This increase was related to an increase of kinship-coefficient contrast between haplotype groups when closely related individuals were considered.

The MILC approach allows the simultaneous use of affected individuals from a founder population and affected individuals with any kind of relationship, close or remote.

We used the MILC approach to analyze the role of HLA in celiac disease and showed that the effect of HLA may be detected with the MILC approach by typing only 11 affected individuals , who were part of a single large Finnish pedigree .

A Genomewide Search for Quantitative-Trait Loci Underlying Asthma 

A genomewide screen for quantitative-trait loci ( QTLs ) that underlie asthma was performed on 533 Chinese families with asthma , by the unified Haseman-Elston method.

Nine <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma-related phenotypes <END> were studied, including <START:PHENOTYPE> forced expiratory volume in 1 s <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> FEV 1 <END> ), <START:PHENOTYPE> forced vital capacity <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> FVC <END> ), <START:PHENOTYPE> airway responsiveness <END> as indicated by methacholine ( MTCH )-challenge test, <START:PHENOTYPE> serum total immunoglobulin E <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> TIgE <END> ), <START:PHENOTYPE> serum-specific immunoglobulin E <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> eosinophil count in peripheral blood <END> , and skin-prick tests with three different allergens ( cockroach , Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus , and D. farinae ).

Our study showed significant linkage between <START:PHENOTYPE> airway responsiveness <END> to MTCH and D2S1780 on chromosome 2 ( P <.00002 ) and provided suggestive evidence ( P <.002 ) for six additional possible QTLs : D10S1435 and D22S685 , for <START:PHENOTYPE> FEV 1 <END> ; D16S412 , for <START:PHENOTYPE> FVC <END> ; D19S433 , for <START:PHENOTYPE> airway responsiveness to MTCH <END> ; D1S518 , for <START:PHENOTYPE> TIgE <END> ; and D4S1647 , for <START:PHENOTYPE> skin reactivity to cockroach <END> .

No significant or suggestive evidence of linkage for the other four <START:PHENOTYPE> traits <END> was found.

Evidence for a Susceptibility Gene , SLEV1 , on Chromosome 17p13 in Families with Vitiligo -Related Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 

Both systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) and vitiligo are autoimmune disorders that have strong evidence of complex genetic contributions to their etiology, but, to date, efforts using genetic linkage to find the susceptibility genes for either phenotype have met with limited success.

Since autoimmune diseases are thought to share at least some of their genetic origins, and since only a small minority ( 16 of 92 ) of the European-American pedigrees multiplex for SLE in our collection have one or more affected members with vitiligo , we hypothesized that these pedigrees might be more genetically homogeneous at loci important to both SLE and vitiligo and, hence, have increased power for detection of linkage.

We therefore evaluated genomewide microsatellite-marker ?scan data for markers at an average marker density of ?11 cM in these 16 European-American pedigrees and identified a significant linkage at 17p13 , where the maximum multipoint parametric LOD score was 3.64 ( P <4.3×10 -5 ) and the nonparametric linkage score was 4.02 ( P <2.8×10 -5 ), respectively.

The segregation behavior of this linkage suggests a recessive mode of <START:PHENOTYPE> inheritance <END> with a virtually homogeneous genetic effect in these 16 pedigrees .

These results support the hypotheses that SLE and vitiligo may share important genetic effects and that sampling on the basis of clinical covariates dramatically improves power to identify genetic effects.

BLyS and APRIL in rheumatoid arthritis 

The cytokines B lymphocyte stimulator ( BLyS ) and a proliferation-inducing ligand ( APRIL ) enhance autoimmune disease by sustaining <START:PHENOTYPE> B cell activation <END> .

In RA , B cells contribute to the formation of 3 functionally distinct types of lymphoid microarchitectures in the <START:PHENOTYPE> inflamed synovium <END> : <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopic GCs <END> ; <START:PHENOTYPE> T cell?B cell aggregates lacking GC reactions <END> ; and <START:PHENOTYPE> unorganized, diffuse infiltrates <END> .

We examined 72 tissues representing the 3 types of synovitis for <START:PHENOTYPE> BLyS and APRIL production <END> and for <START:PHENOTYPE> expression of APRIL/BLyS receptors <END> .

Biologic effects of BLyS and APRIL were explored by treating human synovium?SCID mouse chimeras with the APRIL and BLyS decoy receptor transmembrane activator and CAML interactor:Fc ( TACI:Fc ) .

GC + synovitis had the <START:PHENOTYPE> highest levels of APRIL <END> , produced exclusively by CD83 + DCs .

BLyS was present in similar levels in all tissue types and derived exclusively from CD68 + macrophages .

In GC + synovitis , treatment with TACI:Fc resulted in <START:PHENOTYPE> GC destruction <END> and marked inhibition of <START:PHENOTYPE> IFN-? and Ig transcription <END> .

In contrast, inhibition of APRIL and BLyS in aggregate and diffuse synovitis left <START:PHENOTYPE> Ig levels <END> unaffected and enhanced <START:PHENOTYPE> IFN-? production <END> .

These differential immunomodulatory effects correlated with the presence of TACI + T cells in aggregate and diffuse synovitis and their absence in GC + synovitis .

We propose that BLyS and APRIL regulate B cell as well as T cell function and have pro- and antiinflammatory activities in RA .

PTPN22 Genetic Variation: Evidence for Multiple Variants Associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis 

The minor allele of the R620W missense single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) ( rs2476601 ) in the hematopoietic-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase gene , PTPN22 , has been associated with multiple autoimmune diseases , including rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ).

These genetic data, combined with biochemical evidence that this SNP affects PTPN22 function, suggest that this phosphatase is a key regulator of <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmunity <END> .

To determine whether other genetic variants in PTPN22 contribute to the development of RA , we sequenced the coding regions of this gene in 48 white North American patients with RA and identified 15 previously unreported SNPs, including 2 coding SNPs in the catalytic domain .

We then genotyped 37 SNPs in or near PTPN22 in 475 patients with RA and 475 individually matched controls ( sample set 1 ) and selected a subset of markers for replication in an additional 661 patients with RA and 1,322 individually matched controls ( sample set 2 ).

Analyses of these results predict 10 common ( frequency >1% ) PTPN22 haplotypes in white North Americans .

The sole haplotype found to carry the previously identified W620 risk allele was strongly associated with disease in both sample sets , whereas another haplotype , identical at all other SNPs but carrying the R620 allele , showed no association.

R620W, however, does not fully explain the association between PTPN22 and RA , since significant differences between cases and controls persisted in both sample sets after the haplotype data were stratified by R620W.

Additional analyses identified two SNPs on a single common haplotype that are associated with RA independent of R620W, suggesting that R620W and at least one additional variant in the PTPN22 gene region influence <START:PHENOTYPE> RA susceptibility <END> .

A Genomewide Screen in Multiplex Rheumatoid Arthritis Families Suggests Genetic Overlap with Other Autoimmune Diseases 

Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is an autoimmune/inflammatory disorder with a complex genetic component .

We report the first major genomewide screen of multiplex families with RA gathered in the United States.

The North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium, using well-defined clinical criteria, has collected 257 families containing 301 affected sibling pairs with RA .

A genome screen for allele sharing was performed, using 379 microsatellite markers .

A nonparametric analysis using SIBPAL confirmed linkage of the HLA locus to RA ( P <.00005 ), with ? HLA =1.79 .

However, the analysis also revealed a number of non-HLA loci on chromosomes 1 ( D1S235 ), 4 ( D4S1647 ), 12 ( D12S373 ), 16 ( D16S403 ), and 17 ( D17S1301 ) , with evidence for linkage at a significance level of P <.005 .

Analysis of X-linked markers using the MLOD method from ASPEX also suggests linkage to the telomeric marker DXS6807 .

Stratifying the families into white or seropositive subgroups revealed some additional markers that showed improvement in significance over the full data set .

Several of the regions that showed evidence for nominal significance ( P <.05 ) in our data set had previously been implicated in RA ( D16S516 and D17S1301 ) or in other diseases of an <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune <END> nature, including systemic lupus erythematosus ( D1S235 ), inflammatory bowel disease ( D4S1647 , D5S1462 , and D16S516 ), multiple sclerosis ( D12S1052 ), and ankylosing spondylitis ( D16S516 ).

Therefore, genes in the HLA complex play a major role in <START:PHENOTYPE> RA susceptibility <END> , but several other regions also contribute significantly to overall genetic risk.

DC-SIGN Induction in Alveolar Macrophages Defines Privileged Target Host Cells for Mycobacteria in Patients with Tuberculosis 

Background Interplays between Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the etiological agent of tuberculosis ( TB ) in human and host professional phagocytes , namely macrophages ( M s ) and dendritic cells ( DCs ), are central to <START:PHENOTYPE> immune protection <END> against TB and to <START:PHENOTYPE> TB pathogenesis <END> .

We and others have recently shown that the C-type lectin dendritic cell?specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin ( DC-SIGN ; CD209 ) mediates important interactions between mycobacteria and human monocyte-derived DCs ( MoDCs ) in vitro.

Methods and Findings In order to explore the possible role of DC-SIGN in M. tuberculosis infection in vivo, we have analysed <START:PHENOTYPE> DC-SIGN expression <END> in broncho-alveolar lavage ( BAL ) cells from patients with TB ( n = 40 ) or with other <START:PHENOTYPE> non-mycobacterial lung pathologies <END> , namely asthma ( n = 14 ) and sarcoidosis ( n = 11 ), as well as from control individuals ( n = 9 ).

We show that in patients with TB , up to 70% of alveolar M s express DC-SIGN .

By contrast, the lectin is barely detected in alveolar M s from all other individuals .

Flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay analyses of BAL-derived fluids and cells indicated that M. tuberculosis infection induces <START:PHENOTYPE> DC-SIGN expression <END> in alveolar M s by a mechanism that is independent of Toll-like receptor-4 , interleukin ( IL )-4 , and IL-13 .

This mechanism most likely relies on the <START:PHENOTYPE> secretion of soluble host and/or mycobacterial factors <END> that have yet to be identified, as both infected and uninfected bystander M s were found to express DC-SIGN in the presence of M. tuberculosis .

Immunohistochemical examination of lung biopsy samples from patients with TB showed that the bacilli concentrate in pulmonary regions enriched in <START:PHENOTYPE> DC-SIGN-expressing alveolar M s <END> in vivo.

Ex vivo binding and inhibition of binding experiments further revealed that <START:PHENOTYPE> DC-SIGN?expressing alveolar M s <END> constitute preferential target cells for M. tuberculosis , as compared to their DC-SIGN ? counterparts .

In contrast with what has been reported previously in MoDCs in vitro, ex vivo DC-SIGN ligation by mycobacterial products failed to induce <START:PHENOTYPE> IL-10 secretion <END> by alveolar M s , and IL-10 was not detected in BALs from patients with TB .

Conclusion Altogether, our results provide further evidence for an important role of DC-SIGN during TB in humans .

<START:PHENOTYPE> DC-SIGN induction <END> in alveolar M s may have important consequences on <START:PHENOTYPE> lung colonization <END> by the tubercle bacillus , and on <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary inflammatory <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> immune responses <END> in the infected host .

Genome Scan of Human Systemic Lupus Erythematosus by Regression Modeling: Evidence of Linkage and Epistasis at 4p16-15.2 

Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is a complex autoimmune disorder involving at least hormonal, environmental, and genetic factors.

Familial aggregation, a 2%?3% sibling recurrence rate, monozygotic twin concordance >20%, association with several candidate genes , as well as the results of five genome scans support a genetic component .

We present here the results of a genome scan of 126 pedigrees multiplex for SLE , including 469 sibling pairs ( affected and unaffected ) and 175 affected relative pairs .

Using the revised multipoint Haseman-Elston regression technique for concordant and discordant sibling pairs and a conditional logistic regression technique for affected relative pairs , we identify a novel linkage to chromosome 4p16-15.2 ( P =.0003 and LOD =3.84 ) and present evidence of an epistatic interaction between chromosome 4p16-15.2 and chromosome 5p15 in our European American families .

We confirm the evidence of linkage to chromosome 4p16-15.2 in European American families using data from an independent pedigree collection .

In addition, our data support the published results of three independent studies for nine purportedly linked regions and agree with the previously published results from a subset of these data for three regions .

In summary, results from two new analytical techniques establish and confirm linkage with SLE at 4p16-15.2 , indicate epistasis between 4p16-15.2 and 5p15 , and confirm other linkage effects with SLE that have been reported elsewhere.

The IBD2 Locus Shows Linkage Heterogeneity between Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn Disease 

The IBD2 locus on chromosome 12 has been linked to both Crohn disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis ( UC ) but has not been detected in some CD -dominated data sets.

In the present study, we genotyped 581 relative pairs with inflammatory bowel disease ( 252 from CD-only families , 138 from UC-only families , and 191 from mixed families containing cases of both CD and UC ), using 12 markers spanning the IBD2 locus .

A GENEHUNTER-PLUS multipoint LOD score of 3.91 was detected for pairs from UC-only families , compared with 1.66 for CD-only and 1.29 for mixed families .

The difference between the LOD scores for UC and CD was significant in two different tests for heterogeneity ( P =.0057 for one test and P =.0375 for the other ).

IBD2 thus appears to make a major contribution to <START:PHENOTYPE> UC susceptibility <END> but to have only a relatively minor effect with regard to CD , for which there may be substantially more locus heterogeneity.

Genome Screening in Human Systemic Lupus Erythematosus : Results from a Second Minnesota Cohort and Combined Analyses of 187 Sib-Pair Families 

Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of immunologic tolerance <END> to a multitude of self-antigens .

Epidemiological data suggest an important role for genes in the etiology of lupus , and previous genetic studies have implicated the HLA locus , complement genes , and low-affinity IgG ( Fc? ) receptors in <START:PHENOTYPE> SLE pathogenesis <END> .

In an effort to identify new susceptibility loci for SLE , we recently reported the results of a genomewide microsatellite marker screen in 105 SLE sib-pair families .

By using nonparametric methods, evidence for linkage was found in four intervals : 6p11-21 ( near the HLA ) , 16q13 , 14q21-23 , and 20p12.3 ( LOD scores 2.0 ), and weaker evidence in another nine regions .

We now report the results of a second complete genome screen in a new cohort of 82 SLE sib-pair families .

In the cohort 2 screen, the four best intervals were 7p22 ( LOD score 2.87 ), 7q21 ( LOD score 2.40 ), 10p13 ( LOD score 2.24 ), and 7q36 ( LOD score 2.15 ).

Eight additional intervals were identified with LOD scores in the range 1.00?1.67.

A combined analysis of MN cohorts 1 and 2 ( 187 sib-pair families ) showed that markers in 6p11-p21 ( D6S426 , LOD score 4.19 ) and 16q13 ( D16S415 , LOD score 3.85 ) met the criteria for significant linkage.

Three intervals ( 2p15 , 7q36 , and 1q42 ) had LOD scores in the range 1.92?2.06, and another 13 intervals had LOD scores in the range of 1.00?1.78 in the combined sample .

These data, together with other available gene mapping results in SLE , are beginning to allow a prioritization of genomic intervals for gene discovery efforts in human SLE .

Linkage of Inflammatory Bowel Disease to Human Chromosome 6p 

Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) is characterized by a <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation <END> .

IBD is subdivided into <START:PHENOTYPE> Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis phenotypes <END> .

Given the <START:PHENOTYPE> immunologic dysregulation <END> in IBD , the human-leukocyte-antigen region on chromosome 6p is of significant interest.

Previous association and linkage analysis has provided conflicting evidence as to the existence of an IBD-susceptibility locus in this region .

Here we report on a two-stage linkage and association analysis of both a basic population of 353 affected sibling pairs ( ASPs ) and an extension of this population to 428 white ASPs of northern European extraction .

Twenty-eight microsatellite markers on chromosome 6 were genotyped.

A peak multipoint LOD score of 4.2 was observed, at D6S461 , for the <START:PHENOTYPE> IBD phenotype <END> .

A transmission/disequilibrium test ( TDT ) result of P =.006 was detected for D6S426 in the basic population and was confirmed in the extended cohort ( P =.004 ; 97 vs.

56 transmissions ).

The <START:PHENOTYPE> subphenotypes of Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and mixed IBD <END> contributed equally to this linkage, suggesting a general role for the chromosome 6 locus in IBD .

Analysis of five single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the TNFA and LTA genes did not reveal evidence for association of these important candidate genes with IBD .

In summary, we provide firm linkage evidence for an IBD-susceptibility locus on chromosome 6p and demonstrate that TNFA and LTA are unlikely to be susceptibility loci for IBD .

A Second-Generation Genomewide Screen for Asthma-Susceptibility Alleles in a Founder Population 

A genomewide screen for asthma- and atopy-susceptibility loci was conducted, using 563 markers , in 693 Hutterites who are members of a single 15-generation pedigree , nearly doubling the sample size from the authors' earlier studies.

The resulting increase in power led to the identification of 23 loci in 18 chromosomal regions showing evidence for linkage that is, in general, 10-fold more significant ( P <.001 vs.

P <.01 ) than the linkages reported previously in this population .

Moreover, linkages to loci in 11 chromosomal regions were identified for the first time in the Hutterites in this report, including five regions ( 5p , 5q , 8p , 14q , and 16q ) showing evidence both of linkage, by the likelihood ratio ( LR ) ? 2 , and of disequilibrium, by the transmission/disequilibrium test.

A region on chromosome 19 continues to show evidence for linkage, by both tests, in this study.

Studies of 17 candidate genes provide evidence for association with variation in the IL4RA gene ( 16p12 ), the HLA class II genes ( 6p21 ), and the interferon-? gene cluster ( 9p22 ), but the lack of evidence for linkage in these regions by the LR ? 2 test suggests that these are minor susceptibility loci .

A polymorphism in the CD14 gene is in linkage disequilibrium with an as yet unidentified susceptibility allele in the 5q cytokine cluster , a region showing evidence for linkage among the Hutterites .

Finally, 10 of the regions showing evidence for linkage in the Hutterites have shown evidence of linkage to <START:PHENOTYPE> related phenotypes <END> in other genome screens, suggesting that these regions may contain common alleles that have relatively large effects on <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma and atopy phenotypes <END> in diverse populations .

Major Genes Regulating <START:PHENOTYPE> Total Serum Immunoglobulin E Levels <END> in Families with Asthma 

Immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) has a major role in the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis of allergic disorders and asthma <END> .

Previous data from 92 families , each identified through a proband with asthma , showed evidence for two major genes regulating <START:PHENOTYPE> total serum IgE levels <END> .

One of these genes mapped to 5q31-33 .

In the current study, the segregation analysis was extended by the addition of 108 probands and their families , ascertained in the same manner.

A mixed recessive model ( i.e., major recessive gene and residual genetic effect ) was the best-fitting and most-parsimonious one- locus model of the segregation analysis.

A mixed two- major-gene model ( i.e., two major genes and residual genetic effect ) fit the data significantly better than did the mixed recessive one- major-gene model.

The second gene modified the effect of the first recessive gene .

Individuals with the genotype aaBB ( homozygous high-risk allele at the first gene and homozygous low-risk allele at the second locus ) had <START:PHENOTYPE> normal IgE levels <END> ( mean 23 IU/ml ), and only individuals with genotypes aaBb and aabb had <START:PHENOTYPE> high IgE levels <END> ( mean 282 IU/ml ).

A genomewide screening was performed using variance-component analysis.

Significant evidence for linkage was found for a novel locus at 7q , with a multipoint LOD score of 3.36 ( P =.00004 ).

A LOD score of 3.65 ( P =.0000 2 ) was obtained after genotyping additional markers in this region .

Evidence for linkage was also found for two previously reported regions , 5q and 12q , with LOD scores of 2.73 ( P =.0002 ) and 2.46 ( P =.0004 ), respectively.

These results suggest that several major genes , plus residual genetic effects, regulate <START:PHENOTYPE> total serum IgE levels <END> .

Evidence for a susceptibility gene ( SLEH1 ) on chromosome 11q14 for systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) families with hemolytic anemia 

Hemolytic anemia is a forme fruste of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ), being observed months or even years before the onset of other clinical manifestations in some patients .

We hypothesized that hemolytic anemia in those SLE-affected patients would identify a group of SLE pedigrees that share a high degree of genetic homogeneity.

From 160 multiplex SLE pedigrees , we sought evidence for linkage in 35 ( 16 African-American , 17 European-American , and 2 Hispanic ) who had at least one SLE-affected patient with hemolytic anemia .

Significant linkage was present at 11q14 in the 16 African-American pedigrees , yielding a maximum two-point logarithm of odds ( LOD ) score of 4.5 at D11S2002 .

The segregation pattern of SLE in these African-American pedigrees suggested a dominant mode of <START:PHENOTYPE> inheritance <END> and, when maximized across penetrance and disease allele frequencies, produced a multipoint LOD of 4.7.

Multipoint analysis yielded a multipoint heterogeneity LOD score of 3.6 ( ? = 0.63 ), again with maximum LOD at D11S2002 .

Finally, markers typed 7 centimorgans to either side of D11S2002 achieved LOD scores of 3 or better by using the maximized model, supporting linkage to 11q14 .

Clearly, pedigree ascertainment based on select clinical manifestations is an important tool, capable of revealing otherwise cryptic genetic linkages in complex genetic diseases .

Thus, we show strong evidence for an SLE susceptibility gene , SLEH1 , near D11S2002 in African-American pedigrees multiplex for SLE that have at least one SLE-affected patient with hemolytic anemia .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Immunity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> behavior <END> : Antibodies alter <START:PHENOTYPE> emotion <END> 

Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease in which most patients express Abs that bind double-stranded DNA .

Recent work has shown that a subset of lupus Abs can crossreact with the NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor .

This receptor is expressed in neurons throughout the brain but is at highest density within cells of the hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus .

The neurons in the CNS are normally protected from brain-reactive Abs by the blood?brain barrier ( BBB ); however, a breach in the barrier 's integrity exposes neurons to potentially pathogenic Abs .

Previously, we have shown that mice that are immunized with a peptide mimetope of DNA produce lupus-like Abs that crossreact with DNA and the NMDA receptor .

Moreover, after abrogation of the BBB by treatment with lipopolysaccharide , the immunized mice display <START:PHENOTYPE> hippocampal neuron damage <END> with ensuing <START:PHENOTYPE> memory impairment <END> .

Given that rises in epinephrine can increase <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral blood flow <END> and can cause leaks in the BBB , we decided to investigate whether epinephrine could act as a permissive agent for <START:PHENOTYPE> Ab-mediated neurotoxicity <END> .

Here, we show that peptide-immunized mice , given epinephrine to open the BBB , lose neurons in the lateral amygdala and develop a <START:PHENOTYPE> behavioral disorder <END> characterized by a <START:PHENOTYPE> deficient response <END> to fear-conditioning paradigms.

Thus, the agent used to open the BBB determines which brain region is made vulnerable to neurotoxic Abs , and Abs that penetrate brain tissue can cause changes not only in <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive competence <END> , but also in <START:PHENOTYPE> emotional behavior <END> .

Prime role for an insulin epitope in the development of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice 

A fundamental question about the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes <END> is whether there are primary autoantigens .

For type 1 diabetes it is clear that multiple islet molecules are the target of <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmunity <END> in man and animal models 1 , 2 .

It is not clear whether any of the target molecules are essential for the <START:PHENOTYPE> destruction of islet beta cells <END> .

Here we show that the proinsulin/insulin molecules have a sequence that is a primary target of the <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmunity <END> that causes diabetes of the non-obese diabetic ( NOD ) mouse .

We created insulin 1 and insulin 2 gene knockouts combined with a mutated proinsulin transgene ( in which residue 16 on the B chain was changed to alanine ) in NOD mice .

This mutation abrogated the <START:PHENOTYPE> T-cell stimulation <END> of a series of the major insulin autoreactive NOD T-cell clones 3 .

Female mice with only the altered insulin did not develop insulin autoantibodies , <START:PHENOTYPE> insulitis <END> or autoimmune diabetes , in contrast with mice containing at least one copy of the native insulin gene .

We suggest that proinsulin is a primary autoantigen of the NOD mouse , and speculate that <START:PHENOTYPE> organ-restricted autoimmune disorders <END> with marked major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) restriction of disease are likely to have specific primary autoantigens .

A Testing Framework for Identifying Susceptibility Genes in the Presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> Epistasis <END> 

An efficient testing strategy called the ?focused interaction testing framework? ( FITF ) was developed to identify susceptibility genes involved in epistatic interactions for case - control studies of candidate genes .

In the FITF approach, likelihood-ratio tests are performed in stages that increase in the order of interaction considered.

Joint tests of main effects and interactions are performed conditional on significant lower-order effects.

A reduction in the number of tests performed is achieved by prescreening gene combinations with a goodness-of-fit ? 2 statistic that depends on association among candidate genes in the pooled case-control group .

Multiple testing is accounted for by controlling false-discovery rates.

Simulation analysis demonstrated that the FITF approach is more powerful than marginal tests of candidate genes .

FITF also outperformed multifactor dimensionality reduction when interactions involved additive, dominant, or recessive genes .

In an application to asthma case - control data from the Children ?s Health Study, FITF identified a significant multilocus effect between the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( phosphate ) reduced:quinone oxidoreductase gene ( NQO1 ), myeloperoxidase gene ( MPO ), and catalase gene ( CAT ) ( unadjusted P =.00026 ), three genes that are involved in the <START:PHENOTYPE> oxidative stress pathway <END> .

In an independent data set consisting primarily of African American and Asian American children , these three genes also showed a significant association with asthma status ( P =.0008 ).

IL-23 is essential for T cell ?mediated colitis and promotes <START:PHENOTYPE> inflammation <END> via IL-17 and IL-6 

<START:PHENOTYPE> Uncontrolled mucosal immunity <END> in the gastrointestinal tract of humans results in chronic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ), such as Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis .

In early clinical trials as well as in animal models , IL-12 has been implicated as a major mediator of these diseases based on the ability of anti-p40 mAb treatment to reverse <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal inflammation <END> .

The cytokine IL-23 shares the same p40 subunit with IL-12 , and the anti-p40 mAbs used in human and mouse IBD studies neutralized the activities of both IL-12 and IL-23 .

IL-10 ?deficient mice spontaneously develop enterocolitis .

To determine how IL-23 contributes to <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal inflammation <END> , we studied the <START:PHENOTYPE> disease susceptibility <END> in the absence of either IL-23 or IL-12 in this model , as well as the ability of recombinant IL-23 to exacerbate IBD induced by <START:PHENOTYPE> T cell transfer <END> .

Our study shows that in these models , IL-23 is essential for manifestation of <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic intestinal inflammation <END> , whereas IL-12 is not.

A critical target of IL-23 is a unique subset of tissue-homing memory T cells , which are specifically activated by IL-23 to produce the proinflammatory mediators IL-17 and IL-6 .

This pathway may be responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic intestinal inflammation <END> as well as other chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases .

Fine-Mapping Chromosome 20 in 230 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Sib Pair and Multiplex Families : Evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> Genetic Epistasis <END> with Chromosome 16q12 

The presence of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) susceptibility genes on chromosome 20 is suggested by the observation of genetic linkage in several independent SLE family collections .

To further localize the genetic effects, we typed 59 microsatellites in the two best regions , as defined by genome screens.

Genotypes were analyzed for statistical linkage and/or association with SLE , by use of a combination of nonparametric linkage methods, family -based tests of association ( transmission/disequilibrium and pedigree disequilibrium tests ), and haplotype -sharing statistics ( haplotype runs test ), in a set of 230 SLE pedigrees .

Maximal evidence for linkage to SLE was to 20p12 ( LOD =2.84 ) and 20q13.1 ( LOD =1.64 ) in the white pedigrees .

Subsetting families on the basis of evidence for linkage to 16q12 significantly improved the LOD scores at both chromosome 20 locations ( 20p12 LOD =5.06 and 20q13 LOD =3.65 ), consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> epistasis <END> .

We then typed 162 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers across a 1.3-Mb candidate region on 20q13.1 and identified several SNPs that demonstrated significant evidence for association.

These data provide additional support for linkage and association to 20p12 and 20q13.1 in SLE and further refine the intervals of interest.

These data further suggest the possibility of epistatic relationships among loci within the 20q12 , 20q13 , and 16q12 regions in SLE families .

The adipocyte fatty acid?binding protein aP2 is required in <START:PHENOTYPE> allergic airway inflammation <END> 

The adipocyte fatty acid?binding protein aP2 regulates <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic glucose and lipid metabolism <END> .

We report that aP2 , in addition to being abundantly expressed by adipocytes , is also expressed by human airway epithelial cells and shows a <START:PHENOTYPE> striking upregulation <END> following stimulation of epithelial cells with the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Regulation of aP2 mRNA expression <END> by Th2 cytokines was highly dependent on STAT6 , a transcription factor with a major regulatory role in <START:PHENOTYPE> allergic inflammation <END> .

We examined aP2-deficient mice in a model of <START:PHENOTYPE> allergic airway inflammation <END> and found that <START:PHENOTYPE> infiltration of leukocytes <END> , especially eosinophils , into the airways was highly dependent on aP2 function.

<START:PHENOTYPE> T cell priming <END> was unaffected by <START:PHENOTYPE> aP2 deficiency <END> , suggesting that aP2 was acting locally within the lung , and analysis of bone marrow chimeras implicated non-hematopoietic cells , most likely bronchial epithelial cells , as the site of action of aP2 in <START:PHENOTYPE> allergic airway inflammation <END> .

Thus, aP2 regulates <START:PHENOTYPE> allergic airway inflammation <END> and may provide a link between <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty acid metabolism <END> and asthma .

I <START:PHENOTYPE> nterferon-inducible gene expression <END> signature in peripheral blood cells of patients with severe lupus 

Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is a complex, inflammatory autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems .

We used global <START:PHENOTYPE> gene expression <END> profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to identify distinct patterns of <START:PHENOTYPE> gene expression <END> that distinguish most SLE patients from healthy controls .

Strikingly, about half of the patients studied showed <START:PHENOTYPE> dysregulated expression of genes in the IFN pathway <END> .

Furthermore, this <START:PHENOTYPE> IFN gene expression <END> ?signature? served as a marker for more severe disease involving the kidneys , hematopoetic cells , and/or the central nervous system .

These results provide insights into the <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic pathways <END> underlying SLE , and identify a subgroup of patients who may benefit from therapies targeting the <START:PHENOTYPE> IFN pathway <END> .

Inducible costimulator is essential for collagen-induced arthritis 

CD4 + helper Th cells play a major role in the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Th cell activation, differentiation <END> , and immune function are regulated by costimulatory molecules .

Inducible costimulator ( ICOS ) is a novel costimulatory receptor expressed on activated T cells .

We, as well as others, recently demonstrated its importance in <START:PHENOTYPE> Th2 cytokine expression <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> Ab class switching <END> by B cells .

In this study, we examined the role of ICOS in rheumatoid arthritis using a collagen-induced arthritis model .

We found that ICOS knockout mice on the DBA/1 background were completely <START:PHENOTYPE> resistant to collagen-induced arthritis <END> and exhibited <START:PHENOTYPE> absence of joint tissue inflammation <END> .

These mice , when immunized with collagen , exhibited <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced anti-collagen IgM Ab?s <END> in the initial stage and IgG2a Ab?s at the effector phase of collagen-induced arthritis .

Furthermore, ICOS regulates the in vitro and in vivo <START:PHENOTYPE> expression of IL-17 <END> , a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in rheumatoid arthritis .

These data indicate that ICOS is essential for collagen-induced arthritis and may suggest novel means for treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis .

Involvement of PTEN in airway hyperresponsiveness and <START:PHENOTYPE> inflammation in bronchial asthma <END> 

Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten ( PTEN ) is part of a complex signaling system that affects a variety of important cell functions.

PTEN blocks the action of PI3K by dephosphorylating the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate .

We have used a mouse model for asthma to determine the effect of PI3K inhibitors and PTEN on <START:PHENOTYPE> allergen-induced bronchial inflammation <END> and airway hyperresponsiveness .

PI3K activity increased significantly after allergen challenge.

<START:PHENOTYPE> PTEN protein expression <END> and PTEN activity were decreased in OVA -induced asthma .

Immunoreactive PTEN localized in epithelial layers around the bronchioles in control mice .

However, this immunoreactive PTEN dramatically disappeared in allergen-induced asthmatic lungs .

The <START:PHENOTYPE> increased IL-4, IL-5, and eosinophil cationic protein levels <END> in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids after OVA inhalation were significantly reduced by the intratracheal administration of PI3K inhibitors or adenoviruses carrying PTEN cDNA ( AdPTEN ).

Intratracheal administration of PI3K inhibitors or AdPTEN remarkably reduced <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchial inflammation <END> and airway hyperresponsiveness .

These findings indicate that PTEN may play a pivotal role in the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis of the asthma phenotype <END> .

A mutation in a CD44 variant of inflammatory cells enhances the mitogenic interaction of FGF with its receptor 

Synovial fluid cells from joints of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients express a novel variant of CD44 ( designated CD44vRA ), encoding an extra trinucleotide ( CAG ) transcribed from intronic sequences flanking a variant exon .

The CD44vRA mutant was detected in 23 out of 30 RA patients .

CD44-negative Namalwa cells transfected with CD44vRA cDNA or with CD44v3-v10 ( CD44vRA wild type ) cDNA bound FGF-2 to an equal extent via their associated heparan sulfate chains .

However, Namalwa cells , immobilizing FGF-2 via their cell surface CD44vRA , bound substantially more soluble FGF receptor-1 ( FGFR-1 ) than did Namalwa cells immobilizing the same amount of FGF-2 via their cell surface CD44v3-v10 .

The former cells stimulated the <START:PHENOTYPE> proliferation of BaF-32 cells <END> , bearing FGFR-1 , more efficiently than did the latter cells .

Finally, isolated primary synovial fluid cells from RA patients expressing CD44vRA bound more soluble FGFR-1 to their cell surface?associated FGF-2 than did corresponding synovial cells expressing CD44v3-v10 or synovial cells from osteoarthritis patients .

The binding of soluble FGFR-1 to RA synovial cells could be specifically reduced by their preincubation with Ab?s against the v3 exon product of CD44 .

Hence, FGF-2 attached to the heparan sulfate moiety expressed by the novel CD44 variant of RA synovium cells exhibits an augmented ability to stimulate FGFR-1 ?mediated activities.

A similar mechanism may foster the <START:PHENOTYPE> destructive inflammatory cascade <END> not only in RA , but also in other autoimmune diseases .

SLE like syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> functional deficiency <END> of C1q in members of a large family .

Two sisters and a brother from one family are described whose sera were deficient in haemolytic complement function.

This defect was restored by addition of purified C1q .

In their sera , C1q like material was found, whereas C1r and C1s were normal or increased in concentration, as were the other complement components tested.

All three had suffered from glomerulonephritis during childhood.

A renal biopsy in the brother recently disclosed a membranous glomerulopathy stage 1; otherwise, he is apparently healthy.

In both sisters , a systemic lupus erythematosus like disease became manifest at the age of 20 and 23, respectively, resulting in the <START:PHENOTYPE> death <END> of one of them.

In the serum of these three family members , the C1q like material was antigenically deficient compared with normal C1q and had, on sucrose gradient analysis, a molecular weight of approximately 65,000 daltons.

It did not bind to C1r and C1s .

Binding of the dysfunctional C1q to aggregated human gammaglobulin could be demonstrated.

On double immunodiffusion analysis, the abnormal C1q was identical with reduced and alkylated C1q .

The possible structure of the abnormal C1q molecule is discussed.

Congenital complete heart block in the newborn associated with maternal systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue disorders .

Four babies with complete heart block associated with maternal systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) are described, together with a 5th baby whose mother had <START:PHENOTYPE> serological abnormalities <END> only.

One baby had a <START:PHENOTYPE> rapidly fatal outcome <END> , one has required digoxin for heart failure , and the remaining 3 are asymptomatic but remain in complete heart block .

Additional manifestations were present in 2 of them.

The spectrum of <START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal abnormalities <END> that may occur in association with maternal SLE and related connective tissue disorders is discussed, together with the possible causes and the prognosis.

We conclude that congenital heart block is more common than had previously been appreciated.

A Chromosome 8 Gene-Cluster Polymorphism with Low Human Beta-Defensin 2 Gene Copy Number Predisposes to Crohn Disease of the Colon 

Defensins are endogenous antimicrobial peptides that protect the intestinal mucosa against <START:PHENOTYPE> bacterial invasion <END> .

It has been suggested that <START:PHENOTYPE> deficient defensin expression <END> may underlie the <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic inflammation <END> of Crohn disease ( CD ).

The DNA copy number of the beta-defensin gene cluster on chromosome 8p23.1 is highly polymorphic within the healthy population , which suggests that the <START:PHENOTYPE> defective beta-defensin induction <END> in colonic CD could be due to low beta-defensin?gene copy number.

Here, we tested this hypothesis, using genomewide DNA copy number profiling by array-based comparative genomic hybridization and quantitative polymerase -chain-reaction analysis of the human beta-defensin 2 ( HBD-2 ) gene .

We showed that healthy individuals , as well as patients with ulcerative colitis , have a median of 4 ( range 2?10 ) HBD-2 gene copies per genome.

In a surgical cohort with ileal or colonic CD and in a second large cohort with inflammatory bowel diseases , those with ileal resections/disease exhibited a normal median HBD-2 copy number of 4, whereas those with colonic CD had a median of only 3 copies per genome ( P =.008 for the surgical cohort ; P =.032 for the second cohort ).

Overall, the copy number distribution in colonic CD was shifted to lower numbers compared with controls ( P =.002 for both the surgical cohort and the cohort with inflammatory bowel diseases ).

Individuals with 3 copies have a significantly higher risk of developing colonic CD than did individuals with 4 copies ( odds ratio 3.06; 95% confidence interval 1.46?6.45 ).

An HBD-2 gene copy number of <4 was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> diminished mucosal HBD-2 mRNA expression <END> ( P =.033 ).

In conclusion, a lower HBD-2 gene copy number in the beta-defensin locus predisposes to colonic CD , most likely through <START:PHENOTYPE> diminished beta-defensin expression <END> .

Familial Chilblain Lupus , a Monogenic Form of Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus , Maps to Chromosome 3p 

Systemic lupus erythematosu s is a prototypic autoimmune disease .

Apart from <START:PHENOTYPE> rare monogenic deficiencies <END> of complement factors , where l upuslike disease may occur in association with other autoimmune diseases or <START:PHENOTYPE> high susceptibility to bacterial infections <END> , its etiology is multifactorial in nature.

<START:PHENOTYPE> Cutaneous findings <END> are a hallmark of the disease and manifest either alone or in association with internal-organ disease .

We describe a novel genodermatosis characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> painful bluish-red inflammatory papular <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> nodular lesions <END> in acral locations such as fingers , toes , nose , cheeks , and ears .

The <START:PHENOTYPE> lesions <END> sometimes appear plaquelike and tend to ulcerate.

Manifestation usually begins in early childhood and is precipitated by cold and wet exposure.

Apart from <START:PHENOTYPE> arthralgias <END> , there is no evidence for internal-organ disease or an <START:PHENOTYPE> increased susceptibility to infection <END> .

Histological findings include a <START:PHENOTYPE> deep inflammatory infiltrate <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> perivascular distribution and granular deposits of immunoglobulins and complement <END> along the basement membrane.

Some affected individuals show <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies or immune complex formation <END> , whereas cryoglobulins or cold agglutinins are absent.

Thus, the findings are consistent with chilblain lupus , a rare form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus .

Investigation of a large German kindred with 18 affected members suggests a <START:PHENOTYPE> highly penetrant trai <END> t with <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .

By single- nucleotide -polymorphism?based genomewide linkage analysis, the locus was mapped to chromosome 3p .

Haplotype analysis defined the locus to a 13.8-cM interval with a LOD score of 5.04.

This is the first description of a monogenic form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus .

Identification of the gene responsible for familial chilblain lupus may shed light on the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis <END> of common forms of connective-tissue disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus .

The thyrotropin receptor autoantigen in Graves disease is the culprit as well as the victim 

Graves disease , a common organ-specific autoimmune disease affecting humans , differs from all other autoimmune diseases in being associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> target organ hyperfunction <END> rather than <START:PHENOTYPE> organ damage <END> .

Clinical thyrotoxicosis is directly caused by autoantibodies that activate the thyrotropin receptor ( TSHR ).

The etiology of Graves disease is multifactorial, with nongenetic factors playing an important role.

Of the latter, there is the intriguing possibility that the molecular structure of the target antigen contributes to the development of thyroid-stimulatory autoantibodies ( TSAb?s ).

Among the glycoprotein hormone receptors , only the TSHR undergoes <START:PHENOTYPE> intramolecular cleavage <END> into disulfide-linked subunits with consequent <START:PHENOTYPE> shedding <END> of some of the extracellular, autoantibody-binding A subunits .

Functional autoantibodies do not arise to the noncleaving glycoprotein hormone receptors .

Recently, TSAb?s were found to preferentially recognize shed, rather than attached, A subunits .

Here we use a new adenovirus-mediated animal model of Graves disease to show that goiter and hyperthyroidism occur to a much greater extent when the adenovirus expresses the free A subunit as opposed to a genetically modified TSHR that cleaves minimally into subunits .

These data show that shed A subunits induce or amplify the <START:PHENOTYPE> immune response <END> leading to hyperthyroidism and provide new insight into the etiology of Graves disease .

Atopic disease and immunoglobulin E in twins reared apart and together.

Both genetic and environmental influences have been implicated in the etiology of atopic disease and in the determination of <START:PHENOTYPE> serum IgE levels <END> .

To quantify the relative contribution of these influences, we studied the prevalence of asthma and seasonal rhinitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> skin-test response <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> total serum IgE levels <END> , and specific IgE , as measured by RAST, in a sample of MZ and DZ twins reared apart or together.

Concordance rates for asthma , rhinitis , positive skin tests, and RAST were calculated.

MZ twins , whether reared apart or together, showed a greater concordance than dizygotic twins reared apart or together.

Maximum-likelihood tests of genetic and environmental components of the variation of <START:PHENOTYPE> total IgE levels <END> revealed a substantial genetic component and a negligible contribution from common familial environmental effects.

Relative predispositional effects ( RPEs ) of marker alleles with disease: HLA-DR alleles and Graves disease .

A method is described to reveal the relative predispositional effects ( RPEs ) ( predisposing, protective, or neutral ) of the HLA alleles or of any other marker system that is associated with a disease.

When the disease is associated with two or more alleles of a locus , the RPE method identifies the associations sequentially according to their strength; thus the problem that a strong association with one allele can create misleading deviations in the frequencies of other alleles is alleviated.

Using this method, we have examined the relative effects of HLA-DR alleles in <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility to Graves disease <END> in the Caucasian population .

The well-established positive association with DR3 was confirmed as the strongest effect.

In addition, a negative association was found between DR5 and Graves disease .

The <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced frequency of DR5 <END> among patients is statistically significant and is not a result of the <START:PHENOTYPE> increase in DR3 <END> .

Finally, when patients were divided according to the presence or absence of eye disease , the latter showed a significant <START:PHENOTYPE> increase in the frequency of DR4 <END> .

With family data, linkage to HLA of Graves disease was established in both Caucasian and Chinese families by the sib-pair method.

Cloning and <START:PHENOTYPE> expression <END> of a novel human antibody ? antigen pair associated with Felty's syndrome 

An increasing number of studies suggest the importance of antibodies in the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis <END> of most systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases , although there is considerable controversy over the precise role of the autoantibodies involved.

In humans , a major obstacle to progress is the identification and cloning of the relevant autoantibodies and autoantigens .

Here, an approach based on the sequential use of antibody phage display and <START:PHENOTYPE> antigen expression <END> libraries is developed and applied to a donor suffering from rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ), <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral destruction of neutrophils <END> leading to neutropenia ( Felty's syndrome ).

An antibody phage display library was constructed from bone marrow from the donor and a high-affinity human mAb , ANA15 , selected by panning against fresh neutrophils and independently by panning against a fixed cell line .

The antibody showed strong staining of neutrophils and a number of cell lines .

Probing of a ?gt11 <START:PHENOTYPE> expression <END> library from an induced myelomonocytic cell line with the mAb ANA15 identified the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A-1 ( eEF1A-1 ) as a novel autoantigen .

The specificity of ANA15 was confirmed by reactivity with both purified and recombinant eEF1A-1 .

Screening of a large panel of sera revealed that 66% of patients with Felty's syndrome had <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated levels of anti-eEF1A-1 antibodies <END> .

The cloning of this antibody ? antigen pair should permit rational evaluation of any pathogenicity resulting from the interaction and its significance in neutropenia .

HLA and disease: predictions for HLA haplotype sharing in families .

An analysis of published data on the segregation of HLA haplotypes in families with more than one individual affected with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or multiple sclerosis yields three conclusions: ( 1 ) In families with unaffected parents , affected sib pairs are much more often HLA haplotype identical in sibships with two affected sibs than in sibships with three or four affected sibs ( P less than .01 ).

( 2 ) In families with unaffected parents and HLA half-identical affected sibs , well siblings more often receive the single haplotype not found in the affected sibs than is expected by chance ( P less than .05 ).

( 3 ) In families with one affected parent , well siblings of affected individuals may share with the affected child a haplotype from the unaffected parent less than 50% of the time ( P less than .10 ).

These results are consistent with the premise that in some non-Mendelian, familial, HLA-associated disease more than one gene may contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility to the disorder <END> .

Human lupus autoantibodies against NMDA receptors mediate <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> 

Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus , which often entails <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive disturbances <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> memory loss <END> , has become a <START:PHENOTYPE> major complication <END> for lupus patients .

Previously, we developed a murine model of neuropsychiatric lupus based on Abs that cross-react with dsDNA and the NMDA receptor ( NMDAR ).

We showed that these murine Abs impair <START:PHENOTYPE> cognition <END> when they access the CNS through a breach in the blood?brain barrier ( BBB ) triggered by lipopolysaccharide .

Because studies show that lupus patients possess anti-NMDAR Abs in their serum and cerebrospinal fluid , we decided to investigate whether these human Abs contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive dysfunction <END> .

Here, we show that serum with reactivity to DNA and NMDAR extracted from lupus patients elicited <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> in mice receiving the serum intravenously and given lipopolysaccharide to compromise the BBB integrity.

Brain histopathology showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hippocampal neuron damage <END> , and behavioral testing revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> hippocampus-dependent memory impairment <END> .

To determine whether anti-NMDAR Abs exist in the brains of systemic lupus erythematosus patients , we eluted IgG from a patient's brain .

The IgG bound DNA and NMDAR and caused <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal apoptosis <END> when injected into mouse brains .

We examined four more brains of patients with neuropsychiatric lupus and found that they displayed endogenous IgG colocalizing with anti-NMDAR Abs .

Our results indicate that lupus patients have circulating anti-NMDAR Abs capable of causing <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal damage <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> memory deficit <END> , if they breach the BBB , and that the Abs exist within patients' brains .

Which aspects of neuropsychiatric lupus may be mediated by anti-NMDAR Abs , how often, and in which patients are now important clinical questions.

The affected-pedigree-member method of linkage analysis.

This paper describes a generalization of the affected-sib-pair method of linkage analysis to pedigrees .

By substituting identity-by-state relations for identity-by-descent relations, we develop a test statistic for detecting departures from independent segregation of disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> marker phenotypes <END> .

The statistic is based on the <START:PHENOTYPE> marker phenotypes <END> of affected pedigree members only.

Since it is more striking for distantly affected relatives to share a rare marker allele than a common marker allele , the statistic also includes a weighting factor based on allele frequency.

The distributional properties of the statistic are investigated theoretically and by simulation.

Part of the theoretical treatment entails generalizing Karigl's multiple- person kinship coefficients.

When the test statistic is applied to pedigree data on Huntington disease , the null hypothesis of independent segregation between the marker locus and the disease locus is firmly rejected.

In this case, as expected, there is a loss of power when compared with standard lod-score analysis.

However, our statistic possesses the advantage of requiring no explicit assumptions about the mode of <START:PHENOTYPE> inheritance of the disease <END> .

This point is illustrated by application of the test statistic to data on rheumatoid arthritis .

Familial Hashimoto's thyroiditis with <START:PHENOTYPE> kidney impairment <END> .

A 12 year old boy and his two sisters with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and <START:PHENOTYPE> renal impairment <END> were studied.

Three generations of this family had autoimmune thyroid disease : Graves' disease was diagnosed in the first generation , and the second and third generations had <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid enlargement <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal thyroid function <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> immunological abnormalities <END> .

The disease in this family could not be explained simply by the types of human leucocyte antigens found.

Renal disease in autoimmune thyroid disease is uncommon, treatment difficult, and the prognosis unknown.

The <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> disappeared in all three children during the three and a half years of follow up, which implies that the <START:PHENOTYPE> renal impairment <END> may be transitory in some patients .

Mutations in the gene for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in patients with different clinical phenotypes.

Recently, the gene for the most common peroxisomal disorder , X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( X-ALD ), has been described encoding a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein .

We analyzed the entire protein-coding sequence of this gene by reverse- <START:PHENOTYPE> transcription <END> PCR, SSCP, and DNA sequencing in five patients with different clinical expression of X-ALD and in their female relatives ; these clinical expressions were cerebral childhood ALD , adrenomyeloneuropathy ( AMN ), and <START:PHENOTYPE> " Addison disease only " ( ADO ) phenotype <END> .

In the three patients exhibiting the classical picture of severe childhood ALD we identified in the 5' portion of the X-ALD gene a 38-bp deletion that causes a frameshift mutation, a 3-bp deletion leading to a deletion of an amino acid in the ATP-binding domain of the ALD protein , and a missense mutation.

In the patient with the clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotype of AMN <END> , a nonsense mutation in codon 212 , along with a second site mutation at codon 178 , was observed.

Analysis of the patient with the <START:PHENOTYPE> ADO phenotype <END> revealed a further missense mutation at a highly conserved position in the ALDP / PMP70 comparison.

The disruptive nature of two mutations ( i.e., the frameshift and the nonsense mutation ) in patients with biochemically proved childhood ALD and AMN further strongly supports the hypothesis that alterations in this gene play a crucial role in the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis of X-ALD <END> .

Since the current biochemical techniques for X-ALD carrier detection in affected families lack sufficient reliability, our procedure described for systematic mutation scanning is also capable of improving genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.

Genetic epidemiology of rheumatoid arthritis .

We conducted family studies and segregation analyses of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) that were based on consecutive patients with RA ascertained without regard to family history or known risk factors.

First-degree relatives from 135 simplex and 30 multiplex families were included in the analyses.

A highly penetrant recessive major gene , with a mutant allele frequency of .005, was identified as the most parsimonious genetic risk factor .

Significant evidence for heterogeneity in risk for RA was observed for proband gender but not for proband age at onset.

Kaplan-Meier risk analysis demonstrated significant evidence for differences in the distribution of risk among first-degree relatives .

These analyses demonstrated that both proband gender and age at onset are important risk factors but that proband gender appears to be the more important determinant of risk, with relatives of male probands having the greatest cumulative risk for RA .

In addition, log-linear modeling identified proband gender, familiality ( multiplex or simplex ), and an interaction term between these two variables as being adequate to define the distribution of risk in families .

The pattern of risk for RA among susceptible individuals and its <START:PHENOTYPE> inheritance <END> is thus heterogeneous.

For future genetic analyses, families with an excess of affected males having a young age at onset may be the most informative in identifying the putative recessive gene and its modifiers .

Two- locus maximum lod score analysis of a <START:PHENOTYPE> multifactorial trait <END> : joint consideration of IDDM2 and IDDM4 with IDDM1 in type 1 diabetes .

To investigate the genetic component of multifactorial diseases such as type 1 ( insulin-dependent ) diabetes mellitus ( IDDM ), models involving the joint action of several disease loci are important.

These models can give increased power to detect an effect and a greater understanding of etiological mechanisms.

Here, we present an extension of the maximum lod score method of N.

Risch, which allows the simultaneous detection and modeling of two unlinked disease loci .

Genetic constraints on the identical-by-descent sharing probabilities, analogous to the " triangle " restrictions in the single-locus method, are derived, and the size and power of the test statistics are investigated.

The method is applied to affected-sib-pair data, and the joint effects of IDDM1 ( HLA ) and IDDM2 ( the INS VNTR ) and of IDDM1 and IDDM4 ( FGF3 -linked ) are assessed with relation to the development of IDDM .

In the presence of genetic heterogeneity, there is seen to be a significant advantage in analyzing more than one locus simultaneously.

Analysis of these families indicates that the effects at IDDM1 and IDDM2 are well described by a multiplicative genetic model, while those at IDDM1 and IDDM4 follow a heterogeneity model.

Evidence for two unlinked loci regulating <START:PHENOTYPE> total serum IgE levels <END> .

Studies investigating the genetic control of <START:PHENOTYPE> total serum IgE levels <END> are of major importance in understanding basic pathophysiologic mechanisms in atopy and asthma , since <START:PHENOTYPE> IgE levels <END> predict onset and correlate with the clinical expression of these disorders.

Previous analysis of data from 92 families , ascertained through a parent with asthma , showed evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> recessive inheritance <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> high IgE levels <END> with linkage to chromosome 5q .

Since there was significant residual familial correlation in the one- locus segregation analysis, two- locus segregation and linkage analyses were performed.

Segregation analyses provided evidence for a second major locus unlinked to the locus on 5q .

Utilization of this two- locus model corroborates the previous evidence for linkage between this trait and markers on 5q31-q33 .

The LODs for the most informative marker D5S436 increased from 3.00 at 10% <START:PHENOTYPE> recombination <END> to 4.67 at 9% <START:PHENOTYPE> recombination <END> , when the two- locus model was used.

Additional linkage studies are needed to map this second locus .

These results demonstrate the importance of performing multilocus segregation and linkage analyses for <START:PHENOTYPE> quantitative traits <END> that are related to the <START:PHENOTYPE> phenotype of a complex disorder <END> .

This approach has given further insight into the genetics of allergy and asthma by providing evidence for a two- locus model.

Association of a common complement receptor 2 haplotype with increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus 

A genomic region on distal mouse chromosome 1 and its syntenic human counterpart 1q23?42 show strong evidence of harboring lupus susceptibility genes .

We found evidence of linkage at 1q32.2 in a targeted genome scan of 1q21?43 in 126 lupus multiplex families containing 151 affected sibpairs ( nonparametric linkage score 2.52, P = 0.006 ).

A positional candidate gene at 1q32.2 , complement receptor 2 ( CR2 ), is also a candidate in the murine Sle1c lupus susceptibility locus .

To explore its role in human disease , we analyzed 1,416 individuals from 258 Caucasian and 142 Chinese lupus simplex families and demonstrated that a common three-single- nucleotide polymorphism CR2 haplotype ( rs3813946, rs1048971, rs17615 ) was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> lupus susceptibility <END> ( P = 0.00001 ) with a 1.54-fold increased risk for the development of disease.

Single- nucleotide polymorphism 1 ( rs3813946 ), located in the 5? untranslated region of the CR2 gene , altered transcriptional activity, suggesting a potential mechanism by which CR2 could contribute to the development of lupus .

Our findings reveal that CR2 is a likely susceptibility gene for human lupus at 1q32.2 , extending previous studies suggesting that CR2 participates in the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .

Heterozygous Mutations in TREX1 Cause Familial Chilblain Lupus and Dominant Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome 

TREX1 constitutes the major 3??5? DNA exonuclease activity measured in mammalian cells.

Recently, biallelic mutations in TREX1 have been shown to cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome at the AGS1 locus .

Interestingly, Aicardi-Goutières syndrome shows overlap with systemic lupus erythematosus at both clinical and pathological levels.

Here, we report a heterozygous TREX1 mutation causing familial chilblain lupus .

Additionally, we describe a de novo heterozygous mutation, affecting a critical catalytic residue in TREX1 , that results in typical Aicardi-Goutières syndrome .

Gene - Gene and Gene -Environment Interactions Involving HLA-DRB1 , PTPN22 , and Smoking in Two Subsets of Rheumatoid Arthritis 

Gene - gene and gene -environment interactions are key features in the development of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and other complex diseases .

The aim of this study was to use and compare three different definitions of interaction between the two major genetic risk factors of RA ?the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope ( SE ) alleles and the PTPN22 R620W allele ?in three large case - control studies: the Swedish Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis ( EIRA ) study, the North American RA Consortium ( NARAC ) study, and the Dutch Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic study ( in total, 1,977 cases and 2,405 controls ).

The EIRA study was also used to analyze interactions between smoking and the two genes .

?Interaction? was defined either as a departure from additivity, as interaction in a multiplicative model, or in terms of linkage disequilibrium?for example, deviation from independence of penetrance of two unlinked loci .

Consistent interaction, defined as departure from additivity, between HLA-DRB1 SE alleles and the A allele of PTPN22 R620W was seen in all three studies regarding anti-CCP?positive RA .

Testing for multiplicative interactions demonstrated an interaction between the two genes only when the three studies were pooled.

The linkage disequilibrium approach indicated a gene - gene interaction in EIRA and NARAC, as well as in the pooled analysis.

No interaction was seen between smoking and PTPN22 R620W .

A new pattern of interactions is described between the two major known genetic risk factors and the major environmental risk factor concerning the risk of developing anti-CCP?positive RA .

The data extend the basis for a pathogenetic hypothesis for RA involving genetic and environmental factors.

The study also raises and illustrates principal questions concerning ways to define interactions in complex diseases .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Systemic lupus erythematosus-associated defects <END> in the inhibitory receptor Fc?RIIb reduce <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility to malaria <END> 

Polygenic autoimmune diseases , such as systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ), are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

In recent years, functionally important genetic polymorphisms conferring <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility to SLE <END> have been identified, but the evolutionary pressures driving their retention in the gene pool remain elusive.

A defunctioning, SLE -associated polymorphism of the inhibitory receptor Fc?RIIb is found at an increased frequency in African and Asian populations , broadly corresponding to areas where malaria is endemic.

Here, we show that Fc?RIIb-deficient mice have increased <START:PHENOTYPE> clearance of malarial parasites <END> ( Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi ) and develop less severe disease.

In vitro , the human lupus associated Fc?RIIb polymorphism enhances <START:PHENOTYPE> phagocytosis of Plasmodium falciparum -infected erythrocytes <END> .

These results demonstrate that Fc?RIIb is important in controlling the <START:PHENOTYPE> immune response to malarial parasites <END> and suggests that the higher frequency of human Fc?RIIb polymorphisms predisposing to SLE in Asians and Africans may be maintained because these variants reduce <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility to malaria <END> .

Analysis of DAX1 ( NR0B1 ) and steroidogenic factor-1 ( SF1 / Ad4BP , NR5A1 ) in children and adults with primary adrenal failure : ten years' experience 

Context Primary adrenal failure is a life-threatening condition that can be caused by a range of etiologies, including <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune, metabolic, and developmental disorders <END> .

The nuclear receptors DAX1 ( NR0B1 ) and steroidogenic factor-1 ( SF1 / Ad4BP , NR5A1 ) play an important role in <START:PHENOTYPE> adrenal development <END> and function, and mutations in these transcription factors have been found in patients with adrenal hypoplasia .

Objective To investigate the prevalence of DAX1 and SF1 mutations in children and adults with primary adrenal failure of unknown etiology ( i.e., not caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia , adrenoleukodystrophy , autoimmune disease ).

Patients One-hundred and seventeen patients were included.

Eighty-eight individuals presented in infancy or childhood with adrenal hypoplasia or primary adrenal failure of unknown etiology ( n=64, 46,XY phenotypic males ; n=17, <START:PHENOTYPE> 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis/impaired androgenization <END> ; n=7, 46,XX females ).

Twenty-nine individuals presented in adulthood with ? Addison disease ? of unknown etiology.

Methods Mutational analysis of DAX1 ( NR0B1 ) ( including exon 2?/1A ) and SF1 ( NR5A1 ) by direct sequencing.

Results DAX1 mutations were found in 58% ( 37/64 ) of 46,XY phenotypic boys referred with adrenal hypoplasia , and in all boys ( 8/8 ) with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and a family history suggestive of adrenal failure in males .

SF1 mutations causing adrenal failure were found only in two patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis <END> .

No DAX1 or SF1 mutations were identified in the adult-onset group .

Conclusions DAX1 mutations are a relatively frequent cause of adrenal failure in this group of boys .

SF1 mutations causing adrenal failure in humans are rare and are more likely to be associated with significant underandrogenization and gonadal dysfunction in 46,XY individuals .

Non-Classic Congenital Lipoid Adrenal Hyperplasia : A New <START:PHENOTYPE> Disorder of the Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein <END> With Very Late Presentation and <START:PHENOTYPE> Normal Male Genitalia <END> 

Context Congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia ( lipoid CAH ) is a <START:PHENOTYPE> severe disorder of adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis <END> caused by mutations in the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein ( StAR ).

Affected children typically present with life-threatening adrenal insufficiency in early infancy due to a <START:PHENOTYPE> failure of glucocorticoid ( cortisol ) and mineralocorticoid ( aldosterone ) biosynthesis <END> , and 46,XY genetic males have <START:PHENOTYPE> complete lack of androgenization <END> and appear phenotypically <START:PHENOTYPE> female <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired testicular androgen secretion <END> in utero .

Objective The objective of this study was to investigate whether non-classic forms of this condition exist.

Patients & Methods Sequence analysis of the gene encoding StAR was undertaken in three children from two families who presented with primary adrenal insufficiency at 2-4 years of age; the males had <START:PHENOTYPE> normal genital development <END> .

Identified mutants were tested in a series of biochemical assays.

Results DNA sequencing identified homozygous StAR mutations Val187Met and Arg188Cys in these two families .

Functional studies of StAR activity in cells and in vitro, and cholesterol -binding assays showed these mutants retained ?20% of wild type activity.

Conclusions These patients define a new disorder, ? non-classic lipoid CAH ?, and represent a new cause of non-autoimmune Addison disease ( primary adrenal failure ).

Pristane -induced arthritis in rats : a new model for rheumatoid arthritis with a chronic disease course influenced by both major histocompatibility complex and non-major histocompatibility complex genes .

We present a novel animal model for rheumatoid arthritis induced with a well defined synthetic adjuvant oil , pristane .

Two weeks after a single intradermal injection of 150 microliters of pristane , the rats developed severe and chronic arthritis .

The <START:PHENOTYPE> inflammation <END> was restricted to the joints and involved <START:PHENOTYPE> pannus formation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II expression <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> T lymphocyte infiltration <END> .

The initial development as well as the chronic stage of pristane -induced arthritis was ameliorated by treatment with antibodies to the alpha beta-T-cell receptor showing that the disease is T cell dependent.

Increased levels of interleukin in serum was seen after pristane injection but not during the chronic stage of arthritis .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Joint erosions <END> were accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated serum levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein <END> .

Comparison of MHC congenic LEW strains showed that the <START:PHENOTYPE> severity <END> and chronicity of arthritis varied among the different MHC haplotypes .

Rats with RT1f haplotype showed a <START:PHENOTYPE> significantly higher susceptibility to pristane-induced arthritis <END> .

A strong influence of non-MHC genes was also suggested by the variability of <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis susceptibility <END> among different strains with the same MHC haplotype ; the most susceptible background was the DA and the least susceptible was the E3 .

Arthritis induced with a well defined nonimmunogenic adjuvant , with a disease course that closely resembles that of rheumatoid arthritis , makes a suitable animal model for future studies of the pathology and genetics of rheumatoid arthritis .

Gene Copy-Number Variation and Associated Polymorphisms of Complement Component C4 in Human Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ): Low Copy Number Is a Risk Factor for and High Copy Number Is a Protective Factor against <START:PHENOTYPE> SLE Susceptibility <END> in European Americans 

Interindividual gene copy-number variation ( CNV ) of complement component C4 and its associated polymorphisms in gene size ( long and short ) and protein isotypes ( C4A and C4B ) probably lead to different <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibilities to autoimmune disease <END> .

We investigated the C4 gene CNV in 1,241 European Americans , including patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ), their first-degree relatives , and unrelated healthy subjects , by definitive genotyping and phenotyping techniques.

The gene copy number ( GCN ) varied from 2 to 6 for total C4 , from 0 to 5 for C4A , and from 0 to 4 for C4B .

Four copies of total C4 , two copies of C4A , and two copies of C4B were the most common GCN counts, but each constituted only between one-half and three-quarters of the study populations .

Long C4 genes were strongly correlated with C4A ( R =0.695 ; P <.0001 ).

Short C4 genes were correlated with C4B ( R =0.437 ; P <.0001 ).

In comparison with healthy subjects , patients with SLE clearly had the GCN of total C4 and C4A shifting to the lower side.

The risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> SLE disease susceptibility <END> significantly increased among subjects with only two copies of total C4 ( patients 9.3%; unrelated controls 1.5%; odds ratio [OR] = 6.514; P =.00002 ) but decreased in those with 5 copies of C4 ( patients 5.79%; controls 12%; OR =0.466 ; P =.016 ).

Both zero copies ( OR =5.267 ; P =.001 ) and one copy ( OR =1.613 ; P =.022 ) of C4A were risk factors for SLE , whereas 3 copies of C4A appeared to be protective ( OR =0.574 ; P =.012 ).

Family -based association tests suggested that a specific haplotype with a single short C4B in tight linkage disequilibrium with the ?308A allele of TNFA was more likely to be transmitted to patients with SLE .

This work demonstrates how gene CNV and its related polymorphisms are associated with the <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility to a human complex disease <END> .

IRAK-M Is Involved in the <START:PHENOTYPE> Pathogenesis of Early-Onset Persistent Asthma <END> 

Asthma is a multifactorial disease influenced by genetic and environmental factors.

In the past decade, several loci and >100 genes have been found to be associated with the disease in at least one population .

Among these loci , region 12q13-24 has been implicated in asthma etiology in multiple populations , suggesting that it harbors one or more asthma susceptibility genes .

We performed linkage and association analyses by transmission/disequilibrium test and case - control analysis in the candidate region 12q13-24 , using the Sardinian founder population , in which limited heterogeneity of pathogenetic alleles for monogenic and complex disorders as well as of environmental conditions should facilitate the study of <START:PHENOTYPE> multifactorial traits <END> .

We analyzed our cohort , using a cutoff age of 13 years at asthma onset, and detected significant linkage to a portion of 12q13-24 .

We identified IRAK-M as the gene contributing to the linkage and showed that it is associated with early-onset persistent asthma .

We defined protective and predisposing SNP haplotypes and replicated associations in an outbred Italian population .

Sequence analysis in patients found mutations, including <START:PHENOTYPE> inactivating lesions <END> , in the IRAK-M coding region .

Immunohistochemistry of lung biopsies showed that IRAK-M is highly expressed in epithelial cells .

We report that IRAK-M is involved in the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis of early-onset persistent asthma <END> .

IRAK-M , a negative regulator of the <START:PHENOTYPE> Toll-like receptor/IL-1R pathways <END> , is a master regulator of NF-?B and <START:PHENOTYPE> inflammation <END> .

Our data suggest a mechanistic link between <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivation <END> of the innate immune system and <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic airway inflammation <END> and indicate IRAK-M as a potential target for therapeutic intervention against asthma .

CEACAM6 acts as a receptor for adherent-invasive E. coli , supporting <START:PHENOTYPE> ileal mucosa colonization <END> in Crohn disease 

The ileal mucosa of Crohn disease ( CD ) patients is abnormally colonized by adherent-invasive E. coli ( AIEC ) that are able to adhere to and invade intestinal epithelial cells .

Here, we show that CD-associated AIEC strains adhere to the brush border of primary ileal enterocytes isolated from CD patients but not controls without inflammatory bowel disease .

<START:PHENOTYPE> AIEC adhesion <END> is dependent on <START:PHENOTYPE> type 1 pili expression <END> on the bacterial surface and on <START:PHENOTYPE> carcinoembryonic antigen?related cell adhesion molecule 6 ( CEACAM6 ) expression <END> on the apical surface of ileal epithelial cells .

We report also that CEACAM6 acts as a receptor for <START:PHENOTYPE> AIEC adhesion <END> and is abnormally expressed by ileal epithelial cells in CD patients .

In addition, our in vitro studies show that there is <START:PHENOTYPE> increased CEACAM6 expression <END> in cultured intestinal epithelial cells after IFN-? or TNF-? stimulation and after infection with AIEC bacteria , indicating that AIEC can promote its own <START:PHENOTYPE> colonization <END> in CD patients .

Genetic linkage of familial granulomatous inflammatory arthritis , <START:PHENOTYPE> skin rash <END> , and uveitis to chromosome 16 .

Blau syndrome ( MIM 186580 ), first described in a large, three-generation kindred , is an autosomal, dominantly inherited disease characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> multiorgan, tissue-specific inflammation <END> .

Its clinical phenotype includes granulomatous arthritis , <START:PHENOTYPE> skin rash <END> , and uveitis and probably represents a subtype of a group of clinical entities referred to as " familial granulomatosis .

" It is the sole human model with recognizably <START:PHENOTYPE> Mendelian inheritance <END> for a variety of multisystem inflammatory diseases affecting a significant percentage of the population .

A genomewide search for the Blau susceptibility locus was undertaken after karyotypic analysis revealed no <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormalities <END> .

Sixty-two of the 74-member pedigree were genotyped with dinucleotide-repeat markers .

Linkage analysis was performed under a dominant model of <START:PHENOTYPE> inheritance with reduced penetrance <END> .

The marker D16S298 gave a maximum LOD score of 3.75 at theta = .04, with two-point analysis.

LOD scores for flanking markers were consistent and placed the Blau susceptibility locus within the 16p12-q21 interval .

HLA -linked rheumatoid arthritis .

Twenty-eight pedigrees were ascertained through pairs of first-degree relatives diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ).

RA was confirmed in 77 pedigree members including probands ; the absence of disease was verified in an additional 261 pedigree members .

Pedigree members were serologically typed for HLA .

We used likelihood analysis to statistically characterize the HLA-linked RA susceptibility locus .

The genetic model assumed tight linkage to HLA .

The analysis supported the existence of an HLA-linked RA susceptibility locus , estimated the susceptibility allele frequency as 2.16%, and estimated the lifetime penetrance as 41% in male homozygotes and as 48% in female homozygotes .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Inheritance <END> was recessive in males and was nearly recessive in females .

In addition, the analysis attributed 78% of the variance within genotypes to genetic or environmental effects shared by siblings .

The genetic model inferred in this analysis is consistent with previous association, linkage, and familial aggregation studies of RA .

The inferred HLA-linked RA susceptibility locus accounts for approximately one-half of familial RA , although it accounts for only approximately one-fifth of the RA in the population .

Although other genes may account for the remaining familial RA , a large portion of RA cases may occur sporadically.

Variants in a Novel Epidermal Collagen Gene ( COL29A1 ) Are Associated with Atopic Dermatitis 

Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder and a major manifestation of allergic disease .

AD typically presents in early childhood often preceding the onset of an allergic airway disease , such as asthma or hay fever .

We previously mapped a susceptibility locus for AD on Chromosome 3q21 .

To identify the underlying disease gene , we used a dense map of microsatellite markers and single nucleotide polymorphisms, and we detected association with AD .

In concordance with the linkage results, we found a <START:PHENOTYPE> maternal transmission <END> pattern.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that the same families contribute to linkage and association.

We replicated the association and the maternal effect in a large independent family cohort .

A common haplotype showed strong association with AD ( p = 0.000059 ).

The associated region contained a single gene , COL29A1 , which encodes a novel epidermal collagen .

COL29A1 shows a specific <START:PHENOTYPE> gene expression <END> pattern with the highest transcript levels in skin , lung , and the gastrointestinal tract , which are the major sites of allergic disease manifestation.

<START:PHENOTYPE> Lack of COL29A1 expression <END> in the outer epidermis of AD patients points to a role of collagen XXIX in epidermal integrity and function, the breakdown of which is a clinical hallmark of AD .

Escape from <START:PHENOTYPE> tolerance <END> in the human X-linked autoimmunity?allergic disregulation syndrome and the Scurfy mouse 

XLAAD is an X-linked disease that presents early in life with a syndrome of <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmunity <END> , allergy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> failure to thrive <END> .

It was first described as an X-linked immunodeficiency syndrome associated with polyendocrinopathy ( type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroiditis ), hemolytic anemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic diarrhea <END> ( autoimmune ), and <START:PHENOTYPE> eczema <END> ( 3 , 4 ).

While the <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune manifestations <END> are prominent, children with XLAAD also suffer from <START:PHENOTYPE> allergic manifestations <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> severe eczema <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> elevated IgE levels <END> , eosinophilia , and food allergy ( 3 ).

As Chatila et al.

( 1 ) show, activated PBMCs from affected individuals are skewed toward the <START:PHENOTYPE> Th2 phenotype <END> , expressing <START:PHENOTYPE> high levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 <END> , but <START:PHENOTYPE> low levels of IFN-? <END> .

Indeed, even the resting cells from affected individuals are activated compared to those from normal individuals , as measured by their <START:PHENOTYPE> expression of Th2 cytokines <END> .

Genetic pleiotropy between asthma and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in a community-based sample of twins 

Background Asthma and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> are common conditions that are strongly associated.

This association might be due to shared genetic or environmental causes.

Objective We sought to determine whether a shared genetic cause is responsible for the association between asthma and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and to estimate the magnitude of shared genetic cause .

Methods The analyses were performed with 1001 monozygotic and 383 dizygotic same-sex twin pairs within the University of Washington Twin Registry.

The presence of asthma was determined by self-report of a physician diagnosis of asthma , and body mass index ( BMI ) was calculated by using self-reported <START:PHENOTYPE> height <END> and weight .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Obesity <END> was defined as a BMI of 30 or greater.

The association between asthma and BMI was assessed by means of mixed-effects ordinal regression.

Twin correlations examined the association of asthma and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> .

Univariate and bivariate structural equation models estimated the components of variance attributable to genetic and environmental effects.

Results A strong association between asthma and BMI was identified in the sample population ( P < .001 ).

Substantial heritability was detected for asthma ( 53% ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ( 77% ), which is indicative of additive genetic influences on each disorder.

The best-fitting model of shared components of variance indicated that 8% of the genetic component of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> is shared with asthma .

Conclusion The covariation between <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and asthma is predominantly caused by shared genetic risk factors for both conditions.

The cation efflux transporter ZnT8 ( Slc30A8 ) is a major autoantigen in human type 1 diabetes 

Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) results from <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive loss of pancreatic islet mass <END> through <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmunity <END> targeted at a diverse, yet limited, series of molecules that are expressed in the pancreatic ? cell .

Identification of these molecular targets provides insight into the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenic process <END> , diagnostic assays, and potential therapeutic agents.

Autoantigen candidates were identified from microarray <START:PHENOTYPE> expression <END> profiling of human and rodent pancreas and islet cells and screened with radioimmunoprecipitation assays using new-onset T1D and prediabetic sera .

A high-ranking candidate , the zinc transporter ZnT8 ( Slc30A8 ), was targeted by autoantibodies in 60?80% of new-onset T1D compared with <2% of controls and <3% type 2 diabetic and in up to 30% of patients with other autoimmune disorders with a T1D association.

ZnT8 antibodies ( ZnTA ) were found in 26% of T1D subjects classified as autoantibody -negative on the basis of existing markers [ glutamate decarboxylase ( GADA ), protein tyrosine phosphatase IA2 ( IA2A ), antibodies to insulin ( IAA ), and islet cytoplasmic autoantibodies ( ICA )].

Individuals followed from birth to T1D showed ZnT8A as early as 2 years of age and <START:PHENOTYPE> increasing levels <END> and prevalence persisting to disease onset.

ZnT8A generally emerged later than GADA and IAA in prediabetes , although not in a strict order.

The combined measurement of ZnT8A , GADA , IA2A , and IAA raised <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmunity <END> detection rates to 98% at disease onset, a level that approaches that needed to detect prediabetes in a general pediatric population .

The combination of bioinformatics and molecular engineering used here will potentially generate other diabetes autoimmunity markers and is also broadly applicable to other autoimmune disorders .

Protection from Experimental Asthma by an Endogenous Bronchodilator 

Mechanisms that protect against asthma remain poorly understood.

S -nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO ), an endogenous bronchodilator , is depleted from asthmatic airways , suggesting a protective role.

We report that, following allergen challenge, wild-type mice exhibiting airway hyperresponsivity have increased <START:PHENOTYPE> airway levels of the enzyme GSNO reductase <END> ( GSNOR ) and are depleted of <START:PHENOTYPE> lung S -nitrosothiols <END> ( SNOs ).

In contrast, mice with genetic deletion of GSNOR exhibit increases in <START:PHENOTYPE> lung SNOs <END> and are protected from airway hyperresponsivity .

Our results indicate that endogenous SNOs , governed by GSNOR , are critical regulators of <START:PHENOTYPE> airway responsivity <END> and may provide new therapeutic approaches to asthma .

Clustering of non-major histocompatibility complex susceptibility candidate loci in human autoimmune diseases 

Human autoimmune diseases are thought to develop through a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Genome-wide linkage searches of autoimmune and inflammatory/immune disorders have identified a large number of non-major histocompatibility complex loci that collectively contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> disease susceptibility <END> .

A comparison was made of the linkage results from 23 published autoimmune or immune-mediated disease genome-wide scans.

Human diseases included multiple sclerosis , Crohn?s disease , familial psoriasis , asthma , and type-I diabetes ( IDDM ).

Experimental animal disease studies included murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , rat inflammatory arthritis , rat and murine IDDM , histamine sensitization, <START:PHENOTYPE> immunity to exogenous antigens <END> , and murine lupus ( systemic lupus erythematosus ; SLE ).

A majority ( ?65% ) of the human positive linkages map nonrandomly into 18 distinct clusters.

Overlapping of susceptibility loci occurs between different human immune diseases and by comparing conserved regions with experimental autoimmune/immune disease models .

This nonrandom clustering supports a hypothesis that, in some cases, clinically distinct autoimmune diseases may be controlled by a common set of susceptibility genes .

The HLA-DQ2 gene dose effect in celiac disease is directly related to the magnitude and breadth of <START:PHENOTYPE> gluten-specific T cell responses <END> 

In patients with celiac disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> inflammatory T cell responses <END> to HLA-DQ2-bound gluten peptides are thought to cause disease.

Two types of HLA-DQ2 molecules exist, termed HLA-DQ2.5 and HLA-DQ2.2 .

Whereas HLA-DQ2.5 predisposes to celiac disease , HLA-DQ2.2 does not.

We now provide evidence that the disease-associated HLA-DQ2.5 molecule presents a large repertoire of gluten peptides , whereas the non-disease-associated HLA-DQ2.2 molecule can present only a subset of these.

Moreover, <START:PHENOTYPE> gluten presentation <END> by HLA-DQ2 homozygous antigen-presenting cells was superior to presentation by HLA-DQ2/non-DQ2 heterozygous antigen-presenting cells in terms of <START:PHENOTYPE> T cell proliferation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cytokine secretion <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Gluten presentation <END> by HLA-DQ2.5/2.2 heterozygous antigen-presenting cells induced <START:PHENOTYPE> intermediate T cell stimulation <END> .

These results correlated with peptide binding to the antigen-presenting cells .

Finally, we demonstrate that HLA-DQ trans dimers formed in HLA-DQ2.5/2.2 heterozygous individuals have properties identical with HLA-DQ2.5 dimers .

Our findings explain the strongly increased risk of disease development for HLA-DQ2.5 homozygous and HLA-DQ2.2/2.5 heterozygous individuals , and they are indicative of a quantitative model for disease development, where <START:PHENOTYPE> HLA-DQ expression <END> and the available number of T cell-stimulatory gluten peptides are critical limiting factors.

This model may have important implications for disease prevention.

Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I?Recognizing Receptors Are Disease Risk Genes in Rheumatoid Arthritis 

Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a heterogeneous syndrome of which a subset of patients develops <START:PHENOTYPE> vascular inflammation <END> .

The genetic determinants that confer risk for rheumatoid vasculitis are not known, but patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> vascular complications <END> are known to have an <START:PHENOTYPE> expansion of CD4 + CD28 null T cells <END> , a cell population potentially involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> endothelial damage <END> .

CD4 + CD28 null T cell clones isolated from RA patients with vasculitis were found to express killer cell immunoglobulin?like receptors ( KIRs ) with the stimulatory KIR2DS2 often present in the absence of opposing inhibitory receptors with related specificities.

To test the hypothesis that the KIR2DS2 gene is involved in the development of vasculitis , association studies were performed.

The KIR2DS2 gene was significantly enriched among patients with rheumatoid vasculitis compared with normal individuals ( odds ratio 5.56, P = 0.001 ) and patients with RA but no vasculitis ( odds ratio 7.96, P = 0.001 ).

Also, the distribution of human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen ( HLA )-C , the putative ligand for KIRs , was significantly different in patients with rheumatoid vasculitis in comparison with the control populations .

These data suggest that HLA class I?recognizing receptors and HLA class I genes are genetic risk determinants that modulate the pattern of <START:PHENOTYPE> RA expression <END> .

Specifically, KIR2DS2 in conjunction with the appropriate HLA-C ligand may have a role in <START:PHENOTYPE> vascular damage <END> by regulating CD4 + CD28 null T cells .

Epidermal Transglutaminase ( TGase 3 ) Is the Autoantigen of Dermatitis Herpetiformis 

<START:PHENOTYPE> Gluten sensitivity <END> typically presents as celiac disease , a common chronic small intestinal disorder .

However, in certain individuals it is associated with dermatitis herpetiformis , a blistering skin disease characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> granular IgA deposits <END> in the papillary dermis .

While tissue transglutaminase has been implicated as the major autoantigen of gluten sensitive disease , there has been no explanation as to why this condition appears in two distinct forms.

Here we show that while sera from patients with either form of gluten sensitive disease react both with tissue transglutaminase and the related enzyme epidermal ( type 3 ) transglutaminase , antibodies in patients having dermatitis herpetiformis show a markedly higher avidity for epidermal transglutaminase .

Further, these patients have an antibody population specific for this enzyme .

We also show that the IgA precipitates in the papillary dermis of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis , the defining signs of the disease, contain epidermal transglutaminase , but not tissue transglutaminase or keratinocyte transglutaminase .

These findings demonstrate that epidermal transglutaminase , rather than tissue transglutaminase , is the dominant autoantigen in dermatitis herpetiformis and explain why <START:PHENOTYPE> skin symptoms <END> appear in a proportion of patients having gluten sensitive disease .

The <START:PHENOTYPE> Intestinal T Cell Response <END> to ?-Gliadin in Adult Celiac Disease Is Focused on a Single Deamidated Glutamine Targeted by Tissue Transglutaminase 

The great majority of patients that are <START:PHENOTYPE> intolerant of wheat gluten protein <END> due to celiac disease ( CD ) are <START:PHENOTYPE> human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen ( HLA )-DQ2 + <END> , and the remaining few normally express HLA-DQ8 .

These two class II molecules are chiefly responsible for the presentation of gluten peptides to the gluten -specific T cells that are found only in the gut of CD patients but not of controls .

Interestingly, <START:PHENOTYPE> tissue transglutaminase ( tTG )-mediated deamidation <END> of gliadin plays an important role in <START:PHENOTYPE> recognition of this food antigen <END> by intestinal T cells .

Here we have used recombinant antigens to demonstrate that the <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal T cell response to ?-gliadin <END> in adult CD is focused on two immunodominant, DQ2-restricted peptides that overlap by a seven-residue fragment of gliadin .

We show that tTG converts a glutamine residue within this fragment into glutamic acid and that this process is critical for <START:PHENOTYPE> T cell recognition <END> .

Gluten -specific T cell lines from 16 different adult patients all responded to one or both of these deamidated peptides , indicating that these epitopes are highly relevant to <START:PHENOTYPE> disease pathology <END> .

Binding studies showed that the deamidated peptides displayed an increased affinity for DQ2 , a molecule known to preferentially bind peptides containing negatively charged residues .

Interestingly, the modified glutamine is accommodated in different pockets of DQ2 for the different epitopes .

These results suggest <START:PHENOTYPE> modifications of anchor residues <END> that lead to an improved affinity for major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ), and altered conformation of the peptide?MHC complex may be a critical factor leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> T cell responses to gliadin <END> and the <START:PHENOTYPE> oral intolerance of gluten <END> found in CD .

Common Variants within MECP2 Confer Risk of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 

Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is a predominantly female autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems .

Herein, we report on an X-chromosome gene association with SLE .

Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 ( MECP2 ) is located on chromosome Xq28 and encodes for a protein that plays a critical role in <START:PHENOTYPE> epigenetic transcriptional regulation <END> of methylation-sensitive genes .

Utilizing a candidate gene association approach, we genotyped 21 SNPs within and around MECP2 in SLE patients and controls .

We identify and replicate association between SLE and the genomic element containing MECP2 in two independent SLE cohorts from two ethnically divergent populations .

These findings are potentially related to the <START:PHENOTYPE> overexpression of methylation-sensitive genes <END> in SLE .

Loss of Bardet?Biedl syndrome proteins alters the morphology and function of motile cilia in airway epithelia 

Mutations in a group of genes that contribute to ciliary function cause Bardet?Biedl syndrome ( BBS ).

Most studies of BBS have focused on primary, sensory cilia.

Here, we asked whether loss of BBS proteins would also affect motile cilia lining the respiratory tract .

We found that BBS genes were expressed in human airway epithelia , and BBS2 and BBS4 localized to cellular structures associated with motile cilia.

Although BBS proteins were not required for <START:PHENOTYPE> ciliogenesis <END> , their loss caused <START:PHENOTYPE> structural defects <END> in a fraction of cilia covering mouse airway epithelia .

The most common abnormality was <START:PHENOTYPE> bulges filled with vesicles <END> near the tips of cilia.

We discovered this same misshapen appearance in airway cilia from Bbs1 , Bbs2 , Bbs4 , and Bbs6 mutant mice .

The <START:PHENOTYPE> structural abnormalities <END> were accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> functional defects <END> ; ciliary beat frequency was reduced in Bbs mutant mice .

Previous reports suggested BBS might increase the incidence of asthma .

However, compared with wild-type controls , neither <START:PHENOTYPE> airway hyperresponsiveness nor inflammation <END> increased in Bbs 2 ?/? or Bbs 4 ?/? mice immunized with ovalbumin .

Instead, these animals were partially protected from <START:PHENOTYPE> airway hyperresponsiveness <END> .

These results emphasize the role of BBS proteins in both the structure and function of motile cilia.

They also invite additional scrutiny of <START:PHENOTYPE> motile cilia dysfunction <END> in patients with this disease.

A Genome-Wide Association Study of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Identifies New Disease Loci 

A genome-wide association study was performed to identify genetic factors involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility to psoriasis ( PS ) and psoriatic arthritis ( PSA ), inflammatory diseases of the skin and joints <END> in humans .

223 PS cases ( including 91 with PSA ) were genotyped with 311,398 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ), and results were compared with those from 519 Northern European controls .

Replications were performed with an independent cohort of 577 PS cases and 737 controls from the U.S., and 576 PSA patients and 480 controls from the U.K..

Strongest associations were with the class I region of the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ).

The most highly associated SNP was rs10484554, which lies 34.7 kb upstream from HLA-C ( P = 7.8×10 ?11 , GWA scan; P = 1.8×10 ?30 , replication; P = 1.8×10 ?39 , combined; U.K.

PSA: P = 6.9×10 ?11 ).

However, rs2395029 encoding the G2V polymorphism within the class I gene HCP5 ( combined P = 2.13×10 ?26 in U.S. cases ) yielded the highest ORs with both PS and PSA ( 4.1 and 3.2 respectively ).

This variant is associated with low viral set point following HIV infection and its effect is independent of rs10484554.

We replicated the previously reported association with interleukin 23 receptor and interleukin 12B ( IL12B ) polymorphisms in PS and PSA cohorts ( IL23R : rs11209026, U.S.

PS , P = 1.4×10 ?4 ; U.K.

PSA : P = 8.0×10 ?4 ; IL12B :rs6887695, U.S.

PS , P = 5×10 ?5 and U.K.

PSA , P = 1.3×10 ?3 ) and detected an independent association in the IL23R region with a SNP 4 kb upstream from IL12RB2 ( P = 0.001 ).

Novel associations replicated in the U.S.

PS cohort included the region harboring lipoma HMGIC fusion partner ( LHFP ) and conserved oligomeric golgi complex component 6 ( COG6 ) genes on chromosome 13q13 ( combined P = 2×10 ?6 for rs7993214; OR = 0.71 ), the late cornified envelope gene cluster ( LCE ) from the Epidermal Differentiation Complex ( PSORS4 ) ( combined P = 6.2×10 ?5 for rs6701216; OR 1.45 ) and a region of LD at 15q21 ( combined P = 2.9×10 ?5 for rs3803369; OR = 1.43 ).

This region is of interest because it harbors ubiquitin-specific protease-8 whose processed pseudogene lies upstream from HLA-C .

This region of 15q21 also harbors the gene for SPPL2A ( signal peptide peptidase like 2a ) which activates tumor necrosis factor alpha by cleavage, triggering the <START:PHENOTYPE> expression of IL12 <END> in human dendritic cells .

We also identified a novel PSA ( and potentially PS ) locus on chromosome 4q27 .

This region harbors the interleukin 2 ( IL2 ) and interleukin 21 ( IL21 ) genes and was recently shown to be associated with four autoimmune diseases ( Celiac disease , Type 1 diabetes , Grave's disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis ).

A genome-wide association study for celiac disease identifies risk variants in the region harboring IL2 and IL21 

We tested 310,605 single-nucleotide polymorphisms for association in 778 celiac disease cases and 1422 controls .

Outside the HLA , the most significant finding ( rs13119723, P=2.0 × 10 ?7 , empirical genome-wide significance P=0.045 ) was in the KIAA1109 / Tenr / IL2 / IL21 linkage disequilibrium block.

Association was independently confirmed in two further collections ( strongest at rs6822844, 24kB 5' of IL21 , meta-analysis P=1.3 × 10 ?14 , OR 0.63 ), suggesting genetic variation in this region predisposes to celiac disease .

Novel Association in Chromosome 4q27 Region with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Confirmation of Type 1 Diabetes Point to a General Risk Locus for Autoimmune Diseases 

Recently, association of celiac disease with common single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) variants in an extensive linkage-disequilibrium block of 480 kb containing the KIAA1109 , Tenr , IL2 , and IL21 genes has been demonstrated in three independent populations ( rs6822844 P combined =1.3×10 -14 ).

The KIAA1109/Tenr/IL2/IL21 block corresponds to the Idd3 locus in the nonobese diabetic mouse model of type 1 diabetes ( T1D ).

This block was recently found to be associated with T1D in a genomewide association study, although this finding lacks unequivocal confirmation.

We therefore aimed to investigate whether the KIAA1109/Tenr/IL2/IL21 region is involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility to multiple autoimmune diseases <END> .

We tested SNP rs6822844 for association with disease in 350 T1D-affected and 1,047 rheumatoid arthritis ( RA )?affected Dutch patients and in 929 controls .

We replicated the association with T1D ( P =.0006 ; OR 0.64 [95% CI 0.50?0.83] ), and revealed a similar novel association with RA ( P =.0002 ; OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.61?0.86] ).

Our results replicate and extend the association found in the KIAA1109/Tenr/IL2/IL21 gene region with autoimmune diseases , implying that this locus is a general risk factor for multiple autoimmune diseases .

Interleukin 9 : A candidate gene for asthma 

Asthma is a complex heritable inflammatory disorder of the airways associated with clinical signs of atopy and bronchial hyperresponsiveness .

Recent studies localized a major gene for asthma to chromosome 5q31-q33 in humans .

Thus, this segment of the genome represents a candidate region for genes that determine <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility to bronchial hyperresponsiveness and atopy <END> in animal models .

Homologs of candidate genes on human chromosome 5q31-q33 are found in four regions in the mouse genome, two on chromosome 18 , and one each on chromosomes 11 and 13 .

We assessed bronchial responsiveness as a <START:PHENOTYPE> quantitative trait <END> in mice and found it linked to chromosome 13 .

Interleukin 9 ( IL-9 ) is located in the linked region and was analyzed as a gene candidate .

The <START:PHENOTYPE> expression of IL-9 <END> was markedly reduced in bronchial hyporesponsive mice , and the level of <START:PHENOTYPE> expression <END> was determined by sequences within the qualitative trait locus ( QTL ).

These data suggest a role for IL-9 in the <START:PHENOTYPE> complex pathogenesis <END> of bronchial hyperresponsivenes s as a risk factor for asthma .

Genome scan of human systemic lupus erythematosus : Evidence for linkage on chromosome 1q in African-American pedigrees 

Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> production of autoantibodies against intracellular antigens <END> including DNA , ribosomal P , Ro ( SS-A ), La ( SS-B ), and the spliceosome .

Etiology is suspected to involve genetic and environmental factors.

Evidence of genetic involvement includes: associations with HLA-DR3 , HLA-DR2 , Fc? receptors ( Fc?R ) IIA and IIIA , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hereditary complement component deficiencies <END> , as well as familial aggregation, monozygotic twin concordance >20%, ? s > 10, purported linkage at 1q41?42 , and inbred mouse strains that consistently develop lupus .

We have completed a genome scan in 94 extended multiplex pedigrees by using model-based linkage analysis.

Potential [log 10 of the odds for linkage ( lod ) > 2.0] SLE loci have been identified at chromosomes 1q41 , 1q23 , and 11q14?23 in African-Americans ; 14q11 , 4p15 , 11q25 , 2q32 , 19q13 , 6q26?27 , and 12p12?11 in European-Americans ; and 1q23 , 13q32 , 20q13 , and 1q31 in all pedigrees combined.

An effect for the Fc?RIIA candidate polymorphism ) at 1q23 ( lod = 3.37 in African-Americans ) is syntenic with linkage in a murine model of lupus .

Sib-pair and multipoint nonparametric analyses also support linkage ( P < 0.05 ) at nine loci detected by using two-point lod score analysis ( lod > 2.0 ).

Our results are consistent with the presumed complexity of <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic susceptibility to SLE <END> and illustrate racial origin is likely to influence the specific nature of these genetic effects.

A genome-wide search for susceptibility genes in human systemic lupus erythematosus sib-pair families 

Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is an autoimmune multisystem inflammatory disease characterized by the <START:PHENOTYPE> production of pathogenic autoantibodies <END> .

Previous genetic studies have suggested associations with HLA Class II alleles , <START:PHENOTYPE> complement gene deficiencies <END> , and Fc receptor polymorphisms; however, it is likely that other genes contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> SLE susceptibility and pathogenesis <END> .

Here, we report the results of a genome-wide microsatellite marker screen in 105 SLE sib-pair families .

By using multipoint nonparametric methods, the strongest evidence for linkage was found near the HLA locus ( 6p11-p21 ) [ D6S257 , logarithm of odds ( lod ) = 3.90, P = 0.000011] and at three additional regions : 16q13 ( D16S415 , lod = 3.64, P = 0.000022 ), 14q21?23 ( D14S276 , lod = 2.81, P = 0.00016 ), and 20p12 ( D20S186 , lod = 2.62, P = 0.00025 ).

Another nine regions ( 1p36 , 1p13 , 1q42 , 2p15 , 2q21?33 , 3cent-q11 , 4q28 , 11p15 , and 15q26 ) were identified with lod scores ?1.00.

These data support the hypothesis that multiple genes , including one in the HLA region , influence <START:PHENOTYPE> susceptibility to human SLE <END> .

Robust associations of four new chromosome regions from genome-wide analyses of type 1 diabetes 

The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium ( WTCCC ) primary genome-wide association ( GWA ) scan 1 on seven diseases, including the multifactorial, autoimmune disease , type 1 diabetes ( T1D ), shows significant association ( P < 5 × 10 ?7 between T1D and six chromosome regions : 12q24 , 12q13 , 16p13 , 18p11 , 12p13 and 4q27 .

Here, we attempted to validate these and six other top findings in 4,000 individuals with T1D , 5,000 controls and 2,997 family trios that were independent of the WTCCC study.

We confirmed unequivocally the associations of 12q24 , 12q13 , 16p13 and 18p11 ( P follow-up ? 1.35 × 10 ?9 ; P overall ? 1.15 × 10 ?14 ), leaving eight regions with small effects or false-positive associations with T1D .

We also obtained evidence for chromosome 18q22 ( P overall = 1.38 × 10 ?8 ) from a genome-wide association study of nonsynonymous SNPs.

Several regions , including 18q22 and 18p11 , showed association with autoimmune thyroid disease .

This study increases the number of T1D loci with compelling evidence from six to at least ten.

High-Density Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Genome-Wide Linkage Scan for Susceptibility Genes for Diabetic Nephropathy in Type 1 Diabetes 

OBJECTIVE? Epidemiological and family studies have demonstrated that susceptibility genes play an important role in the etiology of diabetic nephropathy , defined as <START:PHENOTYPE> persistent proteinuria <END> or end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) in type 1 diabetes .

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS? To efficiently search for genomic regions harboring diabetic nephropathy genes , we conducted a scan using 5,382 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms on 100 sibpairs concordant for type 1 diabetes but discordant for diabetic nephropathy .

In addition to being powerful for detecting linkage to diabetic nephropathy , this design allows linkage analysis on type 1 diabetes via traditional affected sibpair ( ASP ) analysis.

In weighing the evidence for linkage, we considered maximum logarithm of odds score ( maximum likelihood score [MLS] ) values and corresponding allelic sharing patterns, calculated and viewed graphically using the software package SPLAT.

RESULTS? Our primary finding for diabetic nephropathy , broadly defined, is on chromosome 19q ( MLS = 3.1 ), and a secondary peak exists on chromosome 2q ( MLS = 2.1 ).

Stratification of discordant sibpairs based on whether disease had progressed to ESRD suggested four tertiary peaks on chromosome 1q ( ESRD only ), chromosome 20p ( <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> only ), and chromosome 3q ( two loci 58 cm apart, one for ESRD only and another for <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> only ).

Additionally, analysis of 130 ASPs for type 1 diabetes confirmed the linkage to the HLA region on chromosome 6p ( MLS = 9.2 ) and IDDM15 on chromosome 6q ( MLS = 3.1 ).

CONCLUSIONS? This study identified several novel loci as candidates for diabetic nephropathy , none of which appear to be the sole genetic determinant of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes .

In addition, this study confirms two previously reported type 1 diabetes loci .

Syndromes of Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus 

Ketosis-prone diabetes ( KPD ) is a widespread, emerging, heterogeneous syndrome characterized by patients who present with diabetic ketoacidosis or unprovoked ketosis but do not necessarily have the <START:PHENOTYPE> typical phenotype of autoimmune type 1 diabetes <END> .

Multiple, severe forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> ?-cell dysfunction <END> appear to underlie the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathophysiology of KPD <END> .

Until recently, the syndrome has lacked an accurate, clinically relevant and etiologically useful classification scheme.

We have utilized a large, longitudinally followed, heterogeneous, multiethnic cohort of KPD patients to identify four clinically and pathophysiologically distinct subgroups that are separable by the presence or absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> ?-cell autoimmunity <END> and the presence or absence of ?-cell functional reserve.

The resulting ?A?? classification system of KPD has proven to be highly accurate and predictive of such clinically important outcomes as glycemic control and insulin dependence, as well as an aid to biochemical and molecular investigations into novel causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> ?-cell dysfunction <END> .

In this review, we describe the current state of knowledge in regard to the natural history, <START:PHENOTYPE> pathophysiology <END> , and treatment of the subgroups of KPD , with an emphasis on recent advances in understanding their immunological and genetic bases.

Highly significant linkage to chromosome 3q13.31 for rhinitis and related allergic diseases 

Background Allergic diseases such as asthma and rhinitis have <START:PHENOTYPE> closely related phenotypes <END> and often occur with atopy .

They show strong familial and intra? individual clustering, suggesting overlapping disease aetiology.

Various loci and candidate genes have been suggested to underlie allergy .

Many or all are still inconclusive.

Following genome?wide scans on multiple phenotypes, we previously suggested that chromosome 3q13.12?q21.2 harbours an allergy locus .

Objective To identify candidate loci in the Danish population , two additional independent sets of sib?pair families were fine?scale mapped in candidate regions showing maximum likelihood scores ( MLS ) 1.5 in the genome?wide scans.

Results Twenty eight microsatellite markers in a denser map on chromosome 3q were analysed in 236 allergy sib?pair families including 125 sib pairs with rhinitis .

We report significant evidence for linkage to chromosome 3q13.31 for rhinitis ( MLS 5.55, identity by descent ( IBD ) 63.9% ) and atopy ( increased specific immunoglobulin E ) ( MLS 3.71, IBD 61.7% ).

We obtained an MLS of 5.1 ( IBD 67.3% ) at 3q13.31 when sib pairs with both rhinitis and atopy were analysed.

Conclusion This study reports the first statistically significant evidence for a genetic susceptibility locus for rhinitis and to our knowledge shows the most significant evidence to date of linkage for any <START:PHENOTYPE> allergy phenotype <END> .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Innate immunity <END> and intestinal microbiota in the development of Type 1 diabetes 

Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) is a debilitating autoimmune disease that results from <START:PHENOTYPE> T cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing ? cells <END> .

Its incidence has increased during the past several decades in developed countries 1 , 2 , suggesting that changes in the environment ( including human microbial environment ) may influence <START:PHENOTYPE> disease pathogenesis <END> .

The incidence of spontaneous T1D in non-obese diabetic ( NOD ) mice can be affected by the microbial environment in the animal housing facility 3 or by exposure to microbial stimuli, such as injection with mycobacteria or various microbial products 4 , 5 .

Here we show that specific-pathogen free ( SPF ) NOD mice lacking MyD88 protein ( an adaptor for multiple innate immune receptors that recognize microbial stimuli ) do not develop T1D .

The effect is dependent on commensal microbes as germ-free ( GF ) MyD88-negative NOD mice develop robust diabetes , whereas colonization of these GF NOD.MyD88-negative mice with a defined microbial consortium ( representing bacterial phyla normally present in human gut ) attenuates T1D .

We also find that <START:PHENOTYPE> MyD88-deficiency <END> changes the composition of the distal gut microbiota, and that exposure to the microbiota of SPF NOD.MyD88-negative donors attenuates T1D in GF NOD recipients .

Together, these findings indicate that interaction of the intestinal microbes with the innate immune system is a critical epigenetic factor modifying <START:PHENOTYPE> T1D predisposition <END> .

Persistent activation of an innate immune axis translates respiratory viral infection into chronic lung disease 

To understand the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disease <END> , we analyzed an experimental mouse model of a chronic lung disease that resembles asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) in humans .

In this model , chronic lung disease develops after infection with a common type of respiratory virus is cleared to trace levels of noninfectious virus .

Unexpectedly, the chronic inflammatory disease arises independently of an <START:PHENOTYPE> adaptive immune response <END> and is driven by IL-13 produced by macrophages stimulated by CD1d-dependent TCR-invariant NKT cells .

This innate immune axis is also activated in the lungs of humans with chronic airway disease due to asthma or COPD .

These findings provide new insight into the <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disease <END> with the discovery that the transition from respiratory viral infection into chronic lung disease requires persistent activation of a novel NKT cell-macrophage innate immune axis .

Dissecting the Genetic Complexity of the Association between Human Leukocyte Antigens and Rheumatoid Arthritis 

Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is an inflammatory disease with a complex genetic component.

An association between RA and the human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) complex has long been observed in many different populations, and most studies have focused on a direct role for the HLA-DRB1 âshared epitopeâ

We have performed an extensive haplotype analysis, using 54 markers distributed across the entire HLA complex, in a set of 469 multicase families with RA .

The results show that, in addition to associations with the DRB1 alleles , at least two additional genetic effects are present within the major histocompatibility complex.

One of these lies within a 497-kb region in the central portion of the HLA complex, an interval that excludes DRB1 .

This genetic risk factor is present on a segment of a highly conserved ancestral A1-B8-DRB1*03 ( 8.1 ) haplotype .

Additional risk genes may also be present in the HLA class I region in a subset of DRB1*0404 haplotypes .

These data emphasize the importance of defining haplotypes when trying to understand the HLA associations with disease, and they clearly demonstrate that such associations with RA are complex and cannot be completely explained by the DRB1 locus.

A new model for dermatitis herpetiformis that uses HLA-DQ8 transgenic NOD mice 

Dermatitis herpetiformis ( DH ) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder that is associated with gluten sensitivity.

It presents as a <START:PHENOTYPE> papulovesicular rash <END> and is often associated with enteropathy .

The <START:PHENOTYPE> rash <END> resolves when the patient is placed on a gluten -free diet and/or dapsone .

DH, as well as celiac disease , is tightly associated with DQ2 and DQ8 .

A novel mouse model for DH is described that utilizes the NOD background and the HLA-DQ8 transgene.

The addition of DQ8 contributes sensitivity to gliadin , and the addition of the NOD background contributes to <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmunity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> pathogenesis <END> .

Fifteen NOD DQ8+ mice of 90 that were sensitized to gluten developed <START:PHENOTYPE> blistering <END> pathology similar to that seen in DH .

<START:PHENOTYPE> Neutrophil infiltration of the dermis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deposition of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction <END> , and a <START:PHENOTYPE> complete reversal of the blistering phenomenon <END> with the administration of a gluten -free diet with or without dapsone were observed.

None of the 3 blistering mice examined had small-bowel pathology.

This animal model of DH will be useful to determine the specificity of the <START:PHENOTYPE> IgA deposits <END> , as well as the pathogenic mechanisms that occur in the skin as a result of gluten ingestion.
