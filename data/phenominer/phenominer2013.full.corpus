Combined <START:disease> aortic and mitral stenosis <END> in <START:disease> mucopolysaccharidosis type I-S <END> ( <START:disease> Ullrich-Scheie syndrome <END> ).
The genetic <START:disease> mucopolysaccharidosis syndromes <END> ( <START:disease> MPS <END> ) are <START:bf> autosomal recessive inborn errors of metabolism <END> . <START:disease> Heart valve involvement <END> in <START:disease> MPS <END> is not uncommon but only a few <START:organism> case <END> reports of successful cardiac surgery are available. In particular, reports of combined <START:disease> aortic and mitral stenosis <END> associated with <START:disease> MPS type I-S <END> are very rare. Both <START:disease> type I and type VI MPS <END> are associated with significant <START:disease> left sided valvar heart disease <END> that requires surgical <START:anatomy> valve <END> replacement because of <START:bf> irregular valve thickening, fibrosis, and calcification <END> . A <START:organism> 35 year old man <END> had severe <START:disease> mitral valve stenosis <END> after successful surgical replacement of a stenotic <START:anatomy> aortic valve <END> . <START:disease> Valvar heart disease <END> was investigated by cardiac ultrasound and left heart catheterisation. Histomorphological characterisation of the affected <START:anatomy> mitral valve <END> was performed. The <START:organism> case <END> illustrates typically associated clinical features of <START:bf> cardiac and extracardiac abnormalities <END> found in <START:disease> MPS type I-S <END> .
<START:disease> Cardiac anomalies <END> in the <START:disease> Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome <END> .
Diverse <START:disease> cardiac abnormalities <END> have been reported in <START:organism> patients <END> with the <START:disease> Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> SGBS <END> ), and it is suspected that they are related to the apparently high incidence of <START:bf> early death <END> . To clarify the incidence and significance of the various <START:disease> cardiac abnormalities <END> , we reviewed 101 <START:organism> SGBS patients <END> (89 from the literature, 12 new). All were male, except for one clearly affected <START:organism> female patient <END> with <START:bf> translocation X;1 <END> [Punnett, 1994: Am J Med Genet 50: 391-393]. Ninety-six of 99 (97%) <START:organism> patients <END> had the <START:bf> classic phenotype of macrosomia <END> and <START:bf> typical "coarse" face <END> . Thirty-six <START:organism> patients <END> (36%) had a <START:disease> cardiac abnormality <END> , of whom 26 (26%) had a <START:disease> cardiovascular malformation <END> ( <START:disease> CVM <END> ). After excluding 24 <START:organism> patients <END> with insufficient clinical data, these percentages among the 77 informative <START:organism> cases <END> were 47% and 34%, respectively. When grouped according to a mechanistic classification, most <START:organism> cases <END> (20/ 26, or 77%) were <START:disease> class II CVMs <END> (attributed to <START:bf> altered embryonic intracardiac flow <END> ). Other <START:disease> cardiac abnormalities <END> included <START:disease> cardiomyopathy <END> (n = 4) and <START:bf> electrocardiogram (ECG) conduction <END> or <START:bf> rhythm abnormalities <END> (n = 12); three of the <START:organism> affected patients <END> (25%) also had a <START:disease> CVM <END> . Among 92 informative <START:organism> cases <END> , there were 29 (32%) <START:bf> deaths <END> , a figure that excludes seven elective terminations. Among the 25 <START:organism> patients <END> younger than 3 years, <START:bf> death <END> was associated with a <START:disease> cardiac abnormality <END> in six (23%). <START:bf> GPC3 mutation <END> analysis using Southern blot testing and <START:ggp> polymerase <END> chain reaction amplification was performed for 37 of 101 (37%) <START:organism> patients <END> . A <START:bf> mutation <END> was detected in 26 of the 37 <START:organism> patients <END> tested (70%), 12 of whom (46%) had a <START:disease> cardiac abnormality <END> . We conclude that <START:disease> cardiac abnormalities <END> of any type are common in <START:disease> SGBS <END> (almost one-half of informative <START:organism> cases <END> ), with <START:disease> CVMs <END> seen in one-third of <START:organism> cases <END> . The <START:bf> heterogeneous ECG abnormalities <END> in this survey must be viewed with caution, since they may represent a genuine component of the <START:disease> syndrome <END> or reporting bias. Determining the true prevalence and natural history of <START:disease> cardiac abnormalities <END> in <START:disease> SGBS <END> will require a larger number of <START:organism> patients <END> and more consistent prospective cardiac evaluations. There are sufficient data to recommend a baseline echocardiogram and ECG in <START:organism> SGBS patients <END> . Data are insufficient to define a <START:bf> cardiac phenotype <END> /molecular correlation.
A novel <START:bf> deficiency of mitochondrial ATPase <END> of nuclear origin.
We report a new type of <START:bf> fatal mitochondrial disorder <END> caused by selective <START:bf> deficiency of mitochondrial ATP synthase <END> ( <START:ggp> ATPase <END> ). A <START:organism> hypotrophic newborn <END> from a consanguineous marriage presented severe <START:disease> lactic acidosis <END> , <START:disease> cardiomegaly <END> and <START:disease> hepatomegaly <END> and died from <START:disease> heart failure <END> after 2 days. The activity of <START:ggp> oligomycin-sensitive ATPase <END> was only 31-34% of the <START:organism> control <END> , both in <START:anatomy> muscle <END> and <START:anatomy> heart <END> , but the activities of <START:ggp> cytochrome c oxidase <END> , <START:ggp> citrate synthase <END> and <START:ggp> pyruvate dehydrogenase <END> were normal. Electrophoretic and western blot analysis revealed selective <START:bf> reduction of ATPase complex <END> but <START:bf> normal levels of the respiratory chain complexes I, III and IV <END> . The same selective <START:bf> deficiency of ATPase <END> was found in cultured <START:anatomy> skin fibroblasts <END> which showed similar <START:bf> decreases in ATPase content, ATPase hydrolytic activity and level of substrate-dependent ATP synthesis <END> (20-25, 18 and 29-33% of the <START:anatomy> control <END> , respectively). Pulse-chase labelling of <START:anatomy> patient fibroblasts <END> revealed low incorporation of <START:ched> [(35)S]methionine <END> into assembled <START:ggp> ATPase complexes <END> , but increased incorporation into immunoprecipitated <START:ggp> ATPase subunit beta <END> , which had a very short half-life. In contrast, no difference was found in the size and subunit composition of the assembled and newly produced <START:ggp> ATPase complex <END> . Transmitochondrial cybrids prepared from enucleated <START:anatomy> fibroblasts <END> of the <START:organism> patient <END> and rho degrees cells derived from <START:anatomy> 143B <END> . <START:anatomy> TK(-)human osteosarcoma cells <END> fully restored the <START:ggp> ATPase <END> activity, <START:bf> ATP synthesis <END> and <START:ggp> ATPase <END> content, when compared with control cybrids. Likewise, the pattern of <START:ched> [(35)S]methionine <END> labelling of <START:ggp> ATPase <END> was found to be normal in <START:organism> patient <END> cybrids. We conclude that the generalized <START:bf> deficiency of mitochondrial ATPase <END> described is of nuclear origin and is caused by <START:bf> altered biosynthesis of the enzyme <END> .
Genomic organization and chromosomal localization of the <START:ggp> human Coxsackievirus B-adenovirus receptor gene <END> .
<START:disease> Myocarditis <END> and <START:disease> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( <START:disease> DCM <END> ) are common causes of morbidity and mortality in <START:organism> children <END> . Many studies have implicated the <START:organism> enteroviruses <END> and, particularly, the <START:organism> Coxsackievirus-B family <END> as etiologic agents of the acquired forms of these <START:disease> diseases <END> . However, we have shown the <START:organism> group-C adenoviruses <END> to be as commonly detected as <START:organism> enteroviruses <END> in the <START:anatomy> myocardium <END> of <START:organism> children <END> and <START:organism> adults <END> with these <START:disease> diseases <END> . It has remained something of a conundrum why two such divergent <START:organism> virus families <END> cause these <START:disease> diseases <END> . The recent description of the common <START:ggp> human Coxsackievirus B-adenovirus receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> CAR <END> ) offers at least a partial explanation. In order to characterize the <START:ggp> CAR gene <END> , we screened a bacterial artificial chromosomal (BAC) library (RPCI11) using a <START:ggp> polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product <END> derived from the <START:ggp> 3' end <END> of the <START:ggp> CAR cDNA <END> sequence. This identified 13 BACs that were further characterized by PCR amplification of seven <START:ggp> contiguous regions <END> of the entire <START:ggp> cDNA <END> sequence. Eleven of the BACs were determined to encode <START:ggp> pseudogenes <END> while the other two BACs (131J5 and 246M1) encoded the presumed <START:ggp> functional gene <END> . PCR amplification of a monochromosomal hybrid panel indicated the presence of <START:ggp> pseudogenes <END> on <START:ggp> chromosomes 15, 18, and 21 <END> while the f <START:ggp> unctional gene <END> is encoded on <START:ggp> chromosome 21 <END> . Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis indicated that the <START:ggp> gene <END> is located at <START:ggp> 21q11.2 <END> . <START:ggp> DNA <END> sequencing of BACs 131J5 and 246M1 revealed the presence of seven <START:ggp> exons <END> . The <START:ggp> DNA <END> sequences have been determined for each <START:ggp> exon-intron boundary <END> , and putative <START:ggp> promoter <END> sequences and <START:ggp> transcription initiation sites <END> identified. No <START:ggp> consensus polyadenylation signal <END> was identified.
<START:ggp> CACP <END> , encoding a <START:ggp> secreted proteoglycan <END> , is mutated in <START:disease> camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome <END> .
<START:bf> Altered growth and function of synoviocytes <END> , the <START:anatomy> intimal cells <END> which line <START:anatomy> joint cavities <END> and <START:anatomy> tendon sheaths <END> , occur in a number of <START:disease> skeletal diseases <END> . <START:bf> Hyperplasia of synoviocytes <END> is found in both <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> and <START:disease> osteoarthritis <END> , despite differences in the underlying aetiologies of the two <START:disease> disorders <END> . We have studied the <START:disease> autosomal recessive disorder <END> <START:disease> camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> CACP <END> ; MIM 208250) to identify biological pathways that lead to <START:bf> synoviocyte hyperplasia <END> , the principal pathological feature of this <START:disease> syndrome <END> . Using a positional-candidate approach, we identified <START:bf> mutations in a gene (CACP) <END> encoding a secreted <START:ggp> proteoglycan <END> as the cause of <START:disease> CACP <END> . The <START:ggp> CACP protein <END> , which has previously been identified as both ' <START:ggp> megakaryocyte stimulating factor precursor <END> ' and ' <START:ggp> superficial zone protein <END> ', contains <START:ggp> domains <END> that have homology to <START:ggp> somatomedin B <END> , <START:ggp> heparin-binding proteins <END> , <START:ggp> mucins <END> and <START:ggp> haemopexins <END> . In addition to <START:bf> expression in joint synovium and cartilage <END> , <START:ggp> CACP <END> is expressed in <START:anatomy> non-skeletal tissues <END> including <START:anatomy> liver <END> and <START:anatomy> pericardium <END> . The similarity of <START:ggp> CACP <END> sequence to that of other <START:ggp> protein families <END> and the <START:bf> expression of CACP in non-skeletal tissues <END> suggest it may have diverse biological activities.
<START:bf> Mutations in the cardiac transcription factor NKX2.5 <END> affect diverse <START:bf> cardiac developmental pathways <END> .
<START:bf> Heterozygous mutations in NKX2.5 <END> , a <START:ggp> homeobox transcription factor <END> , were reported to cause <START:disease> secundum atrial septal defects <END> and result in <START:disease> atrioventricular (AV) conduction block <END> during postnatal life. To further characterize the role of <START:ggp> NKX2.5 <END> in <START:bf> cardiac morphogenesis <END> , we sought additional <START:bf> mutations <END> in groups of <START:organism> probands <END> with <START:disease> cardiac anomalies <END> and <START:disease> first-degree AV block <END> , idiopathic <START:disease> AV block <END> , or <START:disease> tetralogy of Fallot <END> . We identified 7 novel <START:bf> mutations <END> by sequence analysis of the <START:ggp> NKX2.5-coding region <END> in 26 <START:organism> individuals <END> . Associated phenotypes included <START:disease> AV block <END> , which was the primary manifestation of <START:disease> cardiac disease <END> in nearly a quarter of <START:organism> affected individuals <END> , as well as <START:disease> atrial septal defect <END> and <START:disease> ventricular septal defec <END> t. <START:disease> Ventricular septal defect <END> was associated with <START:disease> tetralogy of Fallot <END> or <START:disease> double-outlet right ventricle <END> in 3 <START:organism> individuals <END> . <START:disease> Ebstein's anomaly <END> and other <START:bf> tricuspid valve abnormalities <END> were also present. <START:bf> Mutations in human NKX2.5 <END> cause a variety of <START:disease> cardiac anomalies <END> and may account for a clinically significant portion of <START:disease> tetralogy of Fallot <END> and <START:disease> idiopathic AV block <END> . The coinheritance of <START:bf> NKX2.5 mutations <END> with various <START:bf> congenital heart defects <END> suggests that this <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> contributes to diverse <START:bf> cardiac developmental pathways <END> .
Severity of <START:disease> hypertension <END> in <START:disease> familial hyperaldosteronism type I <END> : relationship to gender and degree of biochemical disturbance.
In <START:disease> familial hyperaldosteronism type I <END> ( <START:disease> FH-I <END> ), inheritance of a <START:ggp> hybrid 11beta-hydroxylase/aldosterone synthase gene <END> causes <START:bf> ACTH-regulated aldosterone overproduction <END> . In an attempt to understand the marked variability in <START:disease> hypertension <END> severity in <START:disease> FH-I <END> , we compared clinical and biochemical characteristics of 9 <START:organism> affected individuals <END> with mild <START:disease> hypertension <END> ( <START:bf> normotensive <END> or onset of <START:disease> hypertension <END> after 15 yr, <START:bf> blood pressure never >160/100 mm Hg <END> , < or = 1 medication required to control <START:disease> hypertension <END> , no history of <START:disease> stroke <END> , age >18 yr when studied) with those of 17 <START:organism> subjects <END> with severe <START:disease> hypertension <END> (onset before 15 yr, or <START:bf> systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg <END> or <START:bf> diastolic blood pressure >120 mm Hg <END> at least once, or > or = 2 medications, or history of <START:disease> stroke <END> ). Severe <START:disease> hypertension <END> was more frequent in <START:organism> males <END> (11 of 13 <START:organism> males <END> vs. 6 of 13 <START:organism> females <END> ; P < 0.05). All 4 <START:organism> subjects <END> still <START:bf> normotensive <END> after age 18 yr were <START:organism> females <END> . Of 10 other <START:organism> affected, deceased individuals <END> (7 <START:organism> males <END> and 3 <START:organism> females <END> ) from a single <START:organism> family <END> , all six who died before 60 yr of age (4 by stroke) were <START:organism> males <END> . Biochemical studies were conducted in 6 <START:organism> mild and 16 severe subjects <END> . The 2 <START:organism> groups <END> were similar in terms of <START:bf> urinary sodium excretion <END> . <START:organism> Mild subjects <END> tended, although not significantly, to have <START:bf> lower urinary 18-oxo-cortisol <END> (mean +/- SD, 27.4 +/- 9.0 vs. 35.2 +/- 12.9 nmol/mmol creatinine x day), <START:bf> higher plasma potassium <END> (4.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.4 mmol/L), and <START:bf> lower recumbent (0800 h after overnight recumbency) plasma aldosterone levels <END> (498 +/- 279 vs. 744 +/- 290 pmol/L). Upright (midmorning after 2-3 h of upright posture) plasma aldosterone levels were similar (mild, 485 +/- 150; severe, 474 +/- 188 pmol/L). In 1 <START:organism> normotensive female <END> , upright PRA was much higher, and the upright aldosterone/PRA ratio was much lower than that in the other <START:organism> subjects <END> . The remaining <START:organism> mild subjects <END> had <START:bf> similar upright PRA levels (mild, 2.8 +/- 1.4; severe, 3.7 +/- 3.2 pmol/ L x min) and aldosterone/PRA ratios (mild, 199.5 +/- 133.4; severe, 200.6 +/- 150.9) as severe subjects <END> . During <START:ggp> angiotensin II <END> ( <START:ggp> AII <END> ) infusion studies (n = 6 mild and 10 severe), performed during recumbency, aldosterone levels were lower in the <START:organism> mild group <END> both basally (404 +/- 144 vs. 843 +/- 498 pmol/L; P < 0.05) and after 60 min <START:ggp> AII <END> (2 ng/kg x min; 261 +/- 130 vs. 520 +/- 330 pmol/L; P < 0.05). <START:ched> Aldosterone <END> was unresponsive (rose by <50%) to <START:ggp> AII <END> in all <START:organism> subjects <END> . Day curve studies ( <START:anatomy> blood <END> collected every 2 h for 24 h; n = 2 <START:organism> mild <END> and 7 <START:organism> severe <END> ) demonstrated <START:bf> abnormal regulation of aldosterone by ACTH <END> rather than by <START:ggp> AII <END> in both <START:organism> groups <END> . In conclusion, in this series of <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> FH-I <END> , <START:organism> males <END> had more severe <START:disease> hypertension <END> , and the degree of <START:bf> hybrid gene-induced aldosterone overproduction <END> may have contributed to the severity of <START:disease> hypertension <END> .
Clinical and molecular genetic spectrum of <START:disease> autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy <END> due to <START:bf> mutations of the lamin A/C gene <END> .
<START:disease> Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy <END> ( <START:disease> EDMD <END> ) is characterized by early <START:disease> contractures <END> of the <START:anatomy> elbows <END> and <START:anatomy> Achilles tendons <END> , <START:bf> slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness <END> , and life-threatening <START:disease> cardiomyopathy <END> with <START:bf> conduction blocks <END> . We recently identified <START:ggp> LMNA <END> encoding two <START:ggp> nuclear envelope proteins <END> , <START:ggp> lamins A and C <END> , to be implicated in the <START:disease> autosomal dominant form of EDMD <END> . Here, we report on the variability of the phenotype and spectrum of <START:bf> LMNA mutations <END> in 53 <START:organism> autosomal dominant EDMD patients <END> (36 <START:organism> members <END> of 6 <START:organism> families <END> and 17 <START:organism> sporadic cases <END> ). Twelve of the 53 <START:organism> patients <END> showed <START:disease> cardiac involvement <END> exclusively, although the remaining 41 all showed <START:disease> muscle weakness <END> and <START:disease> contractures <END> . We were able to identify a common phenotype among the <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> skeletal muscle involvement <END> , consisting of <START:bf> humeroperoneal wasting and weakness <END> , <START:bf> scapular winging <END> , <START:bf> rigidity of the spine <END> , and <START:anatomy> elbow <END> and <START:anatomy> Achilles tendon <END> <START:disease> contractures <END> . The <START:disease> disease <END> course was generally slow, but we observed either a <START:bf> milder phenotype <END> characterized by late onset and a mild degree of <START:bf> weakness <END> and <START:disease> contractures <END> or a more <START:bf> severe phenotype <END> with early presentation and a rapidly progressive course in a few <START:organism> cases <END> . <START:bf> Mutation <END> analysis identified 18 <START:bf> mutations in LMNA <END> (i.e., 1 <START:bf> nonsense mutation <END> , 2 <START:bf> deletions of a codon <END> , and 15 <START:bf> missense mutations <END> ). All the <START:bf> mutations <END> were distributed between <START:ggp> exons 1 and 9 <END> in the <START:ggp> region <END> of <START:ggp> LMNA <END> that is common to <START:ggp> lamins A and C <END> . <START:bf> LMNA mutations <END> arose de novo in 76% of the <START:organism> cases <END> ; 2 of these <START:bf> de novo mutations <END> were <START:ggp> typical hot spots <END> , and 2 others were identified in 2 unrelated <START:organism> cases <END> . There was no clear correlation between the phenotype and type or localization of the <START:bf> mutations within the gene <END> . Moreover, a marked inter- and intra-familial variability in the clinical expression of <START:bf> LMNA mutations <END> exists, ranging from <START:organism> patients <END> expressing the full clinical picture of <START:disease> EDMD <END> to those characterized only by <START:disease> cardiac involvement <END> , which points toward a significant role of possible <START:ggp> modifier genes <END> in the course of this <START:disease> disease <END> . In conclusion, the high proportion of <START:bf> de novo mutations <END> together with the large spectrum of both <START:bf> LMNA mutations <END> and the expression of the <START:disease> disease <END> should now prompt screening for <START:ggp> LMNA <END> in <START:organism> familial and sporadic cases <END> of both <START:disease> EDMD <END> and <START:disease> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> associated with <START:disease> conduction system disease <END> .
Two common <START:bf> endoglin mutations <END> in <START:organism> families <END> with <START:disease> hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia <END> in the Netherlands Antilles: evidence for a founder effect.
<START:disease> Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia <END> ( <START:disease> HHT <END> ) is an <START:disease> autosomal dominant bleeding disorder <END> characterized by localized <START:disease> angiodysplasia <END> . <START:bf> Mutations <END> in either of two genes, <START:ggp> endoglin <END> or <START:ggp> ALK-1 <END> , can cause <START:disease> HHT <END> . Both <START:ggp> genes <END> encode putative <START:ggp> receptors <END> for the <START:ggp> transforming growth factor-beta superfamily <END> of <START:ggp> ligands <END> . Many <START:bf> mutations <END> in each <START:ggp> gene <END> have been identified in <START:organism> HHT kindreds <END> from around the world, and with few exceptions <START:bf> mutations <END> are unique and <START:organism> family <END> specific. The prevalence of <START:disease> HHT <END> in the Leeward Islands of the Netherlands Antilles is possibly the highest of any geographical location. We wished to establish whether this high prevalence is due to a genetic founder effect or to multiple <START:bf> mutational events <END> . <START:organism> HHT kindreds <END> from the Netherlands Antilles and The Netherlands were screened for <START:bf> mutations <END> in the two <START:ggp> genes <END> associated with <START:disease> HHT <END> . Haplotype analysis of a <START:ggp> 5-cM region <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 9 <END> flanking the <START:ggp> endoglin gene <END> revealed three distinct <START:disease> disease <END> haplotypes in the ten <START:organism> Antillean families <END> studied. Seven of these <START:organism> families <END> share a <START:bf> splice-site mutation <END> in <START:ggp> exon 1 <END> of <START:ggp> endoglin <END> . Two other <START:organism> Antillean families <END> share a <START:bf> missense mutation <END> in <START:ggp> exon 9a <END> of <START:ggp> endoglin <END> . This <START:bf> mutation <END> was also found in a <START:organism> Dutch family <END> that shares the same <START:disease> disease <END> haplotype as the <START:organism> Antillean families <END> with this <START:bf> mutation <END> . Thus it appears that <START:disease> HHT <END> in the Netherlands Antilles is due to a limited number of ancestral <START:bf> mutations <END> in the <START:ggp> endoglin gene <END> , and that one of these <START:bf> mutations <END> was introduced into the <START:organism> African slave population <END> by a <START:organism> Dutch colonist <END> . The limited scope of <START:bf> mutations <END> suggests that a presymptomatic screening program for <START:disease> HHT <END> would be feasible in this <START:organism> population <END> .
Genomic structure of the <START:ggp> human plasma prekallikrein gene <END> , identification of allelic variants, and analysis in <START:disease> end-stage renal disease <END> .
<START:ggp> Kallikreins <END> are <START:ggp> serine proteases <END> that catalyze the <START:bf> release of kinins and other vasoactive peptides <END> . Previously, we have studied one <START:anatomy> tissue <END> -specific ( <START:organism> H. Yu <END> et al., 1996, J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 7: 2559-2564) and one <START:anatomy> plasma <END> -specific ( <START:organism> H. Yu <END> et al., 1998, <START:disease> Hypertension <END> 31: 906-911) <START:ggp> human kallikrein gene <END> in <START:disease> end-stage renal disease <END> ( <START:disease> ESRD <END> ). Short sequence repeat <START:bf> polymorphisms <END> for the <START:ggp> human plasma kallikrein gene <END> ( <START:ggp> KLKB1 <END> ; previously known as <START:ggp> KLK3 <END> ) on <START:ggp> chromosome 4 <END> were associated with <START:disease> ESRD <END> in an <START:organism> African American study population <END> . This study of <START:ggp> KLKB1 <END> in <START:disease> ESRD <END> has been extended by determining the genomic structure of <START:ggp> KLKB1 <END> and searching for <START:ggp> allelic variants <END> that may be associated with <START:disease> ESRD <END> . <START:ggp> Exon <END> -spanning PCR primer sets were identified by serial testing of primer pairs designed from <START:ggp> KLKB1 cDNA <END> sequence and <START:ggp> DNA <END> sequencing of <START:ggp> PCR products <END> . Like the <START:ggp> rat plasma kallikrein gene <END> and the closely related <START:ggp> human factor XI gene <END> , the <START:ggp> human KLKB1 gene <END> contains 15 <START:ggp> exons <END> and 14 <START:ggp> introns <END> . The <START:ggp> longest intron <END> , <START:ggp> F <END> , is almost 12 kb long. The total length of the <START:ggp> gene <END> is approximately 30 kb. Sequence of the <START:ggp> 5'-proximal promoter region <END> of <START:ggp> KLKB1 <END> was obtained by shotgun cloning of <START:ggp> genomic fragments <END> from a bacterial artificial clone containing the <START:ggp> KLKB1 gene <END> , followed by screening of the clones using <START:ggp> exon 1 <END> -specific probes. Primers flanking the <START:ggp> exons <END> and <START:ggp> 5'-proximal promoter region <END> were used to screen for <START:ggp> allelic variants <END> in the <START:ggp> genomic DNA <END> from <START:organism> ESRD patients <END> and controls using the single-strand conformation <START:bf> polymorphism <END> technique. We identified 12 <START:ggp> allelic variants <END> in the <START:ggp> 5'-proximal promoter <END> and 7 <START:ggp> exons <END> . Of note were a common <START:bf> polymorphism <END> (30% of the population) at <START:ggp> position 521 <END> of <START:ggp> KLKB1 cDNA <END> , which leads to the replacement of <START:ched> asparagine <END> with a <START:ched> serine <END> at <START:ggp> position 124 <END> in the <START:ggp> heavy chain <END> of the <START:ggp> A2 domain <END> of the <START:ggp> protein <END> . In addition, an <START:bf> A716C <END> <START:bf> polymorphism <END> in <START:ggp> exon 7 <END> resulting in the <START:bf> amino acid change <END> <START:bf> H189P <END> in the <START:ggp> A3 domain <END> of the <START:ggp> heavy chain <END> was observed in 5 <START:organism> patients <END> belonging to 3 <START:organism> ESRD families <END> . A third <START:bf> polymorphism <END> in the <START:ggp> coding sequence <END> was a <START:bf> C699A shift <END> that caused an <START:bf> amino acid change <END> , <START:bf> H183Q <END> . This <START:ggp> allele <END> was observed in 8 <START:organism> cases <END> from 6 <START:organism> ESRD families <END> but was not found in any <START:ggp> control DNAs <END> . Individually or combined, the <START:ggp> allelic variants <END> observed are not statistically associated with <START:disease> ESRD <END> , though in several <START:organism> cases <END> (e.g., <START:bf> H183Q <END> ) the small number of <START:organism> people <END> in the <START:organism> population <END> carrying these <START:ggp> alleles <END> limits our ability to statistically test for significant association with <START:disease> ESRD <END> . Two new <START:ggp> CA/GT repeat polymorphic markers <END> , designated <START:ggp> KLK3f <END> and <START:ggp> KLK3g <END> , that have heterozygosities of 0.65 and 0.84, respectively, were identified within <START:ggp> introns M and N <END> . Analysis using the relative predispositional effect technique indicated that the frequencies of <START:ggp> alleles 4 and 8 <END> of <START:ggp> KLK3f <END> and <START:ggp> allele 8 <END> of <START:ggp> KLK3g <END> were significantly different between <START:organism> controls <END> and <START:organism> ESRD cases <END> . They accounted for 0.226, 0.096, and 0.313, respectively, in the <START:organism> probands <END> of 166 <START:organism> ESRD families <END> compared to 0.172, 0.066, and 0.244 in 139 <START:organism> healthy race-matched controls <END> ( <START:ggp> allele <END> P and total P < 0.05 for all three <START:ggp> alleles <END> ). Therefore, although <START:bf> polymorphisms <END> in the <START:ggp> coding <END> and <START:ggp> 5'-proximal promoter <END> of <START:ggp> KLKB1 <END> show no statistically significant association with <START:disease> ESRD <END> in <START:organism> African Americans <END> , there is still evidence for association of this part of <START:ggp> chromosome 4 <END> with <START:disease> ESRD <END> . This observation suggests that other <START:ggp> sequences <END> within or near <START:ggp> KLKB1 <END> , or another <START:ggp> gene <END> nearby, may contribute to <START:bf> ESRD susceptibility <END> .
<START:disease> Cardiovascular malformations <END> and other <START:disease> cardiovascular abnormalities <END> in <START:disease> neurofibromatosis 1 <END> .
Although it is well recognized that a <START:disease> peripheral vasculopathy <END> may occur in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> neurofibromatosis 1 <END> ( <START:disease> NF1 <END> ), it is unclear whether <START:bf> cardiovascular abnormalities <END> are more common. We reviewed the frequency of <START:disease> cardiovascular abnormalities <END> , in particular, <START:disease> cardiovascular malformations <END> ( <START:disease> CVMs <END> ), among 2322 <START:organism> patients <END> with definite <START:disease> NF1 <END> in the National <START:disease> Neurofibromatosis <END> Foundation International Database from 1991-98. <START:disease> Cardiovascular malformations <END> were reported in 54/2322 (2.3%) of the <START:organism> NF1 patients <END> , only 4 of whom had <START:disease> Watson syndrome <END> or <START:disease> NF1-Noonan syndrome <END> . There was a predominance of <START:bf> Class II "flow" defects <END> [ <START:organism> Clark <END> , 1995: <START:organism> Moss <END> and <START:organism> Adams <END> ' <START:disease> Heart Disease <END> in <START:organism> Infants <END> , <START:organism> Children <END> , and <START:organism> Adolescents <END> Including the <START:organism> Fetus <END> and <START:organism> Young Adult <END> . p 60-70] (43/54, 80%) among the <START:organism> NF1 patients <END> with <START:disease> CVMs <END> . <START:disease> Pulmonic stenosis <END> , that was present in 25 <START:organism> NF1 patients <END> , and <START:disease> aortic coarctation <END> , that occurred in 5, constitute much larger proportions of all <START:disease> CVMs <END> than expected. Of interest was the paucity of <START:bf> Class I conotruncal defects <END> (2 <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> tetralogy of Fallot <END> ), and the <START:bf> absence of atrioventricular canal <END> , <START:bf> anomalous pulmonary venous return <END> , <START:bf> complex single ventricle <END> and <START:bf> laterality defects <END> . Besides the 54 <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> CVMs <END> , there were 27 <START:organism> patients <END> with other <START:disease> cardiac abnormalities <END> (16 with <START:bf> murmur <END> , 5 with <START:disease> mitral valve prolapse <END> , 1 with intracardiac <START:disease> tumor <END> , and 5 with <START:bf> electrocardiogram abnormalities <END> ). No <START:organism> patient <END> in this study had <START:disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> . There were 16 <START:organism> patients <END> who had a <START:bf> peripheral vascular abnormality <END> without an intracardiac <START:disease> CVM <END> , plus an additional 4 <START:organism> patients <END> among those with a <START:disease> CVM <END> who also had a <START:bf> peripheral vascular abnormality <END> .
<START:bf> Barth's syndrome-like disorder <END> : a new phenotype with a maternally inherited <START:bf> A3243G substitution of mitochondrial DNA <END> ( <START:bf> MELAS mutation <END> ).
An <START:organism> Argentine male child <END> died at 4.5 years of age of a <START:disease> lethal mitochondrial disease <END> associated with a <START:bf> MELAS mutation <END> and a <START:bf> Barth syndrome-like presentation <END> . The <START:organism> child <END> had <START:bf> severe failure to thrive <END> from the early months and for approximately two years thereafter. In addition, the <START:organism> patient <END> had <START:bf> severely delayed gross motor milestones <END> , marked <START:disease> muscle weakness <END> , and <START:disease> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> that progressed to <START:disease> congestive heart failure <END> . He also had <START:bf> persistently elevated urinary levels of 3-methylglutaconic and 2-ethylhydracrylic acids <END> and <START:bf> low blood levels of cholesterol <END> . Detailed histopathologic evaluation of the <START:anatomy> skeletal muscle <END> biopsy showed <START:bf> high activity of succinate dehydrogenase <END> , a generalized <START:bf> decrease of COX activity <END> , and <START:bf> abundant ragged-red fibers <END> . Electron microscopic studies revealed multiple <START:bf> mitochondrial abnormalities <END> in <START:anatomy> lymphocytes <END> and <START:anatomy> monocytes <END> , in the <START:anatomy> striated muscle <END> , and in the <START:anatomy> postmortem samples <END> ( <START:anatomy> muscle <END> , <START:anatomy> heart <END> , <START:anatomy> liver <END> , and <START:anatomy> brain <END> ). Biochemical analysis showed a pronounced and constant <START:disease> lactic acidosis <END> , and <START:bf> abnormal urinary organic acid excretion <END> ( <START:bf> unchanged in the fasting and postprandial states <END> ). In addition, in <START:anatomy> CSF <END> there was a <START:bf> marked increase of lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate <END> ( <START:ched> beta-HOB <END> ) and also a <START:bf> high systemic ratio beta-HOB/acetoacetate <END> . Enzymatic assay of the <START:ggp> respiratory chain <END> in biopsied <START:anatomy> muscle <END> showed <START:bf> 10% of complex I activity <END> and <START:bf> 24% of complex IV activity <END> compared with <START:organism> controls <END> . Molecular studies of the <START:ggp> mitochondrial genome <END> revealed an <START:bf> A to G mutation at nucleotide pair 3243 in mitochondrial DNA <END> , a <START:bf> well-known pathogenetic mutation <END> ( <START:bf> MELAS mutation <END> ) in all the <START:anatomy> patient's tissues <END> and also in the <START:anatomy> blood <END> specimens of the <START:organism> probands <END> <START:organism> mother <END> and <START:organism> sibs <END> (4 of 5). The diagnosis of <START:bf> MELAS mutation <END> was reinforced by the absence of an identifiable <START:bf> mutation in the X-linked G4.5 gene <END> of the <START:organism> propositus <END> . The present observation gives additional evidence of the variable clinical expression of <START:bf> mtDNA mutations <END> in <START:organism> humans <END> and demonstrates that all clinical variants deserve adequate investigation to establish a primary defect. It also suggests adding <START:disease> Barth-like syndrome <END> to the list of phenotypes with the <START:bf> MELAS mutation <END> .
<START:disease> Congenital heart disease <END> in <START:disease> maternal phenylketonuria <END> : report from the <START:disease> Maternal PKU <END> Collaborative Study.
The frequency and types of <START:disease> congenital heart disease <END> in <START:organism> offspring <END> from <START:bf> pregnancies <END> in <START:organism> women <END> with <START:disease> hyperphenylalaninemia <END> were examined in the international prospective <START:disease> Maternal Phenylketonuria <END> Collaborative Study. Relationships of <START:disease> congenital heart disease <END> in <START:organism> offspring <END> to the <START:bf> basal blood phenylalanine level <END> in the <START:organism> mother <END> , metabolic control through diet during <START:bf> pregnancy <END> , and <START:bf> phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations <END> in <START:organism> mother <END> and <START:organism> offspring <END> were determined. The 416 <START:organism> offspring <END> from 412 <START:bf> maternal phenylketonuria pregnancies <END> that produced <START:bf> live births <END> and 100 <START:organism> offspring <END> from the 99 control <START:bf> pregnancies <END> were included in this examination. Thirty-four of the 235 <START:organism> offspring <END> (14%; 95% CI, 10.2 to 19.6%) from <START:bf> pregnancies <END> in <START:organism> phenylketonuric women <END> with a <START:bf> basal phenylalanine level > or = 900 microM <END> (15 mg/dL) [ <START:bf> normal blood phenylalanine < 120 microM <END> (2 mg/dL)] and not in metabolic control [ <START:bf> phenylalanine level < or = 600 microM <END> (10 mg/dL)] by the eighth gestational week had <START:disease> congenital heart disease <END> compared with one <START:organism> control offspring <END> (1%) with <START:disease> congenital heart disease <END> . One <START:organism> offspring <END> among the 50 (2%) from <START:organism> mothers <END> with <START:disease> non-phenylketonuria mild hyperphenylalaninemia <END> also had <START:disease> congenital heart disease <END> . <START:disease> Coarctation of the aorta <END> and <START:disease> hypoplastic left heart syndrome <END> were overrepresented compared with expected percentages among those with <START:disease> congenital heart disease <END> in the <START:organism> general population <END> . A <START:bf> basal maternal phenylalanine level > 1800 microM <END> (30 mg/dL) significantly increased the risk for bearing a <START:organism> child <END> with <START:disease> congenital heart disease <END> (p = 0.003). <START:bf> Phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations <END> in the <START:organism> mothers <END> and <START:organism> offspring <END> did not have an independent relationship to <START:disease> congenital heart disease <END> but were related through the basal maternal <START:ched> phenylalanine <END> levels. The data in this study indicate that a <START:bf> basal maternal phenylalanine level of 900 microM <END> may be a threshold for <START:disease> congenital heart disease <END> , that <START:organism> women <END> with the most severe degree of <START:disease> phenylketonuria <END> are at highest risk for <START:bf> bearing such a child <END> , and that prevention of the <START:disease> congenital heart disease <END> requires initiation of the low <START:ched> phenylalanine <END> diet before <START:bf> conception <END> or early in <START:bf> pregnancy <END> with metabolic control no later than the eighth gestational week.
Estimating the efficacy and efficiency of cascade genetic screening.
Screening for <START:ggp> genetic variants <END> that predispose <START:organism> individuals <END> or their <START:organism> offspring <END> to <START:disease> disease <END> may be performed at the <START:organism> general population <END> level or may instead be targeted at the <START:organism> relatives <END> of <START:organism> previously identified carriers <END> . The latter strategy has come to be known as "cascade genetic screening." Since the carrier risk of <START:organism> close relatives <END> of <START:organism> known carriers <END> is generally higher than the <START:organism> population <END> risk, cascade screening is more efficient than <START:organism> population <END> screening, in the sense that fewer <START:organism> individuals <END> have to be genotyped per <START:organism> detected carrier <END> . The efficacy of cascade screening, as measured by the overall proportion of <START:organism> carriers <END> detected in a given <START:organism> population <END> , is, however, lower than that of <START:organism> population <END> -wide screening, and the respective inclusion rates vary according to the <START:organism> population <END> frequency and mode of <START:bf> inheritance of the predisposing variants <END> . For <START:bf> dominant mutations <END> , we have developed equations that allow the inclusion rates of cascade screening to be calculated in an iterative fashion, depending upon screening depth and penetrance. For <START:bf> recessive mutations <END> , we derived only equations for the screening of <START:organism> siblings <END> and the <START:organism> children <END> of <START:organism> patients <END> . Owing to their mathematical complexity, it was necessary to study more extended screening strategies by simulation. Cascade screening turned out to result in low inclusion rates (<1%) when aimed at the identification of <START:organism> heterozygous carriers <END> of <START:ggp> rare recessive variants <END> . Considerably higher rates are achievable, however, when screening is performed to detect <START:organism> covert homozygotes <END> for <START:bf> frequent recessive mutations <END> with reduced penetrance. This situation is exemplified by <START:disease> hereditary hemochromatosis <END> , for which up to 40% of <START:organism> at-risk individuals <END> may be identifiable through screening of <START:organism> first- to third-degree relatives <END> of <START:organism> overt carriers <END> (i.e., <START:organism> patients <END> ); the efficiency of this screening strategy was found to be approximately 50 times higher than that of <START:organism> population <END> -wide screening. For <START:bf> dominant mutations <END> , inclusion rates of cascade screening were estimated to be higher than for <START:ggp> recessive variants <END> . Thus, some 80% of all <START:organism> carriers <END> of the <START:bf> factor V Leiden mutation <END> would be detected if screening were to be targeted specifically at <START:organism> first- to third-degree relatives <END> of <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> venous thrombosis <END> . The relative cost efficiency of cascade as compared with <START:organism> population <END> -wide screening (i.e., the overall savings in the extra managerial cost of the condition) is also likely to be higher for <START:bf> dominant than for recessive mutations <END> . This notwithstanding, once screening has become cost-effective at the <START:organism> population <END> level, it can be expected that cascade screening would only transiently represent an economically viable option.
<START:bf> Altered potassium balance and aldosterone secretion <END> in a <START:organism> mouse model <END> of <START:organism> human <END> congenital <START:disease> long QT syndrome <END> .
The <START:ggp> voltage-dependent K(+) channel <END> responsible for the <START:bf> slowly activating delayed K(+) current I(Ks) <END> is composed of <START:ggp> pore-forming KCNQ1 <END> and <START:ggp> regulatory KCNE1 subunits <END> , which are mutated in familial forms of cardiac <START:disease> long QT syndrome <END> . Because <START:ggp> KCNQ1 <END> and <START:ggp> KCNE1 genes <END> also are expressed in <START:anatomy> epithelial tissues <END> , such as the <START:anatomy> kidneys <END> and the <START:anatomy> intestine <END> , we have investigated the adaptation of <START:organism> KCNE1-deficient mice <END> to different <START:bf> K(+) and Na(+) intakes <END> . On a normal <START:ched> K(+) <END> diet, <START:organism> homozygous kcne1(-/-) mice <END> exhibit signs of <START:bf> chronic volume depletion <END> associated with <START:bf> fecal Na(+) and K(+) wasting <END> and have <START:bf> lower plasma K(+) concentration <END> and <START:bf> higher levels of aldosterone <END> than <START:organism> wild-type mice <END> . Although <START:anatomy> plasma <END> <START:ched> aldosterone <END> can be suppressed by low <START:ched> K(+) <END> diets or stimulated by low <START:ched> Na(+) <END> diets, a high <START:ched> K(+) <END> diet provokes a <START:bf> tremendous increase of plasma aldosterone levels <END> in <START:organism> kcne1(-/-) mice <END> as compared with <START:organism> wild-type mice <END> (7.1-fold vs. 1.8-fold) despite <START:bf> lower plasma K(+) <END> in <START:organism> kcne1(-/-) mice <END> . This <START:bf> exacerbated aldosterone production <END> in <START:organism> kcne1(-/-) mice <END> is accompanied by an <START:bf> abnormally high plasma renin concentration <END> , which could partly explain the <START:disease> hyperaldosteronism <END> . In addition, we found that <START:ggp> KCNE1 <END> and <START:ggp> KCNQ1 mRNAs <END> are expressed in the <START:anatomy> zona glomerulosa of adrenal glands <END> where <START:bf> I(Ks) <END> may directly participate in the <START:bf> control of aldosterone production by plasma K(+) <END> . These results, which show that <START:ggp> KCNE1 <END> and <START:bf> I(Ks) <END> are involved in <START:bf> K(+) homeostasis <END> , might have important implications for <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:bf> I(Ks) <END> -related <START:disease> long QT syndrome <END> , because <START:disease> hypokalemia <END> is a well known risk factor for the occurrence of <START:disease> torsades de pointes <END> <START:disease> ventricular arrhythmia <END> .
<START:disease> Pseudoxanthoma elasticum <END> : <START:bf> Point mutations in the ABCC6 gene <END> and a <START:bf> large deletion including also ABCC1 and MYH11 <END> .
<START:disease> Pseudoxanthoma elasticum <END> ( <START:disease> PXE <END> ) is a <START:disease> mendelian disorder <END> characterized by <START:bf> calcification of elastic fibers in skin, arteries, and retina <END> . It results in <START:bf> dermal lesions <END> , <START:bf> arterial insufficiency <END> and <START:bf> retinal hemorrhages <END> , leading to <START:disease> macular degeneration <END> . <START:disease> PXE <END> is transmitted either as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait and several <START:organism> sporadic cases <END> have been observed. <START:bf> Mutations in the ABCC6 gene <END> have been identified very recently in <START:organism> patients <END> . Here, we report on a large <START:organism> Italian family <END> affected by <START:disease> pseudoxanthoma elasticum <END> for which linkage analysis had pointed to a <START:ggp> region <END> encompassing <START:ggp> markers <END> <START:ggp> D16S3069 <END> - <START:ggp> D16S405 <END> - <START:ggp> D16S3103 <END> ; hemizygosity of <START:ggp> marker <END> <START:ggp> D16S405 <END> allowed us to detect a <START:bf> submicroscopic deletion of at least 900 kb involving ABCC6, ABCC1, and MYH11 <END> . <START:bf> Mutation <END> analysis on the other <START:ggp> allele <END> of the <START:organism> family <END> , as well as on two additional <START:organism> sporadic cases <END> , revealed <START:bf> nonsense (Y227X, R518X, R1164X) and frame-shift (c.960delC) mutations in ABCC6 <END> ( <START:ggp> MRP6 <END> ) further confirming the role of this <START:ggp> multi-drug resistance gene <END> in the etiology of <START:disease> pseudoxanthoma elasticum <END> . Furthermore, clinical re-examination of <START:organism> members <END> of the <START:organism> family <END> harboring the <START:bf> deletion <END> led to the detection of additional features, potentially caused by the <START:bf> deletion of the MYH11 gene <END> . In the course of the analysis five <START:ggp> nonpathogenic variants <END> were found in <START:ggp> ABCC6 <END> : <START:bf> 1233T>C <END> , <START:bf> 1245G>A <END> , <START:bf> 1838 T>G <END> ( <START:bf> V614A <END> ), <START:bf> 1890C>G <END> , and <START:bf> 3506+83C>A <END> .

Identification of <START:bf> connexin43 (alpha1) gap junction gene mutations <END> in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> hypoplastic left heart syndrome <END> by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).
<START:ggp> Gap junction channels <END> formed by the <START:ggp> connexin43 protein <END> are considered to play crucial roles in <START:bf> development <END> and function because they allow the direct <START:bf> cell-to-cell exchange of molecules <END> that mediate multiple <START:bf> signaling events <END> . Previous results have shown that <START:ggp> connexin43 channels <END> are intricately gated by <START:bf> phosphorylation <END> and that disruption of this <START:bf> regulation <END> gives rise to severe <START:disease> heart malformations <END> and <START:bf> defects of laterality <END> in <START:organism> human <END> , <START:organism> chick <END> and <START:organism> frog <END> . Here we report the identification of <START:bf> connexin43 gene mutations <END> that represent a minor population of <START:ggp> connexin43 alleles <END> , which could be reliably detected by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to visualize <START:ggp> normal and mutant DNAs <END> that were separately sequenced. In contrast, sequencing of total <START:ggp> PCR products <END> without DGGE-pre-selection failed to consistently identify these <START:bf> mutations <END> . Forty-six <START:organism> controls <END> and 20 <START:organism> heart transplant recipients <END> were examined in this study. In the latter <START:organism> group <END> , 14 <START:organism> children <END> had <START:disease> hypoplastic left heart syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> HLHS <END> ) in which <START:bf> connexin43 gene defects <END> were detected in eight. The remaining six <START:organism> transplant patients <END> with <START:disease> HLHS <END> and all <START:organism> controls <END> showed <START:bf> no defects <END> . All eight <START:organism> HLHS children <END> with <START:bf> gene defects <END> had the same four <START:bf> substitutions <END> : two that were <START:bf> silent polymorphisms <END> , and two that were <START:bf> missense, replacing arginine codons at positions 362 and 376 with codons for glutamines <END> . All four of these <START:bf> substitutions <END> are identical to the nucleotide sequence of the <START:ggp> connexin43 pseudogene <END> , suggesting the possibility of an <START:bf> illicit recombination <END> . A <START:ggp> breakpoint region <END> was identified <START:ggp> 5' <END> to the <START:ggp> mutation site <END> in a <START:ggp> 63bp domain <END> that is 100% identical in the <START:ggp> gene <END> and <START:ggp> pseudogene <END> . Results from in vitro <START:bf> phosphorylation <END> indicate that the <START:bf> absence of arginines 362 and 376 <END> completely abolishes <START:bf> phosphorylation in the connexin43 channel regulation domain <END> suggesting a possible mechanism for the pathologies associated with <START:disease> HLHS <END> .
<START:disease> Ritscher-Schinzel cranio-cerebello-cardiac (3C) syndrome <END> : report of four new <START:organism> cases <END> and review.
<START:disease> Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome <END> , also known as the <START:disease> 3C syndrome <END> , is a rare, <START:disease> autosomal recessive syndrome <END> characterized by <START:bf> craniofacial, cerebellar, and cardiac anomalies <END> . <START:bf> Cardiac manifestations <END> include <START:disease> ventricular septal defect <END> , <START:disease> atrial septal defect <END> , <START:disease> tetralogy of Fallot <END> , <START:disease> double outlet right ventricle <END> , <START:disease> hypoplastic left heart <END> , <START:disease> aortic stenosis <END> , <START:disease> pulmonic stenosis <END> and other <START:bf> valvular anomalies <END> . <START:disease> Central nervous system anomalies <END> include <START:disease> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> , <START:bf> cerebellar vermis hypoplasia <END> and <START:bf> enlargement of the cisterna magna <END> . <START:disease> Craniofacial abnormalities <END> seen are <START:disease> cleft palate <END> , <START:bf> ocular coloboma <END> , <START:bf> prominent occiput <END> , <START:bf> low-set ears <END> , <START:disease> hypertelorism <END> , <START:bf> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:bf> depressed nasal bridge <END> and <START:disease> micrognathia <END> . <START:disease> Dandy-Walker malformation <END> , <START:bf> posterior fossa cyst <END> , <START:disease> hydrocephalus <END> and <START:disease> congenital heart defect <END> are common <START:bf> malformations <END> that may occur in isolation or as a part of many <START:disease> syndromes <END> . Accurate genetic diagnosis and counseling require detailed analysis of the <START:anatomy> external as well as the internal anatomy <END> and knowledge of the relative frequencies of various <START:bf> malformations <END> in <START:disease> syndromes <END> that may have overlapping <START:bf> clinical signs <END> . We have had the opportunity recently to study four <START:organism> cases <END> of the <START:disease> Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome <END> . A review of all reported <START:organism> cases <END> is presented and an attempt made to define the minimum diagnostic criteria for the <START:disease> Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome <END> . Of the nine <START:bf> craniofacial anomalies <END> commonly reported as a part of the <START:disease> Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome <END> , we consider two i.e., <START:disease> cleft palate <END> and <START:bf> ocular coloboma <END> , to be readily and objectively ascertainable. The other seven <START:bf> craniofacial traits <END> , however, are somewhat subjective, require expert interpretation and are sometimes difficult to ascertain in a <START:organism> newborn <END> or <START:organism> stillborn fetus <END> . These are <START:bf> prominent forehead <END> , <START:bf> prominent occiput <END> , <START:disease> hypertelorism <END> , <START:bf> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:bf> low-set ears <END> , <START:bf> depressed nasal bridge <END> and <START:disease> micrognathia <END> . At least four of these were present in all <START:organism> cases <END> that had a secure diagnosis of the <START:disease> Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome <END> . Thus, the criteria we propose to establish the diagnosis of the <START:disease> Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome <END> in a <START:organism> chromosomally normal sporadic case <END> are the presence of <START:disease> cardiac malformation <END> other than isolated <START:disease> patent ductus arteriosus <END> , <START:bf> cerebellar malformation <END> , and <START:disease> cleft palate <END> or <START:bf> ocular coloboma <END> or four of the following seven findings: <START:bf> prominent forehead <END> , <START:bf> prominent occiput <END> , <START:disease> hypertelorism <END> , <START:bf> down-slanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:bf> low-set ears <END> , <START:bf> depressed nasal bridge <END> , and <START:disease> micrognathia <END> .
Interaction of <START:ggp> alpha(1)-Na,K-ATPase <END> and <START:ggp> Na,K,2Cl-cotransporter genes <END> in <START:organism> human <END> <START:disease> essential hypertension <END> .
<START:disease> Essential hypertension <END> is a <START:disease> common disease <END> the genetic determinants of which have been difficult to unravel because of its clinical heterogeneity and complex, multifactorial, polygenic etiology. Based on our observations that <START:ggp> alpha(1)-Na,K-ATPase <END> ( <START:ggp> ATP1A1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> renal-specific, bumetanide-sensitive Na,K,2Cl-cotransporter <END> ( <START:ggp> NKCC2 <END> ) genes interactively increase susceptibility to <START:disease> hypertension <END> in the <START:organism> Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive (Dahl S) rat model <END> , we investigated whether parallel molecular genetic mechanisms might exist in <START:organism> human <END> <START:disease> essential hypertension <END> in a <START:organism> relatively genetic homogeneous cohort <END> in northern Sardinia. Putative <START:ggp> ATP1A1 <END> - <START:ggp> NKCC2 gene <END> interaction was tested by comparing <START:organism> hypertensive patients <END> ( <START:bf> blood pressure [BP] >165/95 mm Hg <END> ) with <START:organism> normotensive controls <END> age >60 years with <START:bf> BP <140/85 mm Hg <END> . Genotype analysis with <START:ggp> microsatellite markers <END> revealed conformation to Hardy-Weinberg proportions for 6 <START:ggp> alleles <END> of both <START:ggp> ATP1A1 <END> ( <START:ggp> D1S453 <END> ) and <START:ggp> NKCC2 <END> ( <START:ggp> NKCGT7 <END> ) markers, respectively. Two-by-six chi(2) analysis of <START:ggp> alleles <END> identified overrepresentation of <START:ggp> ATP1A1 No. 4 <END> and <START:ggp> NKCC2 No. 4 alleles <END> , respectively, in <START:organism> hypertensives <END> compared with <START:organism> controls <END> . With a <START:bf> qualitative trait <END> framework, single- <START:ggp> gene <END> analysis detected association of both the <START:ggp> ATP1A1 No. 4 allele <END> (P=0.004, chi(2)=8.094, df=1) and the <START:ggp> NKCC2 No. 4 allele <END> (P=0.0002, chi(2)=14.279, df=1) with moderate to severe <START:disease> hypertension <END> . Digenic analysis revealed that <START:ggp> ATP1A1 No. 4 <END> - <START:ggp> NKCC2 No. 4 allele <END> interaction increases susceptibility to <START:disease> hypertension <END> (P<0.0001, chi(2)=22.3, df=1) beyond levels obtained in single- <START:ggp> gene <END> analysis. Analysis was also performed in a <START:bf> quantitative trait <END> framework with BP as the continuous <START:bf> trait <END> parameter. Digenic analysis of <START:ggp> ATP1A1 No. 4 <END> - <START:ggp> NKCC2 No. 4 allele <END> interaction revealed significant association with systolic (1-way ANOVA, P=0.000076) and diastolic (P=0.00099) BP. Interaction was corroborated by 2x2 factorial ANOVA for interaction (systolic BP interaction term, P<0.05, diastolic BP interaction term, P=0.035). The data are compelling that <START:ggp> ATP1A1 <END> and <START:ggp> NKCC2 genes <END> are candidate interacting <START:ggp> hypertension-susceptibility loci <END> in <START:organism> human <END> <START:disease> essential hypertension <END> and affirm <START:ggp> gene <END> interaction as an important genetic mechanism underlying <START:disease> hypertension <END> susceptibility. Although corroboration in other <START:organism> cohorts <END> and identification of <START:bf> functionally significant mutations <END> are imperative next steps, the data provide a <START:bf> genotype <END> -stratification scheme, with 4-fold predictive value (odds ratio, 4.28; 95% confidence interval, 2.29 to 8.0), which could help decipher the complex genetics of <START:disease> essential hypertension <END> .
<START:ggp> Chromosome 17 <END> and the <START:ggp> inducible nitric oxide synthase gene <END> in <START:organism> human <END> <START:disease> essential hypertension <END> .
<START:disease> Essential hypertension <END> is a <START:bf> common multifactorial trait <END> that results in a significantly increased risk for <START:disease> heart attack <END> and <START:disease> stroke <END> . The condition has a genetic basis, although at present the number of <START:ggp> genes <END> is unknown. In order to identify such <START:ggp> genes <END> , we are utilising a linkage scanning approach using <START:ggp> microsatellite markers <END> and affected sibships. Here we provide evidence for the location of at least one <START:ggp> hypertension susceptibility locus <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 17 <END> . Analysis of 177 <START:organism> affected sibpairs <END> gave evidence for significant excess <START:ggp> allele <END> sharing to <START:ggp> D17S949 <END> (SPLINK: P=0.0029; MAPMAKER SIBS: P=0.0033; ASPEX: P=0.0061; GENEHUNTER: P=0.0096; ANALYZE (SIBPAIR): P=0.0025) on <START:ggp> 17q22-24 <END> , with significant <START:ggp> allele <END> sharing also indicated for an additional <START:ggp> marker <END> , <START:ggp> D17S799 <END> (SPLINK: P=0.025; MAPMAKER SIBS: P=0.025) located close to the <START:ggp> centromere <END> . Since these two <START:ggp> genomic regions <END> are well separated, our results indicate that there may be more than one <START:ggp> chromosome 17 locus <END> affecting <START:organism> human <END> <START:anatomy> blood <END> pressure. Moreover, further investigation of this <START:ggp> chromosome <END> , utilizing a <START:bf> polymorphism <END> within the <START:ggp> promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> iNOS candidate gene <END> , <START:ggp> NOS2A <END> , revealed both increased <START:ggp> allele <END> sharing among <START:organism> sibpairs <END> (SPLINK: P=0.02; ASPEX: P=0.00004) and positive association (P=0.034) of <START:ggp> NOS2A <END> to <START:disease> essential hypertension <END> . Hence these results indicate that <START:ggp> chromosome 17 <END> and, more specifically, the <START:ggp> NOS2A gene <END> may play a role in <START:organism> human <END> <START:disease> essential hypertension <END> .
<START:ggp> Quantitative-trait loci <END> influencing <START:anatomy> body <END> -mass index reside on <START:ggp> chromosomes 7 and 13 <END> : the National <START:anatomy> Heart <END> , <START:anatomy> Lung <END> , and <START:anatomy> Blood <END> Institute <START:organism> Family <END> <START:anatomy> Heart <END> Study.
<START:bf> Obesity <END> is a risk factor for many <START:disease> chronic diseases <END> , including <START:disease> glucose intolerance <END> , <START:disease> lipid disorders <END> , <START:disease> hypertension <END> , and <START:disease> coronary heart disease <END> . Even though the <START:anatomy> body <END> -mass index (BMI) is a <START:bf> heterogeneous phenotype <END> reflecting the amount of fat, lean mass, and <START:anatomy> body build <END> , several studies have provided evidence of one or two <START:ggp> major loci <END> contributing to the variation in this complex <START:bf> trait <END> . We sought to identify <START:ggp> loci <END> with potential influence on BMI in the data obtained from National <START:anatomy> Heart <END> , <START:anatomy> Lung <END> , and <START:anatomy> Blood <END> Institute <START:organism> Family <END> <START:anatomy> Heart <END> Study. Two <START:organism> complementary samples <END> were studied: (a) 1,184 <START:organism> subjects <END> in 317 <START:organism> sibships <END> , with 243 <START:ggp> markers <END> typed by the Utah Molecular Genetics Laboratory (UMGL) and (b) 3,027 <START:organism> subjects <END> distributed among 401 <START:organism> three-generation families <END> , with 404 <START:ggp> markers <END> typed by the Mammalian Genotyping Service (MGS). A <START:ggp> genome <END> scan using a variance-components-based linkage approach was performed for each <START:organism> sample <END> , as well as for the <START:organism> combined sample <END> , in which the <START:ggp> markers <END> from each analysis were placed on a common genetic map. There was strong evidence for linkage on <START:ggp> chromosome 7q32.3 <END> in each <START:organism> sample <END> : the maximum multipoint LOD scores were 4.7 (P<10-5) at <START:ggp> marker <END> <START:ggp> GATA43C11 <END> and 3.2 (P=.00007) at <START:ggp> marker <END> <START:ggp> D7S1804 <END> , for the <START:organism> MGS and UMGL samples <END> , respectively. The linkage result is replicated by the consistent evidence from these two <START:organism> complementary subsets <END> . Furthermore, the evidence for linkage was maintained in the <START:organism> combined sample <END> , with a LOD score of 4.9 (P<10-5) for both <START:ggp> markers <END> , which map to the same location. This signal is very near the published location for the <START:ggp> leptin gene <END> , which is the <START:ggp> most prominent candidate gene <END> in this <START:ggp> region <END> . For the <START:organism> combined-sample <END> analysis, evidence of linkage was also found on <START:ggp> chromosome 13q14 <END> , with <START:ggp> D13S257 <END> (LOD score 3.2, P=.00006), and other, weaker signals (LOD scores 1.5-1.9) were found on <START:ggp> chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 14, and 15 <END> .
A <START:ggp> genome <END> -wide scan for <START:disease> coronary heart disease <END> suggests in Indo-Mauritians a <START:ggp> susceptibility locus <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 16p13 <END> and replicates linkage with the <START:disease> metabolic syndrome <END> on <START:ggp> 3q27 <END> .
Prevalence of <START:disease> coronary heart disease <END> ( <START:disease> CHD <END> ), of <START:disease> type 2 diabetes <END> ( <START:disease> T2DM <END> ) and of the <START:disease> metabolic syndrome <END> are in Mauritius amongst the highest in the world. As <START:disease> T2DM <END> and <START:disease> CHD <END> are closely associated and have both a polygenic basis, we conducted a <START:ggp> 10 cM genome <END> scan with 403 <START:ggp> microsatellite markers <END> in 99 <START:organism> independent families <END> of North-Eastern Indian origin including 535 <START:organism> individuals <END> . <START:organism> Families <END> were ascertained through a <START:organism> proband <END> with <START:disease> CHD <END> before 52 years of age and additional <START:organism> sibs <END> with <START:disease> myocardial infarction <END> ( <START:disease> MI <END> ) or <START:disease> T2DM <END> . Model-free two-point and multipoint linkage analysis were performed using the Mapmarker- <START:organism> Sibs <END> (MLS) and maximum-likelihood-binomial (MLB) programs for <START:ggp> autosomal markers <END> and the Aspex program for <START:ggp> chromosome X markers <END> . In a second step, additional <START:ggp> markers <END> were studied to increase the genetic map density in three <START:ggp> regions <END> on <START:ggp> chromosomes 3, 8 and 16 <END> where initial indication for linkage was found. Our data show suggestive linkage with <START:disease> CHD <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 16p13-pter <END> with the MLS statistics at 8.69 cM (LOD = 3.06, P = 0.00017) which partially overlaps with a <START:disease> high pressure <END> ( <START:disease> HBP <END> ) peak. At the same <START:ggp> locus <END> , a nominal indication for linkage with <START:ggp> T2DM <END> was found in 35 large <START:organism> T2DM Pondicherian families <END> also having Indian origin. With respect to <START:ggp> region 8q23 <END> , we found suggestive linkage with <START:disease> T2DM <END> (LOD = 2.55, P = 0.00058) as well as with <START:disease> HBP <END> . On <START:ggp> 3q27 <END> , we replicated previous indication for linkage found in <START:organism> Caucasians <END> (for the <START:disease> metabolic syndrome <END> and for <START:disease> diabetes <END> ) according to the categorized trait for <START:disease> CHD <END> and <START:disease> MI <END> with the MLB statistics (LOD = 2.13, P = 0.0009). The <START:ggp> genome <END> scan also revealed nominal evidence of linkage with <START:disease> CHD <END> on <START:ggp> 10q23 <END> (LOD = 2.06, P = 0.00188). Interestingly, we detected in the same <START:ggp> region <END> overlapping linkages with three <START:ggp> QTLs <END> : age of onset of <START:disease> CHD <END> (LOD = 2.03), <START:ched> HDL cholesterol <END> (LOD = 1.48) and <START:ched> LDL <END> / <START:ched> HDL <END> ratio (LOD = 1.34). Ordered-subset analysis based on <START:organism> family <END> <START:anatomy> body <END> mass index ranking replicated finding on <START:ggp> 2q37 <END> for <START:disease> T2DM <END> (at <START:ggp> Calpain 10 locus <END> ). These results show the first evidence for <START:ggp> susceptibility loci <END> that predispose to <START:disease> CHD <END> , <START:disease> T2DM <END> and <START:disease> HBP <END> in the context of the <START:disease> metabolic syndrome <END> .
<START:bf> CFC1 mutations <END> in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> transposition of the great arteries <END> and <START:disease> double-outlet right ventricle <END> .
Recent investigations identified <START:bf> heterozygous CFC1 mutations <END> in <START:organism> subjects <END> with <START:disease> heterotaxy syndrome <END> , all of whom had <START:disease> congenital cardiac malformations <END> , including <START:disease> malposition of the great arteries <END> . We hypothesized that a <START:organism> subset <END> of <START:organism> patients <END> with similar types of <START:disease> congenital heart disease <END> ---namely, <START:disease> transposition of the great arteries <END> and <START:disease> double-outlet right ventricle <END> , in the <START:bf> absence of laterality defects <END> ---would also have <START:bf> CFC1 mutations <END> . Our analysis of the <START:ggp> CFC1 gene <END> in <START:organism> patients <END> with these <START:disease> cardiac disorders <END> identified two <START:bf> disease-related mutations <END> in 86 <START:organism> patients <END> . The present study identifies the first <START:bf> autosomal single-gene defect <END> for these <START:disease> cardiac malformations <END> and indicates that some <START:organism> cases <END> of <START:disease> transposition of the great arteries <END> and <START:disease> double-outlet right ventricle <END> can share a common genetic etiology with <START:disease> heterotaxy syndrome <END> . In addition, these results demonstrate that the <START:bf> molecular pathway <END> involving <START:ggp> CFC1 <END> plays a critical role in <START:bf> normal and abnormal cardiovascular development <END> .
Malignancy of recurrent, early-onset <START:disease> major depression <END> : a <START:organism> family <END> study.
Coordinated efforts to identify <START:ggp> susceptibility genes <END> for unipolar <START:disease> major depressive disorder <END> ( <START:disease> MDD <END> ) and <START:disease> related disorders <END> are now underway. These studies have focused on recurrent, early-onset <START:disease> MDD <END> (RE- <START:disease> MDD <END> ), the most heritable form of this <START:disease> disorder <END> . The goal of this study was to characterize the burden of <START:disease> MDD <END> and other <START:disease> mood disorders <END> , <START:disease> comorbid mental disorders <END> , and excess mortality in <START:organism> RE-MDD families <END> . A total of 81 <START:organism> families <END> were identified through <START:organism> probands <END> over the age of 18, who met criteria for recurrent (> or = 2 episodes), early-onset (< or = 25 years), nonpsychotic, unipolar <START:disease> MDD <END> (RE- <START:disease> MDD <END> ), and included 407 <START:organism> first-degree relatives <END> and 835 <START:organism> extended relatives <END> . Psychiatric diagnoses for <START:organism> probands <END> and their <START:organism> family members <END> who provided <START:anatomy> blood <END> samples were formulated from structured personal interviews, structured <START:organism> family <END> history assessments, and available medical records. The remaining <START:organism> family members <END> who participated and those who were deceased were evaluated through the <START:organism> family <END> history method augmented by available medical records. Best estimate diagnoses were made during a consensus conference according to established diagnostic criteria. Approximately half of the <START:organism> first-degree relatives <END> and a quarter of <START:organism> extended relatives <END> of <START:organism> RE-MDD probands <END> suffered from at least one <START:disease> mood disorder <END> , typically <START:disease> MDD <END> . As commonly observed for other <START:disease> oligogenic, multifactorial disorders <END> , the severity of <START:disease> MDD <END> reflected by age at onset and number of <START:bf> episodes <END> attenuated with increasing familial/genetic distance from the <START:organism> proband <END> . A substantial fraction of <START:organism> RE-MDD probands <END> and their <START:organism> first-degree relatives <END> met diagnostic criteria for additional <START:disease> psychiatric disorders <END> that include <START:bf> prominent disturbances of mood <END> . The <START:organism> deceased relatives <END> of <START:organism> RE-MDD probands <END> died at a median age that was 8 years earlier than for the <START:organism> local population <END> ; over 40% died before reaching age 65. These differences in mortality statistics resulted from a shift toward younger ages at <START:bf> death <END> across the lifespan, including a fivefold increase in the proportion of <START:organism> individuals <END> who died in the first year of life. Several-fold increases in the proportion of <START:bf> deaths <END> by suicide, homicide, and <START:disease> liver disease <END> were observed among the <START:organism> relatives <END> of <START:organism> RE-MDD probands <END> . However, the rank order of the three most common causes of <START:bf> death <END> - <START:disease> heart disease <END> , <START:disease> cancer <END> , and <START:disease> stroke <END> -remained unchanged and differences in the proportions of <START:bf> deaths <END> from the remaining causes were small. RE- <START:disease> MDD <END> is a strongly familial condition with a high rate of psychiatric comorbidity, whose malignant effects have a significant negative impact on the health and <START:bf> longevity <END> of <START:organism> patients <END> and their <START:organism> family members <END> .
<START:ched> Cholesterol <END> and development: the <START:disease> RSH ("Smith-Lemli-Opitz") syndrome <END> and related conditions.
The half-century of lipophobia in the United States may be abating with some return of sanity on the discussion of health and dietary fat [ <START:organism> Taubes <END> , 2001]. The <START:organism> youngest victims <END> of this collective, decades long madness are those <START:organism> infants <END> deprived for one reason or another of <START:anatomy> breast milk <END> . They are unable to speak for themselves at a time of greatest need for <START:ched> cholesterol <END> during <START:bf> growth <END> , the most critical period of <START:bf> myelination of central and peripheral nervous system <END> , <START:bf> formation of bone and bile, and of every steroid hormone <END> . Some of the commercial formulas they are fed contain only 1 or 2 mg of <START:ched> cholesterol <END> per 100 g edible portion contrasted with almost 14 mg in <START:anatomy> breast milk <END> . One can only hope that the confidence in their endogenous ability to synthesize sufficient amounts of <START:ched> cholesterol <END> is not misplaced. Pediatric pathology has learned that when this endogenous ability fails during <START:bf> embryogenesis <END> on the basis of <START:bf> mutations <END> in the <START:bf> postsqualene biosynthesis of cholesterol <END> , a startling variety of developmental pathology may present itself ranging from lethal forms of <START:bf> "idiopathic" hydrops <END> , <START:disease> microcephaly <END> with <START:disease> cerebral dysgenesis <END> and <START:bf> dysmyelinization <END> , <START:disease> agenesis of corpus callosum <END> , <START:disease> cerebellar vermis dysgenesis <END> , <START:disease> cataracts <END> , <START:disease> cleft palate <END> , many different forms of <START:disease> congenital heart defect <END> , <START:disease> pyloric stenosis <END> and/or <START:disease> Hirschsprung dysganglionosis <END> , <START:disease> adrenal (cortical) insufficiency <END> , <START:disease> cholestatic liver disease <END> , <START:disease> limb malformations <END> , and <START:disease> genital ambiguity <END> in <START:organism> genetic males <END> . Population genetic considerations suggest a hypothetical birth prevalence of the <START:disease> RSH (so-called Smith-Lemli-Opitz) syndrome <END> , the commonest of these <START:bf> Garrodian errors of cholesterol biosynthesis <END> , of 1/2500; since only about 1/15,000 to 1/20,000 <START:organism> homozygotes <END> are <START:bf> liveborn <END> and biochemically confirmed, over 80% prenatal or perinatal mortality must occur and deserves the most discerning of services from <START:organism> birth attendants <END> , <START:organism> perinatologists <END> , <START:organism> neonatologists <END> , and <START:organism> fetal/pediatric pathologists <END> . An easy, reliable, economical biochemical test for the presence of <START:ched> 7-dehydrocholesterol <END> is available and the <START:bf> commonest mutation <END> , the <START:bf> IVS8-1G-->C mutation <END> , is quickly and reliably tested for molecularly. Thus, the successful diagnosis, even after <START:bf> death <END> , will contribute substantially to correct genetic counseling, <START:organism> carrier <END> detection, prenatal diagnosis, and treatment in those known to be affected prenatally andplanned to be <START:bf> liveborn <END> . Thus, developmental pathology plays an integral, vital role in preventive medicine.
<START:bf> Chromosome 3 duplication q21 <END> leads to <START:bf> qter deletion p25 <END> leads to <START:disease> pter syndrome <END> in <START:organism> children <END> of <START:organism> carriers <END> of a <START:bf> pericentric inversion inv(3) <END> ( <START:bf> p25q21 <END> ).
Close phenotypic similarity between two <START:organism> cases <END> carrying a <START:bf> rec(3) dup q,inv(3) <END> ( <START:bf> p25q21 <END> ), 12 additional <START:organism> infants <END> from the same <START:organism> inv (3)(p25q21) kindred <END> who lived less than 1 year, and eight <START:organism> cases <END> studied in other medical centers has led us to postulate the existence of a distinct <START:disease> chromosome 3 duplication-deletion syndrome <END> . In the presence of <START:bf> trisomy for (3)q21 <END> leads to <START:ggp> qter <END> and <START:bf> monosomy for (3)p25 <END> leads to <START:ggp> pter <END> , the <START:bf> facial dysmorphy <END> is unique: a <START:bf> distorted head shape <END> due to <START:anatomy> irregular cranial sutures <END> , <START:bf> thick low eyebrows <END> , <START:bf> long eyelashes <END> , <START:bf> persistent lanugo <END> , <START:bf> distended veins on the scalp <END> , <START:disease> hypertelorism <END> , <START:bf> oblique palpebral fissures <END> , a <START:bf> very short nose with a broad depressed bridge <END> and <START:bf> anteverted nares <END> , <START:bf> protruding maxilla <END> , <START:bf> thin upper lip <END> , <START:disease> micrognathia <END> , <START:bf> low-set ears <END> , and a <START:bf> short webbed neck <END> . <START:disease> Port-wine stains <END> , <START:disease> congenital glaucoma <END> , <START:bf> cloudy corneas <END> , <START:disease> cleft palate <END> and <START:disease> harelip <END> also occur frequently. Each <START:organism> infant <END> has <START:bf> difficulty sucking and swallowing <END> . <START:bf> Congenital anomalies of the cardiovascular system, of midgut rotation, and of the urogenital system <END> are noted for the <START:organism> infants <END> who died neonatally. Most frequent is a <START:disease> ventricular septal defect <END> , followed by <START:disease> atrial septal defect <END> , <START:disease> patent ductus arteriosus <END> , <START:disease> patent foramen ovale <END> , and <START:disease> coarctation of the aorta <END> . <START:disease> Omphalocele <END> , <START:disease> umbilical hernia <END> , <START:bf> hyperplastic kidneys <END> , <START:disease> polycystic kidneys <END> , <START:disease> double ureter <END> , <START:bf> hydro-ureter <END> , <START:disease> hydronephrosis <END> , and <START:disease> undescended testes <END> often occur. The <START:anatomy> extremities <END> are short in proportion to the length of the <START:anatomy> trunk <END> . <START:bf> Clinodactyly <END> , <START:disease> coxa valga <END> , <START:disease> talipes <END> , and <START:disease> spina bifida <END> are frequently observed.
Presence of the <START:ggp> d8/17 B-cell marker <END> in <START:organism> children <END> with <START:disease> rheumatic fever <END> in Israel.
A genetic predisoposition to <START:disease> rheumatic fever <END> ( <START:disease> RF <END> ) has been suspected by several <START:organism> researchers <END> . Ten years ago, using <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> , the <START:ggp> B-cell alloantigen <END> <START:ggp> D8/17 <END> was identified in 90-100% of <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> RF <END> . The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the <START:ggp> marker <END> is found in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> RF <END> in Israel, where the <START:organism> population <END> is made up of diverse <START:organism> ethnic groups <END> . The Schneider Children's Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Israel, was the setting for this study. The <START:organism> population <END> included 22 <START:organism> children <END> with <START:disease> RF <END> and nine <START:organism> ethnically matched, disease-free individuals <END> who served as <START:organism> controls <END> . Each of the <START:organism> patients <END> and <START:organism> controls <END> were tested for the <START:ggp> B-cell antigen <END> with flow cytometry assay by using <START:ggp> monoclonal antibodies <END> . The main outcome measure was the difference in the presence of the <START:ggp> D8/17 <END> <START:ggp> B-cell marker <END> between the <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> RF <END> and the <START:organism> controls <END> . The mean percentage of <START:anatomy> B-cells <END> expressing the <START:ggp> marker <END> was 11.5 +/- 2.9 in the <START:organism> patients <END> and 4.24 +/- 2.7 in the <START:organism> controls <END> (P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of the <START:ggp> marker <END> by ethnic origin. The present results support earlier studies suggesting that <START:ggp> D8/17 <END> is a <START:ggp> disease-specific marker <END> with a world-wide distribution which may potentially serve as an additional diagnostic tool in <START:organism> patients <END> with suspected <START:disease> RF <END> .
Grouping of <START:disease> multiple-lentigines/LEOPARD and Noonan syndromes <END> on the <START:ggp> PTPN11 gene <END> .
<START:disease> Multiple-lentigines (ML)/LEOPARD (multiple lentigines, electrocardiographic-conduction abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary stenosis, abnormal genitalia, retardation of growth, and sensorineural deafness) syndrome <END> is an <START:bf> autosomal dominant condition <END> --characterized by <START:disease> lentigines <END> and <START:disease> caf au lait spots <END> , <START:bf> facial anomalies <END> , <START:bf> cardiac defects <END> --that shares several clinical features with <START:disease> Noonan syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> NS <END> ). We screened nine <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> ML/LEOPARD syndrome <END> (including a <START:organism> mother-daughter pair <END> ) and two <START:organism> children <END> with <START:disease> NS <END> who had multiple <START:disease> caf au lait spots <END> , for <START:bf> mutations in the NS gene, PTPN11 <END> , and found, in 10 of 11 <START:organism> patients <END> , one of two new <START:bf> missense mutations, in exon 7 or exon 12 <END> . Both <START:bf> mutations <END> affect the <START:ggp> PTPN11 phosphotyrosine phosphatase domain <END> , which is involved in <30% of the <START:bf> NS PTPN11 mutations <END> . The study demonstrates that <START:disease> ML/LEOPARD syndrome <END> and <START:disease> NS <END> are <START:bf> allelic disorders <END> . The detected <START:bf> mutations <END> suggest that distinct molecular and pathogenetic mechanisms cause the <START:bf> peculiar cutaneous manifestations <END> of the <START:disease> ML/LEOPARD-syndrome subtype of NS <END> .
The role of <START:disease> hyperhomocysteinemia <END> and <START:bf> methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation <END> in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> retinal artery occlusion <END> .
<START:disease> Hyperhomocysteinemia <END> has been established as an important risk factor for <START:disease> cardiovascular diseases <END> . The aim of the present study was to investigate whether <START:disease> hyperhomocysteinemia <END> and/or homozygosity for the <START:bf> methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation <END> are associated with an increased risk for <START:disease> retinal artery occlusion <END> ( <START:disease> RAO <END> ).
Assessment and evaluation of <START:disease> hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies <END> with autonomic and neurophysiological examinations.
The five different types of the rare <START:disease> hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies <END> ( <START:disease> HSAN <END> ) are classified by their mode of <START:bf> inheritance <END> , <START:bf> pathology <END> , natural history, <START:bf> biochemical, neurophysiologic and autonomic abnormalities <END> . Clinically, the different types of <START:disease> HSANs <END> can be identified by a detailed history and examination and 'bedside' tests of <START:bf> sympathetic or parasympathetic function <END> such as <START:bf> active standing, <END> <START:bf> metronomic breathing <END> or the <START:bf> Valsalva maneuver <END> , <START:bf> sensory and motor nerve conduction <END> studies, quantitative sensory testing of <START:bf> thermal and vibratory perception <END> , and the analysis of <START:bf> sudomotor function <END> by recordings of the <START:bf> sympathetic skin response <END> ( <START:bf> SSR <END> ) or the <START:bf> sweat output <END> during quantitative <START:bf> sudomotor axon reflex <END> testing (QSART). The slowly progressive, symmetrical <START:disease> HSAN type I <END> manifests between the second and fourth decade with <START:bf> ulcers or mutilations of the lower extremities <END> , <START:bf> low normal sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities <END> , but <START:bf> abnormal warm, cold and heat pain perception <END> and <START:disease> distal anhidrosis <END> . In <START:disease> HSAN type II <END> , <START:disease> symptoms <END> occur already in infancy, <START:bf> trophic alterations <END> affect <START:anatomy> fingers <END> and <START:anatomy> toes <END> . There are <START:disease> acral anhidrosis <END> and various <START:bf> autonomic dysfunctions <END> such as <START:disease> tonic pupils <END> , <START:bf> eating and swallowing difficulties <END> , <START:bf> constipation <END> , <START:bf> episodic fever <END> , <START:bf> profound hypotonia <END> and <START:bf> episodes of apnea <END> . <START:bf> Sensory perception <END> is severely impaired and accounts for <START:bf> elevated vibratory but also thermal perception thresholds <END> . <START:bf> Sensory nerve conduction <END> is highly abnormal while <START:bf> motor nerve conduction <END> studies are almost normal. <START:disease> Type III <END> , the <START:disease> autosomal recessive familial dysautonomia <END> ( <START:disease> FD <END> ), is the most common of the <START:disease> HSANs <END> . <START:disease> FD <END> is characterized by <START:bf> pronounced autonomic, primarily sympathetic dysregulation <END> with severe <START:disease> orthostatic hypotension <END> , <START:bf> repeated episodes of autonomic crises with excessive arterial hypertension <END> , <START:bf> profuse sweating <END> , <START:bf> skin blotching <END> , <START:bf> puffy hands <END> and <START:bf> behavioral abnormalities <END> . <START:disease> FD <END> manifests only in <START:organism> children <END> of <START:organism> Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry <END> . Cardinal findings are <START:bf> diminished deep tendon reflexes <END> , <START:bf> absence of overflow tears <END> , <START:bf> absence of fungi-form papillae of the tongue <END> and of <START:bf> axon flare response following intradermal histamine injection <END> . Thermal and vibratory testing show <START:bf> pronounced impairment of temperature and pain but also of vibratory perception <END> . <START:organism> Children <END> with <START:disease> HSAN IV <END> , ' <START:bf> congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis <END> ' experience <START:bf> repeated episodes of high fevers during high environmental temperature <END> due to <START:disease> anhidrosis <END> . The <START:disease> anhidrosis <END> of the <START:bf> hyperkeratotic skin <END> accounts for <START:bf> absence of the SSR <END> or <START:bf> lack of sweat output during QSART <END> . The <START:organism> patients <END> ' <START:bf> insensitivity to superficial as well as deep, visceral pain <END> can be demonstrated e. g. by quantitative heat pain testing. <START:organism> Patients <END> develop <START:bf> severe mutilations <END> e. g. of the <START:anatomy> tip of their tongue <END> , they might have <START:bf> severe burn injuries <END> and <START:bf> multiple, unnoticed fractures with neuropathic joints <END> . <START:organism> Children <END> with the very rare <START:disease> HSAN type V <END> respond normally to tactile, vibratory or thermal stimuli, but have a <START:bf> selective loss of pain perception <END> with otherwise normal neurological examination. Painful stimuli reveal no signs of discomfort.
Cardiovascular consequences of <START:bf> early-onset growth hormone excess <END> .
<START:disease> Acromegaly <END> has relevant effects on the <START:anatomy> cardiovascular system <END> , but few data deal with the early effects of <START:bf> GH and IGF-I excess <END> . To study the early stage of acromegalic <START:disease> cardiomyopathy <END> and give indirect evidence of the mechanisms underlying <START:ggp> GH <END> and <START:ggp> IGF-I <END> action on the <START:anatomy> human heart <END> , 25 <START:organism> patients <END> with uncomplicated <START:disease> acromegaly <END> [15 <START:organism> young subjects <END> with <START:disease> short-term (< or =5 yr) disease <END> and 10 with <START:disease> long-term (>5 yr) disease <END> ] and 25 <START:organism> sex- and age-matched controls <END> were studied. Cardiovascular risk parameters were studied by standard methods; <START:bf> cardiac morphology <END> by M-mode and Doppler echocardiography, cardiac function at rest and at peak exercise by equilibrium radionuclide angiography, and <START:disease> vascular disease <END> at common <START:anatomy> carotid arteries <END> by Doppler ultrasonography. In the <START:organism> patient group <END> these measurements were repeated after 6 months of treatment with <START:ched> octreotide-LAR <END> (20-40 mg, im, every 28 d). <START:ched> Glucose <END> , <START:ggp> glycosylated hemoglobin <END> , <START:ggp> insulin <END> , <START:ched> low density lipoprotein cholesterol <END> , <START:ched> triglycerides <END> , and <START:ggp> fibrinogen <END> levels were higher, and <START:ched> high density lipoprotein cholesterol <END> levels were lower in <START:organism> acromegalic patients <END> than in <START:organism> controls <END> . Resting <START:anatomy> blood <END> pressure was similar in <START:organism> patients <END> and <START:organism> controls <END> , whereas <START:anatomy> heart <END> rate at rest and systolic <START:anatomy> blood <END> pressure at peak exercise were higher in the <START:organism> patients <END> . The left ventricular mass index was higher in <START:organism> acromegalic patients <END> than in <START:organism> controls <END> (123.3 +/- 8.9 vs. 81.5 +/- 4.3 g/m(2); P < 0.001); seven <START:organism> patients <END> had <START:disease> left ventricular hypertrophy <END> . Diastolic function was similar in the two <START:organism> groups <END> . The ejection fraction at rest, but not at peak exercise, was significantly increased in the <START:organism> patients <END> compared with <START:organism> controls <END> . As a consequence the exercise-induced changes in the ejection fraction were lower in <START:organism> patients <END> than <START:organism> controls <END> (8.7 +/- 1.1% vs. 21.9 +/- 3.5%; P < 0.001). At <START:anatomy> common carotid <END> ultrasonography, <START:organism> young patients <END> with <START:disease> acromegaly <END> had <START:bf> increased diastolic peak velocity <END> and <START:bf> increased intima media thickness <END> , even if neither <START:organism> patient <END> nor <START:organism> controls <END> had <START:bf> atherosclerotic plaques <END> . Six months after <START:ched> OCT-LAR <END> treatment, <START:ggp> GH <END> and <START:ggp> IGF-I <END> levels remarkably decreased in all <START:organism> patients <END> ; 8 (53.3%) achieved <START:disease> disease <END> control. <START:ggp> Insulin <END> , total <START:ched> cholesterol <END> , and <START:ggp> fibrinogen <END> levels reduced, whereas <START:ched> high density lipoprotein cholesterol <END> levels increased. Both at rest and at peak exercise, <START:anatomy> heart <END> rate significantly decreased, whereas systolic and diastolic <START:anatomy> blood <END> pressures did not change. The left ventricular mass index was significantly reduced, but it was still higher than the <START:organism> control <END> value (101.6 +/- 3.5 g/m(2); P < 0.01). The left ventricular ejection fraction at rest was significantly reduced, but its response at peak exercise was increased (16.3 +/- 2.4%), becoming similar to the <START:organism> control <END> value. At <START:anatomy> common carotids <END> , the <START:bf> intima media thickness of right and left arteries <END> was significantly reduced as was the diastolic peak velocity without any change in systolic peak velocity. <START:bf> Short-term GH excess <END> , despite causing <START:bf> enhanced cardiac performance at rest <END> , reduces cardiac performance on effort and impairs <START:bf> vascular morphology <END> . These deleterious effects of early-onset <START:disease> acromegaly <END> are ameliorated by suppressing <START:ggp> GH <END> / <START:ggp> IGF-I <END> levels for 6 months.
<START:organism> Pax3-FKHR knock-in mice <END> show <START:bf> developmental aberrations <END> but do not develop <START:disease> tumors <END> .
<START:disease> Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma <END> is a <START:disease> pediatric disease <END> specified by the <START:bf> recurrent chromosome translocations <END> <START:bf> t(2;13) <END> and <START:bf> t(1;13) <END> . These <START:bf> translocations <END> result in the formation of the <START:ggp> PAX3-FKHR <END> and <START:ggp> PAX7-FKHR <END> <START:ggp> fusion genes <END> , which are thought to play a causal role in the genesis of this <START:disease> disease <END> . Although <START:ggp> PAX3-FKHR <END> exhibits <START:bf> transforming <END> activity in <START:anatomy> immortalized fibroblast cell lines <END> , a direct role of this <START:ggp> fusion protein <END> in <START:bf> tumorigenesis <END> in vivo has not been shown. We determined whether <START:bf> expression of Pax3-FKHR <END> in the <START:anatomy> mouse germ line <END> would render these <START:organism> animals <END> prone to the development of <START:disease> rhabdomyosarcomas <END> . By targeting <START:ggp> FKHR cDNA <END> sequences into the <START:ggp> Pax3 locus <END> of <START:anatomy> embryonic stem cells <END> , we used these <START:anatomy> cells <END> to generate <START:organism> mice <END> carrying a <START:ggp> Pax3-FKHR knock-in allele <END> . Despite <START:bf> low expression of the knock-in allele <END> , <START:organism> heterozygous offspring <END> of <START:organism> Pax3-FKHR chimeric mice <END> showed <START:bf> developmental abnormalities <END> . These included <START:bf> intraventricular septum defects <END> , <START:bf> tricuspid valve insufficiency <END> , and <START:bf> diaphragm defects <END> , which caused <START:disease> congestive heart failure <END> leading to <START:bf> perinatal death <END> . In addition, <START:organism> Pax3-FKHR heterozygous offspring <END> displayed <START:bf> malformations of some but not all hypaxial muscles <END> . However, neither <START:organism> newborn heterozygous pups <END> nor their <START:organism> chimeric parents <END> showed any signs of <START:bf> malignancy <END> . We conclude that the <START:ggp> Pax3-FKHR allele <END> causes <START:bf> lethal developmental defects <END> in <START:organism> knock-in mice <END> but might be insufficient to cause <START:disease> muscle tumors <END> .
<START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> --the story of Overture and Octave.
At the American College of Cardiology in March two major trials were presented. The publicity surrounding the two could not have been more different. The LIFE demonstrated clear superiority of <START:ched> losartan <END> -based therapy over <START:ched> atenolol <END> -based therapy for the treatment of <START:disease> hypertension <END> . It was published the same week in the Lancet and received major press coverage all over the world. The OVERTURE ( <START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> Versus <START:ched> Enalapril <END> Randomized Trial of Utility in Reducing Events) study in contrast received a subdued reception, very little publicity and is yet to be published. 5770 <START:organism> NYHA class II-IV heart failure patients <END> ( <START:bf> LVEF<or=30% <END> , recent <START:disease> heart failure <END> hospital admission) were randomised and uptitrated to either 10 mg BD of <START:ched> Enalapril <END> or 40 mg once a day <START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> . The primary end-point of all cause mortality or <START:disease> heart failure <END> related hospitalisation did not differ significantly: 914/2884 for <START:ched> Enalapril <END> and 914/2886 for <START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> (hazard ratio 0.94, CI's 0.86-1.03, P=0.187). Mortality was also similar: 509 for <START:ched> Enalapril <END> and 477 for <START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> (hazard ratio 0.94, CI's 0.83-1.07, P=0.339). <START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> was as good as <START:ched> Enalapril <END> but not better. The worrying trend was however, that <START:disease> angioedema <END> was more common with <START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> ; 24 (0.8%) versus 14 <START:organism> cases <END> (0.5%). The OCTAVE ( <START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> Cardiovascular Treatment Assessment Versus <START:ched> Enalapril <END> ) study was also presented at this time. 25,267 <START:organism> hypertensives <END> were randomised to <START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> or <START:ched> enalapril <END> and a difference of approximately 3 mmHg in favour of <START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> was seen. Significantly more cases of <START:disease> angioedema <END> were seen with <START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> , 274 (2.17%) compared to 86 (0.68%) with <START:ched> enalapril <END> . Overall <START:bf> death <END> rates were similar, 0.18% for <START:ched> enalapril <END> and 0.15% for <START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> . All <START:bf> adverse events <END> were similar, 51.0% for <START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> and 50.4% for <START:ched> enalapril <END> . The rates of <START:disease> angioedema <END> were much higher in <START:organism> blacks <END> , 5.54% for <START:ched> Ompatrilat <END> and 1.62% for <START:ched> enalapril <END> and for <START:organism> smokers <END> , 3.93% for <START:ched> Omapatrilat <END> and 0.81% for <START:ched> enalapril <END> . We were left with a <START:ched> drug <END> that was, for <START:disease> heart failure <END> , not superior to an <START:ched> ACE inhibitor <END> already off patent, and, as an anti- <START:disease> hypertensive <END> , with an <START:disease> angioedema <END> rate more than double that of an <START:ched> ACE inhibitor <END> in a large head to head comparison. The medical community will be watching to make sure these data are published in full in the medical literature in a timely fashion, in the order of end-points specified in the protocol and with appropriate emphasis on the logical points of presentation.
Interaction between smoking and the <START:bf> stromelysin-1 (MMP3) gene 5A/6A promoter polymorphism <END> and risk of <START:disease> coronary heart disease <END> in <START:organism> healthy men <END> .
Smoking is a major risk factor for <START:disease> coronary heart disease <END> ( <START:disease> CHD <END> ), but this risk may be modified by an <START:ggp> individual's genotype <END> . A common functional <START:bf> 5A/6A polymorphism <END> in the <START:ggp> promoter <END> of the <START:ggp> stromelysin-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> matrix metalloproteinase 3 <END> , <START:ggp> MMP3 <END> ) gene has been identified. The <START:ggp> 6A allele <END> has been consistently associated with faster progression of angiographically determined <START:disease> CHD <END> , while the <START:ggp> 5A allele <END> has recently been associated with risk of <START:disease> acute myocardial infarction <END> ( <START:disease> MI <END> ) in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> unstable angina <END> . To date there has been no prospective study of the relationship of this <START:bf> genotype <END> to <START:disease> CHD <END> risk in <START:organism> smokers <END> and <START:organism> non-smokers <END> . <START:ggp> DNA <END> was available from 2,743 <START:organism> middle-aged men <END> , free of <START:disease> CHD <END> at baseline, recruited through nine general practices in the UK for prospective surveillance. To date there have been almost 24,000 <START:organism> person <END> -years of follow-up with 125 <START:disease> CHD <END> events (fatal and non-fatal <START:disease> MI <END> , <START:bf> sudden coronary death <END> , need for <START:anatomy> coronary artery <END> surgery or new <START:bf> major ECG Q-wave abnormality <END> ). <START:organism> Men <END> with events were each matched for age, practice and <START:ched> cholesterol <END> level with three <START:organism> healthy men <END> . Smoking habit was determined by questionnaire. <START:bf> 5A/6A genotype <END> was determined using a heteroduplex generator method. Associations between <START:bf> genotype <END> and <START:disease> disease <END> outcome, according to smoking status, were assessed using conditional logistic regression. Overall, current smoking was associated with a relative risk (RR) of 1.99 (95% CI 1.30-3.06) as compared with <START:organism> never-smokers <END> and <START:organism> ex-smokers <END> combined (p&0.002). In <START:organism> non-smoking men <END> , and after adjustment for conventional risk factors, compared with the <START:organism> 5A5A group <END> , the RR was 1.37 (0.64-2.94) in those with the <START:bf> genotype 5A6A <END> and 3.02 (1.38-6.61) in those with the <START:bf> genotype 6A6A <END> . Smoking increased risk 1.4 fold in the <START:organism> 5A6A group <END> to 1.91 (1.84-4.36), by 1.3 fold in the <START:organism> 6A6A group <END> to 4.01 (1.57-10.24), but by 3.81 fold (1.54-9.40) in the <START:organism> 5A5A group <END> (smoking- <START:bf> genotype <END> interaction p = 0.01). The data indicate a key role for <START:ggp> stromelysin <END> in the <START:bf> atherosclerotic process <END> . <START:organism> Men <END> with the <START:bf> stromelysin genotype 5A5A <END> represent 29% of the <START:organism> general population <END> , and their high risk, if smokers, provides a further strong argument for smoking avoidance.
<START:bf> Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion <END> and phenotypic features in 30 <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:bf> conotruncal heart defects <END> .
This report describes the <START:bf> dysmorphic features <END> and frequency of <START:bf> 22q11.2 deletion <END> ( <START:bf> del22q11 <END> ) in 30 <START:organism> Turkish patients <END> with <START:bf> conotruncal heart defects <END> ( <START:bf> CTHDs <END> ). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed <START:bf> deletions in the 22q11.2 region <END> in nine (30%) <START:organism> individuals <END> . The <START:bf> CTHDs <END> in this <START:organism> group <END> were <START:disease> tetralogy of Fallot <END> (four <START:organism> cases <END> ), <START:disease> double-outlet right ventricle <END> ( <START:disease> DORV <END> ) (two <START:organism> cases <END> ), <START:disease> transposition of great arteries <END> (two <START:organism> cases <END> ), and <START:disease> ventricular septal defect <END> ( <START:disease> VSD <END> ) associated with other <START:bf> CTHDs <END> (one <START:organism> case <END> ). The frequency of <START:bf> del22q11 <END> in the study <START:organism> group <END> was relatively high because many of the <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:bf> dysmorphic findings <END> also had <START:disease> cardiac anomalies <END> involving the <START:anatomy> pulmonary artery <END> , <START:anatomy> ductus arteriosus <END> , or the <START:anatomy> aortic arch <END> and its <START:anatomy> main branches <END> . Twenty of the 30 <START:organism> patients <END> exhibited several <START:bf> dysmorphic findings <END> . Two of the nine <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:bf> del22q11 <END> exhibited <START:bf> no apparent dysmorphic features <END> other than <START:bf> sacral dimple <END> . Interestingly, one of the <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:bf> del22q11 <END> had a phenotypic appearance similar to that seen in <START:disease> oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum <END> ( <START:disease> OAVS <END> ). This <START:organism> individual <END> had <START:bf> left microtia <END> , <START:bf> atresia of the external meatus <END> , <START:bf> mandibular asymmetry <END> , and <START:bf> peripheral facial nerve paralysis <END> . His <START:bf> mental development <END> was normal and there were <START:bf> no abnormalities on ophthalmological examination <END> . The <START:bf> CTHDs <END> in this <START:organism> patient <END> were <START:bf> situs inversus <END> <START:disease> dextrocardia <END> , <START:disease> DORV <END> , <START:disease> pulmonary stenosis <END> , and <START:disease> VSD <END> . Radiographs of this <START:organism> patient <END> showed <START:disease> platybasia <END> , <START:bf> complete fusion of C2-C3 <END> , and <START:bf> posterior fusion of the T1-T2 vertebrae <END> . This particular <START:organism> case <END> indicates that the <START:bf> phenotypic features <END> of <START:bf> del22q11 <END> and <START:disease> OAVS <END> may overlap.
<START:bf> KCNQ1 gain-of-function mutation <END> in <START:disease> familial atrial fibrillation <END> .
<START:disease> Atrial fibrillation <END> ( <START:disease> AF <END> ) is a common <START:disease> cardiac arrhythmia <END> whose molecular etiology is poorly understood. We studied a <START:organism> family <END> with hereditary persistent <START:disease> AF <END> and identified the <START:bf> causative mutation (S140G) in the KCNQ1 <END> ( <START:ggp> KvLQT1 <END> ) gene on <START:ggp> chromosome 11p15.5 <END> . The <START:ggp> KCNQ1 gene <END> encodes the <START:ggp> pore-forming alpha subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> cardiac I(Ks) channel <END> ( <START:ggp> KCNQ1/KCNE1 <END> ), the <START:ggp> KCNQ1/KCNE2 <END> and the <START:ggp> KCNQ1/KCNE3 <END> <START:ggp> potassium channels <END> . Functional analysis of the <START:bf> S140G mutant <END> revealed a gain-of-function effect on the <START:ggp> KCNQ1/KCNE1 <END> and the <START:ggp> KCNQ1/KCNE2 <END> currents, which contrasts with the dominant negative or loss-of-function effects of the <START:bf> KCNQ1 mutations <END> previously identified in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> long QT syndrome <END> . Thus, the <START:bf> S140G mutation <END> is likely to initiate and maintain <START:disease> AF <END> by <START:bf> reducing action potential duration and effective refractory period in atrial myocytes <END> .
<START:ggp> KLOTHO allele <END> status and the risk of early-onset occult <START:disease> coronary artery disease <END> .
We previously identified a <START:ggp> functional variant of KLOTHO <END> (termed " <START:ggp> KL-VS <END> "), which harbors two <START:bf> amino acid substitutions <END> in complete linkage disequilibrium and is associated with reduced <START:bf> human longevity <END> when in homozygosity. <START:anatomy> Klotho-deficient mice <END> display extensive <START:disease> arteriosclerosis <END> when fed a normal diet, suggesting a potent <START:bf> genetic predisposition <END> . To determine whether <START:ggp> klotho <END> influences atherosclerotic risk in <START:organism> humans <END> , we performed cross-sectional studies to assess the association between the <START:ggp> KL-VS allele <END> and occult <START:disease> coronary artery disease <END> ( <START:disease> CAD <END> ) in two <START:organism> independent samples <END> of apparently <START:organism> healthy siblings <END> of <START:organism> individuals <END> with early-onset (age <60 years) <START:disease> CAD <END> ( <START:organism> SIBS-I <END> [N=520] and <START:organism> SIBS-II <END> [N=436]). Occult <START:disease> CAD <END> was defined as the occurrence of a <START:bf> reversible perfusion defect <END> during exercise <START:ched> thallium <END> scintigraphy and/or as an <START:bf> abnormal result of an exercise electrocardiogram <END> ( <START:organism> SIBS-I <END> , n=97; <START:organism> SIBS-II <END> , n=56). In <START:organism> SIBS-I <END> , the <START:ggp> KL-VS allele <END> conferred a relative odds of 1.90 (95% confidence interval 1.21-2.98) for occult <START:disease> CAD <END> , after adjusting for familial intraclass correlations (P<.005). Logistic regression modeling, incorporating known <START:disease> CAD <END> risk factors, demonstrated that the <START:ggp> KL-VS allele <END> is an independent risk factor (P<.019) and that the imposed risk of <START:ggp> KL-VS allele <END> status is influenced by modifiable risk factors. <START:disease> Hypertension <END> (P<.022) and <START:bf> increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels <END> (P<.022) mask or reduce the risk conferred by the <START:ggp> KL-VS allele <END> , respectively, whereas current smoking (P<.004) increases the risk. Remarkably concordant effects of the <START:ggp> KL-VS allele <END> and modifying factors on the risk of occult <START:disease> CAD <END> were seen in <START:organism> SIBS-II <END> . These results demonstrate that the <START:ggp> KL-VS allele <END> is an independent risk factor for occult <START:disease> CAD <END> in two <START:organism> independent high-risk samples <END> . Modifiable risk factors, including <START:disease> hypertension <END> , smoking status, and <START:ched> HDL-C <END> level, appear to influence the risk imposed by this <START:ggp> allele <END> .
<START:bf> KCNQ1 mutations <END> in <START:organism> patients <END> with a <START:organism> family <END> history of lethal <START:disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> and <START:bf> sudden death <END> .
<START:disease> Long QT syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> LQTS <END> ) is the prototype of the <START:bf> cardiac ion channelopathies <END> which cause <START:bf> syncope <END> and <START:bf> sudden death <END> . <START:disease> LQT1 <END> , due to <START:bf> mutations of KCNQ1 <END> ( <START:ggp> KVLQT1 <END> ), is the most common form. This study describes the <START:bf> genotype <END> - <START:bf> phenotype <END> characteristics in 10 <START:organism> families <END> with <START:bf> mutations of KCNQ1 <END> , including 5 <START:bf> novel mutations <END> . One hundred and two <START:organism> families <END> with a history of <START:bf> lethal cardiac events <END> , 55 <START:disease> LQTS <END> , 9 <START:disease> Brugada syndrome <END> , 18 <START:disease> idiopathic ventricular fibrillation <END> ( <START:disease> IVF <END> ), and 20 acquired <START:disease> LQTS <END> , were studied by <START:bf> single-strand conformational polymorphism <END> ( <START:bf> SSCP <END> ) and <START:ggp> DNA <END> sequence analyzes. <START:organism> Families <END> found to have <START:bf> KCNQ1 mutations <END> were phenotyped using ECG parameters and <START:bf> cardiac event <END> history, and <START:bf> genotype <END> - <START:bf> phenotype <END> correlation was performed. No <START:bf> mutations <END> were found in <START:disease> Brugada syndrome <END> , <START:disease> IVF <END> , or <START:organism> acquired LQTS families <END> . Ten out of 55 <START:organism> LQTS families <END> had <START:bf> KCNQ1 mutations <END> and 62 <START:organism> carriers <END> were identified. <START:bf> Mutations <END> included <START:bf> G269S in domain S5 <END> ; <START:bf> W305X, G314C, Y315C, and D317N in the pore region <END> ; <START:bf> A341E and Q357R in domain S6 <END> ; and <START:bf> 1338insC, G568A and T587M mutations in the C-terminus <END> . <START:bf> W305X <END> , <START:bf> G314C <END> , <START:bf> Q357R <END> , <START:bf> 1338insC <END> , and <START:bf> G568A <END> , appeared to be novel <START:bf> mutations <END> . <START:organism> Gene carriers <END> were 26 +/- 19 years (32 <START:organism> females <END> ). Baseline QTc was 0.47 +/- 0.03 s (range 0.40-0.57 s) and 40% had <START:bf> normal to borderline QTc <END> (< or = 0.46 s). <START:bf> Typical LQT1 T wave patterns <END> were present in at least one <START:organism> affected member <END> of each <START:organism> family <END> , and in 73% of all <START:organism> affected members <END> . A history of <START:bf> cardiac events <END> was present in 19/62 (31%), 18 with <START:bf> syncope <END> , 2 with aborted <START:disease> cardiac arrest <END> (ACA) and six with <START:bf> sudden death <END> ( <START:bf> SD <END> ). Two out of 6 <START:bf> SDs <END> (33%) occurred as the <START:bf> first symptom <END> . No difference in <START:bf> phenotype <END> was evident in <START:bf> pore vs. non-pore mutations <END> . <START:bf> KCNQ1 mutations <END> were limited to <START:organism> LQTS families <END> . All five novel <START:bf> mutations <END> produced a <START:bf> typical LQT1 phenotype <END> . Findings emphasize (1) <START:bf> reduced penetrance of QTc <END> and <START:bf> symptoms <END> , resulting in diagnostic challenges, (2) the problem of <START:bf> sudden death <END> as the <START:bf> first symptom <END> (33% of those who died), and (3) genetic testing is important for identification of <START:organism> gene carriers <END> with <START:bf> reduced penetrance <END> , in order to provide treatment and to prevent lethal <START:disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> and <START:bf> sudden death <END> .
A <START:ggp> locus <END> for autosomal dominant <START:disease> mitral valve prolapse <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 11p15.4 <END> .
<START:disease> Mitral valve prolapse <END> ( <START:disease> MVP <END> ) is a <START:bf> common cardiovascular abnormality <END> in the United States, occurring in approximately 2.4% of the <START:organism> general population <END> . Clinically, <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> MVP <END> exhibit <START:bf> fibromyxomatous changes in one or both of the mitral leaflets <END> that result in <START:bf> superior displacement of the leaflets into the left atrium <END> . Although often clinically benign, <START:disease> MVP <END> can be associated with important accompanying <START:disease> sequelae <END> , including <START:disease> mitral regurgitation <END> , <START:disease> bacterial endocarditis <END> , <START:disease> congestive heart failure <END> , <START:disease> atrial fibrillation <END> , and even <START:bf> sudden death <END> . <START:disease> MVP <END> is genetically heterogeneous and is inherited as an <START:bf> autosomal dominant trait <END> that exhibits both sex- and age-dependent penetrance. In this report, we describe the results of a <START:ggp> genome <END> scan and show that a <START:ggp> locus <END> for <START:disease> MVP <END> maps to <START:ggp> chromosome 11p15.4 <END> . Multipoint parametric analysis performed by use of GENEHUNTER gave a maximum LOD score of 3.12 for the <START:ggp> chromosomal region <END> immediately surrounding the <START:bf> four-marker haplotype D11S4124-D11S2349-D11S1338-D11S1323 <END> , and multipoint nonparametric analysis (NPL) confirms this finding (NPL=38.59; P=.000397). <START:bf> Haplotype <END> analysis across this <START:ggp> region <END> defines a <START:ggp> 4.3-cM region <END> between the <START:ggp> markers <END> <START:ggp> D11S1923 <END> and <START:ggp> D11S1331 <END> as the location of a new <START:ggp> MVP locus <END> , <START:ggp> MMVP2 <END> , and confirms the genetic heterogeneity of this <START:disease> disorder <END> . The discovery of <START:ggp> genes <END> involved in the <START:bf> pathogenesis <END> of this <START:disease> common disease <END> is crucial to understanding the marked variability in <START:disease> disease <END> expression and mortality seen in <START:disease> MVP <END> .
Familial <START:disease> mitral valve prolapse <END> associated with <START:disease> short stature <END> , <START:bf> characteristic face <END> , and <START:bf> sudden death <END> .
<START:disease> Mitral valve prolapse <END> ( <START:disease> MVP <END> ) is frequently a <START:bf> familial disorder <END> but in few of these <START:organism> inherited cases <END> it does form a prominent component of a <START:disease> multiple congenital anomaly (MCA) syndrome <END> . We report a <START:organism> family <END> in which eight <START:organism> individuals <END> in four generations were affected by a <START:bf> dominantly inherited disorder <END> involving <START:disease> MVP <END> , <START:disease> short stature <END> , a <START:bf> dolicocephalic face <END> , <START:bf> broad forehead <END> , <START:bf> posteriorly angulated ears <END> , <START:bf> long philtrum <END> , <START:bf> thin upper lip <END> , <START:bf> high arched palate <END> , and a <START:bf> small mandible <END> . The <START:organism> proband <END> presented with infective <START:disease> mastoiditis <END> , <START:disease> bacterial endocarditis <END> , and a <START:disease> supraventricular tachycardia <END> . One other <START:organism> family member <END> also had infective <START:disease> mastoiditis <END> and <START:disease> bacterial endocarditis <END> and both the <START:organism> proband's mother and grandmother <END> died suddenly at the age of 30 and 25 years, respectively.
<START:ggp> NFATc3 <END> and <START:ggp> NFATc4 <END> are required for <START:bf> cardiac development <END> and mitochondrial function.
Activation of the <START:ggp> nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) family <END> of <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> is associated with changes in <START:bf> gene expression <END> and <START:anatomy> myocyte <END> function in <START:anatomy> adult cardiac and skeletal muscle <END> . However, the role of <START:ggp> NFATs <END> in normal <START:bf> embryonic heart development <END> is not well characterized. In this report, the function of <START:ggp> NFATc3 <END> and <START:ggp> NFATc4 <END> in <START:bf> embryonic heart development <END> was examined in <START:organism> mice <END> with targeted disruption of both <START:ggp> nfatc3 <END> and <START:ggp> nfatc4 genes <END> . The <START:organism> nfatc3-/-nfatc4-/- mice <END> demonstrate <START:bf> embryonic lethality <END> after embryonic day 10.5 and have <START:bf> thin ventricles <END> , <START:disease> pericardial effusion <END> , and a <START:bf> reduction in ventricular myocyte proliferation <END> . Cardiac mitochondria are swollen with <START:bf> abnormal cristae <END> , indicative of <START:bf> metabolic failure <END> , but hallmarks of <START:bf> apoptosis <END> are not evident. Furthermore, enzymatic activity of <START:ggp> complex II and IV <END> of the <START:ggp> respiratory chain <END> and mitochondrial oxidative activity are reduced in <START:anatomy> nfatc3-/-nfatc4-/- cardiomyocytes <END> . <START:bf> Cardiac-specific expression of constitutively active NFATc4 <END> in <START:organism> nfatc3-/-nfatc4-/- embryos <END> prolongs <START:bf> embryonic viability <END> to embryonic day 12 and preserves <START:bf> ventricular myocyte proliferation <END> , compact zone density, and <START:bf> trabecular formation <END> . The rescued <START:organism> embryos <END> also maintain cardiac mitochondrial ultrastructure and <START:ggp> complex II <END> enzyme activity. Together, these data support the hypothesis that loss of <START:ggp> NFAT <END> activity in the <START:anatomy> heart <END> results in a <START:bf> deficiency in mitochondrial energy metabolism <END> required for <START:bf> cardiac morphogenesis and function <END> .
Novel <START:bf> deletions in MYH7 and MYBPC3 <END> identified in <START:organism> Indian families <END> with <START:disease> familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> .
<START:bf> Mutations <END> causing <START:disease> familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> ( <START:disease> HCM <END> ) have been described in at least 11 <START:ggp> genes <END> encoding <START:ggp> cardiac sarcomeric proteins <END> . In this study, three previously unknown <START:organism> deletions <END> have been identified in the <START:ggp> human cardiac genes <END> coding for <START:ggp> beta-myosin heavy chain <END> ( <START:ggp> MYH7 <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 14 <END> ) and <START:ggp> myosin-binding protein-C <END> ( <START:ggp> MYBPC3 <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 11 <END> ). In <START:organism> family MM <END> , a <START:bf> 3-bp deletion in MYH7 <END> was detected to be associated with <START:bf> loss of glutamic acid in position 927 (DeltaE927) of the myosin rod <END> . In two other <START:organism> families <END> ( <START:organism> HH <END> and <START:organism> NP <END> , related by a <START:organism> common founder <END> ) a <START:bf> 2-bp loss in codon 453 (exon 16) of MYBPC3 <END> was identified as the presumable cause of a <START:bf> translation reading frame shift <END> . Taken together 15 <START:organism> living mutation carriers <END> were investigated. Six <START:organism> deceased family members <END> (with five <START:organism> cases <END> of premature <START:disease> sudden cardiac death <END> ( <START:disease> SCD <END> ) in <START:organism> families MM <END> and <START:organism> NP <END> ) were either <START:organism> obligate or suspected mutation carriers <END> . In addition to these <START:bf> mutations <END> a <START:bf> 25-bp deletion in intron 32 of MYBPC3 <END> was identified in <START:organism> family MM <END> (five <START:organism> carriers <END> ) and in a <START:organism> fourth family <END> ( <START:organism> MiR <END> , one <START:organism> HCM patient <END> , three <START:organism> deletion carriers <END> ). In agreement with the <START:bf> loss of the regular splicing branch point in the altered intron 32 <END> , a <START:bf> splicing deficiency <END> was observed in an <START:ggp> exon <END> trapping experiment using <START:ggp> MYBPC3 exon 33 <END> as a test substrate. Varying <START:disease> disease <END> profiles assessed using standard clinical, ECG and echocardiographic procedures in conjunction with <START:bf> mutation <END> analysis led to the following conclusions: (1) In <START:organism> family MM <END> the <START:bf> DeltaE927 deletion in MYH7 <END> was assumed to be associated with complete penetrance. Two <START:organism> cases <END> of reported <START:disease> SCD <END> might have been related to this <START:bf> mutation <END> . (2) The two <START:organism> families <END> , <START:organism> HH <END> and <START:organism> NP <END> , distantly related by a <START:organism> common founder <END> , and both suffering from a <START:bf> 2-bp deletion in exon 16 of MYBPC3 <END> differed in their <START:bf> average phenotypes <END> . In <START:organism> family NP <END> , four <START:organism> cases <END> of <START:bf> cardiac death <END> were documented, whereas no <START:bf> cardiac-related death <END> was reported from <START:organism> family HH <END> . These results support the notion that <START:bf> mutations in HCM genes <END> may directly determine disease penetrance and severity; however, a contribution of additional, unidentified factors ( <START:ggp> genes <END> ) to the <START:bf> HCM phenotype <END> can-at least in some <START:organism> cases <END> -not be excluded. (3) The <START:bf> deletion in intron 32 of MYBPC3 <END> was seen in two <START:organism> families <END> , but in both its relation to <START:disease> disease <END> was not unequivocal. In addition, this <START:bf> deletion <END> was observed in 16 of 229 <START:organism> unrelated healthy individuals <END> of the <START:organism> population <END> of the South Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It was not seen in 270 <START:organism> Caucasians <END> from Russia and western Europe. Hence, it is considered to represent a regional <START:bf> genetic polymorphism <END> restricted to southern India. The association of the <START:bf> deletion <END> with <START:bf> altered splicing <END> in <START:anatomy> transfected cells <END> suggests that this <START:bf> deletion <END> may create a " <START:ggp> modifying gene <END> ", which is per se not or only rarely causing <START:disease> HCM <END> , but which may enhance the <START:bf> phenotype of a mutation responsible for disease <END> .
<START:disease> Johnson-McMillin syndrome <END> , a <START:disease> neuroectodermal syndrome <END> with <START:disease> conductive hearing loss <END> and <START:disease> microtia <END> : report of a new <START:organism> case <END> .
In 1983, <START:organism> Johnson <END> et al. described 16 <START:organism> related individuals <END> with <START:disease> alopecia <END> , <START:disease> anosmia <END> or <START:disease> hyposmia <END> , <START:disease> conductive hearing loss <END> , <START:disease> microtia <END> and/or <START:bf> atresia of the external auditory canal <END> , and <START:disease> hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism <END> inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Other <START:bf> less constant manifestations <END> included <START:bf> facial asymmetry <END> , <START:bf> mental retardation <END> , <START:bf> congenital heart defect <END> , <START:disease> cleft palate <END> , and <START:bf> choanal stenosis <END> . An <START:organism> isolated case <END> was reported later ( <START:organism> Johnston <END> et al. [1987: Am J Med Genet 26: 925-927]) and thereafter an <START:organism> affected mother and son <END> ( <START:organism> Hennekam <END> and <START:organism> Holtus <END> [1993: Am J Med Genet 47: 714-716]). We describe an additional <START:organism> unrelated female patient <END> with features resembling those of the <START:organism> previously reported cases <END> . She presented with <START:bf> intrauterine growth deficiency <END> , <START:disease> microcephaly <END> , <START:disease> alopecia <END> , <START:disease> bilateral microtia <END> with <START:bf> canal atresia <END> , <START:disease> conductive hearing loss <END> , partial left <START:disease> facial palsy <END> , posterior <START:disease> cleft palate <END> , <START:bf> left choanal stenosis <END> , <START:disease> tetralogy of Fallot <END> , <START:bf> developmental delay <END> , and <START:anatomy> right thumb <END> <START:disease> polydactyly <END> . Because the <START:bf> phenotypic abnormalities <END> in this <START:disease> syndrome <END> affect the <START:anatomy> brain <END> , <START:anatomy> facial structures <END> , <START:anatomy> ectoderm <END> and <START:anatomy> its derivatives <END> , <START:bf> outflow tract of the heart <END> , and <START:bf> Rathke's pouch derivatives <END> , this has suggested to previous <START:organism> authors <END> etiologic involvement of the <START:anatomy> ectoderm <END> and <START:anatomy> neuroectoderm <END> of the <START:anatomy> first and second branchial arches <END> , <START:anatomy> Rathke's pouch <END> , and the <START:anatomy> diencephalon <END> . <START:disease> Microtia <END> with <START:disease> conductive hearing loss <END> differentiates the condition from other <START:bf> ectodermal dysplasias <END> . In the initial report, <START:organism> females <END> appeared somewhat less affected than <START:organism> males <END> , and there was <START:bf> male-to-male transmission <END> . The <START:organism> mother <END> of our <START:organism> patient <END> manifests <START:bf> subtle features <END> , which suggest she may be a <START:organism> mildly affected female <END> . Additionally, there is a <START:organism> family <END> history of early-onset <START:disease> alopecia <END> in the <START:organism> maternal grandfather's relatives <END> .
<START:bf> Sexual dimorphism <END> in the <START:ggp> growth hormone <END> and <START:ggp> insulin-like growth factor <END> axis at <START:bf> birth <END> .
In <START:organism> rodents <END> and <START:organism> humans <END> there is a sexually dimorphic pattern of <START:bf> GH secretion <END> that influences the <START:anatomy> serum <END> concentration of <START:ggp> IGF-I <END> . Pattern differences can be identified in <START:organism> children <END> , but it is not known how early this difference is established. We studied the <START:anatomy> plasma <END> concentrations of <START:ggp> IGF-I <END> , <START:ggp> IGF-II <END> , I <START:ggp> GF-binding protein-3 <END> ( <START:ggp> BP-3 <END> ), and <START:ggp> GH <END> in <START:anatomy> cord blood <END> taken from the <START:organism> offspring <END> of 1650 <START:bf> singleton Caucasian pregnancies <END> born at term and related these values to <START:bf> birth <END> weight, length, and <START:anatomy> head <END> circumference. <START:bf> Pregnancies <END> complicated by <START:bf> preterm delivery <END> , <START:bf> antepartum hemorrhage <END> , <START:disease> pregnancy-induced hypertension <END> , <START:bf> preeclampsia <END> , or <START:disease> gestational diabetes <END> and where cigarette smoking continued were excluded, resulting in a <START:organism> cohort <END> of 987. <START:anatomy> Cord plasma <END> concentrations of <START:ggp> IGF-I <END> , <START:ggp> IGF-II <END> , and <START:ggp> IGFBP-3 <END> were influenced by factors influencing birth size: <START:bf> gestational age <END> at <START:bf> delivery <END> , mode of <START:bf> delivery <END> , maternal height, and parity of the <START:organism> mother <END> . <START:anatomy> Plasma <END> <START:ggp> GH <END> concentrations were inversely related to the <START:anatomy> plasma <END> concentrations of <START:ggp> IGF-I <END> and <START:ggp> IGFBP-3 <END> ; 10.2% of the variability in <START:anatomy> cord plasma <END> <START:ggp> IGF-I <END> concentration and 2.7% for <START:ggp> IGFBP-3 <END> was explained by sex of the <START:organism> offspring <END> and parity. None of the factors, apart from maternal height, influenced <START:anatomy> cord serum <END> <START:ggp> IGF-II <END> concentrations (adjusted r(2) = 1%). Sex of the <START:organism> baby <END> , mode of <START:bf> delivery <END> , and parity influenced <START:anatomy> cord serum <END> <START:ggp> GH <END> concentrations (adjusted r(2) = 2.6%). <START:bf> Birth <END> weight, length, and <START:anatomy> head <END> circumference measurements were greater in <START:organism> males <END> than <START:organism> females <END> (P < 0.001). Mean <START:anatomy> cord plasma <END> concentrations of <START:ggp> IGF-I <END> ( <START:organism> males <END> , 66.4 +/- 1.2 micro g/liter; <START:organism> females <END> , 74.5 +/- 1.3 micro g/liter; P < 0.001) and <START:ggp> IGFBP-3 <END> ( <START:organism> males <END> , 910 +/- 13 micro g/liter; <START:organism> females <END> 978 +/- 13 micro g/liter; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in <START:organism> males <END> than <START:organism> females <END> . <START:anatomy> Cord plasma <END> <START:ggp> GH <END> concentrations were higher in <START:organism> males <END> than <START:organism> females <END> ( <START:organism> males <END> , 30.0 +/- 1.2 mU/liter; <START:organism> females <END> , 26.9 +/- 1.1 mU/liter; P = 0.05), but no difference was noted between the sexes for <START:ggp> IGF-II <END> ( <START:organism> males <END> , 508 +/- 6 micro g/liter; <START:organism> females <END> , 519 +/- 6 micro g/liter; P = NS). After adjustment for gestational age, parity, and maternal height, <START:anatomy> cord plasma <END> concentrations of <START:ggp> IGF-I <END> and <START:ggp> IGFBP-3 <END> along with sex explained 38.0% of the variability in <START:bf> birth <END> weight, 25.0% in <START:bf> birth <END> length, and 22.7% in <START:anatomy> head <END> circumference. These data demonstrate that in a <START:organism> group <END> of <START:organism> singleton Caucasian babies <END> born at term, <START:anatomy> cord plasma <END> <START:ggp> IGF-I <END> , <START:ggp> IGFBP-3 <END> , and <START:ggp> GH <END> concentrations relate to <START:bf> birth <END> size, with evidence for <START:bf> sexual dimorphism <END> in the <START:ggp> GH <END> - <START:ggp> IGF <END> axis.
Ex vivo <START:ggp> gene <END> therapy of <START:disease> familial hypercholesterolemia <END> .
<START:disease> Familial hypercholesterolemia <END> ( <START:disease> FH <END> ) is an <START:bf> autosomal dominant disorder <END> caused by a <START:bf> deficiency in the receptor <END> that clears <START:ggp> low density lipoprotein <END> ( <START:ggp> LDL <END> ) from the <START:anatomy> serum <END> (reviewed in Ref. 1 and 2). <START:organism> Patients <END> with one <START:ggp> abnormal LDL receptor allele <END> have <START:bf> moderate elevations in plasma LDL <END> and suffer premature <START:disease> coronary artery disease <END> ( <START:disease> CAD <END> ). Approximately 5% of all <START:organism> patients <END> under 45 who have had a <START:disease> myocardial infarction <END> carry this <START:bf> trait <END> . <START:organism> Patients <END> with two <START:ggp> abnormal LDL receptor genes <END> ( <START:organism> homozygous deficient patients <END> ) have severe <START:disease> hypercholesterolemia <END> and life-threatening <START:disease> coronary artery disease <END> in childhood. Strategies for treating <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> FH <END> are directed at lowering the <START:anatomy> plasma <END> level of <START:ggp> LDL <END> . In <START:organism> heterozygotes <END> , this is accomplished through the administration of <START:ched> drugs <END> that stimulate the <START:bf> expression of LDL receptor from the normal allele <END> (2). This therapeutic approach is not effective in the treatment of <START:organism> homozygous deficient patients <END> , especially those that retain <START:bf> less than 2% of residual LDL receptor activity <END> . Partial amelioration of <START:disease> hyperlipidemia <END> has been achieved in some <START:organism> homozygous deficient patients <END> by diverting the <START:bf> portal circulation <END> through a portacaval anastomosis (3) and by chronic plasmapheresis therapy (4). A more direct approach has been to correct the <START:bf> deficiency of hepatic LDL receptor <END> by transplanting a <START:anatomy> liver <END> that expresses <START:bf> normal levels of LDL receptor <END> . Three <START:organism> patients <END> that survived this procedure normalized their <START:anatomy> serum <END> <START:ched> LDL-cholesterol <END> (5-9). We have used an <START:organism> authentic animal model <END> for <START:disease> FH <END> , the <START:organism> Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic rabbit <END> ( <START:organism> WHHL <END> ), to develop <START:ggp> gene <END> therapies for the homozygous form of <START:disease> FH <END> (10-13). The <START:organism> WHHL rabbit <END> has a mutation in its <START:ggp> LDL receptor gene <END> which renders the <START:ggp> receptor <END> completely dysfunctional (12) leading to severe <START:disease> hypercholesterolemia <END> , diffuse <START:disease> atherosclerosis <END> , and premature death. The potential efficacy of <START:ggp> gene <END> therapy for <START:disease> FH <END> is supported by a series of studies we have performed in the <START:organism> WHHL rabbit <END> in which we have achieved metabolic improvement (14-18). Liver tissue was removed from <START:organism> WHHL rabbits <END> and used to isolate hepatocytes and establish primary cultures. A <START:ggp> functional rabbit LDL receptor gene <END> was transduced into a high proportion of hepatocytes using <START:organism> recombinant retroviruses <END> , and the genetically corrected cells were transplanted into the <START:organism> animal <END> from which they were derived. Transplantation of the genetically corrected, autologous hepatocytes was associated with a 30-40% decrease in serum <START:ched> cholesterol <END> that persisted for the duration of the experiment (4 months, Ref. 18). Recombinant derived <START:ggp> LDL receptor RNA <END> was detected in liver for at least 6 months. There was no apparent immunological response to the recombinant derived <START:ggp> LDL receptor <END> .(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
<START:disease> Down's syndrome <END> : an <START:bf> atheroma <END> -free model?
Postmortem examination of five <START:organism> institutionalised patients <END> with <START:disease> Down's syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> DS <END> ) aged 40-66 years showed a <START:bf> complete absence of atheroma <END> , while a similar number of <START:organism> mental defectives <END> with <START:disease> DS <END> were found to have <START:bf> mild or severe atheroma <END> . Previous investigation of risk factors for <START:bf> atheroma <END> in 70 <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> DS <END> and 70 <START:organism> age-and sex-matched mental defectives <END> living in the same institution showed <START:bf> significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures <END> in the <START:organism> DS group <END> , with the exception of systolic pressure in <START:organism> men <END> under 40. Fasting <START:anatomy> serum <END> <START:ched> cholesterol <END> and <START:ched> triglyceride <END> concentrations were similar in the two <START:organism> groups <END> , but <START:ched> triglyceride <END> concentrations were significantly lower than in <START:organism> normal people <END> without a history of <START:disease> vascular disease <END> . These unexplained observations may be relevant in further studies of the <START:bf> pathogenesis of atheroma <END> .
Identification and functional analysis of <START:bf> ZIC3 mutations <END> in <START:disease> heterotaxy <END> and related <START:disease> congenital heart defects <END> .
<START:bf> Mutations in the zinc finger transcription factor ZIC3 <END> cause <START:disease> X-linked heterotaxy <END> and have also been identified in <START:organism> patients <END> with isolated <START:disease> congenital heart disease <END> ( <START:disease> CHD <END> ). To determine the relative contribution of <START:bf> ZIC3 mutations <END> to both <START:disease> heterotaxy <END> and isolated <START:disease> CHD <END> , we screened the <START:ggp> coding region of ZIC3 <END> in 194 <START:organism> unrelated patients <END> , including 61 <START:organism> patients <END> with classic <START:disease> heterotaxy <END> , 93 <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:bf> heart defects <END> characteristic of <START:disease> heterotaxy <END> , and 11 <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> situs inversus totalis <END> . Five novel <START:bf> ZIC3 mutations <END> in three <START:organism> classic heterotaxy kindreds <END> and two <START:organism> sporadic CHD cases <END> were identified. None of these <START:ggp> alleles <END> was found in 97 <START:organism> ethnically matched control samples <END> . On the basis of these analyses, we conclude that the phenotypic spectrum of <START:bf> ZIC3 mutations <END> should be expanded to include <START:organism> affected females <END> and <START:disease> CHD <END> not typical for <START:disease> heterotaxy <END> . This screening of a <START:organism> cohort <END> of <START:organism> patients <END> with sporadic <START:disease> heterotaxy <END> indicates that <START:bf> ZIC3 mutations <END> account for approximately 1% of <START:organism> affected individuals <END> . <START:bf> Missense and nonsense mutations <END> were found in the highly conserved <START:ggp> zinc finger-binding domain <END> and in the <START:ggp> N-terminal protein domain <END> . Functional analysis of all currently known <START:bf> ZIC3 point mutations <END> indicates that <START:bf> mutations in the putative zinc finger DNA binding domain and in the N-terminal domain <END> result in <START:bf> loss of reporter gene transactivation <END> . It is surprising that transfection studies demonstrate <START:bf> aberrant cytoplasmic localization <END> resulting from <START:bf> mutations between amino acids 253-323 of the ZIC3 protein <END> , indicating that the <START:bf> pathogenesis of a subset of ZIC3 mutations <END> results at least in part from <START:bf> failure of appropriate nuclear localization <END> . These results further expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of <START:bf> ZIC3 mutations <END> and provide initial mechanistic insight into their functional consequences.
The <START:ggp> HLA-DRB1 locus <END> as a <START:ggp> genetic component <END> in <START:disease> giant cell arteritis <END> . Mapping of a <START:ggp> disease-linked sequence motif <END> to the <START:ggp> antigen binding site <END> of the <START:ggp> HLA-DR molecule <END> .
<START:disease> Giant cell arteritis <END> ( <START:disease> GCA <END> ) is a <START:disease> granulomatous vasculitis <END> affecting <START:organism> persons <END> over 50 years of age. The <START:bf> inflammatory infiltrate <END> , which is targeted at the <START:anatomy> aorta <END> and its <START:anatomy> proximal branches <END> , includes <START:anatomy> activated CD4+ helper T cells <END> , <START:anatomy> histiocytes <END> , and <START:anatomy> giant cells <END> . To investigate whether the <START:bf> genetic polymorphism of the HLA-DRB1 genes <END> contributes to the <START:bf> local accumulation of activated T cells <END> , we have analyzed both <START:ggp> HLA-DRB1 alleles <END> in a <START:organism> cohort <END> of 42 <START:organism> patients <END> with biopsy-proven <START:disease> GCA <END> . The majority of <START:organism> patients <END> (60%) expressed the <START:ggp> B1*0401 <END> or <START:ggp> B1*0404/8 variant <END> of the <START:bf> HLA-DR4 haplotype <END> , both of which also represent the <START:ggp> major genetic factors <END> underlying the <START:disease> disease <END> association in <START:disease> RA <END> . <START:organism> GCA patients <END> <START:bf> negative for the disease-linked HLA-DR4 alleles <END> were characterized by a <START:bf> nonrandom distribution of HLA-DRB1 alleles <END> . Sequence comparison among the <START:ggp> allelic products <END> identified in the <START:organism> GCA cohort <END> demonstrated heterogeneity for the <START:bf> sequence polymorphism of the third hypervariable region <END> ( <START:ggp> HVR <END> ), but homology for the <START:ggp> polymorphic residues <END> within the <START:ggp> HVR2 <END> of the <START:ggp> HLA-DRB1 gene <END> . The <START:organism> GCA patients <END> shared a <START:ggp> sequence motif <END> spanning <START:ggp> amino acid positions 28-31 <END> of the <START:ggp> HLA-DR beta 1 chain <END> . In the structural model for <START:ggp> HLA-DR molecules <END> , this <START:ggp> sequence motif <END> can be mapped to the <START:ggp> antigen-binding site <END> of the <START:ggp> HLA complex <END> , suggesting a crucial role of <START:bf> antigen selection and presentation <END> in <START:disease> GCA <END> . In contrast, the <START:bf> sequence polymorphism <END> linked to <START:disease> RA <END> has been mapped to the <START:ggp> HVR3 <END> of the <START:ggp> HLA-DRB1 gene <END> and translates into a distinct <START:ggp> domain <END> of the <START:ggp> HLA-DR molecule <END> , the <START:ggp> alpha-helical loop <END> surrounding the <START:ggp> antigen-binding groove <END> . A <START:organism> consecutive case series <END> study demonstrated that <START:disease> GCA <END> and <START:disease> RA <END> rarely co-occurred, supporting the interpretation that distinct <START:ggp> functional domains <END> of the <START:ggp> HLA-DR molecule <END> are implicated in the pathomechanisms of these two <START:disease> autoimmune diseases <END> .
<START:bf> Congenital disorder of oxygen sensing <END> : association of the <START:bf> homozygous Chuvash polycythemia VHL mutation <END> with <START:disease> thrombosis <END> and <START:bf> vascular abnormalities <END> but not <START:disease> tumors <END> .
<START:bf> Adaptation to hypoxia <END> is critical for <START:bf> survival <END> and regulates multiple <START:bf> processes <END> , including <START:bf> erythropoiesis <END> and <START:bf> vasculogenesis <END> . <START:disease> Chuvash polycythemia <END> is a <START:bf> hypoxia-sensing disorder <END> characterized by <START:bf> homozygous mutation (598C>T) of von Hippel-Lindau gene <END> ( <START:ggp> VHL <END> ), a negative regulator of <START:bf> hypoxia sensing <END> . Although endemic to the <START:organism> Chuvash population <END> of Russia, this <START:bf> mutation <END> occurs worldwide and originates from a single ancient event. That <START:bf> VHL 598C>T <END> homozygosity causes <START:bf> elevated normoxic levels of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), serum erythropoietin and hemoglobin <END> is known, but the <START:bf> disease phenotype <END> has not been documented in a controlled manner. In this <START:organism> matched cohort <END> study, <START:bf> VHL 598C>T <END> homozygosity was associated with vertebral <START:disease> hemangiomas <END> , <START:disease> varicose veins <END> , <START:bf> lower blood pressures <END> , and <START:bf> elevated serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations <END> (P <.0005), as well as <START:bf> premature mortality related to cerebral vascular events <END> and peripheral <START:disease> thrombosis <END> . Spinocerebellar <START:disease> hemangioblastomas <END> , <START:disease> renal carcinomas <END> , and <START:disease> pheochromocytomas <END> typical of <START:disease> classical VHL syndrome <END> were not found, suggesting that <START:bf> overexpression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF <END> is not sufficient for <START:bf> tumorigenesis <END> . Although <START:ggp> hemoglobin <END> -adjusted <START:anatomy> serum <END> <START:ggp> erythropoietin <END> concentrations were approximately 10-fold higher in <START:organism> VHL 598C>T homozygotes <END> than in <START:organism> controls <END> , <START:bf> erythropoietin response to hypoxia <END> was identical. Thus, <START:disease> Chuvash polycythemia <END> is a distinct <START:disease> VHL syndrome <END> manifested by <START:disease> thrombosis <END> , <START:bf> vascular abnormalities <END> , and <START:bf> intact hypoxic regulation <END> despite <START:bf> increased basal expression of hypoxia-regulated genes <END> .
Effective long-term control of <START:bf> cardiac events <END> with <START:ched> beta-blockers <END> in a <START:organism> family <END> with a <START:bf> common LQT1 mutation <END> .
The congenital <START:disease> long QT syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> LQTS <END> ) is characterized by a <START:bf> prolonged QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram <END> and an increased risk of <START:bf> recurrent syncope <END> and <START:disease> sudden cardiac death <END> . <START:bf> Mutations in seven genes <END> have been identified as the molecular basis of <START:disease> LQTS <END> . <START:ched> beta-blockers <END> are the treatment of choice to reduce <START:bf> cardiac symptoms <END> . However, long-term follow-up of <START:organism> genotyped families <END> with <START:disease> LQTS <END> has been rarely reported. We have clinically followed a <START:organism> four-generation family <END> with <START:disease> LQTS <END> being treated with <START:ched> beta-blocker <END> therapy over a period of 23 years. Seven <START:organism> family members <END> were <START:organism> carriers <END> of two <START:bf> amino acid alterations in cis (V254M-V417M) in the cardiac potassium channel gene KCNQ1 <END> . Voltage-clamp recordings of <START:ggp> mutant KCNQ1 protein <END> in <START:organism> Xenopus <END> oocytes showed that only the V254M mutation reduced the IKs current and that the effect of the <START:ggp> V417M variant <END> was negligible. The <START:organism> family <END> exhibited the <START:bf> complete clinical spectrum of the disease <END> , from <START:organism> asymptomatic patients <END> to <START:organism> victims <END> of <START:bf> sudden death <END> before <START:ched> beta-blocker <END> therapy. There was <START:bf> no significant reduction in QTc <END> (556 +/- 40 ms(1/2) before therapy, 494 +/- 20 ms(1/2) during 17 years of treatment; n = 5 <START:organism> individuals <END> ). Of nine <START:organism> family members <END> , one <START:organism> female <END> died suddenly before treatment, three <START:organism> females <END> of the second generation were <START:bf> asymptomatic <END> , and four <START:organism> individuals <END> of the third and fourth generation were symptomatic. All <START:organism> mutation carriers <END> were treated with <START:ched> beta-blockers <END> and remained asymptomatic for a follow-up up to 23 years. Long-term follow-up of a <START:organism> LQT1 family <END> with a <START:bf> common mutation (V254M) <END> being on <START:ched> beta-blocker <END> therapy was effective and safe. This study underscores the importance of long-term follow-up in <START:organism> families <END> with <START:bf> specific LQT mutations <END> to provide valuable information for <START:organism> clinicians <END> for an appropriate antiarrhythmic treatment.
In vitro expression studies of a novel <START:bf> mutation delta299 <END> in a <START:organism> patient <END> affected with <START:bf> apparent mineralocorticoid excess <END> .
<START:disease> Apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> AME <END> ) is an <START:bf> autosomal recessive disorder <END> that results in low renin <START:disease> hypertension <END> and other <START:bf> characteristic clinical features <END> . <START:organism> Typical patients <END> present with severe <START:disease> hypertension <END> , <START:disease> hypokalemia <END> , and <START:bf> undetectable aldosterone <END> . Most <START:organism> patients <END> also have <START:bf> low birth weight <END> , <START:bf> failure to thrive <END> , and <START:disease> nephrocalcinosis <END> . The <START:bf> 11betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11betaHSD2) defect <END> is documented by demonstrating a <START:bf> failure to convert cortisol to cortisone <END> . Here, we report a <START:organism> patient <END> with <START:bf> typical phenotypic features of AME <END> who does not carry any of the previously described <START:bf> mutations in the HSD11B2 gene <END> . This <START:organism> female patient <END> from a <START:organism> consanguineous Pakistani family <END> presented at age 9 yr. She had a <START:bf> low birth weight <END> compared with her <START:organism> siblings <END> and presented with <START:disease> hypertension <END> (225/120 mm Hg), <START:bf> low plasma renin activity <END> , <START:bf> hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis <END> , <START:bf> suppressed aldosterone <END> , and bilateral <START:disease> nephrocalcinosis <END> . Echocardiogram did not reveal <START:disease> left ventricular hypertrophy <END> , and baseline ophthalmological evaluation did not demonstrate <START:disease> hypertensive retinopathy <END> . However, at age 12 yr, she developed mild to moderate <START:disease> hypertensive retinopathy <END> . Biochemical analysis showed an <START:bf> elevated urinary cortisol to cortisone metabolites ratio <END> ( <START:ched> tetrahydrocortisol <END> and <START:ched> 5alpha-tetrahydrocortisol <END> / <START:ched> tetrahydrocortisone <END> ) of 28 (normal, 0.66-2.44). She had a <START:bf> cortisol secretion rate of 0.43 mg/d <END> (normal, 5-25 mg/d). Sequence analysis of the <START:ggp> HSD11B2 gene <END> revealed a novel <START:bf> homozygous delta299 mutation in exon 5 <END> . In vitro expression in <START:organism> Chinese hamster <END> ovary cells revealed that this mutation resulted in no activity.
<START:bf> Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency <END> , clinical, biochemical and genetic aspects.
The <START:ggp> carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase <END> ( <START:ggp> CACT <END> ) is one of the components of the <START:bf> carnitine cycle <END> . The <START:bf> carnitine cycle <END> is necessary to shuttle <START:ched> long-chain fatty acids <END> from the cytosol into the intramitochondrial space where <START:bf> mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids <END> takes place. The oxidation of <START:ched> fatty acids <END> yields <START:ched> acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) units <END> , which may either be degraded to <START:ched> CO(2) <END> and H <START:ched> (2)O <END> in the <START:bf> citric acid cycle <END> to produce <START:ched> ATP <END> or converted into <START:ched> ketone bodies <END> which occurs in <START:anatomy> liver <END> and <START:anatomy> kidneys <END> . Metabolic consequences of a <START:ggp> defective CACT <END> are <START:bf> hypoketotic hypoglycaemia <END> under fasting conditions, <START:bf> hyperammonemia <END> , <START:bf> elevated creatine kinase and transaminases <END> , <START:bf> dicarboxylic aciduria <END> , <START:bf> very low free carnitine <END> and an <START:bf> abnormal acylcarnitine profile with marked elevation of the long-chain acylcarnitines <END> . <START:bf> Clinical signs and symptoms <END> in <START:organism> CACT deficient patients <END> , are a combination of <START:bf> energy depletion <END> and <START:bf> endogenous toxicity <END> . The <START:anatomy> predominantly affected organs <END> are <START:anatomy> brain <END> , <START:anatomy> heart <END> and <START:anatomy> skeletal muscle <END> , and <START:anatomy> liver <END> , leading to <START:bf> neurological abnormalities <END> , <START:disease> cardiomyopathy <END> and <START:disease> arrythmias <END> , <START:bf> skeletal muscle damage <END> and <START:disease> liver dysfunction <END> . Most <START:organism> patients <END> become symptomatic in the neonatal period with a <START:bf> rapidly progressive deterioration <END> and a <START:bf> high mortality rate <END> . However, presentations at a later age with a <START:bf> milder phenotype <END> have also been reported. The therapeutic approach is the same as in other <START:bf> long-chain fatty acid disorders <END> and includes intravenous <START:ched> glucose <END> (+/- <START:ggp> insulin <END> ) administration to maximally inhibit <START:bf> lipolysis <END> and subsequent <START:bf> fatty acid oxidation <END> during the <START:bf> acute deterioration <END> , along with other measures such as <START:bf> ammonia detoxification <END> , depending on the clinical features. Long-term strategy consists of avoidance of fasting with frequent meals and a special diet with restriction of <START:ched> long-chain fatty acids <END> . Due to the <START:bf> extremely low free carnitine concentrations <END> , <START:ched> carnitine <END> supplementation is often needed. <START:ched> Acylcarnitine <END> profiling in <START:anatomy> plasma <END> is the assay of choice for the diagnosis at a <START:ched> metabolite <END> level. However, since the <START:ched> acylcarnitine <END> profile observed in <START:organism> CACT-deficient patients <END> is identical to that in <START:organism> CPT2-deficient patients <END> , definitive identification of <START:bf> CACT-deficiency <END> in a certain <START:organism> patient <END> requires determination of the activity of <START:ggp> CACT <END> . Subsequently, mutational analysis of the <START:ggp> CACT gene <END> can be performed. So far, 9 different <START:bf> mutations <END> have been identified in the <START:ggp> CACT gene <END> .
Molecular and functional analysis of <START:bf> SLC25A20 mutations <END> causing <START:bf> carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency <END> .
The <START:ggp> enzyme <END> <START:ggp> carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase <END> ( <START:ggp> CACT <END> ) is involved in the transport of <START:ched> long-chain fatty acids <END> into mitochondria. <START:bf> CACT deficiency <END> is a <START:bf> life-threatening, recessively inherited disorder of lipid beta-oxidation <END> which manifests in early infancy with hypoketotic <START:disease> hypoglycemia <END> , <START:disease> cardiomyopathy <END> , <START:disease> liver failure <END> , and <START:disease> muscle weakness <END> . We report here the clinical, biochemical, and molecular features of six <START:organism> CACT-deficient patients <END> from Italy, Spain, and North America who exhibited significant clinical heterogeneity. In five <START:organism> patients <END> ( <START:organism> Patients 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 <END> ) the <START:disease> disease <END> manifested in the neonatal period, while the remaining <START:organism> patient <END> ( <START:organism> Patient 3 <END> ), the <START:organism> younger sibling <END> of an <START:organism> infant <END> who had died with clinical suspicion of <START:bf> fatty acid oxidation defect <END> , has been treated since <START:bf> birth <END> and was clinically asymptomatic at 4.5 years of age. <START:organism> Patients 1 and 4 <END> were deceased within 6 months from the onset of this study, while the remaining four are still alive at 8, 4.5, 3.5, and 2 years, respectively. Sequence analysis of the <START:ggp> CACT gene <END> ( <START:ggp> SLC25A20 <END> ) disclosed five novel <START:bf> mutations <END> and three previously reported <START:bf> mutations <END> . Three <START:organism> patients <END> were homozygous for the identified <START:bf> mutations <END> . Two of the novel <START:bf> mutations <END> ( <START:bf> c.718+1G>C <END> and <START:bf> c.843+4_843+50del <END> ) altered the <START:ggp> donor splice site <END> of <START:ggp> introns 7 and 8 <END> , respectively. The <START:bf> 47-nt deletion in intron 8 <END> caused both <START:bf> skipping of exon 8 <END> only and <START:bf> skipping of exons 6-8 <END> . Four <START:bf> mutations <END> [[ <START:bf> c.159dupT;c.163delA <END> ] ([ <START:bf> p.Gly54Trp;p.Thr55Ala <END> ]) <START:bf> c.397C>T <END> ( <START:bf> p.Arg133Trp <END> ), <START:bf> c.691G>C <END> ( <START:bf> p.Asp231His <END> ), and <START:bf> c.842C>T <END> ( <START:bf> p.Ala281Val <END> )] resulted in <START:bf> amino acid substitutions <END> affecting <START:ggp> evolutionarily conserved regions <END> of the <START:ggp> protein <END> . Interestingly, one of these <START:bf> exonic mutations <END> ( <START:bf> p.Ala281Val <END> ) was associated with a <START:bf> splicing defect <END> also characterized by <START:bf> skipping of exons 6-8 <END> . The deleterious effect of the <START:bf> p.Arg133Trp substitution <END> was demonstrated by measuring <START:ggp> CACT <END> activity upon expression of the <START:ggp> normal and the mutant protein <END> in <START:organism> E. coli <END> and functional reconstitution into liposomes. Combined analysis of clinical, biochemical, and molecular data failed to indicate a correlation between the <START:bf> phenotype <END> and the <START:bf> genotype <END> .
<START:bf> Decreased mechanical stiffness <END> in <START:anatomy> LMNA-/- cells <END> is caused by <START:bf> defective nucleo-cytoskeletal integrity <END> : implications for the development of <START:disease> laminopathies <END> .
<START:disease> Laminopathies <END> comprise a group of <START:disease> inherited diseases <END> with variable <START:bf> clinical phenotypes <END> , caused by <START:bf> mutations in the lamin A/C gene <END> ( <START:ggp> LMNA <END> ). A prominent feature in several of these <START:disease> diseases <END> is <START:bf> muscle wasting <END> , as seen in <START:disease> Emery-Dreifuss muscle dystrophy <END> , <START:disease> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and <START:disease> limb-girdle muscular dystrophy <END> . Although the mechanisms underlying this <START:bf> phenotype <END> remain largely obscure, two major working hypotheses are currently being investigated, namely, <START:bf> defects in gene regulation <END> and/or <START:bf> abnormalities in nuclear architecture <END> causing <START:bf> cellular fragility <END> . In this study, using a newly developed <START:anatomy> cell <END> compression device we have tested the latter hypothesis. The device allows controlled application of mechanical load onto single living <START:anatomy> cells <END> , with simultaneous visualization of <START:bf> cellular deformation <END> and quantitation of resistance. With the device, we have compared <START:anatomy> wild-type (MEF+/+) and LMNA knockout (MEF-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts <END> ( <START:anatomy> MEFs <END> ), and found that <START:anatomy> MEF-/- cells <END> show a <START:bf> significantly decreased mechanical stiffness <END> and a <START:bf> significantly lower bursting force <END> . Partial rescue of the <START:bf> phenotype <END> by transfection with either <START:ggp> lamin A <END> or <START:ggp> lamin C <END> prevented gross <START:bf> nuclear disruption <END> , as seen in <START:anatomy> MEF-/- cells <END> , but was unable to fully restore <START:bf> mechanical stiffness <END> in these <START:anatomy> cells <END> . Our studies show a direct correlation between <START:bf> absence of LMNA proteins <END> and <START:bf> nuclear fragility in living cells <END> . Simultaneous recordings by confocal microscopy revealed that the nuclei in <START:anatomy> MEF-/- cells <END> , in contrast to <START:anatomy> MEF+/+ cells <END> , exhibited an <START:bf> isotropic deformation upon indentation <END> , despite an <START:bf> anisotropic deformation of the cell <END> as a whole. This <START:bf> nuclear behaviour <END> is indicative for a <START:bf> loss of interaction of the disturbed nucleus with the surrounding cytoskeleton <END> . In addition, careful investigation of the three-dimensional organization of <START:ggp> actin <END> -, <START:ggp> vimentin <END> - and <START:ggp> tubulin <END> -based filaments showed a <START:bf> disturbed interaction of these structures in MEF-/- cells <END> . Therefore, we suggest that in addition to the <START:bf> loss of nuclear stiffness <END> , the <START:bf> loss of a physical interaction between nuclear structures (i.e. lamins) and the cytoskeleton <END> is causing <START:bf> more general cellular weakness <END> and emphasizes a potential key function for <START:ggp> lamins <END> in <START:bf> maintaining cellular tensegrity <END> .
Identification of a <START:bf> KCNE2 gain-of-function mutation <END> in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> familial atrial fibrillation <END> .
<START:disease> Atrial fibrillation <END> ( <START:disease> AF <END> ) is the most common <START:disease> cardiac arrhythmia <END> encountered in clinical practice. We first reported an <START:bf> S140G mutation of KCNQ1 <END> , an <START:ggp> alpha subunit <END> of <START:ggp> potassium channels <END> , in one <START:organism> Chinese kindred <END> with <START:disease> AF <END> . However, the <START:bf> molecular defects <END> and cellular mechanisms in most <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> AF <END> remain to be identified. We evaluated 28 <START:organism> unrelated Chinese kindreds <END> with <START:disease> AF <END> and sequenced eight <START:ggp> genes <END> of <START:ggp> potassium channels <END> ( <START:ggp> KCNQ1 <END> , <START:ggp> HERG <END> , <START:ggp> KCNE1 <END> , <START:ggp> KCNE2 <END> , <START:ggp> KCNE3 <END> , <START:ggp> KCNE4 <END> , <START:ggp> KCNE5 <END> , and <START:ggp> KCNJ2 <END> ). An <START:bf> arginine-to-cysteine mutation at position 27 (R27C) of KCNE2 <END> , the <START:ggp> beta subunit <END> of the <START:ggp> KCNQ1-KCNE2 channel <END> responsible for a <START:bf> background potassium current <END> , was found in 2 of the 28 <START:organism> probands <END> . The <START:bf> mutation <END> was present in all <START:organism> affected members <END> in the two <START:organism> kindreds <END> and was absent in 462 <START:organism> healthy unrelated Chinese subjects <END> . Similar to <START:bf> KCNQ1 S140G <END> , the <START:bf> mutation <END> had a gain-of-function effect on the <START:ggp> KCNQ1-KCNE2 channel <END> ; unlike <START:bf> long QT syndrome-associated KCNE2 mutations <END> , it did not alter <START:bf> HERG-KCNE2 current <END> . The <START:bf> mutation <END> did not alter the functions of the <START:ggp> HCN channel family <END> either. Thus, <START:bf> KCNE2 R27C <END> is a <START:bf> gain-of-function mutation <END> associated with the initiation and/or maintenance of <START:disease> AF <END> .
<START:bf> Genetic variation at the locus <END> encompassing <START:ggp> 11-beta hydroxylase <END> and <START:ggp> aldosterone synthase <END> accounts for <START:bf> heritability in cortisol precursor (11-deoxycortisol) urinary metabolite excretion <END> .
<START:bf> Genetic variation in the gene <END> encoding <START:ggp> aldosterone synthase <END> ( <START:ggp> CYP11B2 <END> ) has previously been shown to be associated with <START:disease> hypertension <END> and <START:disease> left ventricular hypertrophy <END> . The <START:bf> intermediate phenotype <END> most consistently associated with <START:bf> variation at this locus <END> is that of <START:bf> elevated plasma 11-deoxycortisol <END> ( <START:ched> S <END> ). However, in <START:organism> normal subjects <END> , <START:ggp> aldosterone synthase <END> does not metabolize <START:ched> S <END> , which is converted to <START:ched> cortisol <END> ( <START:ched> F <END> ) by the <START:ggp> enzyme <END> <START:ggp> 11 beta hydroxylase <END> , encoded by the <START:ggp> gene <END> <START:ggp> CYP11B1 <END> , which lies adjacent to <START:ggp> CYP11B2 <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 8 <END> . It is possible that the <START:ggp> quantitative trait locus <END> for the <START:bf> phenotype <END> is within <START:ggp> CYP11B1 <END> and that linkage disequilibrium across the <START:ggp> extended locus <END> could account for these observations. However, <START:bf> variation across the whole CYP11B1/B2 locus <END> had not been extensively characterized with respect to these <START:bf> phenotypes <END> . We genotyped six <START:bf> polymorphisms in the CYP11B2 gene <END> and three <START:bf> polymorphisms in the CYP11B1 gene <END> in 248 <START:organism> Caucasian nuclear families <END> comprising 1428 <START:organism> individuals <END> . We measured <START:anatomy> plasma <END> levels of <START:ched> S <END> and <START:ched> F <END> in 460 <START:organism> individuals <END> from 86 <START:organism> families <END> and <START:bf> urinary excretion <END> rates of <START:ched> tetrahydrodeoxycortisol <END> ( <START:ched> THS <END> ) and <START:ched> tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone <END> in 573 <START:organism> individuals <END> from 105 <START:organism> families <END> . We examined heritability of the <START:bf> phenotypes <END> and their association with <START:bf> genotypes and haplotypes at this locus <END> . All <START:bf> steroid phenotypes <END> except urinary <START:ched> tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone <END> were highly heritable (P < 0.00001). There was strong linkage disequilibrium across the <START:ggp> CYP11B1/B2 locus <END> . There was modest evidence for association between <START:bf> polymorphisms of CYP11B2 <END> and <START:anatomy> plasma <END> levels of <START:ched> S <END> (P = 0.02 for <START:bf> T4986C polymorphism <END> ) and the <START:anatomy> plasma <END> <START:ched> S <END> to <START:ched> F <END> ratio, reflecting the activity of <START:ggp> 11-beta hydroxylase <END> (P = 0.01 for <START:bf> T4986C polymorphism <END> ). There was strong evidence for association between <START:bf> polymorphisms of both CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 <END> and urinary <START:ched> THS <END> , which was strongest for the <START:bf> CYP11B1 exon 1 polymorphism <END> (P = 0.00002). Addition of other marker data to <START:ggp> CYP11B1 exon 1 <END> did not improve the fit of a log-linear model. <START:bf> Genotype at CYP11B1 <END> explained approximately 5% of the variance in <START:bf> urinary THS excretion <END> in the <START:organism> population <END> . Thus, it is likely that linkage disequilibrium between <START:ggp> causative CYP11B1 variants <END> and <START:bf> CYP11B2 polymorphisms <END> account for the previous observations. Further fine-mapping studies across the <START:ggp> CYP11B1 locus <END> are required to localize the <START:ggp> causative variant(s) <END> for the <START:bf> biochemical phenotype <END> ; this may also identify <START:ggp> susceptibility alleles <END> for <START:disease> hypertension <END> and <START:disease> left ventricular hypertrophy <END> .
Genetic heterogeneity in <START:disease> LEOPARD syndrome <END> : two <START:organism> families <END> with <START:bf> no mutations in PTPN11 <END> .
<START:disease> LEOPARD syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> lentigines <END> , <START:bf> electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities <END> , <START:disease> ocular hypertelorism <END> , <START:disease> pulmonary stenosis <END> , <START:bf> abnormal genitalia <END> , <START:bf> retardation of growth <END> , and <START:disease> sensorineural deafness <END> ) is an autosomal dominant condition. The <START:bf> main clinical features <END> include multiple <START:disease> lentigines <END> , <START:bf> cardiovascular defects <END> , and <START:bf> facial anomalies <END> , some of which are shared with <START:disease> Noonan syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> NS <END> ). Recent reports have shown that <START:disease> LEOPARD syndrome <END> can be caused by <START:bf> mutations in PTPN11 <END> , the <START:ggp> gene <END> in which <START:bf> mutations <END> can produce <START:disease> NS <END> . Here we report the findings of <START:bf> mutation <END> screening and linkage analysis of <START:ggp> PTPN11 <END> in three <START:organism> families <END> with <START:disease> LEOPARD syndrome <END> . We identified a novel <START:bf> mutation <END> in one <START:organism> family <END> . The <START:bf> mutation <END> ( <START:bf> 1529A>C <END> ) substitutes <START:ched> proline <END> for <START:ched> glutamine <END> at <START:ggp> amino acid 510 <END> ( <START:bf> Gln510Pro <END> ). <START:bf> No variations in sequence <END> were observed in the other two <START:organism> families <END> , and negative LOD scores excluded linkage to the <START:ggp> PTPN11 locus <END> , showing that <START:disease> LEOPARD syndrome <END> is genetically heterogeneous.
The <START:ggp> secreted glycoprotein <END> <START:ggp> lubricin <END> protects <START:anatomy> cartilage surfaces <END> and inhibits <START:bf> synovial cell overgrowth <END> .
The long-term integrity of an articulating <START:anatomy> joint <END> is dependent upon the nourishment of its <START:anatomy> cartilage component <END> and the <START:bf> protection of the cartilage surface from friction-induced wear <END> . <START:bf> Loss-of-function mutations in lubricin <END> (a <START:ggp> secreted glycoprotein <END> encoded by the <START:ggp> gene <END> <START:ggp> PRG4 <END> ) cause the <START:organism> human <END> <START:organism> autosomal recessive disorder <END> <START:disease> camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> CACP <END> ). A major feature of <START:disease> CACP <END> is <START:bf> precocious joint failure <END> . In order to delineate the mechanism by which <START:ggp> lubricin <END> protects <START:anatomy> joints <END> , we studied the <START:bf> expression of Prg4 mRNA during mouse joint development <END> , and we created <START:organism> lubricin-mutant mice <END> . <START:ggp> Prg4 <END> began to be expressed in surface <START:anatomy> chondrocytes <END> and <START:anatomy> synoviocytes <END> after <START:bf> joint cavitation <END> had occurred and remained strongly expressed by these <START:anatomy> cells <END> postnatally. <START:organism> Mice <END> lacking <START:ggp> lubricin <END> were viable and fertile. In the newborn period, their <START:anatomy> joints <END> appeared normal. As the <START:organism> mice <END> aged, we observed <START:bf> abnormal protein deposits on the cartilage surface <END> and <START:bf> disappearance of underlying superficial zone chondrocytes <END> . In addition to <START:bf> cartilage surface changes <END> and subsequent <START:bf> cartilage deterioration <END> , <START:anatomy> intimal cells in the synovium <END> surrounding the <START:anatomy> joint space <END> became hyperplastic, which further contributed to <START:bf> joint failure <END> . Purified or recombinant <START:ggp> lubricin <END> inhibited the <START:bf> growth of these synoviocytes <END> in vitro. <START:anatomy> Tendon <END> and <START:anatomy> tendon sheath <END> involvement was present in the <START:anatomy> ankle joints <END> , where <START:bf> morphologic changes and abnormal calcification of these structures <END> were observed. We conclude that <START:ggp> lubricin <END> has multiple functions in articulating <START:anatomy> joints <END> and <START:anatomy> tendons <END> that include the <START:bf> protection of surfaces <END> and the <START:bf> control of synovial cell growth <END> .
<START:bf> Phenotypes with GATA4 or NKX2.5 mutations <END> in familial <START:disease> atrial septal defect <END> .
Recently, <START:ggp> GATA4 <END> and <START:ggp> NKX2.5 <END> were reported as the <START:ggp> disease genes <END> of <START:disease> atrial septal defect <END> ( <START:disease> ASD <END> ) but the relationship between the locations of their <START:bf> mutations <END> and <START:bf> phenotypes <END> is not clear. We analyzed <START:bf> GATA4 and NKX2.5 mutations <END> in 16 <START:organism> familial ASD cases <END> , including four <START:organism> probands <END> with <START:disease> atrioventricular conduction disturbance <END> ( <START:disease> AV block <END> ) and two with <START:disease> pulmonary stenosis <END> ( <START:disease> PS <END> ), by PCR and direct sequencing, and examined their <START:bf> phenotypes <END> clinically. Five <START:bf> mutations <END> , including two <START:bf> GATA4 and three NKX2.5 mutations <END> , were identified in 31.3% of the <START:organism> probands <END> with <START:disease> ASD <END> , and three of them were novel. The two <START:bf> GATA4 mutations <END> in the <START:organism> probands <END> without <START:disease> AV block <END> were <START:bf> S52F <END> and <START:bf> E359Xfs <END> ( <START:bf> c.1075delG <END> ) that was reported previously, and three <START:bf> NKX2.5 mutations <END> in the <START:organism> probands <END> with <START:disease> AV block <END> were <START:bf> A88Xfs <END> ( <START:bf> c.262delG <END> ), <START:bf> R190C <END> , and <START:bf> T178M <END> . Additionally, we observed some <START:bf> remarkable phenotypes <END> , i.e., <START:disease> dextrocardia <END> with <START:bf> E359Xfs <END> ( <START:bf> c.1075delG <END> ) and cribriform type <START:disease> ASD <END> with <START:bf> R190C <END> , both of which are expected to be clues for further investigations. Furthermore, progressive, most severe <START:disease> AV block <END> was closely related with a <START:bf> missense mutation in a homeodomain <END> or with a <START:bf> nonsense/frame-shift mutation of NKX2.5 <END> for which classification has not been clearly proposed. This pinpoints <START:ggp> essential sites <END> of <START:ggp> NKX2.5 <END> in the <START:bf> development of the conduction system <END> .
Fatal congenital heart <START:disease> glycogenosis <END> caused by a recurrent activating <START:bf> R531Q mutation <END> in the <START:ggp> gamma 2-subunit <END> of <START:ggp> AMP-activated protein kinase <END> ( <START:ggp> PRKAG2 <END> ), not by <START:bf> phosphorylase kinase deficiency <END> .
Fatal congenital nonlysosomal cardiac <START:disease> glycogenosis <END> has been attributed to a subtype of <START:bf> phosphorylase kinase deficiency <END> , but the underlying <START:ggp> genes <END> and <START:bf> mutations <END> have not been identified. Analyzing four <START:organism> sporadic, unrelated patients <END> , we found <START:bf> no mutations either in the eight genes <END> encoding <START:ggp> phosphorylase kinase subunits <END> or in the two <START:ggp> genes <END> encoding the <START:ggp> muscle and brain isoforms <END> of <START:ggp> glycogen phosphorylase <END> . However, in three of five <START:organism> patients <END> , we identified identical <START:bf> heterozygous R531Q missense mutations of the PRKAG2 gene <END> , which encodes the <START:ggp> gamma 2-subunit <END> of <START:ggp> AMP-activated protein kinase <END> , a key regulator of energy balance. Biochemical characterization of the <START:ggp> recombinant R531Q mutant protein <END> showed <START:bf> >100-fold reduction of binding affinities for the regulatory nucleotides AMP and ATP <END> but an <START:bf> enhanced basal activity and increased phosphorylation of the alpha -subunit <END> . Other <START:bf> PRKAG2 missense mutations <END> were previously identified in <START:organism> patients <END> with autosomal dominant <START:disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> with <START:disease> Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome <END> , characterized by juvenile-to-adult clinical onset, <START:bf> moderate cardiac glycogenosis <END> , <START:bf> disturbed excitation conduction <END> , risk of <START:disease> sudden cardiac death <END> in midlife, and <START:bf> molecular perturbations <END> that are similar to--but less severe than--those observed for the <START:bf> R531Q mutation <END> . Thus, <START:bf> recurrent heterozygous R531Q missense mutations in PRKAG2 <END> give rise to a massive nonlysosomal cardiac <START:disease> glycogenosis <END> of fetal symptomatic onset and rapidly fatal course, constituting a genotypically and clinically distinct variant of <START:disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> with <START:disease> Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome <END> . <START:bf> R531Q <END> and other <START:bf> PRKAG2 mutations <END> enhance the basal activity and <START:bf> alpha -subunit phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase <END> , explaining the dominant nature of <START:bf> PRKAG2 disease mutations <END> . Since not all <START:organism> cases <END> displayed <START:bf> PRKAG2 mutations <END> , fatal congenital nonlysosomal cardiac <START:disease> glycogenosis <END> seems to be genetically heterogeneous. However, the existence of a <START:bf> heart-specific primary phosphorylase kinase deficiency <END> is questionable, because <START:bf> no phosphorylase kinase mutations <END> were found.
A <START:bf> Kir2.1 gain-of-function mutation <END> underlies <START:disease> familial atrial fibrillation <END> .
The <START:ggp> inward rectifier K(+) channel <END> <START:ggp> Kir2.1 <END> mediates the <START:bf> potassium I(K1) current in the heart <END> . It is encoded by <START:ggp> KCNJ2 gene <END> that has been linked to <START:disease> Andersen's syndrome <END> . Recently, strong evidences showed that <START:ggp> Kir2.1 channels <END> were associated with <START:organism> mouse <END> <START:disease> atrial fibrillation <END> ( <START:disease> AF <END> ), therefore we hypothesized that <START:ggp> KCNJ2 <END> was associated with familial <START:disease> AF <END> . Thirty <START:organism> Chinese AF kindreds <END> were evaluated for <START:bf> mutations in KCNJ2 gene <END> . A <START:bf> valine-to-isoleucine mutation at position 93 (V93I) of Kir2.1 <END> was found in all <START:organism> affected members <END> in one <START:organism> kindred <END> . This <START:ched> valine <END> and its <START:ggp> flanking sequence <END> is highly conserved in <START:ggp> Kir2.1 proteins <END> among different species. Functional analysis of the <START:bf> V93I mutant <END> demonstrated a gain-of-function consequence on the <START:bf> Kir2.1 current <END> . This effect is opposed to the loss-of-function effect of previously reported <START:bf> mutations <END> in <START:disease> Andersen's syndrome <END> . <START:bf> Kir2.1 V93I mutation <END> may play a role in initiating and/or maintaining <START:disease> AF <END> by increasing the activity of the <START:ggp> inward rectifier K(+) channel <END> .
<START:disease> CDG-IL <END> : an <START:organism> infant <END> with a novel <START:bf> mutation in the ALG9 gene <END> and additional <START:bf> phenotypic features <END> .
We describe the second case of <START:disease> congenital disorder of glycosylation type IL <END> ( <START:disease> CDG-IL <END> ) caused by <START:bf> deficiency of the ALG9 a1,2 mannosyltransferase enzyme <END> . The <START:organism> female infant <END> 's features included <START:bf> psychomotor retardation <END> , <START:disease> seizures <END> , <START:bf> hypotonia <END> , <START:bf> diffuse brain atrophy with delayed myelination <END> , <START:bf> failure to thrive <END> , <START:disease> pericardial effusion <END> , <START:disease> cystic renal disease <END> , <START:bf> hepatosplenomegaly <END> , <START:disease> esotropia <END> , and <START:bf> inverted nipples <END> . <START:disease> Lipodystrophy <END> and <START:bf> dysmorphic facial features <END> were absent. Magnetic resonance imaging of the <START:anatomy> brain <END> showed <START:bf> volume loss in the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum <END> and <START:bf> delayed myelination <END> . Laboratory investigations revealed <START:bf> low levels of multiple serum proteins <END> including <START:ggp> antithrombin III <END> , <START:ggp> factor XI <END> , and <START:ched> cholesterol <END> . <START:bf> Hypoglycosylation <END> was confirmed by the typical <START:disease> CDG type 1 <END> pattern of <START:anatomy> serum <END> <START:ggp> transferrin <END> analyzed by isoelectric focusing. A <START:bf> defect in the ALG9 enzyme <END> was suggested by the <START:bf> accumulation of the DolPP-GlcNAc2Man6 and DolPP-GlcNAc2Man8 <END> in the <START:anatomy> patient's fibroblasts <END> and confirmed by <START:bf> mutation <END> analysis: the <START:organism> patient <END> is homozygous for the <START:bf> ALG9 mutation <END> <START:bf> p.Y286C <END> . The causal effect of the <START:bf> mutation <END> was shown by complementation assays in <START:ggp> alg9 <END> deficient <START:organism> yeast <END> cells. The <START:organism> child <END> described here further delineates the clinical spectrum of <START:disease> CDG-IL <END> and confirms the significant clinical overlap amongst <START:disease> CDG <END> subtypes.
Diversity and functional consequences of <START:bf> germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations <END> in <START:organism> human <END> <START:disease> disease <END> .
<START:bf> Germline mutations in PTPN11 <END> , the <START:ggp> gene <END> encoding the <START:ggp> protein tyrosine phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> SHP-2 <END> , cause <START:disease> Noonan syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> NS <END> ) and the clinically related <START:disease> LEOPARD syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> LS <END> ), whereas <START:bf> somatic mutations in the same gene <END> contribute to <START:bf> leukemogenesis <END> . On the basis of our previously gathered genetic and biochemical data, we proposed a model that splits <START:bf> NS- and leukemia-associated PTPN11 mutations <END> into two major classes of <START:bf> activating lesions <END> with differential perturbing effects on <START:bf> development <END> and <START:bf> hematopoiesis <END> . To test this model, we investigated further the diversity of <START:bf> germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations <END> , delineated the association of those <START:bf> mutations <END> with <START:disease> disease <END> , characterized biochemically a panel of <START:ggp> mutant SHP-2 proteins <END> recurring in <START:disease> NS <END> , <START:disease> LS <END> , and <START:disease> leukemia <END> , and performed molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural effects of selected <START:bf> mutations <END> . Our results document a strict correlation between the identity of the <START:bf> lesion <END> and <START:disease> disease <END> and demonstrate that <START:bf> NS-causative mutations <END> have less potency for promoting <START:ggp> SHP-2 <END> gain of function than do <START:bf> leukemia-associated ones <END> . Furthermore, we show that the <START:bf> recurrent LS-causing Y279C and T468M amino acid substitutions <END> engender <START:bf> loss of SHP-2 catalytic activity <END> , identifying a previously unrecognized behavior for this class of <START:bf> missense PTPN11 mutations <END> .
The biochemical, clinical, and genetic features of <START:disease> type III hyperlipoproteinemia <END> .
The clinical and biochemical features of <START:disease> type III hyperlipoproteinemia <END> are described in 49 <START:organism> patients <END> from 23 to 70 years of age. An <START:bf> increase in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) of abnormal chemical composition <END> was the basis for diagnosis. The <START:organism> untreated patients <END> all had <START:disease> hypercholesterolemia <END> and <START:disease> hyperglyceridemia <END> , and, on the average, <START:bf> decreased concentrations of both low- and high-density lipoproteins <END> . Seventy-four percent had <START:disease> xanthomas <END> , and classic " <START:disease> xanthoma <END> striata palmaris" was found in more than half. Twenty-seven percent had <START:disease> ischemic heart disease <END> , detected earlier in <START:organism> men <END> than in <START:organism> women <END> . Twenty-seven percent had <START:disease> peripheral vascular disease <END> (compared to 4% of <START:organism> subjects <END> with <START:organism> type II hyperlipoproteinemia <END> ). Twenty-five of 35 <START:organism> subjects <END> achieved <START:bf> normal lipid levels <END> with dietary therapy alone. Analysis of 29 <START:organism> kindred <END> showed <START:disease> hyperlipidemia <END> in half of <START:organism> adult blood relatives <END> ; half of these had <START:disease> type III <END> , the remainder usually had sample endogenous <START:disease> hyperglyceridemia (type IV) <END> . Only 2 of 55 <START:organism> children <END> less than 20 years of age were affected, both with <START:disease> type IV <END> .
<START:bf> PTPN11 (Shp2) mutations <END> in <START:disease> LEOPARD syndrome <END> have dominant negative, not activating, effects.
<START:disease> Multiple lentigines/LEOPARD syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> LS <END> ) is a <START:bf> rare, autosomal dominant disorder <END> characterized by <START:disease> Lentigines <END> , <START:bf> Electrocardiogram abnormalities <END> , <START:disease> Ocular hypertelorism <END> , <START:disease> Pulmonic valvular stenosis <END> , <START:bf> Abnormalities of genitalia <END> , <START:bf> Retardation of growth <END> , and <START:disease> Deafness <END> . Like the more common <START:disease> Noonan syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> NS <END> ), <START:disease> LS <END> is caused by <START:bf> germ line missense mutations in PTPN11 <END> , encoding the <START:ggp> protein-tyrosine phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> Shp2 <END> . Enzymologic, structural, cell biological, and <START:organism> mouse <END> genetic studies indicate that <START:disease> NS <END> is caused by <START:bf> gain-of-function PTPN11 mutations <END> . Because <START:disease> NS <END> and <START:disease> LS <END> share several features, <START:disease> LS <END> has been viewed as an <START:disease> NS <END> variant. We examined a panel of <START:bf> LS mutants <END> , including the two <START:ggp> most common alleles <END> . Surprisingly, we found that in marked contrast to <START:bf> NS, LS mutants <END> are catalytically defective and act as <START:bf> dominant negative mutations <END> that interfere with <START:bf> growth factor/Erk-mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated signaling <END> . Molecular modeling and biochemical studies suggest that <START:bf> LS mutations <END> contort the <START:ggp> Shp2 catalytic domain <END> and result in <START:ggp> open, inactive forms of Shp2 <END> . Our results establish that the <START:bf> pathogenesis of LS and NS <END> is distinct and suggest that these <START:disease> disorders <END> should be distinguished by mutational analysis rather than clinical presentation.
<START:disease> Andersen-Tawil syndrome <END> : prospective <START:organism> cohort <END> analysis and expansion of the <START:bf> phenotype <END> .
<START:disease> Andersen-Tawil syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> ATS <END> ) is an <START:disease> autosomal dominant multisystem disorder <END> characterized by <START:bf> developmental, cardiac, and neuromuscular abnormalities <END> . Approximately 70% of <START:organism> patients <END> have <START:bf> mutations in KCNJ2 <END> , resulting in <START:bf> dysfunction of the inward-rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 <END> . Variable expression complicates the diagnosis of <START:disease> ATS <END> , which in many <START:organism> cases <END> , is not made until years after the <START:bf> first recognized symptom <END> . To better define the distinctive <START:bf> clinical features <END> of <START:disease> ATS <END> and facilitate earlier diagnosis, we conducted a prospective, standardized evaluation of 10 <START:organism> subjects <END> with confirmed <START:bf> KCNJ2 mutations <END> . Detailed anthropometric, neurological, and cardiac evaluations were performed. Using this approach, we identified novel <START:bf> skeletal and dental findings <END> and proposed additional diagnostic criteria for <START:bf> ATS dysmorphology <END> .
<START:ched> Antithrombin <END> and its deficiency states.
<START:ggp> Antithrombin <END> is the most important <START:ggp> physiological proteinase inhibitor <END> of <START:ggp> thrombin <END> and other <START:ggp> coagulation proteinases <END> . It is a <START:ggp> single chain glycoprotein <END> of MW 58,200 which has sequence homology with <START:ggp> alpha 1-antitrypsin <END> and other <START:ggp> members <END> of the <START:ggp> serpin superfamily <END> of <START:ggp> inhibitors <END> . Two <START:ggp> functional domains <END> of importance have been identified, the <START:ggp> reactive centre <END> that interacts with the <START:ggp> proteinase <END> and a <START:ggp> heparin binding domain <END> . Failure to maintain an adequate level of functional <START:ggp> antithrombin <END> in <START:anatomy> plasma <END> results in an increased risk of <START:disease> thromboembolism <END> : <START:bf> deficiency <END> can be inherited or acquired. There is still uncertainty regarding the prevalence of <START:bf> inherited deficiency <END> and the prevalence of <START:disease> thrombosis <END> in <START:organism> affected individuals <END> . The <START:bf> production of antithrombin <END> is under the <START:bf> control of a single gene <END> which is localized on <START:ggp> chromosome 1q 23-25 <END> . Characterization of the <START:ggp> coding sequence <END> , which is distributed over <START:ggp> seven exons <END> , has allowed the analysis of the molecular basis for <START:bf> inherited antithrombin deficiency <END> . To date more than 100 <START:organism> cases <END> have been successfully investigated at the <START:ggp> gene <END> and/or <START:ggp> protein <END> sequence level and 40 novel <START:bf> mutations <END> have been identified. <START:bf> Mutations <END> causing <START:bf> amino acid substitutions <END> solely affecting the <START:ggp> heparin binding site <END> have thus far been located primarily at the <START:ggp> N-terminal region <END> of the <START:ggp> molecule <END> , <START:ggp> residues 7-129 <END> ; this <START:ggp> region <END> has been postulated to align as a <START:ggp> positive groove <END> in the <START:ggp> molecule <END> that forms the <START:ggp> primary contact region <END> for the <START:ched> essential antithrombin binding pentasaccharide <END> of <START:ched> heparin <END> . Not all the <START:ggp> residues <END> in which <START:bf> substitutions <END> have been found are basic and some serve to maintain the <START:bf> conformation of nearby basic regions <END> . Examples of this are provided by the <START:bf> Pro-41 to Leu mutation <END> and a recently investigated <START:bf> mutant <END> , <START:bf> Leu-99 to Phe <END> . The <START:bf> reactive site defects <END> are an interesting group, including those that alter <START:ggp> P1, P1' and P12-P10 residues <END> . Perhaps more <START:bf> remote mutations <END> can also be included such as <START:bf> Pro-429 to Leu <END> . The <START:bf> P1 and P1' mutations <END> directly block interaction of the <START:ggp> proteinase <END> with <START:ggp> anti-thrombin <END> , while <START:ggp> P12-P10 mutants <END> (which have <START:bf> mutations <END> affecting <START:ggp> serpin strand s4A <END> ) enable the substrate reaction to proceed to completion, i.e. the <START:ggp> antithrombin-thrombin complex <END> is not stabilized and the <START:ggp> mutant inhibitor <END> is transformed into a <START:ggp> substrate <END> . The effect of the <START:bf> Pro-429 to Leu substitution <END> is <START:bf> impairment of the reactive site and heparin binding <END> , and the finding that this <START:ggp> variant <END> is not completely recognized by some <START:ggp> MAbs <END> implies a <START:bf> conformational change at the C terminus <END> . Another <START:organism> group <END> (nine <START:organism> cases <END> ) of interesting <START:bf> mutations <END> is emerging, that has its <START:bf> primary defect in or near serpin strand 1C <END> , <START:ggp> amino acid sequence 402-407 <END> .(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
<START:disease> LEOPARD syndrome <END> : clinical diagnosis in the first year of life.
<START:disease> LEOPARD syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> LS <END> ) is an <START:disease> autosomal dominant syndrome <END> characterized by <START:bf> multiple lentigines <END> and <START:bf> caf-au-lait spots <END> , <START:bf> electrocardiographic-conduction abnormalities <END> , <START:disease> ocular hypertelorism <END> / <START:disease> obstructive cardiomyopathy <END> , <START:disease> pulmonary stenosis <END> , <START:bf> abnormalities of the genitalia in males <END> , <START:bf> retardation of growth <END> , and <START:disease> deafness <END> . <START:disease> LS <END> shares many features with <START:disease> Noonan syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> NS <END> ), in which <START:bf> lentigines <END> and <START:disease> deafness <END> are usually not present. Molecular studies have shown that <START:disease> LS <END> and <START:disease> NS <END> are <START:bf> allelic disorders <END> , caused by <START:bf> different missense mutations in PTPN11 <END> , a <START:ggp> gene <END> encoding the <START:ggp> protein tyrosine phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> SHP-2 <END> located at <START:ggp> chromosome 12q22-qter <END> . The clinical diagnosis of <START:disease> LS <END> is generally difficult in the first months of life because the <START:bf> distinctive lentigines <END> are generally not present at <START:bf> birth <END> and develop during childhood. From January 2002 to December 2004, we suspected <START:disease> LS <END> clinically in 10 <START:organism> patients <END> admitted to our genetic counseling services in the first 12 months of life. A <START:bf> PTPN11 gene mutation <END> was detected in 8/10 (80%) <START:organism> patients <END> . In one <START:organism> patient <END> without a <START:bf> PTPN11 mutation <END> a subsequent clinical diagnosis of <START:disease> neurofibromatosis type 1 <END> ( <START:disease> NF1 <END> ) was made, following the evaluation of the <START:organism> mother <END> , who had previously undiagnosed classic <START:disease> NF1 <END> . The age of <START:organism> LS patients <END> with <START:bf> PTPN11 mutation <END> ranged between 1 and 11 months (mean age +/- SD 7.5 +/- 3.96 months). Review of the clinical characteristics of <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> LS <END> confirmed by molecular study during the first year of life demonstrates that the diagnosis of <START:disease> LS <END> in the first months of age can be clinically suspected in <START:organism> patients <END> presenting with three main features, that is, <START:bf> characteristic facial features <END> (100%), <START:disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> ( <START:disease> HCM <END> ) (87%), and <START:disease> cafe-au-lait spots <END> (75%). <START:bf> Characteristic facial features <END> can be mild or severe, and consist of <START:disease> hypertelorism <END> , <START:bf> downslanting palpebral fissures <END> , <START:bf> ptosis <END> , and <START:bf> dysmorphic ears <END> . The clinical suspicion of <START:disease> LS <END> may be confirmed by molecular screening for <START:bf> PTPN11 mutations <END> . An early diagnosis of the <START:disease> disease <END> is useful for the prospective care of associated medical problems and for precise genetic counseling.
Targeting <START:ggp> C-reactive protein <END> for the treatment of <START:disease> cardiovascular disease <END> .
<START:bf> Complement-mediated inflammation <END> exacerbates the <START:bf> tissue injury of ischaemic necrosis <END> in <START:disease> heart attacks <END> and <START:disease> strokes <END> , the most common causes of <START:bf> death <END> in developed countries. <START:bf> Large infarct size <END> increases immediate morbidity and mortality and, in <START:organism> survivors <END> of the <START:bf> acute event <END> , <START:bf> larger non-functional scars <END> adversely affect long-term prognosis. There is thus an important unmet medical need for new cardioprotective and neuroprotective treatments. We have previously shown that <START:ggp> human C-reactive protein <END> ( <START:ggp> CRP <END> ), the <START:ggp> classical acute-phase protein <END> that binds to <START:ched> ligands <END> exposed in <START:anatomy> damaged tissue <END> and then activates <START:ggp> complement <END> , increases <START:disease> myocardial and cerebral infarct <END> size in <START:organism> rats <END> subjected to coronary or cerebral artery ligation, respectively. <START:ggp> Rat CRP <END> does not activate <START:ggp> rat complement <END> , whereas <START:ggp> human CRP <END> activates both <START:ggp> rat and human complement <END> . Administration of <START:ggp> human CRP <END> to <START:organism> rats <END> is thus an excellent model for the actions of <START:ggp> endogenous human CRP <END> . Here we report the design, synthesis and efficacy of <START:ched> 1,6-bis(phosphocholine)-hexane <END> as a specific <START:ched> small-molecule inhibitor <END> of <START:ggp> CRP <END> . Five <START:ched> molecules <END> of this <START:ched> palindromic compound <END> are bound by two <START:ggp> pentameric CRP molecules <END> , crosslinking and occluding the <START:ggp> ligand-binding B-face <END> of <START:ggp> CRP <END> and blocking its functions. Administration of <START:ched> 1,6-bis(phosphocholine)-hexane <END> to <START:organism> rats <END> undergoing <START:disease> acute myocardial infarction <END> abrogated the increase in infarct size and cardiac dysfunction produced by injection of <START:ggp> human CRP <END> . Therapeutic inhibition of <START:ggp> CRP <END> is thus a promising new approach to cardioprotection in <START:disease> acute myocardial infarction <END> , and may also provide neuroprotection in <START:disease> stroke <END> . Potential wider applications include other <START:bf> inflammatory, infective and tissue-damaging conditions <END> characterized by <START:bf> increased CRP production <END> , in which <START:bf> binding of CRP <END> to exposed <START:ched> ligands <END> in <START:anatomy> damaged cells <END> may lead to <START:bf> complement-mediated exacerbation of tissue injury <END> .
<START:disease> Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> is associated with <START:bf> reduced expression of vinculin <END> in the intercalated disc.
<START:bf> Mutations in the cardiac-specific insert of vinculin <END> , <START:ggp> metavinculin <END> , rarely cause <START:disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> ( <START:disease> HCM <END> ) and <START:disease> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( <START:disease> DCM <END> ). Subsequently, a <START:bf> missense mutation in the ubiquitously expressed vinculin <END> was discovered in a <START:organism> patient <END> with <START:disease> obstructive HCM <END> . Microscopic examination of both myectomy specimens from <START:organism> patients <END> bearing <START:bf> genetic defects in metavinculin and vinculin <END> showed a <START:bf> marked reduction of vinculin/metavinculin expression in the intercalated disc <END> , but <START:bf> normal expression in the Z-disc <END> . Given that distinct <START:ggp> functional domains <END> were altered by the <START:bf> metavinculin and vinculin mutations <END> , we hypothesized that the <START:bf> intercalated disc-specific reduction of vinculin <END> may stem from <START:bf> left ventricular tract obstruction <END> in general rather than rarely observed <START:bf> perturbations in VCL-encoded vinculin <END> . To test this hypothesis, we examined the localization of <START:ggp> vinculin <END> / <START:ggp> metavinculin <END> in <START:anatomy> hypertrophied human heart tissue <END> from <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:bf> cardiovascular conditions <END> associated with <START:bf> obstruction <END> and <START:bf> hemodynamic overload <END> using an immunohistochemistry approach. Tissue specimens derived from <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> obstructive HCM <END> and <START:disease> aortic stenosis <END> ( <START:disease> AS <END> ) showed a <START:bf> universal defect of vinculin/metavinculin expression in the intercalated disc <END> but <START:bf> preserved expression in the cardiac Z-disc <END> , whereas <START:anatomy> tissue <END> specimens derived from <START:organism> patients <END> with either <START:disease> DCM <END> , <START:disease> hypertensive heart disease <END> ( <START:disease> HTN <END> ), or <START:disease> pulmonary hypertension <END> ( <START:disease> PHTN <END> ) exhibited <START:bf> normal expression of vinculin/metavinculin in both the Z- and the intercalated disc <END> despite being associated with <START:bf> hypertrophy <END> . Results of this study suggest that <START:disease> cardiac hypertrophy <END> may be associated with different <START:bf> expression of the marker vinculin/metavinculin <END> depending on the underlying pathophysiology; <START:bf> hemodynamic overload <END> may not affect the localization whereas <START:disease> obstructive disease <END> substantially reduces the <START:bf> expression of vinculin <END> preferentially in the intercalated disc.
<START:ggp> Chondromodulin-I <END> maintains <START:bf> cardiac valvular function <END> by preventing <START:bf> angiogenesis <END> .
The <START:bf> avascularity of cardiac valves <END> is abrogated in several <START:disease> valvular heart diseases <END> ( <START:disease> VHDs <END> ). This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying <START:bf> valvular avascularity <END> and its correlation with <START:disease> VHD <END> . <START:ggp> Chondromodulin-I <END> , an <START:ggp> antiangiogenic factor <END> isolated from <START:anatomy> cartilage <END> , is abundantly expressed in <START:anatomy> cardiac valves <END> . <START:ggp> Gene <END> targeting of <START:ggp> chondromodulin-I <END> resulted in <START:bf> enhanced Vegf-A expression, angiogenesis, lipid deposition and calcification in the cardiac valves <END> of <START:organism> aged mice <END> . Echocardiography showed <START:bf> aortic valve thickening <END> , <START:bf> calcification <END> and <START:bf> turbulent flow <END> , indicative of <START:bf> early changes <END> in <START:disease> aortic stenosis <END> . Conditioned medium obtained from cultured <START:anatomy> valvular interstitial cells <END> strongly inhibited <START:bf> tube formation and mobilization of endothelial cells <END> and induced their <START:bf> apoptosis <END> ; these effects were partially inhibited by <START:ggp> chondromodulin-I small interfering RNA <END> . In <START:organism> human <END> <START:disease> VHD <END> , including <START:organism> cases <END> associated with <START:disease> infective endocarditis <END> , <START:disease> rheumatic heart disease <END> and <START:disease> atherosclerosis <END> , <START:bf> VEGF-A expression <END> , <START:bf> neovascularization <END> and <START:bf> calcification <END> were observed in areas of <START:bf> chondromodulin-I downregulation <END> . These findings provide evidence that <START:ggp> chondromodulin-I <END> has a pivotal role in maintaining <START:bf> valvular normal function <END> by preventing <START:bf> angiogenesis <END> that may lead to <START:disease> VHD <END> .
The <START:bf> G534E polymorphism of the gene <END> encoding the <START:ggp> factor VII-activating protease <END> is associated with cardiovascular risk due to <START:bf> increased neointima formation <END> .
The <START:bf> G534E polymorphism (Marburg I [MI]) of factor VII-activating protease <END> ( <START:ggp> FSAP <END> ) is associated with <START:disease> carotid stenosis <END> and <START:disease> cardiovascular disease <END> . We have previously demonstrated that <START:ggp> FSAP <END> is present in <START:bf> atherosclerotic plaques <END> and it is a potent inhibitor of <START:bf> vascular smooth muscle proliferation and migration <END> in vitro. The effect of <START:ggp> wild-type (WT)- and MI-FSAP <END> on <START:bf> neointima formation <END> in the <START:organism> mouse <END> <START:anatomy> femoral artery <END> after <START:bf> wire-induced injury <END> was investigated. Local application of <START:ggp> WT-FSAP <END> led to a 70% <START:bf> reduction in the neointima formation <END> , and this effect was dependent on the <START:ggp> protease <END> activity of <START:ggp> FSAP <END> . <START:ggp> MI-FSAP <END> did not inhibit <START:bf> neointima formation <END> in vivo. This is due to a <START:bf> reduced proteolytic activity of MI-FSAP <END> , compared to <START:ggp> WT-FSAP <END> , toward <START:ggp> platelet-derived growth factor BB <END> , a key mediator of <START:bf> neointima development <END> . The inability of <START:ggp> MI-FSAP <END> to inhibit <START:bf> vascular smooth muscle accumulation <END> explains the observed linkage between the <START:bf> MI-polymorphism <END> and increased cardiovascular risk. Hence, <START:ggp> FSAP <END> has a protective function in the <START:anatomy> vasculature <END> , and analysis of <START:bf> MI polymorphism <END> is likely to be clinically relevant in <START:bf> restenosis <END> .
<START:bf> Congenital myocardial sympathetic dysinnervation <END> ( <START:bf> CMSD <END> )--a <START:bf> structural defect <END> of <START:disease> idiopathic long QT syndrome <END> .
Concerning the pathogenetic mechanism of <START:disease> idiopathic long QT syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> LQTS <END> ), the hypothesis of a <START:bf> specific sympathetic imbalance <END> has gained general acceptance, but its validity has never been proven. To test this hypothesis <START:ched> I-123-MIBG <END> , an <START:ched> analogue <END> of <START:ched> norepinephrine <END> and <START:ched> guanethidine <END> , was used to provide scintigraphic display of the efferent <START:bf> cardiac sympathetic innervation <END> . Twelve <START:organism> members <END> of four <START:organism> LQTS families <END> (mean age 38.2 +/- 17.2 years, eight <START:organism> males <END> ) and eight <START:organism> healthy volunteers <END> (mean age 48.2 +/- 13.3 years, five <START:organism> males <END> ) were studied by means of <START:ched> I-123-MIBG <END> single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). A quantitative analysis of all scans was performed. All scans of the <START:organism> healthy volunteers <END> show a <START:bf> uniform tracer uptake <END> with sometimes <START:bf> slightly decreased activity in the apex <END> . (1) All <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:bf> QTc greater than 440 msec <END> (n = 5); (2) all, who had suffered from at least one episode of <START:disease> torsade de pointes <END> , <START:disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> ( <START:disease> VF <END> ) or <START:bf> syncope <END> (n = 5); and (3) all <START:organism> symptomatic patients <END> with <START:bf> QTc prolongation <END> (n = 4) have <START:bf> reduced or abolished (P less than 0.02) MIBG uptakes in the inferior and inferior septal parts of the left ventricle <END> ( <START:bf> congenital myocardial sympathetic dysinnervation <END> [ <START:bf> CMSD <END> ]). Additionally, one <START:organism> female <END> without <START:bf> symptoms <END> or <START:bf> QTc prolongation <END> ( <START:bf> LQT <END> ) shows an <START:bf> abnormal MIBG SPECT <END> similar to the one of her <START:organism> daughter <END> , who has <START:bf> LQT <END> and <START:bf> symptoms <END> . One <START:organism> male <END> without <START:bf> LQT <END> , who had suffered from <START:disease> VF <END> shows <START:bf> CMSD <END> similar to his <START:organism> father <END> , who has <START:bf> LQT <END> , but no <START:bf> symptoms <END> . All <START:organism> members <END> of the <START:organism> families <END> with <START:bf> normal MIBG SPECTs <END> have neither <START:bf> LQT <END> nor <START:bf> symptoms <END> . In all <START:organism> families <END> <START:bf> CMSD <END> fulfills the criteria of <START:bf> autosomal-dominant inheritance <END> . <START:bf> Normal QTc-interval <END> predicted only in 57% <START:bf> normal cardiac sympathetic innervation <END> in the present <START:organism> LQTS families <END> . Therefore, quantitative I-123- <START:ched> MIBG <END> SPECT enables to identify <START:bf> myocardial sympathetic dysinnervation <END> as <START:bf> structural defect <END> in <START:disease> LQTS <END> . <START:bf> CMSD <END> is associated with and without <START:bf> LQT <END> and presents a pattern of <START:bf> autosomal-dominant inheritance <END> . <START:bf> LQT at rest or during exercis <END> e was specific (100%), but less sensitive (63%) in the assessment of <START:bf> CMSD <END> than <START:ched> I-123-MIBG <END> SPECT.
From molecular variant to <START:disease> disease <END> : initial steps in evaluating the association of <START:ggp> transthyretin M119 <END> with <START:disease> disease <END> .
Traditionally, clinical research has sought to determine the molecular basis of <START:bf> clinical signs and symptoms <END> . Increasingly, the traditional process will be reversed, as many <START:ggp> structural protein variants <END> are elucidated as a result of powerful PCR-based methods. Herein we describe a <START:ggp> variant <END> of <START:ggp> transthyretin <END> ( <START:ggp> TTR <END> ) found by direct genomic sequencing and illustrate the utility of PASA (PCR amplification of specific <START:ggp> alleles <END> ) in the initial characterization of such <START:ggp> variants <END> . <START:ggp> TTR <END> is an intriguing <START:ggp> protein <END> of unknown function, but deposition of <START:ggp> mutant TTR <END> produces <START:disease> familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy <END> ( <START:disease> FAP <END> ). We identify a <START:organism> carrier <END> of a <START:ggp> variant TTR <END> in which <START:ggp> threonine119 <END> is changed to <START:ched> methionine <END> ( <START:bf> T119----M <END> ). <START:ggp> T119 <END> is invariant in five <START:organism> mammalian species <END> , suggesting that this <START:ggp> residue <END> is important for normal <START:ggp> protein <END> function. To determine the frequency of the <START:ggp> M119 variant <END> , <START:organism> individuals <END> of northern- and western-European descent were rapidly screened by generating a PASA assay for the sequence change. Four additional <START:organism> individuals <END> were found to be heterozygous for the <START:bf> mutation <END> , for a total of five <START:ggp> M119 alleles <END> in 1,666 <START:ggp> genes <END> (1/333). Clinical records, initial clinical interviews, and <START:organism> family <END> history of these <START:organism> patients <END> hint at a high frequency of early-onset <START:disease> venous insufficiency <END> and perhaps mild <START:disease> renal dysfunction <END> . <START:bf> Haplotype <END> analysis on the <START:organism> heterozygotes <END> could be performed, despite the absence of samples from <START:organism> relatives <END> , by performing "double PASA." The <START:bf> haplotype <END> data suggest that the <START:ggp> M119 variant <END> derives from a <START:organism> common ancestor <END> . The putative functional deficiency caused by <START:ggp> TTR M119 <END> should be most marked in the <START:organism> homozygotes <END> , who can be calculated to occur in 1/100,000 conceptions. If viable, these <START:organism> individuals <END> may provide important clues about the physiological role of <START:ggp> TTR <END> . Although the nature (if any) of <START:disease> disease <END> caused by <START:ggp> TTR M119 <END> remains to be defined, the genetic and clinical data indicate that this <START:bf> mutation <END> does not cause <START:disease> FAP <END> . Future <START:organism> family <END> studies can determine whether the heterozygous state for <START:ggp> TTR M119 <END> cosegregates with a <START:disease> disease <END> or <START:bf> trait <END> .
<START:bf> Deficiency of Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 <END> affects <START:bf> platelet responses <END> and <START:bf> thrombus growth <END> .
<START:anatomy> Platelets <END> are critical for <START:bf> normal hemostasis <END> . Their <START:bf> deregulation <END> can lead to <START:bf> bleeding <END> or to <START:disease> arterial thrombosis <END> , a primary cause of <START:disease> heart attack <END> and ischemic <START:disease> stroke <END> . <START:ggp> Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 <END> ( <START:ggp> SHIP1 <END> ) is a <START:ggp> 5-phosphatase <END> capable of dephosphorylating the <START:ched> phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate <END> <START:ched> second messenger <END> into <START:ched> phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate <END> . <START:ggp> SHIP1 <END> plays a critical role in <START:bf> regulating the level of these 2 lipids in platelets <END> . Using <START:organism> SHIP1-deficient mice <END> , we found that its loss affects <START:bf> platelet aggregation in response to several agonists <END> with minor effects on <START:bf> fibrinogen binding <END> and <START:bf> beta(3) integrin tyrosine phosphorylation <END> . Accordingly, <START:organism> SHIP1-null mice <END> showed <START:bf> defects in arterial thrombus formation in response to a localized laser-induced injury <END> . Moreover, these <START:organism> mice <END> had a <START:bf> prolonged tail bleeding time <END> . Upon stimulation, <START:anatomy> SHIP1-deficient platelets <END> showed <START:bf> large membrane extensions <END> , <START:bf> abnormalities in the open canalicular system <END> , and a <START:bf> dramatic decrease in close cell-cell contacts <END> . Interestingly, <START:ggp> SHIP1 <END> appeared to be required for <START:bf> platelet contractility <END> , <START:bf> thrombus organization <END> , and <START:bf> fibrin clot retraction <END> . These data indicate that <START:ggp> SHIP1 <END> is an important element of the <START:anatomy> platelet <END> signaling machinery to support <START:bf> normal hemostasis <END> . To our knowledge, this is the first report unraveling an important function of <START:ggp> SHIP1 <END> in the <START:bf> activation of hematopoietic cells <END> , in contrast to its well-documented role in the <START:bf> negative regulation of lymphocytes <END> .
<START:bf> Targeted deletion of titin N2B region <END> leads to <START:bf> diastolic dysfunction <END> and <START:bf> cardiac atrophy <END> .
<START:ggp> Titin <END> is a <START:ggp> giant protein <END> that is in charge of the assembly and passive mechanical properties of the sarcomere. <START:ggp> Cardiac titin <END> contains a unique <START:ggp> N2B region <END> , which has been proposed to modulate elasticity of the <START:ggp> titin <END> filament and to be important for <START:bf> hypertrophy signaling <END> and the <START:bf> ischemic stress response <END> through its <START:ggp> binding proteins <END> <START:ggp> FHL2 <END> and <START:ggp> alphaB-crystallin <END> , respectively. To study the role of the <START:ggp> titin N2B region <END> in <START:bf> systole and diastole of the heart <END> , we generated a <START:organism> knockout (KO) mouse <END> deleting only the <START:ggp> N2B exon 49 <END> and leaving the remainder of the <START:ggp> titin gene <END> intact. The resulting <START:organism> mice <END> survived to adulthood and were fertile. Although <START:anatomy> KO hearts <END> were small, they produced <START:bf> normal ejection volumes <END> because of an <START:bf> increased ejection fraction <END> . <START:ggp> FHL2 protein <END> levels were significantly reduced in the <START:organism> KO mice <END> , a finding consistent with the <START:bf> reduced size of KO hearts <END> . Ultrastructural analysis revealed an increased extension of the remaining <START:ggp> spring elements <END> of <START:ggp> titin <END> ( <START:ggp> tandem Ig segments <END> and the <START:ggp> PEVK region <END> ), which, together with the <START:bf> reduced sarcomere length <END> and <START:bf> increased passive tension <END> derived from skinned <START:anatomy> cardiomyocyte <END> experiments, translates to <START:bf> diastolic dysfunction <END> as documented by echocardiography. We conclude from our work that the <START:ggp> titin N2B region <END> is dispensable for <START:bf> cardiac development <END> and <START:bf> systolic properties <END> but is important to integrate <START:bf> trophic and elastic functions <END> of the <START:anatomy> heart <END> . The <START:organism> N2B-KO mouse <END> is the first <START:ggp> titin <END> -based model of <START:bf> diastolic dysfunction <END> and, considering the high prevalence of <START:disease> diastolic heart failure <END> , it could provide future mechanistic insights into the <START:disease> disease <END> process.
Familial neonatal <START:disease> Marfan syndrome <END> due to parental mosaicism of a <START:bf> missense mutation in the FBN1 gene <END> .
We present a <START:organism> family <END> in which three <START:organism> siblings <END> were born with neonatal <START:disease> Marfan syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> MFS <END> ) to <START:organism> unaffected parents <END> . The clinical findings included <START:bf> joint contractures <END> , <START:bf> large ears <END> , <START:bf> loose skin <END> , <START:disease> ectopia lentis <END> , <START:bf> muscular hypoplasia <END> , <START:bf> aortic root dilatation <END> , <START:bf> mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency <END> , and <START:disease> pulmonary emphysema <END> . All three <START:organism> siblings <END> died due to <START:bf> cardiorespiratory insufficiency <END> by 2-4 months of age. Screening of the <START:ggp> FBN1 gene <END> showed the <START:bf> heterozygous c.3257G > A (p.Cys1086Tyr) mutation <END> in the <START:organism> proband <END> . Mosaicism of the <START:bf> mutation <END> was demonstrated in the <START:anatomy> somatic cells <END> and in the <START:anatomy> germ line <END> of the <START:organism> father <END> . Although three <START:organism> examples <END> of parental mosaicism for classical <START:disease> MFS <END> were demonstrated previously, this is the first report of familial occurrence of neonatal <START:disease> MFS <END> due to a <START:bf> heterozygous mutation in FBN1 <END> . In conclusion, the <START:bf> p.Cys1086Tyr mutation in FBN1 <END> is consistently associated with neonatal <START:disease> MFS <END> . Parental mosaicism should always be kept in mind when counseling <START:organism> families <END> with <START:disease> MFS <END> .
<START:bf> Genotype <END> - <START:bf> phenotype <END> correlation and therapeutic rationale in <START:disease> hyperkalemic periodic paralysis <END> .
<START:disease> Familial hyperkalemic periodic paralysis <END> ( <START:disease> PP <END> ) is a <START:disease> dominantly inherited muscle disease <END> characterized by <START:bf> attacks of flaccid weakness <END> and <START:bf> intermittent myotonia <END> . Some <START:organism> patients <END> experience <START:bf> muscle stiffness <END> that is aggravated by cold and exercise, bordering on the diagnosis of <START:disease> paramyotonia congenita <END> . <START:disease> Hyperkalemic PP <END> and <START:disease> paramyotonia congenita <END> are <START:disease> allelic diseases <END> caused by <START:bf> gain-of-function mutations of the skeletal muscle sodium channel, Nav1.4 <END> , which is essential for the <START:bf> generation of skeletal muscle action potentials <END> . In this review, the functional and clinical consequences of the <START:bf> mutations <END> and therapeutic strategies are reported and the differential diagnoses discussed. Also, the question is addressed of whether <START:disease> hyperkalemic PP <END> is truly a different entity than <START:disease> normokalemic PP <END> . Additionally, the differential diagnosis of <START:disease> Andersen-Tawil syndrome <END> in which <START:disease> hyperkalemic PP <END> attacks may occur will be briefly introduced. Last, because <START:disease> hyperkalemic PP <END> has been described to be associated with an <START:bf> R83H mutation of a MiRP2 potassium channel subunit <END> , evidence refuting <START:disease> disease <END> -causality in this <START:organism> case <END> will be discussed.
Further delineation of the <START:bf> phenotype <END> resulting from <START:bf> BRAF or MEK1 germline mutations <END> helps differentiate <START:disease> cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome <END> from <START:disease> Costello syndrome <END> .
Because <START:disease> Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome <END> has significant phenotypic overlap with <START:disease> Costello syndrome <END> , it may be difficult to establish the diagnosis on a clinical basis. The recent discoveries of <START:bf> germline HRAS mutations <END> in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> Costello syndrome <END> and <START:bf> mutations in BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2 <END> in <START:disease> CFC syndrome <END> uncovered the biologic mechanism for the <START:bf> shared phenotypic findings <END> based on the close interaction of the <START:ggp> affected gene products <END> within the <START:bf> MAP kinase pathway <END> . We evaluated a series of <START:organism> patients <END> who were either clinically diagnosed with <START:disease> Costello syndrome <END> , or in whom the diagnoses of both <START:disease> Costello and CFC syndromes <END> were considered. After excluding <START:bf> mutations in HRAS <END> , we identified eight <START:bf> changes in BRAF and five in MEK1 <END> . Five <START:bf> mutations <END> are novel, and all changes occurred de novo among those triads tested. A review of the <START:bf> clinical abnormalities <END> showed important differences between <START:organism> patients <END> with either a <START:bf> BRAF or MEK1 mutation <END> , and those previously reported with an <START:bf> HRAS mutation <END> . Statistical significance was achieved, despite the relatively small number of <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:bf> BRAF and MEK1 mutations <END> reported here, for <START:bf> polyhydramnios <END> , <START:bf> growth hormone deficiency <END> and the presence of more than one <START:disease> papilloma <END> , which were less common in <START:organism> CFC compared to HRAS mutation positive patients <END> . Although both <START:disease> CFC and Costello syndrome <END> are characterized by <START:bf> cardiac abnormalities <END> in about three-fourths of <START:organism> patients <END> , the pattern of <START:disease> congenital heart defects <END> ( <START:disease> CHD <END> ), <START:disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> ( <START:disease> HCM <END> ), and <START:disease> tachycardia <END> differs somewhat. <START:disease> CHD <END> , especially <START:disease> pulmonic stenosis <END> associated with a <START:disease> secundum-type atrial septal defect <END> , are more common in <START:disease> CFC than Costello syndrome <END> (P = 0.02). <START:disease> Atrial tachycardia <END> is less frequent in <START:organism> CFC patients <END> with <START:bf> BRAF or MEK1 mutations <END> , compared to <START:organism> Costello syndrome patients <END> with <START:bf> HRAS mutation <END> (P = 0.04). <START:bf> Chaotic atrial rhythm <END> or <START:disease> multifocal atrial tachycardia <END> was observed only in <START:disease> Costello syndrome <END> . <START:disease> Malignant tumors <END> have been viewed as characteristic for <START:disease> Costello syndrome <END> due to <START:bf> HRAS mutations <END> , however, we report here on a <START:bf> MEK1 mutation <END> in a <START:organism> patient <END> with a <START:disease> malignant tumor <END> , a <START:disease> hepatoblastoma <END> . Although this indicates that the presence of a <START:disease> tumor <END> is not specific for <START:disease> Costello syndrome <END> with <START:bf> HRAS mutation <END> , it is noteworthy that the <START:disease> tumor <END> histology differs from those commonly seen in <START:disease> Costello syndrome <END> . Based on these clinical differences we suggest that <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:bf> BRAF and MEK mutations <END> should be diagnosed with <START:disease> CFC syndrome <END> , and the diagnosis of <START:disease> Costello syndrome <END> be reserved for <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:bf> HRAS mutations <END> .
<START:disease> Fibromuscular dysplasia <END> .
<START:disease> Fibromuscular dysplasia <END> ( <START:disease> FMD <END> ), formerly called <START:disease> fibromuscular fibroplasia <END> , is a group of <START:disease> nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory arterial diseases <END> that most commonly involve the <START:anatomy> renal and carotid arteries <END> . The prevalence of symptomatic <START:anatomy> renal artery <END> <START:disease> FMD <END> is about 4/1000 and the prevalence of cervicocranial <START:disease> FMD <END> is probably half that. Histological classification discriminates three main subtypes, intimal, medial and perimedial, which may be associated in a single <START:organism> patient <END> . Angiographic classification includes the multifocal type, with <START:bf> multiple stenoses <END> and the <START:bf> 'string-of-beads' appearance <END> that is related to medial <START:disease> FMD <END> , and tubular and focal types, which are not clearly related to <START:bf> specific histological lesions <END> . <START:disease> Renovascular hypertension <END> is the <START:bf> most common manifestation <END> of <START:anatomy> renal artery <END> <START:disease> FMD <END> . <START:bf> Multifocal stenoses <END> with the <START:bf> 'string-of-beads' appearance <END> are observed at angiography in more than 80% of <START:organism> cases <END> , mostly in <START:organism> women <END> aged between 30 and 50 years; they generally involve the middle and distal two-thirds of the <START:anatomy> main renal artery <END> and in some <START:organism> case <END> also <START:anatomy> renal artery branches <END> . Cervicocranial <START:disease> FMD <END> can be complicated by dissection with <START:bf> headache <END> , <START:disease> Horner's syndrome <END> or <START:disease> stroke <END> , or can be associated with intracerebral <START:disease> aneurysms <END> with a risk of <START:disease> subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage <END> . The etiology of <START:disease> FMD <END> is unknown, although various hormonal and mechanical factors have been suggested. <START:bf> Subclinical lesions <END> are found at <START:anatomy> arterial sites <END> distant from the <START:bf> stenotic arteries <END> , and this suggests that <START:disease> FMD <END> is a <START:disease> systemic arterial disease <END> . It appears to be familial in 10% of <START:organism> cases <END> . Noninvasive diagnostic tests include, in increasing order of accuracy, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography. The gold standard for diagnosing <START:disease> FMD <END> is catheter angiography, but this invasive procedure is only used for <START:organism> patients <END> in whom it is clinically pertinent to proceed with revascularization during the same procedure. Differential diagnosis include <START:bf> atherosclerotic stenoses <END> and <START:bf> stenoses <END> associated with <START:disease> vascular Ehlers-Danlos and Williams' syndromes <END> , and <START:disease> type 1 neurofibromatosis <END> . Management of <START:organism> cases <END> with <START:disease> renovascular hypertension <END> includes antihypertensive therapy, percutaneous angioplasty of <START:bf> severe stenoses <END> , and reconstructive surgery in <START:organism> cases <END> with complex <START:disease> FMD <END> that extends to <START:anatomy> segmental arteries <END> . The therapeutic options for securing ruptured <START:disease> intracerebral aneurysms <END> are microvascular neurosurgical clipping and endovascular coiling. <START:bf> Stenosis progression <END> in renal artery <START:disease> FMD <END> is slow and rarely leads to ischemic <START:disease> renal failure <END> .
