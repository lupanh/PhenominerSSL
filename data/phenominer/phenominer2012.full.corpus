<START:disease> Heterozygous C2 deficiency <END> associated with <START:disease> angioedema <END> , <START:disease> myasthenia gravis <END> , and <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .
We describe a <START:organism> patient <END> with <START:disease> myasthenia gravis <END> , <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> , and <START:disease> angioedema <END> associated with <START:disease> heterozygous complement factor 2 ( C2 ) deficiency <END> .
The significance of this association is controversial, though the association of <START:disease> C2 deficiency <END> with certain <START:ggp> histocompatibility antigens <END> suggests possible linkage to <START:ggp> immune response genes <END> .
To our knowledge this is the first report of <START:disease> heterozygous C2 deficiency <END> in association with this combination of <START:disease> 'autoimmune' disorders <END> , and we discuss the aetiological implications.
An <START:bf> IgG subclass imbalance <END> in <START:disease> connective tissue disease <END> .
A group of 16 <START:organism> patients <END> with a disproportionate polyclonal increase in their <START:bf> serum IgG1 <END> , resulting in <START:bf> raised concentrations of total IgG immunoglobulin <END> , has been discovered.
The other <START:ggp> IgG subclasses <END> in these <START:organism> patients <END> are either normal or slightly reduced, resulting in an <START:ggp> IgG1 <END> : <START:ggp> IgG2 <END> ratio of at least 10:1.
Most <START:organism> cases <END> are marked by the presence of <START:ggp> anti-extractable nuclear antigen ( anti-ENA ) antibodies <END> and high titres of <START:ggp> rheumatoid factor <END> and <START:ggp> antinuclear antibody <END> .
All but one <START:organism> patient <END> has a <START:disease> connective tissue disease <END> , nearly twice the prevalence found in similarly <START:organism> hypergammaglobulinaemic patients <END> without this <START:bf> IgG subclass imbalance <END> .
Among <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ), those with the <START:bf> IgG1 disorder <END> have a higher prevalence of high titre <START:ggp> rheumatoid factor <END> and <START:ggp> antinuclear antibody <END> , but a lower prevalence of <START:ggp> anti-double-stranded DNA ( anti-dsDNA ) antibodies <END> above 30 U/ml.
It is suggested that this <START:bf> immunoglobulin abnormality <END> may reflect a unique <START:bf> immunoregulatory dysfunction <END> in these <START:organism> patients <END> .
<START:disease> Familial Felty's syndrome <END> .
A <START:organism> family <END> is described in which the <START:organism> mother <END> and 2 of the 5 <START:organism> children <END> had <START:disease> Felty's syndrome <END> , a pattern of <START:bf> inheritance <END> suggesting a <START:bf> dominant defect <END> and one which has not previously been reported.
The <START:organism> family <END> is also of interest in that the other <START:organism> sib <END> had <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
<START:ggp> Hereditary Factors <END> in <START:disease> Rheumatoid Arthritis <END> and <START:disease> Ankylosing Spondylitis <END> 
<START:disease> Complement factor 2 deficiency <END> : a clinical and serological <START:organism> family <END> study.
<START:bf> Inherited complement deficiencies <END> are associated with a variety of <START:disease> connective tissue diseases <END> .
A <START:organism> family <END> with <START:bf> inherited deficiency of complement factor 2 ( C2 ) <END> is described in which two <START:organism> family members <END> with <START:disease> homozygous C2 deficiency <END> developed <START:disease> cutaneous vasculitis <END> and <START:disease> sicca syndrome <END> .
The other <START:organism> family members <END> had <START:disease> heterozygous C2 deficiency <END> and each <START:organism> member <END> had the <START:ggp> HLA-A25, B18, DR2 ( w15 ) haplotype <END> .
The <START:organism> mother <END> had seropositive <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
Further studies showed the presence of <START:ggp> cryoglobulins <END> , <START:ggp> antibodies <END> against <START:anatomy> endothelial cells <END> , and <START:ggp> anticardiolipin antibodies <END> .
<START:disease> Frontometaphyseal dysplasia <END> : autosomal dominant or <START:ggp> X-linked <END> ? 
The clinical and radiographic manifestations in a <START:organism> 45-year-old male <END> with <START:disease> frontometaphyseal dysplasia <END> ( <START:disease> FMD <END> ) are documented and depicted.
<START:bf> Deafness <END> and <START:disease> degenerative osteoarthropathy <END> in <START:bf> weight-bearing joints <END> were the main clinical problems.
<START:bf> Widespread patchy cranial sclerosis <END> was reminiscent of <START:disease> Paget's disease <END> , while <START:bf> digital deformity <END> resembled <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
On the basis of a review and tabulation of published reports, evidence emerges to support the concept of <START:bf> X-linked inheritance <END> .
The relationship between <START:disease> FMD <END> and <START:disease> osteodysplasty <END> remains a matter for speculation.
Confirmation of genetic heterogeneity in <START:disease> familial psoriasis <END> .
<START:disease> Psoriasis <END> affects approximately 2% of the <START:organism> European population <END> and is often familial.
Linkage of a <START:organism> subset <END> of <START:organism> psoriasis families <END> to <START:ggp> loci <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 17q <END> has recently been reported.
We have studied <START:organism> members <END> of a large <START:organism> multiply affected family <END> from the north east of England and analysed <START:ggp> genotypes <END> for <START:ggp> markers <END> from <START:ggp> 17q <END> , including the <START:ggp> polymorphic microsatellite markers <END> <START:ggp> AFM210xa5 <END> , <START:ggp> AFM163yg1 <END> , <START:ggp> AFM044xg3 <END> , <START:ggp> AFMa353yg1 <END> , and <START:ggp> AFM217yd19 <END> .
Two point and multipoint analysis clearly show exclusion of linkage between the <START:ggp> telomeric region <END> of <START:ggp> 17q <END> and <START:disease> psoriasis <END> in this <START:organism> family <END> .
This confirms the genetic heterogeneity of <START:disease> psoriasis <END> and the existence of at least one other <START:ggp> major psoriasis locus <END> .
<START:disease> Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia <END> : report of a <START:organism> family <END> and review.
<START:disease> Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia <END> is an <START:disease> inherited skeletal dysplasia <END> with <START:bf> radiographic changes notably in the spine <END> , similar to <START:disease> spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda <END> .
There is also <START:bf> articular cartilage involvement <END> which gives it some clinical resemblance to <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
We report here on six <START:organism> subjects <END> from one <START:organism> inbred family <END> from Jordan.
Based on previously published reports and this one, we review the clinical and radiological features and discuss the genetics and differential diagnosis of the disorder.
We suggest the addition of the word " spondyloepiphyseal " to the name adopted by the International Working Group on <START:disease> Constitutional Diseases <END> of <START:anatomy> Bone <END> , to become " <START:disease> progressive pseudorheumatoid spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia <END> " .
We also speculate on <START:ggp> candidate genes <END> for this disorder.
A polymorphism of the <START:ggp> CC16 gene <END> is associated with an increased risk of <START:disease> asthma <END> .
Several <START:bf> quantitative traits <END> associated with the <START:bf> asthma phenotype <END> have been linked to <START:ggp> markers <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 11q13 <END> , although the <START:ggp> gene <END> responsible has yet to be well established.
The <START:ggp> gene <END> for <START:ggp> Clara cell secretory protein <END> ( <START:ggp> CC16 <END> ) is an ideal candidate for involvement in an inherited predisposition to <START:disease> asthma <END> because of its chromosomal location, the role of the <START:ggp> CC16 protein <END> in controlling <START:bf> airway inflammation <END> , and <START:bf> differences in levels of the protein <END> between <START:organism> asthmatics <END> and <START:organism> healthy controls <END> .
All three <START:ggp> CC16 exons <END> were screened in an <START:organism> unselected population <END> of 266 <START:organism> subjects <END> from 76 <START:organism> families <END> and a <START:organism> cohort <END> of 52 <START:organism> severely asthmatic children <END> .
A combination of single strand conformational polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis, heteroduplex analysis, <START:ggp> DNA <END> sequencing, and restriction digestion was used.
Mutation detection methods identified an <START:ggp> adenine <END> to <START:ggp> guanine <END> substitution in the <START:ggp> CC16 gene <END> at <START:ggp> position 38 <END> ( A38G ) downstream from the <START:ggp> transcription initiation site <END> within the <START:ggp> non-coding region <END> of <START:ggp> exon 1 <END> .
In the <START:organism> unselected population <END> , 43.6% were homozygous for the <START:ggp> polymorphic sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> 38GG <END> ) and 46.2% were heterozygous ( <START:ggp> 38AG <END> ).
All the <START:organism> asthmatic and unaffected children <END> from both <START:organism> populations <END> were selected for an unmatched <START:organism> case <END> <START:organism> control <END> analysis consisting of 67 <START:organism> asthmatic <END> and 46 <START:organism> unaffected subjects <END> .
Those homozygous for the <START:ggp> published sequence <END> ( <START:ggp> 38AA <END> ) had a 6.9-fold increased risk of developing <START:disease> asthma <END> ( p=0.049 ) and <START:organism> heterozygotes <END> ( <START:ggp> 38AG <END> ) a 4.2-fold increased risk ( p=0.028 ).
Modelling of <START:ggp> genotype <END> as a continuous covariate indicated evidence of a significant linear trend across the three <START:ggp> genotypes <END> ( odds ratio=2.84 per unit increase in <START:ggp> genotype <END> code, p=0.018 ).
These associations were independent of age, gender, and tobacco smoke exposure.
These data and the known anti-inflammatory role of <START:ggp> CC16 <END> in the <START:anatomy> respiratory tract <END> suggest that alteration to the <START:ggp> gene <END> at <START:ggp> position 38 <END> may contribute to <START:disease> asthma <END> .
Maternal <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> and <START:disease> chondrodysplasia punctata <END> in two <START:organism> sibs <END> : phenocopy or coincidence? 
Two <START:organism> sibs <END> with <START:disease> chondrodysplasia punctata <END> in whom the <START:organism> mother <END> was suffering from <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> are presented and the radiological features described.
Comparison with other forms of <START:disease> chondrodysplasia punctata <END> with a review of the relevant publications is presented and the possible association with maternal <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> is highlighted.
<START:disease> Neonatal lupus syndrome <END> : a <START:organism> case <END> with <START:disease> chondrodysplasia punctata <END> and other unusual manifestations.
We report a case of a <START:organism> newborn infant <END> whose <START:organism> mother <END> had <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ) diagnosed before <START:bf> pregnancy <END> .
The <START:organism> child <END> had clinical manifestations of <START:disease> neonatal lupus <END> as well as <START:disease> chondrodysplasia punctata <END> and other findings that resemble the <START:bf> congenital anomalies <END> associated with the use of oral <START:ched> anticoagulants <END> , with no history of exposure.
We speculate that the combined action of the different <START:ggp> maternal autoantibodies <END> may produce the whole spectrum of manifestations.
<START:disease> Chondrodysplasia punctata <END> and maternal <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .
Citrullinated <START:ggp> proteins <END> have increased immunogenicity and arthritogenicity and their presence in <START:anatomy> arthritic joints <END> correlates with <START:bf> disease severity <END> 
<START:ggp> Autoantibodies <END> directed against citrulline-containing <START:ggp> proteins <END> have an impressive specificity of nearly 100% in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> and have been suggested to be involved in the <START:bf> disease pathogenesis <END> .
The targeted <START:ggp> epitopes <END> are generated by a <START:bf> post-translational modification <END> catalysed by the <START:ggp> calcium-dependent enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase <END> ( <START:ggp> PAD <END> ), which converts positively charged <START:ggp> arginine <END> to polar but uncharged <START:ggp> citrulline <END> .
The aim of this study was to explore the effects of <START:bf> citrullination <END> on the immunogenicity of <START:ggp> autoantigens <END> as well as on potential arthritogenicity.
Thus, <START:bf> immune responses <END> to citrullinated <START:ggp> rat serum albumin <END> ( Cit- <START:ggp> RSA <END> ) and to unmodified <START:ggp> rat serum albumin <END> ( <START:ggp> RSA <END> ) were examined as well as <START:disease> arthritis <END> development induced by immunisation with citrullinated <START:ggp> rat collagen type II <END> ( Cit- <START:ggp> CII <END> ) or unmodified <START:ggp> CII <END> .
In addition, to correlate the presence of citrullinated <START:ggp> proteins <END> and the <START:ggp> enzyme <END> <START:ggp> PAD4 <END> with different stages of <START:disease> arthritis <END> , synovial tissues obtained at different time points from <START:organism> rats <END> with <START:disease> collagen-induced arthritis <END> were examined immunohistochemically.
Our results demonstrate that <START:bf> citrullination <END> of the <START:ggp> endogenous antigen <END> <START:ggp> RSA <END> broke <START:bf> immunological tolerance <END> , as was evident by the <START:bf> generation <END> of <START:ggp> antibodies <END> directed against the modified <START:ggp> protein <END> and cross-reacting with the native <START:ggp> protein <END> .
Furthermore we could demonstrate that Cit- <START:ggp> CII <END> induced <START:disease> arthritis <END> with higher incidence and earlier onset than did the native <START:ggp> counterpart <END> .
Finally, this study reveals that clinical signs of <START:disease> arthritis <END> precede the presence of citrullinated <START:ggp> proteins <END> and the <START:ggp> enzyme <END> <START:ggp> PAD4 <END> .
As disease progressed into a more severe and chronic state, products of <START:bf> citrullination <END> appeared specifically in the joints.
Citrullinated <START:ggp> proteins <END> were detected mainly in extracellular deposits but could also be found in infiltrating cells and on the cartilage surface.
<START:ggp> PAD4 <END> was detected in the cytoplasm of infiltrating mononuclear cells, from day 21 after immunisation and onwards.
In conclusion, our data reveal the potency of <START:bf> citrullination <END> to break <START:bf> tolerance against the self antigen <END> <START:ggp> RSA <END> and to increase the arthritogenic properties of the <START:ggp> cartilage antigen CII <END> .
We also show that citrullinated <START:ggp> proteins <END> and the <START:ggp> enzyme <END> <START:ggp> PAD4 <END> are not detectable in healthy joints, and that the appearance and amounts in arthritic joints of experimental animals are correlated with the <START:bf> severity of inflammation <END> .
Genetic Evidence for Interaction of the <START:ggp> 5q31 Cytokine Locus <END> and the <START:ggp> CARD15 Gene <END> in <START:disease> Crohn Disease <END> 
A <START:ggp> common haplotype <END> spanning <START:ggp> 250 kb <END> in the <START:ggp> cytokine gene cluster <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 5q31 <END> has recently been reported to be strongly associated with <START:disease> Crohn disease <END> ( <START:disease> CD <END> ) in <START:organism> Canadian families <END> .
We have replicated this finding by both the transmission-disequilibrium test ( TDT ) ( P =.016 ) and in a <START:organism> case <END> - <START:organism> control <END> association study ( P =.008 ) in a large <START:organism> European cohort <END> of <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> CD <END> , although the increase in disease risk was small ( odds ratio 1.49 for <START:organism> homozygotes <END> , 95% CI 1.11?2.0 ).
No association was detected in <START:organism> families <END> or <START:organism> individuals <END> with <START:disease> ulcerative colitis <END> ( <START:disease> UC <END> ).
Stratification of <START:organism> offspring <END> with <START:disease> CD <END> in the TDT sample by mutation status in the <START:ggp> CD susceptibility gene <END> <START:ggp> CARD15 <END> showed that the association with the <START:ggp> 5q31 risk haplotype <END> was present only in <START:organism> offspring <END> with at least one of the known <START:ggp> CARD15 disease susceptibility alleles <END> ( P =.044 ).
The <START:ggp> 5q31 risk haplotype <END> frequency was 53.1% in <START:organism> unrelated individuals <END> with <START:disease> CD <END> who had one or two <START:ggp> CARD15 <END> mutations versus 43.7% in <START:organism> control subjects <END> ( P =.0001 ) but was not significantly elevated in <START:organism> individuals <END> with <START:disease> CD <END> who had no <START:ggp> CARD15 <END> mutations ( 45.4%, P =.41 ).
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of age at disease onset showed a significantly earlier onset in <START:organism> homozygotes <END> for the <START:ggp> 5q31 risk haplotype <END> ( P =.0019 ).
These findings suggest that genetic variants at the <START:ggp> 5q31 ( IBD5 ) locus <END> may hasten the onset of <START:disease> Crohn disease <END> and cooperate with <START:ggp> CARD15 <END> in disease causation.
Combined Analysis of Genome Scans of <START:organism> Dutch and Finnish Families <END> Reveals a <START:ggp> Susceptibility Locus <END> for <START:ggp> High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol <END> on <START:ggp> Chromosome 16q <END> 
Several genomewide screens have been performed to identify novel <START:ggp> loci <END> predisposing to <START:bf> unfavorable serum lipid levels <END> and <START:disease> coronary heart disease <END> ( <START:disease> CHD <END> ).
We hypothesized that the accumulating data of these screens in different <START:organism> study populations <END> could be combined to verify which of the identified <START:ggp> loci <END> truly harbor <START:ggp> susceptibility genes <END> .
The power of this strategy has recently been demonstrated with other <START:disease> complex diseases <END> , such as <START:disease> inflammatory bowel disease <END> and <START:disease> asthma <END> .
We assessed the largely unknown <START:ggp> genetic background <END> of <START:disease> CHD <END> by investigating the most common <START:disease> dyslipidemia <END> predisposing to <START:disease> CHD <END> , <START:disease> familial combined hyperlipidemia <END> ( <START:disease> FCHL <END> ), affecting 1%?2% of <START:organism> Western populations <END> and 10%?20% of <START:organism> families <END> with premature <START:disease> CHD <END> .
To be able to perform a combined data analysis, we unified the diagnostic criteria for <START:disease> FCHL <END> and its <START:bf> component traits <END> and combined the data from two genomewide scans performed in two <START:organism> populations <END> , the <START:organism> Finns <END> and the <START:organism> Dutch <END> .
As a result of our pooled data analysis, we identified three <START:ggp> chromosomal regions <END> , on <START:ggp> chromosomes 2p25.1 <END> , <START:ggp> 9p23 <END> , and <START:ggp> 16q24.1 <END> , exceeding the statistical significance level of a LOD score >2.0.
The <START:ggp> 2p25.1 region <END> was detected for the <START:bf> FCHL trait <END> , and the <START:ggp> 9p23 <END> and <START:ggp> 16q24.1 regions <END> were detected for the <START:bf> low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) trait <END> .
In addition, the previously recognized <START:ggp> 1q21 region <END> also obtained additional support in the other study sample, when the <START:bf> triglyceride trait <END> was used.
Analysis of the <START:ggp> 16q24.1 region <END> resulted in a statistically significant LOD score of 3.6 when the data from <START:organism> Finnish families <END> with <START:bf> low HDL-C <END> were included in the analysis.
To search for the <START:ggp> underlying gene <END> in the <START:ggp> 16q24.1 region <END> , we investigated a novel <START:ggp> functional and positional candidate gene <END> , <START:ggp> helix/forkhead transcription factor <END> ( <START:ggp> FOXC2 <END> ), by sequencing and by genotyping of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the <START:organism> families <END> .
<START:ggp> MDR1 Ala893 <END> Polymorphism Is Associated with <START:disease> Inflammatory Bowel Disease <END> 
<START:disease> Crohn disease <END> ( <START:disease> CD <END> ) and <START:disease> ulcerative colitis <END> ( <START:disease> UC <END> ) are overlapping <START:disease> chronic inflammatory bowel diseases <END> ( <START:disease> IBDs <END> ).
Suggestive evidence for linkage at <START:ggp> chromosome 7q <END> has been reported for both <START:disease> CD <END> and <START:disease> UC <END> .
Contained within this <START:ggp> region <END> is the <START:ggp> gene <END> for <START:ggp> MDR1 <END> ( <START:ggp> m ulti d rug r esistance <END> ), a <START:ggp> membrane transport protein <END> for which <START:organism> human <END> polymorphisms have been reported in Ala893Ser/Thr and C3435T that alter pharmacokinetic profiles for a variety of <START:ched> drugs <END> .
Because <START:organism> mdr1 knockout mice <END> spontaneously develop <START:disease> colitis <END> , <START:ggp> exonic regions <END> were resequenced and tested for <START:disease> IBD <END> association in a large, <START:organism> multicenter North American cohort <END> .
Two missense mutations, Asn21Asp and Ala893Ser/Thr, as well as the <START:bf> expression <END> -associated polymorphism C3435T, described elsewhere, were genotyped in the entire <START:organism> cohort <END> .
Significant association of <START:ggp> Ala893 <END> with <START:disease> IBD <END> was observed by both <START:organism> case <END> - <START:organism> control <END> analysis ( P =.002 ) and the <START:organism> pedigree <END> disequilibrium test ( PDT [ P =.00020?.00030 ] ) but not for the Asn21Asp or C3435T polymorphisms.
Significant association by PDT was observed within the <START:organism> subset <END> with <START:disease> CD <END> ( P =.0014?.00090 ), with similar, nonsignificant trends in a smaller <START:organism> subset <END> with <START:disease> UC <END> .
The Ala893Ser/Thr variant is triallelic, and the associated, <START:ggp> common allele <END> is <START:ggp> Ala893 <END> , with undertransmission of the <START:ggp> 893Ser <END> ( common ) and the <START:ggp> 893Thr ( rare ) variants <END> .
The <START:ggp> Ala893 variant <END> has decreased activity compared with the <START:ggp> 893Ser variant <END> ; therefore, the association with <START:disease> human IBD <END> is consistent with the <START:organism> murine model <END> of <START:bf> mdr1 deficiency <END> .
Taken together, these data support the association of the common <START:ggp> Ala893 <END> polymorphism with <START:disease> IBD <END> specifically and, more broadly, provides additional support for its contribution to interindividual pharmacogenetic variation.
<START:ggp> IBD5 <END> is a General Risk Factor for <START:disease> Inflammatory Bowel Disease <END> : Replication of Association with <START:disease> Crohn Disease <END> and Identification of a Novel Association with <START:disease> Ulcerative Colitis <END> 
<START:disease> Inflammatory bowel disease <END> ( <START:disease> IBD <END> ) refers to <START:disease> complex chronic relapsing autoimmune disorders <END> of the <START:anatomy> gastrointestinal tract <END> that have been traditionally classified into <START:disease> Crohn disease <END> ( <START:disease> CD <END> ) and <START:disease> ulcerative colitis <END> ( <START:disease> UC <END> ).
We have previously reported that genetic variation within a <START:ggp> 250-kb haplotype <END> ( <START:ggp> IBD5 <END> ) in the <START:ggp> 5q31 cytokine gene cluster <END> confers <START:bf> susceptibility to CD <END> in a <START:organism> Canadian population <END> .
In the current study, we first replicated this association by examining 368 <START:organism> German trios <END> with <START:disease> CD <END> and demonstrating, by transmission/disequilibrium testing ( TDT ), that the same <START:ggp> haplotype <END> is associated with <START:disease> CD <END> ( ? 2 =5.97 ; P =.007 ).
Our original association study focused on the role of <START:ggp> IBD5 <END> in <START:disease> CD <END> ; we next explored the potential contribution of this <START:ggp> locus <END> to <START:bf> UC susceptibility <END> in 187 <START:organism> German trios <END> .
Given the TDT results in the <START:organism> present cohort <END> with <START:disease> UC <END> , <START:ggp> IBD5 <END> may also act as a <START:ggp> susceptibility locus <END> for <START:disease> UC <END> ( ? 2 =8.10 ; P =.002 ).
We then examined <START:ggp> locus <END> - <START:ggp> locus <END> interactions between <START:ggp> IBD5 <END> and <START:ggp> CARD15 <END> , a <START:ggp> locus <END> reported elsewhere to confer risk exclusively to <START:disease> CD <END> .
Our current results indicate that the two <START:ggp> loci <END> act independently to confer risk to <START:disease> CD <END> but that these two <START:ggp> loci <END> may behave in an epistatic fashion to promote the development of <START:disease> UC <END> .
Moreover, <START:ggp> IBD5 <END> was not associated with particular clinical manifestations upon phenotypic stratification in the <START:organism> current cohort <END> with <START:disease> CD <END> .
Taken together, our results suggest that <START:ggp> IBD5 <END> may act as a general risk factor for <START:disease> IBD <END> , with <START:ggp> loci <END> such as <START:ggp> CARD15 <END> modifying the clinical characteristics of disease.
<START:ggp> Common and Unique Susceptibility Loci <END> in <START:disease> Graves and Hashimoto Diseases <END> : Results of Whole-Genome Screening in a Data Set of 102 <START:organism> Multiplex Families <END> 
The <START:disease> autoimmune thyroid diseases <END> ( <START:disease> AITDs <END> ), comprising <START:disease> Graves disease <END> ( <START:disease> GD <END> ) and <START:disease> Hashimoto thyroiditis <END> ( <START:disease> HT <END> ), develop as a result of a complex interaction between <START:ggp> predisposing genes <END> and environmental triggers.
Previously, we identified six <START:ggp> loci <END> that showed evidence for linkage with <START:disease> AITD <END> in a data set of 56 <START:organism> multiplex families <END> .
The goals of the present study were to replicate/reject the previously identified <START:ggp> loci <END> before fine mapping and sequencing the <START:ggp> candidate genes <END> in these <START:ggp> regions <END> .
We performed a whole-genome linkage study in an expanded data set of 102 <START:organism> multiplex families <END> with <START:disease> AITD <END> ( 540 <START:organism> individuals <END> ), through use of 400 <START:ggp> microsatellite markers <END> .
Seven <START:ggp> loci <END> showed evidence for linkage to <START:disease> AITD <END> .
Three <START:ggp> loci <END> , on <START:ggp> chromosomes 6p <END> , <START:ggp> 8q <END> , and <START:ggp> 10q <END> , showed evidence for linkage with both <START:disease> GD <END> and <START:disease> HT <END> ( maximum multipoint heterogeneity LOD scores [HLOD] 2.0, 3.5, and 4.1, respectively ).
Three <START:ggp> loci <END> showed evidence for linkage with <START:disease> GD <END> : on <START:ggp> 7q <END> ( HLOD 2.3 ), <START:ggp> 14q <END> ( HLOD 2.1 ), and <START:ggp> 20q <END> ( LOD 3.3, in a <START:organism> subset <END> of the <START:organism> families <END> ).
One <START:ggp> locus <END> on <START:ggp> 12q <END> showed evidence of linkage with <START:disease> HT <END> , giving an HLOD of 3.4.
Comparison with the results obtained in the original data set showed that the <START:ggp> 20q <END> ( <START:ggp> GD-2 <END> ) and <START:ggp> 12q ( HT-2 ) loci <END> continued to show evidence for linkage in the expanded data set; the <START:ggp> 6p <END> and <START:ggp> 14q loci <END> were located within the same <START:ggp> region <END> as the previously identified <START:ggp> 6p <END> and <START:ggp> 14q loci <END> ( <START:ggp> AITD-1 <END> and <START:ggp> GD-1 <END> , respectively ), but the <START:ggp> Xq <END> ( <START:ggp> GD-3 <END> ) and <START:ggp> 13q ( HT-1 ) loci <END> were not replicated in the expanded data set.
These results demonstrated that multiple <START:ggp> genes <END> may predispose to <START:disease> GD <END> and <START:disease> HT <END> and that some may be common to both diseases and some are unique.
The <START:ggp> loci <END> that continue to show evidence for linkage in the expanded data set represent <START:ggp> serious candidate regions <END> for <START:ggp> gene <END> identification.
<START:ggp> CARD15 <END> : a <START:ggp> Pleiotropic Autoimmune Gene <END> That Confers <START:bf> Susceptibility to Psoriatic Arthritis <END> 
A recent genomewide scan in <START:disease> psoriatic arthritis <END> ( <START:disease> PsA <END> ) revealed a <START:ggp> susceptibility locus <END> at <START:ggp> 16q <END> .
This <START:ggp> region <END> overlaps <START:ggp> CARD15 <END> , a <START:ggp> susceptibility gene <END> in <START:disease> Crohn disease <END> .
The possibility of a <START:ggp> common susceptibility gene <END> between <START:disease> PsA <END> and <START:disease> Crohn disease <END> is further supported by epidemiological studies that note an increased incidence of <START:disease> psoriasis <END> in <START:organism> subjects <END> with <START:disease> Crohn <END> .
We screened 187 <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> PsA <END> and 136 <START:organism> healthy controls <END> , all from Newfoundland, for the three <START:ggp> common, independent sequence variants <END> of <START:ggp> CARD15 <END> ( <START:ggp> R702W <END> , <START:ggp> leu1007fsinsC <END> , and <START:ggp> G908R <END> ), which were detected by <START:ggp> polymerase <END> chain reaction by use of <START:ggp> allele-specific primers <END> and visualized through gel electrophoresis.
In total, 53/187 ( 28.3% ) <START:organism> probands <END> with <START:disease> PsA <END> had at least one <START:ggp> variant <END> of the <START:ggp> CARD15 gene <END> , compared with 16/136 ( 11.8% ) <START:organism> controls <END> ( odds ratio 2.97; 95% confidence interval 1.61?5.47; P =.0005 ).
<START:ggp> Allele <END> frequencies of <START:ggp> R702W <END> , <START:ggp> leu1007fsinsC <END> , and <START:ggp> G908R <END> were 10.43%, 3.21%, and 1.61%, respectively, in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> PsA <END> , compared with 3.31%, 2.57%, and 0.37%, respectively, in the <START:organism> control patients <END> .
<START:ggp> CARD15 <END> conferred <START:bf> susceptibility to PsA <END> independent of <START:ggp> HLA-Cw*0602 <END> .
Thus, <START:ggp> CARD15 <END> represents a <START:ggp> pleiotropic autoimmune gene <END> and is the first <START:ggp> non-MHC gene <END> to be associated with <START:disease> PsA <END> .
A <START:ggp> stop codon <END> polymorphism of <START:ggp> Toll-like receptor 5 <END> is associated with <START:bf> resistance <END> to <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> 
<START:disease> Systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ) is an <START:disease> autoimmune disease <END> with a complex genetic basis that includes <START:ggp> susceptibility gene( s ) <END> within the <START:ggp> chromosome 1q41?1q42 region <END> .
<START:ggp> Toll-like receptor 5 <END> ( <START:ggp> TLR5 <END> ), the <START:ggp> innate immune receptor <END> for <START:ggp> bacterial flagellin <END> , maps to <START:ggp> chromosome 1q41 <END> and contains a common <START:ggp> stop codon <END> polymorphism that abrogates <START:bf> signaling <END> ( <START:ggp> allele C1174T <END> ) and is associated with an increased risk of <START:disease> infection <END> .
By using transmission disequilibrium testing in a <START:organism> cohort <END> containing 199 <START:organism> affected patients <END> and their 75 <START:organism> unaffected siblings <END> and 326 <START:organism> parents <END> , we found that <START:ggp> allele 1174C <END> , but not <START:ggp> 1174T <END> ( with the <START:ggp> stop codon <END> ), was preferentially transmitted to <START:organism> SLE-affected offspring <END> ( a 19:6 transmitted/not transmitted ratio, P = 0.009 ).
In contrast, the <START:ggp> alleles <END> of the other three <START:ggp> TLR5 <END> SNPs did not exhibit <START:bf> preferential transmission <END> .
In addition, we found that <START:ggp> allele 1174C <END> was not preferentially transmitted to <START:organism> unaffected offspring <END> ( 3:6 transmitted/not transmitted ratio, P value not significant ).
The <START:ggp> allele <END> frequency of <START:ggp> 1174T <END> in the <START:organism> probands <END> was 3.2% compared with 5.8% in <START:organism> unaffected individuals <END> , which was consistent with a protective association ( odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.26?0.98; P = 0.041 ).
<START:organism> Subjects <END> with the <START:ggp> TLR5 stop codon <END> produced <START:bf> significantly lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines <END> in comparison with <START:organism> individuals <END> with the <START:ggp> wild-type genotype <END> .
Together, these results indicate that the <START:ggp> TLR5 stop codon <END> polymorphism is associated with <START:bf> protection <END> from the development of <START:disease> SLE <END> .
These data support a role for f <START:organism> lagellated bacteria <END> and the <START:bf> innate immune response <END> in the development of <START:disease> SLE <END> with implications for novel immunomodulatory treatment strategies.
Linkage at <START:ggp> 12q24 <END> with <START:disease> Systemic Lupus Erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ) Is Established and Confirmed in <START:organism> Hispanic and European American Families <END> 
<START:disease> Systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:ggp> SLE <END> ) is a <START:disease> chronic, complex, and systemic human autoimmune disease <END> , with both an environmental component and a heritable predisposition.
Clinical studies, reinforced by epidemiology and genetics, show impressive variation in <START:bf> disease severity <END> , expression, prevalence, and incidence by ethnicity and sex.
To identify the novel <START:ggp> SLE susceptibility loci <END> , we performed a genomewide scan with 318 <START:ggp> markers <END> on 37 <START:organism> multiplex Hispanic families <END> , using a nonparametric penetrance-independent affected-only <START:ggp> allele <END> -sharing method.
Three <START:ggp> chromosomal regions <END> ( <START:ggp> 12q24 <END> , <START:ggp> 16p13 <END> , and <START:ggp> 16q12-21 <END> ) exceeded our predetermined threshold ( Z lr >2.32 ; nominal P <.01 ) for further evaluation.
Suspected linkages at <START:ggp> 12q24 <END> , <START:ggp> 16p13 <END> , and <START:ggp> 16q12-21 <END> were tested in an independent data set consisting of 92 <START:organism> European American <END> ( <START:organism> EA-1 <END> ) and 55 <START:organism> African American ( AA ) families <END> .
The linkage at <START:ggp> 12q24 <END> was replicated in <START:organism> EA-1 <END> ( Z lr =3.06 ; P =.001 ) but not in <START:organism> AA <END> ( Z lr =0.37 ; P =.35 ).
Although neither the <START:ggp> 16p13 <END> nor the <START:ggp> 16q12-21 <END> was confirmed in <START:organism> EA-1 <END> or <START:organism> AA <END> , the suggestive linkage ( Z lr =3.06 ; P =.001 ) at <START:ggp> 16q12-21 <END> is sufficient to confirm the significant linkage, reported elsewhere, at this location.
The evidence for linkage at <START:ggp> 12q24 <END> in the 129 <START:organism> combined ( Hispanic and EA-1 ) families <END> exceeded the threshold for genomewide significance ( Z lr =4.39 ; P =5.7×10 -6 ; nonparametric LOD =4.19 ).
Parametric linkage analyses suggested a low-penetrance, dominant model ( LOD =3.72 ).
To confirm the linkage effect at <START:ggp> 12q24 <END> , we performed linkage analysis in another <START:organism> set <END> of 82 <START:organism> independent European American families <END> ( <START:organism> EA-2 <END> ).
The evidence for linkage was confirmed ( Z lr =2.11 ; P =.017 ).
Therefore, our results have detected, established, and confirmed the existence of a novel <START:ggp> SLE susceptibility locus <END> at <START:ggp> 12q24 <END> ( designated ? <START:ggp> SLEB4 <END> ? ) that may cause <START:disease> lupus <END> , especially in <START:organism> Hispanic and European American families <END> .
Whole-Genome Scan, in a <START:disease> Complex Disease <END> , Using 11,245 Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms: Comparison with <START:ggp> Microsatellites <END> 
Despite the theoretical evidence of the utility of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) for linkage analysis, no whole-genome scans of a <START:disease> complex disease <END> have yet been published to directly compare SNPs with <START:ggp> microsatellites <END> .
Here, we describe a whole-genome screen of 157 <START:organism> families <END> with <START:organism> multiple cases <END> of <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:disease> RA <END> ), performed using 11,245 genomewide SNPs.
The results were compared with those from a 10-cM <START:ggp> microsatellite <END> scan in the <START:organism> same cohort <END> .
The SNP analysis detected <START:ggp> HLA*DRB1 <END> , the <START:ggp> major RA susceptibility locus <END> ( P =.00004 ), with a linkage <START:ggp> interval <END> of 31 cM, compared with a <START:ggp> 50-cM linkage interval <END> detected by the <START:ggp> microsatellite <END> scan.
In addition, four <START:ggp> loci <END> were detected at a nominal significance level ( P <.05 ) in the SNP linkage analysis; these were not observed in the <START:ggp> microsatellite <END> scan.
We demonstrate that variation in information content was the main factor contributing to observed differences in the two scans, with the SNPs providing significantly higher information content than the <START:ggp> microsatellites <END> .
Reducing the number of SNPs in the <START:ggp> marker <END> set to 3,300 ( 1-cM spacing ) caused several <START:ggp> loci <END> to drop below nominal significance levels, suggesting that decreases in information content can have significant effects on linkage results.
In contrast, differences in maps employed in the analysis, the low detectable rate of genotyping error, and the presence of moderate linkage disequilibrium between <START:ggp> markers <END> did not significantly affect the results.
We have demonstrated the utility of a dense SNP map for performing linkage analysis in a <START:disease> late-age-at-onset disease <END> , where <START:ggp> DNA <END> from <START:organism> parents <END> is not always available.
The high SNP density allows <START:ggp> loci <END> to be defined more precisely and provides a partial scaffold for association studies, substantially reducing the resource requirement for <START:ggp> gene <END> -mapping studies.
Genetic Association of the R620W Polymorphism of <START:ggp> Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase <END> <START:ggp> PTPN22 <END> with <START:disease> Human SLE <END> 
We genotyped 525 <START:organism> independent North American white individuals <END> with <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ) for the <START:ggp> PTPN22 <END> R620W polymorphism and compared the results with data generated from 1,961 <START:organism> white control individuals <END> .
The R620W SNP was associated with <START:disease> SLE <END> ( genotypic P =.00009 ), with estimated <START:ggp> minor ( T ) allele <END> frequencies of 12.67% in <START:organism> SLE cases <END> and 8.64% in <START:organism> controls <END> .
A single copy of the <START:ggp> T allele <END> ( <START:ggp> W620 <END> ) increases risk of <START:disease> SLE <END> ( odds ratio [ OR ]=1.37 ; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07?1.75 ), and two copies of the <START:ggp> allele <END> more than double this risk ( OR =4.37 ; 95% CI 1.98?9.65 ).
Together with recent evidence showing association of this SNP with <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> and <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> , these data provide compelling evidence that <START:ggp> PTPN22 <END> plays a fundamental role in regulating the <START:anatomy> immune system <END> and the development of <START:bf> autoimmunity <END> .
The <START:ggp> IL12B Gene <END> Is Associated with <START:disease> Asthma <END> 
The <START:ggp> IL12B gene <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 5q31-33 <END> encodes the <START:ggp> p40 subunit <END> of <START:ggp> interleukin 12 <END> , an <START:ggp> immunomodulatory cytokine <END> .
To test the hypothesis that the <START:ggp> IL12B gene <END> contains polymorphisms associated with <START:disease> asthma <END> , we genotyped six <START:ggp> haplotype <END> -tagging polymorphisms in the <START:ggp> IL12B gene <END> , both in 708 <START:organism> children <END> enrolled in the Childhood <START:disease> Asthma <END> Management Program ( CAMP ) and in their <START:organism> parents <END> .
Using the <START:organism> family <END> -based association test ( FBAT ) program and its <START:ggp> haplotype <END> ( HBAT ) and phenotype ( PBAT ) options, we tested each polymorphism and <START:ggp> haplotype <END> for association with <START:disease> asthma <END> and <START:bf> asthma-related phenotypes <END> .
We tested positive associations for replication in a <START:organism> case <END> - <START:organism> control <END> study comparing 177 <START:organism> adult moderate-to-severe asthmatics <END> with 177 <START:organism> nonasthmatic controls <END> .
In <START:organism> whites <END> in the <START:organism> CAMP cohort <END> , the <START:ggp> A allele <END> of the <START:ggp> IL12B <END> G4237A polymorphism was undertransmitted to <START:organism> asthmatic children <END> ( P =.0008 , recessive model ), the global test for <START:ggp> haplotypes <END> for affection status was positive ( P =.009 , multiallelic ? 2 ), and two polymorphisms were associated with different <START:bf> atopy phenotypes <END> .
In addition, we found a strong association between the <START:ggp> IL12B_4237 <END> and <START:ggp> IL12B_6402 <END> polymorphisms and an <START:bf> asthma-severity phenotype <END> in <START:organism> whites <END> , which we also found in the <START:organism> independent population <END> of <START:organism> white adult asthmatics <END> .
<START:ggp> IL12B <END> may be an <START:ggp> important asthma gene <END> .
Fine Mapping and Positional Candidate Studies Identify <START:ggp> HLA-G <END> as an <START:ggp> Asthma Susceptibility Gene <END> on <START:ggp> Chromosome 6p21 <END> 
<START:disease> Asthma <END> affects nearly 14 million <START:organism> people <END> worldwide and has been steadily increasing in frequency for the past 50 years.
Although environmental factors clearly influence the onset, progression, and <START:bf> severity <END> of this disease, <START:organism> family <END> and <START:organism> twin <END> studies indicate that genetic variation also influences <START:bf> susceptibility <END> .
Linkage of <START:disease> asthma <END> and <START:bf> related phenotypes <END> to <START:ggp> chromosome 6p21 <END> has been reported in seven genome screens, making it the most replicated <START:ggp> region <END> of the genome.
However, because many <START:ggp> genes <END> with individually small effects are likely to contribute to risk, identification of <START:ggp> asthma susceptibility loci <END> has been challenging.
In this study, we present evidence from four <START:organism> independent samples <END> in support of <START:ggp> HLA-G <END> as a novel <START:ggp> asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness susceptibility gene <END> in the <START:ggp> human leukocyte antigen region <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 6p21 <END> , and we speculate that this gene might contribute to risk for other <START:disease> inflammatory diseases <END> that show linkage to this region.
Polymorphisms in the <START:ggp> Tyrosine Kinase 2 <END> and <START:ggp> Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 Genes <END> Are Associated with <START:disease> Systemic Lupus Erythematosus <END> 
<START:disease> Systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:ggp> SLE <END> ) is a <START:disease> complex systemic autoimmune disease <END> caused by both genetic and environmental factors.
Genome scans in <START:organism> families <END> with <START:ggp> SLE <END> point to multiple potential <START:ggp> chromosomal regions <END> that harbor <START:ggp> SLE susceptibility genes <END> , and association studies in different <START:organism> populations <END> have suggested several <START:ggp> susceptibility alleles <END> for <START:disease> SLE <END> .
<START:bf> Increased production of type I interferon <END> ( <START:ggp> IFN <END> ) and <START:bf> expression of IFN-inducible genes <END> is commonly observed in <START:disease> SLE <END> and may be pivotal in the <START:bf> molecular pathogenesis <END> of the disease.
We analyzed 44 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 13 <START:ggp> genes <END> from the <START:ggp> type I IFN <END> pathway in 679 <START:organism> Swedish, Finnish, and Icelandic patients <END> with <START:disease> SLE <END> , in 798 <START:organism> unaffected family members <END> , and in 438 <START:organism> unrelated control individuals <END> for joint linkage and association with <START:disease> SLE <END> .
In two of the genes?the <START:ggp> tyrosine kinase 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> TYK2 <END> ) and <START:ggp> IFN regulatory factor 5 ( IRF5 ) genes <END> ?we identified SNPs that displayed strong signals in joint analysis of linkage and association ( unadjusted P <10 -7 ) with <START:disease> SLE <END> .
<START:ggp> TYK2 <END> binds to the <START:ggp> type I IFN receptor complex <END> and <START:ggp> IRF5 <END> is a regulator of <START:bf> type I IFN gene expression <END> .
Thus, our results support a disease mechanism in <START:disease> SLE <END> that involves key components of the <START:ggp> type I IFN <END> system.
Regression Mapping of Association between the <START:ggp> Human Leukocyte Antigen Region <END> and <START:disease> Graves Disease <END> 
The <START:ggp> human leukocyte antigen class II genes <END> <START:ggp> DRB1 <END> , <START:ggp> DQB1 <END> , and <START:ggp> DQA1 <END> are associated with <START:disease> Graves disease <END> ( <START:ggp> GD <END> ), but, because of strong linkage disequilibrium within this region, the primary etiological variant( s ) remains unknown.
In the present study, 871 <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> GD <END> and 621 <START:organism> control subjects <END> were genotyped at the <START:ggp> DRB1 <END> , <START:ggp> DQB1 <END> , and <START:ggp> DQA1 loci <END> .
All three loci were associated with <START:disease> GD <END> ( P =1.45×10 -12 , P =3.20×10 -5 , and P =9.26×10 -12 , respectively ).
Stepwise logistic-regression analysis showed that the association could be explained by either <START:ggp> DRB1 <END> or <START:ggp> DQA1 <END> but not by <START:ggp> DQB1 <END> .
To extend previous results, the amino acid sequence of the <START:ggp> exon 2?encoded peptide-binding domain <END> of <START:ggp> DRB1 <END> was predicted for each <START:organism> subject <END> , and, by use of logistic regression, each position was analyzed for association with <START:disease> GD <END> .
Of 102 <START:ggp> amino acids <END> , 70 were uninformative; of the remaining 32 <START:ggp> amino acids <END> , 13 were associated with <START:disease> GD <END> ( P values ranged from 2.20×10 -4 to 1.2×10 -12 ).
The strongest association was at <START:ggp> position ?74 <END> .
This analysis is consistent with the possibility that <START:ggp> position ?74 <END> of <START:ggp> exon 2 <END> of the <START:ggp> DRB1 molecule <END> may have a specific and central role in <START:bf> autoantigen presentation <END> by <START:ggp> DRB1 <END> to <START:anatomy> T lymphocytes <END> .
However, we cannot yet exclude a primary role for <START:ggp> DQA1 <END> or for other polymorphisms that affect <START:ggp> DRB1 <END> function or <START:bf> expression <END> .
Analysis of <START:organism> Families <END> in the <START:disease> Multiple Autoimmune Disease <END> Genetics Consortium ( MADGC ) Collection: the <START:ggp> PTPN22 620W Allele <END> Associates with <START:bf> Multiple Autoimmune Phenotypes <END> 
<START:disease> Autoimmune disorders <END> constitute a diverse group of phenotypes with overlapping features and a tendency toward familial aggregation.
It is likely that <START:ggp> common underlying genes <END> are involved in these disorders.
Until very recently, no specific <START:ggp> alleles <END> ?aside from a few common <START:ggp> human leukocyte antigen class II genes <END> ?had been identified that clearly associate with multiple different <START:disease> autoimmune diseases <END> .
In this study, we describe a unique collection of 265 <START:organism> multiplex families <END> assembled by the <START:disease> Multiple Autoimmune Disease <END> Genetics Consortium ( MADGC ).
At least two of nine ?core? <START:disease> autoimmune diseases <END> are present in each of these <START:organism> families <END> .
These core diseases include <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:disease> RA <END> ), <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ), <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> ( <START:disease> T1D <END> ), <START:disease> multiple sclerosis <END> ( <START:disease> MS <END> ), <START:disease> autoimmune thyroid disease <END> ( <START:disease> Hashimoto thyroiditis <END> or <START:disease> Graves disease <END> ), <START:disease> juvenile RA <END> , <START:disease> inflammatory bowel disease <END> ( <START:disease> Crohn disease <END> or <START:disease> ulcerative colitis <END> ), <START:disease> psoriasis <END> , and <START:disease> primary Sjögren syndrome <END> .
We report that a recently described functional single-nucleotide polymorphism ( rs2476601, encoding <START:ggp> R620W <END> ) in the intracellular <START:ggp> tyrosine phosphatase <END> ( <START:ggp> PTPN22 <END> ) confers risk of four separate <START:bf> autoimmune phenotype <END> s in these <START:organism> families <END> : <START:disease> T1D <END> , <START:disease> RA <END> , <START:disease> SLE <END> , and <START:disease> Hashimoto thyroiditis <END> .
<START:disease> MS <END> did not show association with the <START:ggp> PTPN22 risk allele <END> .
These findings suggest a common underlying etiologic pathway for some, but not all, <START:disease> autoimmune disorders <END> , and they suggest that <START:disease> MS <END> may have a <START:bf> pathogenesis <END> that is distinct from <START:disease> RA <END> , <START:disease> SLE <END> , and <START:disease> T1D <END> .
<START:ggp> DNA <END> and clinical data for the <START:organism> MADGC families <END> are available to the scientific community; these data will provide a valuable resource for the dissection of the <START:ggp> complex genetic factors <END> that underlie the various <START:bf> autoimmune phenotypes <END> .
<START:ggp> Gene <END> -Environment Interaction Effects on the Development of <START:bf> Immune Responses <END> in the 1st Year of Life 
<START:disease> Asthma <END> is a common disease that results from both genetic and environmental risk factors.
<START:organism> Children <END> attending day care in the 1st year of life have lower risks for developing <START:disease> asthma <END> , although the mechanism for this ?day care? effect is largely unknown.
We investigated the interactions between day care exposure in the 1st 6 mo of life and <START:ggp> genotypes <END> for 72 polymorphisms at 45 <START:ggp> candidate loci <END> and their effects on <START:bf> cytokine response <END> profiles and on the development of <START:bf> atopic phenotypes <END> in the 1st year of life in the <START:organism> C hildhood O nset of Ast hma ( COAST ) cohort <END> of <START:organism> children <END> .
Six interactions ( at four polymorphisms in three <START:ggp> loci <END> ) with ?day care? that had an effect on <START:bf> early-life immune phenotypes <END> were significant at P <.001 .
The estimated false-discovery rate was 33%, indicating that an estimated four P values correspond to true associations.
Moreover, the ?day care? effect at some <START:ggp> loci <END> was accounted for by the increased number of <START:disease> viral infections <END> among <START:organism> COAST children <END> attending day care, whereas interactions at other <START:ggp> loci <END> were independent of the number of <START:disease> viral infections <END> , indicating the presence of additional risk factors associated with day care environment.
This study identified significant <START:ggp> gene <END> -environment interactions influencing the early patterning of the <START:anatomy> immune system <END> and the subsequent development of <START:disease> asthma <END> and highlights the importance of considering environmental risk factors in genetic analyses.
Localization of a <START:ggp> Type 1 Diabetes Locus <END> in the <START:ggp> IL2RA/CD25 Region <END> by Use of Tag Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms 
As part of an ongoing search for <START:ggp> genes <END> associated with <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> ( <START:disease> T1D <END> ), a common <START:disease> autoimmune disease <END> , we tested the <START:ggp> biological candidate gene <END> <START:ggp> IL2RA <END> ( <START:ggp> CD25 <END> ), which encodes a <START:ggp> subunit <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-2R? <END> ) of the <START:ggp> high-affinity interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor complex <END> .
We employed a tag single-nucleotide polymorphism ( tag SNP ) approach in large <START:organism> T1D sample collections <END> consisting of 7,457 <START:organism> cases <END> and <START:organism> controls <END> and 725 <START:organism> multiplex families <END> .
Tag SNPs were analyzed using a multilocus test to provide a regional test for association.
We found strong statistical evidence in the <START:organism> case-control collection <END> ( P =6.5×10 -8 ) for a <START:ggp> T1D locus <END> in the <START:ggp> CD25 region <END> of <START:ggp> chromosome 10p15 <END> and replicated the association in the <START:organism> family collection <END> ( P =7.3×10 -3 ; combined P =1.3×10 -10 ).
These results illustrate the utility of tag SNPs in a <START:ggp> chromosome <END> -regional test of disease association and justify future fine mapping of the <START:ggp> causal variant <END> in the <START:ggp> region <END> .
A Missense Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism in a <START:ggp> Gene <END> Encoding a <START:ggp> Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase <END> ( <START:ggp> PTPN22 <END> ) Is Associated with <START:ggp> Rheumatoid Arthritis <END> 
<START:disease> Rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:disease> RA <END> ) is the most common <START:disease> systemic autoimmune disease <END> , affecting ?1% of the <START:organism> adult population <END> worldwide, with an estimated heritability of 60%.
To identify <START:ggp> genes <END> involved in <START:bf> RA susceptibility <END> , we investigated the association between putative functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and <START:disease> RA <END> among <START:organism> white individuals <END> by use of a <START:organism> case <END> - <START:organism> control <END> study design; a <START:organism> second sample <END> was tested for replication.
Here we report the association of <START:bf> RA susceptibility <END> with the <START:ggp> minor allele <END> of a missense SNP in <START:ggp> PTPN22 <END> ( discovery-study allelic P =6.6×10 -4 ; replication-study allelic P =5.6×10 -8 ), which encodes a <START:ggp> hematopoietic-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase <END> also known as ? <START:ggp> Lyp <END> .? We show that the <START:ggp> risk allele <END> , which is present in ?17% of <START:organism> white individuals <END> from the <START:organism> general population <END> and in ?28% of <START:organism> white individuals <END> with <START:disease> RA <END> , disrupts the <START:ggp> P1 proline-rich motif <END> that is important for interaction with <START:ggp> Csk <END> , potentially altering these <START:ggp> proteins <END> ' normal function as negative regulators of <START:bf> T-cell activation <END> .
The <START:ggp> minor allele <END> of this SNP recently was implicated in <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> , suggesting that the variant <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> may increase overall reactivity of the <START:anatomy> immune system <END> and may heighten an individual <START:organism> carrier <END> ?s risk for <START:disease> autoimmune disease <END> .
International Collaboration Provides Convincing Linkage Replication in <START:disease> Complex Disease <END> through Analysis of a Large Pooled Data Set: <START:disease> Crohn Disease <END> and <START:ggp> Chromosome 16 <END> 
Numerous <START:disease> familial, non-Mendelian ( i.e., complex ) diseases <END> have been screened by linkage analysis for <START:ggp> regions <END> harboring <START:ggp> susceptibility genes <END> .
Except for <START:disease> rare, high-penetrance syndromes <END> showing <START:bf> Mendelian inheritance <END> , such as <START:ggp> BRCA1 <END> and <START:ggp> BRCA2 <END> , most attempts have failed to produce replicable linkage findings.
For example, in <START:disease> multiple sclerosis <END> and other <START:disease> complex diseases <END> , there have been many reports of significant linkage, followed by numerous failures to replicate.
In <START:disease> inflammatory bowel disease <END> ( <START:disease> IBD <END> ), linkage to two <START:ggp> regions <END> has elsewhere been reported at genomewide significance levels: the <START:ggp> pericentromeric region <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 16 <END> ( <START:ggp> IBD1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> chromosome 12q <END> ( <START:disease> IBD2 <END> ).
As with other <START:disease> complex diseases <END> , the subsequent support for these localizations has been variable.
In this article, we report the results of an international collaborative effort to investigate these putative localization by pooling of data sets that do not individually provide convincing evidence for linkage to these <START:ggp> regions <END> .
Our results, generated by the genotyping and analysis of 12 <START:ggp> microsatellite markers <END> in 613 <START:organism> families <END> , provide unequivocal replication of linkage for a common <START:organism> human <END> disease: a <START:ggp> Crohn disease susceptibility locus <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 16 <END> ( maximum LOD score 5.79 ).
Despite failure to replicate the previous evidence for linkage on <START:ggp> chromosome 12 <END> , the results described herein indicate the need to further investigate the potential role of this <START:ggp> locus <END> in <START:bf> susceptibility to ulcerative colitis <END> .
This report provides a convincing example of the collaborative approach necessary to obtain the sample numbers required to achieve statistical power in studies of <START:bf> complex human traits <END> .
Genomewide Screen and Identification of <START:ggp> Gene <END> - <START:ggp> Gene <END> Interactions for <START:ggp> Asthma-Susceptibility Loci <END> in Three U.S.
Populations: Collaborative Study on the Genetics of <START:disease> Asthma <END> 
The genomewide screen to search for <START:ggp> asthma-susceptibility loci <END> , in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of <START:disease> Asthma <END> ( CSGA ), has been conducted in two stages and includes 266 <START:organism> families <END> ( 199 <START:organism> nuclear <END> and 67 <START:organism> extended pedigrees <END> ) from three <START:organism> U.S. populations <END> : <START:organism> African American <END> , <START:organism> European American <END> , and <START:organism> Hispanic <END> .
Evidence for linkage with the <START:bf> asthma phenotype <END> was observed for multiple <START:ggp> chromosomal regions <END> , through use of several analytical approaches that facilitated the identification of multiple <START:ggp> disease loci <END> .
Ethnicity-specific analyses, which allowed for different frequencies of <START:ggp> asthma-susceptibility genes <END> in each <START:organism> ethnic population <END> , provided the strongest evidence for linkage at <START:ggp> 6p21 <END> in the <START:organism> European American population <END> , at <START:ggp> 11q21 <END> in the <START:organism> African American population <END> , and at <START:ggp> 1p32 <END> in the <START:organism> Hispanic population <END> .
Both the conditional analysis and the <START:organism> affected-sib-pair <END> two- <START:ggp> locus <END> analysis provided further evidence for linkage, at <START:ggp> 5q31 <END> , <START:ggp> 8p23 <END> , <START:ggp> 12q22 <END> , and <START:ggp> 15q13 <END> .
Several of these <START:ggp> regions <END> have been observed in other genomewide screens and linkage or association studies, for <START:disease> asthma <END> and <START:bf> related phenotypes <END> .
These results were used to develop a conceptual model to delineate <START:ggp> asthma-susceptibility loci <END> and their genetic interactions, which provides a promising basis for initiation of fine-mapping studies and, ultimately, for <START:ggp> gene <END> identification.
Use of <START:organism> Closely Related Affected Individuals <END> for the Genetic Study of <START:disease> Complex Diseases <END> in <START:organism> Founder Populations <END> 
We propose a method, the maximum identity length contrast ( MILC ) statistic, to locate <START:ggp> genetic risk factors <END> for <START:disease> complex diseases <END> in <START:organism> founder populations <END> .
The MILC approach compares the identity length of <START:ggp> parental haplotypes <END> that are transmitted to <START:organism> affected offspring <END> with the identity length of those that are not transmitted to <START:organism> affected offspring <END> .
Initially, the statistical properties of the method were assessed using <START:organism> randomly selected affected individuals <END> with unknown relationship.
Because both <START:organism> nuclear families <END> with <START:organism> multiple affected sibs <END> and large <START:organism> pedigrees <END> are often available in <START:organism> founder populations <END> , we performed simulations to investigate the properties of the MILC statistic in the presence of <START:organism> closely related affected individuals <END> .
The simulation showed that the use of <START:organism> closely related affected individuals <END> greatly enhances the power of the statistic.
For a given sample size and type I error, the use of <START:organism> affected sib pairs <END> , instead of <START:organism> affected individuals <END> randomly selected from the <START:organism> population <END> , could increase the power by a factor of two.
This increase was related to an increase of kinship-coefficient contrast between <START:organism> haplotype groups <END> when <START:organism> closely related individuals <END> were considered.
The MILC approach allows the simultaneous use of <START:organism> affected individuals <END> from a <START:organism> founder population <END> and <START:organism> affected individuals <END> with any kind of relationship, close or remote.
We used the MILC approach to analyze the role of <START:ggp> HLA <END> in <START:disease> celiac disease <END> and showed that the effect of <START:ggp> HLA <END> may be detected with the MILC approach by typing only 11 <START:organism> affected individuals <END> , who were part of a single large <START:organism> Finnish pedigree <END> .
A Genomewide Search for <START:ggp> Quantitative-Trait Loci <END> Underlying <START:disease> Asthma <END> 
A genomewide screen for <START:ggp> quantitative-trait loci <END> ( <START:ggp> QTLs <END> ) that underlie <START:disease> asthma <END> was performed on 533 <START:organism> Chinese families <END> with <START:disease> asthma <END> , by the unified Haseman-Elston method.
Nine <START:bf> asthma-related phenotypes <END> were studied, including <START:bf> forced expiratory volume in 1 s <END> ( <START:bf> FEV 1 <END> ), <START:bf> forced vital capacity <END> ( <START:bf> FVC <END> ), <START:bf> airway responsiveness <END> as indicated by <START:ched> methacholine <END> ( <START:ched> MTCH <END> )-challenge test, <START:bf> serum total immunoglobulin E <END> ( <START:bf> TIgE <END> ), <START:bf> serum-specific immunoglobulin E <END> , <START:bf> eosinophil count in peripheral blood <END> , and skin-prick tests with three different allergens ( <START:organism> cockroach <END> , <START:organism> Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus <END> , and <START:organism> D. farinae <END> ).
Our study showed significant linkage between <START:bf> airway responsiveness <END> to <START:ched> MTCH <END> and <START:ggp> D2S1780 <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 2 <END> ( P <.00002 ) and provided suggestive evidence ( P <.002 ) for six additional possible <START:ggp> QTLs <END> : <START:ggp> D10S1435 <END> and <START:ggp> D22S685 <END> , for <START:bf> FEV 1 <END> ; <START:ggp> D16S412 <END> , for <START:bf> FVC <END> ; <START:ggp> D19S433 <END> , for <START:bf> airway responsiveness to MTCH <END> ; <START:ggp> D1S518 <END> , for <START:bf> TIgE <END> ; and <START:ggp> D4S1647 <END> , for <START:bf> skin reactivity to cockroach <END> .
No significant or suggestive evidence of linkage for the other four <START:bf> traits <END> was found.
Evidence for a <START:ggp> Susceptibility Gene <END> , <START:ggp> SLEV1 <END> , on <START:ggp> Chromosome 17p13 <END> in <START:organism> Families <END> with <START:disease> Vitiligo <END> -Related <START:disease> Systemic Lupus Erythematosus <END> 
Both <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ) and <START:disease> vitiligo <END> are <START:disease> autoimmune disorders <END> that have strong evidence of complex genetic contributions to their etiology, but, to date, efforts using genetic linkage to find the <START:ggp> susceptibility genes <END> for either phenotype have met with limited success.
Since <START:disease> autoimmune diseases <END> are thought to share at least some of their genetic origins, and since only a small <START:organism> minority <END> ( 16 of 92 ) of the <START:organism> European-American pedigrees <END> multiplex for <START:disease> SLE <END> in our <START:organism> collection <END> have one or more <START:organism> affected members <END> with <START:disease> vitiligo <END> , we hypothesized that these <START:organism> pedigrees <END> might be more genetically homogeneous at <START:ggp> loci <END> important to both <START:disease> SLE <END> and <START:disease> vitiligo <END> and, hence, have increased power for detection of linkage.
We therefore evaluated genomewide <START:ggp> microsatellite-marker <END> ?scan data for <START:ggp> markers <END> at an average <START:ggp> marker <END> density of ?11 cM in these 16 <START:organism> European-American pedigrees <END> and identified a significant linkage at <START:ggp> 17p13 <END> , where the maximum multipoint parametric LOD score was 3.64 ( P <4.3×10 -5 ) and the nonparametric linkage score was 4.02 ( P <2.8×10 -5 ), respectively.
The segregation behavior of this linkage suggests a recessive mode of <START:bf> inheritance <END> with a virtually homogeneous genetic effect in these 16 <START:organism> pedigrees <END> .
These results support the hypotheses that <START:disease> SLE <END> and <START:disease> vitiligo <END> may share important genetic effects and that sampling on the basis of clinical covariates dramatically improves power to identify genetic effects.
<START:ggp> BLyS <END> and <START:ggp> APRIL <END> in <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> 
The <START:ggp> cytokines <END> <START:ggp> B lymphocyte stimulator <END> ( <START:ggp> BLyS <END> ) and <START:ggp> a proliferation-inducing ligand <END> ( <START:ggp> APRIL <END> ) enhance <START:disease> autoimmune disease <END> by sustaining <START:bf> B cell activation <END> .
In <START:disease> RA <END> , <START:anatomy> B cells <END> contribute to the formation of 3 functionally distinct types of lymphoid microarchitectures in the <START:bf> inflamed synovium <END> : <START:bf> ectopic GCs <END> ; <START:bf> T cell?B cell aggregates lacking GC reactions <END> ; and <START:bf> unorganized, diffuse infiltrates <END> .
We examined 72 <START:anatomy> tissues <END> representing the 3 types of <START:disease> synovitis <END> for <START:bf> BLyS and APRIL production <END> and for <START:bf> expression of APRIL/BLyS receptors <END> .
Biologic effects of <START:ggp> BLyS <END> and <START:ggp> APRIL <END> were explored by treating <START:organism> human synovium?SCID mouse chimeras <END> with the <START:ggp> APRIL and BLyS decoy receptor transmembrane activator and CAML interactor:Fc <END> ( <START:ggp> TACI:Fc <END> ) .
<START:disease> GC + synovitis <END> had the <START:bf> highest levels of APRIL <END> , produced exclusively by <START:anatomy> CD83 + DCs <END> .
<START:ggp> BLyS <END> was present in similar levels in <START:anatomy> all tissue types <END> and derived exclusively from <START:anatomy> CD68 + macrophages <END> .
In <START:disease> GC + synovitis <END> , treatment with <START:ggp> TACI:Fc <END> resulted in <START:bf> GC destruction <END> and marked inhibition of <START:bf> IFN-? and Ig transcription <END> .
In contrast, inhibition of <START:ggp> APRIL <END> and <START:ggp> BLyS <END> in <START:disease> aggregate and diffuse synovitis <END> left <START:bf> Ig levels <END> unaffected and enhanced <START:bf> IFN-? production <END> .
These differential immunomodulatory effects correlated with the presence of <START:anatomy> TACI + T cells <END> in <START:disease> aggregate and diffuse synovitis <END> and their absence in <START:disease> GC + synovitis <END> .
We propose that <START:ggp> BLyS <END> and <START:ggp> APRIL <END> regulate <START:anatomy> B cell <END> as well as <START:anatomy> T cell <END> function and have pro- and antiinflammatory activities in <START:disease> RA <END> .
<START:ggp> PTPN22 <END> Genetic Variation: Evidence for Multiple <START:ggp> Variants <END> Associated with <START:disease> Rheumatoid Arthritis <END> 
The <START:ggp> minor allele <END> of the R620W missense single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) ( rs2476601 ) in the <START:ggp> hematopoietic-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase gene <END> , <START:ggp> PTPN22 <END> , has been associated with multiple <START:disease> autoimmune diseases <END> , including <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:disease> RA <END> ).
These genetic data, combined with biochemical evidence that this SNP affects <START:ggp> PTPN22 <END> function, suggest that this <START:ggp> phosphatase <END> is a key regulator of <START:bf> autoimmunity <END> .
To determine whether other <START:ggp> genetic variants <END> in <START:ggp> PTPN22 <END> contribute to the development of <START:disease> RA <END> , we sequenced the <START:ggp> coding regions <END> of this <START:ggp> gene <END> in 48 <START:organism> white North American patients <END> with <START:disease> RA <END> and identified 15 previously unreported SNPs, including 2 coding SNPs in the <START:ggp> catalytic domain <END> .
We then genotyped 37 SNPs in or near <START:ggp> PTPN22 <END> in 475 <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> RA <END> and 475 <START:organism> individually matched controls <END> ( <START:organism> sample set 1 <END> ) and selected a subset of <START:ggp> markers <END> for replication in an additional 661 <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> RA <END> and 1,322 <START:organism> individually matched controls <END> ( <START:organism> sample set 2 <END> ).
Analyses of these results predict 10 common ( frequency >1% ) <START:ggp> PTPN22 haplotypes <END> in <START:organism> white North Americans <END> .
The sole <START:ggp> haplotype <END> found to carry the previously identified <START:ggp> W620 risk allele <END> was strongly associated with disease in both <START:organism> sample sets <END> , whereas another <START:ggp> haplotype <END> , identical at all other SNPs but carrying the <START:ggp> R620 allele <END> , showed no association.
R620W, however, does not fully explain the association between <START:ggp> PTPN22 <END> and <START:disease> RA <END> , since significant differences between <START:organism> cases <END> and <START:organism> controls <END> persisted in both <START:organism> sample sets <END> after the <START:ggp> haplotype <END> data were stratified by R620W.
Additional analyses identified two SNPs on a single <START:ggp> common haplotype <END> that are associated with <START:disease> RA <END> independent of R620W, suggesting that R620W and at least one <START:ggp> additional variant <END> in the <START:ggp> PTPN22 gene region <END> influence <START:bf> RA susceptibility <END> .
A Genomewide Screen in <START:organism> Multiplex Rheumatoid Arthritis Families <END> Suggests Genetic Overlap with Other <START:disease> Autoimmune Diseases <END> 
<START:disease> Rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:disease> RA <END> ) is an <START:disease> autoimmune/inflammatory disorder <END> with a <START:ggp> complex genetic component <END> .
We report the first major genomewide screen of <START:organism> multiplex families <END> with <START:disease> RA <END> gathered in the United States.
The North American <START:disease> Rheumatoid Arthritis <END> Consortium, using well-defined clinical criteria, has collected 257 <START:organism> families <END> containing 301 <START:organism> affected sibling pairs <END> with <START:disease> RA <END> .
A genome screen for <START:ggp> allele <END> sharing was performed, using 379 <START:ggp> microsatellite markers <END> .
A nonparametric analysis using SIBPAL confirmed linkage of the <START:ggp> HLA locus <END> to <START:disease> RA <END> ( P <.00005 ), with ? <START:ggp> HLA <END> =1.79 .
However, the analysis also revealed a number of <START:ggp> non-HLA loci <END> on <START:ggp> chromosomes 1 ( D1S235 ), 4 ( D4S1647 ), 12 ( D12S373 ), 16 ( D16S403 ), and 17 ( D17S1301 ) <END> , with evidence for linkage at a significance level of P <.005 .
Analysis of <START:ggp> X-linked markers <END> using the MLOD method from ASPEX also suggests linkage to the <START:ggp> telomeric marker <END> <START:ggp> DXS6807 <END> .
Stratifying the <START:organism> families <END> into <START:organism> white <END> or <START:organism> seropositive subgroups <END> revealed some <START:ggp> additional markers <END> that showed improvement in significance over the <START:organism> full data set <END> .
Several of the <START:ggp> regions <END> that showed evidence for nominal significance ( P <.05 ) in our <START:organism> data set <END> had previously been implicated in <START:disease> RA <END> ( <START:ggp> D16S516 <END> and <START:ggp> D17S1301 <END> ) or in other diseases of an <START:bf> autoimmune <END> nature, including <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:ggp> D1S235 <END> ), <START:disease> inflammatory bowel disease <END> ( <START:ggp> D4S1647 <END> , <START:ggp> D5S1462 <END> , and <START:ggp> D16S516 <END> ), <START:disease> multiple sclerosis <END> ( <START:ggp> D12S1052 <END> ), and <START:disease> ankylosing spondylitis <END> ( <START:ggp> D16S516 <END> ).
Therefore, <START:ggp> genes <END> in the <START:ggp> HLA complex <END> play a major role in <START:bf> RA susceptibility <END> , but several other <START:ggp> regions <END> also contribute significantly to overall genetic risk.
<START:ggp> DC-SIGN <END> Induction in <START:anatomy> Alveolar Macrophages <END> Defines <START:anatomy> Privileged Target Host Cells <END> for <START:organism> Mycobacteria <END> in <START:organism> Patients <END> with <START:disease> Tuberculosis <END> 
Background Interplays between <START:organism> Mycobacterium tuberculosis <END> , the etiological agent of <START:disease> tuberculosis <END> ( <START:disease> TB <END> ) in <START:organism> human <END> and <START:anatomy> host professional phagocytes <END> , namely <START:anatomy> macrophages <END> ( <START:anatomy> M s <END> ) and <START:anatomy> dendritic cells <END> ( <START:anatomy> DCs <END> ), are central to <START:bf> immune protection <END> against <START:disease> TB <END> and to <START:bf> TB pathogenesis <END> .
We and others have recently shown that the <START:ggp> C-type lectin <END> <START:ggp> dendritic cell?specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin <END> ( <START:ggp> DC-SIGN <END> ; <START:ggp> CD209 <END> ) mediates important interactions between <START:organism> mycobacteria <END> and <START:anatomy> human monocyte-derived DCs <END> ( <START:anatomy> MoDCs <END> ) in vitro.
Methods and Findings In order to explore the possible role of <START:ggp> DC-SIGN <END> in <START:disease> M. tuberculosis infection <END> in vivo, we have analysed <START:bf> DC-SIGN expression <END> in <START:anatomy> broncho-alveolar lavage ( BAL ) cells <END> from <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> TB <END> ( n = 40 ) or with other <START:bf> non-mycobacterial lung pathologies <END> , namely <START:disease> asthma <END> ( n = 14 ) and <START:disease> sarcoidosis <END> ( n = 11 ), as well as from <START:organism> control individuals <END> ( n = 9 ).
We show that in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> TB <END> , up to 70% of <START:anatomy> alveolar M s <END> express <START:ggp> DC-SIGN <END> .
By contrast, the <START:ggp> lectin <END> is barely detected in <START:anatomy> alveolar M s <END> from all other <START:organism> individuals <END> .
Flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and <START:ggp> enzyme <END> -linked immunosorbent assay analyses of <START:anatomy> BAL-derived fluids and cells <END> indicated that <START:disease> M. tuberculosis infection <END> induces <START:bf> DC-SIGN expression <END> in <START:anatomy> alveolar M s <END> by a mechanism that is independent of <START:ggp> Toll-like receptor-4 <END> , <START:ggp> interleukin ( IL )-4 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> .
This mechanism most likely relies on the <START:bf> secretion of soluble host and/or mycobacterial factors <END> that have yet to be identified, as both infected and uninfected <START:anatomy> bystander M s <END> were found to express <START:ggp> DC-SIGN <END> in the presence of <START:organism> M. tuberculosis <END> .
Immunohistochemical examination of <START:anatomy> lung biopsy samples <END> from <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> TB <END> showed that the <START:organism> bacilli <END> concentrate in <START:anatomy> pulmonary regions <END> enriched in <START:bf> DC-SIGN-expressing alveolar M s <END> in vivo.
Ex vivo binding and inhibition of binding experiments further revealed that <START:bf> DC-SIGN?expressing alveolar M s <END> constitute <START:anatomy> preferential target cells <END> for <START:organism> M. tuberculosis <END> , as compared to their <START:ggp> DC-SIGN ? counterparts <END> .
In contrast with what has been reported previously in <START:anatomy> MoDCs <END> in vitro, ex vivo <START:ggp> DC-SIGN <END> ligation by <START:ched> mycobacterial products <END> failed to induce <START:bf> IL-10 secretion <END> by <START:anatomy> alveolar M s <END> , and <START:ggp> IL-10 <END> was not detected in <START:anatomy> BALs <END> from <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> TB <END> .
Conclusion Altogether, our results provide further evidence for an important role of <START:ggp> DC-SIGN <END> during <START:disease> TB <END> in <START:organism> humans <END> .
<START:bf> DC-SIGN induction <END> in <START:anatomy> alveolar M s <END> may have important consequences on <START:bf> lung colonization <END> by the <START:organism> tubercle bacillus <END> , and on <START:bf> pulmonary inflammatory <END> and <START:bf> immune responses <END> in the <START:organism> infected host <END> .
Genome Scan of <START:disease> Human Systemic Lupus Erythematosus <END> by Regression Modeling: Evidence of Linkage and Epistasis at <START:ggp> 4p16-15.2 <END> 
<START:disease> Systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ) is a <START:disease> complex autoimmune disorder <END> involving at least hormonal, environmental, and genetic factors.
Familial aggregation, a 2%?3% <START:organism> sibling <END> recurrence rate, <START:organism> monozygotic twin <END> concordance >20%, association with several <START:ggp> candidate genes <END> , as well as the results of five genome scans support a <START:ggp> genetic component <END> .
We present here the results of a genome scan of 126 <START:organism> pedigrees <END> multiplex for <START:disease> SLE <END> , including 469 <START:organism> sibling pairs <END> ( affected and unaffected ) and 175 <START:organism> affected relative pairs <END> .
Using the revised multipoint Haseman-Elston regression technique for concordant and discordant <START:organism> sibling pairs <END> and a conditional logistic regression technique for <START:organism> affected relative pairs <END> , we identify a novel linkage to <START:ggp> chromosome 4p16-15.2 <END> ( P =.0003 and LOD =3.84 ) and present evidence of an epistatic interaction between <START:ggp> chromosome 4p16-15.2 <END> and <START:ggp> chromosome 5p15 <END> in our <START:organism> European American families <END> .
We confirm the evidence of linkage to <START:ggp> chromosome 4p16-15.2 <END> in <START:organism> European American families <END> using data from an <START:organism> independent pedigree collection <END> .
In addition, our data support the published results of three independent studies for nine <START:ggp> purportedly linked regions <END> and agree with the previously published results from a subset of these data for three <START:ggp> regions <END> .
In summary, results from two new analytical techniques establish and confirm linkage with <START:disease> SLE <END> at <START:ggp> 4p16-15.2 <END> , indicate epistasis between <START:ggp> 4p16-15.2 <END> and <START:ggp> 5p15 <END> , and confirm other linkage effects with <START:disease> SLE <END> that have been reported elsewhere.
The <START:ggp> IBD2 Locus <END> Shows Linkage Heterogeneity between <START:disease> Ulcerative Colitis <END> and <START:disease> Crohn Disease <END> 
The <START:ggp> IBD2 locus <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 12 <END> has been linked to both <START:disease> Crohn disease <END> ( <START:disease> CD <END> ) and <START:disease> ulcerative colitis <END> ( <START:disease> UC <END> ) but has not been detected in some <START:disease> CD <END> -dominated data sets.
In the present study, we genotyped 581 <START:organism> relative pairs <END> with <START:disease> inflammatory bowel disease <END> ( 252 from <START:organism> CD-only families <END> , 138 from <START:organism> UC-only families <END> , and 191 from <START:organism> mixed families <END> containing <START:organism> cases <END> of both <START:disease> CD <END> and <START:disease> UC <END> ), using 12 <START:ggp> markers <END> spanning the <START:ggp> IBD2 locus <END> .
A GENEHUNTER-PLUS multipoint LOD score of 3.91 was detected for <START:organism> pairs <END> from <START:organism> UC-only families <END> , compared with 1.66 for <START:organism> CD-only <END> and 1.29 for <START:organism> mixed families <END> .
The difference between the LOD scores for <START:disease> UC <END> and <START:disease> CD <END> was significant in two different tests for heterogeneity ( P =.0057 for one test and P =.0375 for the other ).
<START:ggp> IBD2 <END> thus appears to make a major contribution to <START:bf> UC susceptibility <END> but to have only a relatively minor effect with regard to <START:disease> CD <END> , for which there may be substantially more <START:ggp> locus <END> heterogeneity.
Genome Screening in <START:disease> Human Systemic Lupus Erythematosus <END> : Results from a <START:organism> Second Minnesota Cohort <END> and Combined Analyses of 187 <START:organism> Sib-Pair Families <END> 
<START:disease> Systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ) is an <START:disease> autoimmune disease <END> characterized by a <START:bf> loss of immunologic tolerance <END> to a multitude of <START:ggp> self-antigens <END> .
Epidemiological data suggest an important role for <START:ggp> genes <END> in the etiology of <START:disease> lupus <END> , and previous genetic studies have implicated the <START:ggp> HLA locus <END> , <START:ggp> complement genes <END> , and <START:ggp> low-affinity IgG ( Fc? ) receptors <END> in <START:bf> SLE pathogenesis <END> .
In an effort to identify new <START:ggp> susceptibility loci <END> for <START:disease> SLE <END> , we recently reported the results of a genomewide <START:ggp> microsatellite marker <END> screen in 105 <START:organism> SLE sib-pair families <END> .
By using nonparametric methods, evidence for linkage was found in four <START:ggp> intervals <END> : <START:ggp> 6p11-21 <END> ( near the <START:ggp> HLA <END> ) , <START:ggp> 16q13 <END> , <START:ggp> 14q21-23 <END> , and <START:ggp> 20p12.3 <END> ( LOD scores 2.0 ), and weaker evidence in another nine <START:ggp> regions <END> .
We now report the results of a second complete genome screen in a new <START:organism> cohort <END> of 82 <START:organism> SLE sib-pair families <END> .
In the <START:organism> cohort 2 <END> screen, the four best <START:ggp> intervals <END> were <START:ggp> 7p22 <END> ( LOD score 2.87 ), <START:ggp> 7q21 <END> ( LOD score 2.40 ), <START:ggp> 10p13 <END> ( LOD score 2.24 ), and <START:ggp> 7q36 <END> ( LOD score 2.15 ).
Eight additional <START:ggp> intervals <END> were identified with LOD scores in the range 1.00?1.67.
A combined analysis of <START:organism> MN cohorts 1 and 2 <END> ( 187 <START:organism> sib-pair families <END> ) showed that <START:ggp> markers <END> in <START:ggp> 6p11-p21 <END> ( <START:ggp> D6S426 <END> , LOD score 4.19 ) and <START:ggp> 16q13 <END> ( <START:ggp> D16S415 <END> , LOD score 3.85 ) met the criteria for significant linkage.
Three <START:ggp> intervals <END> ( <START:ggp> 2p15 <END> , <START:ggp> 7q36 <END> , and <START:ggp> 1q42 <END> ) had LOD scores in the range 1.92?2.06, and another 13 <START:ggp> intervals <END> had LOD scores in the range of 1.00?1.78 in the <START:organism> combined sample <END> .
These data, together with other available <START:ggp> gene <END> mapping results in <START:disease> SLE <END> , are beginning to allow a prioritization of <START:ggp> genomic intervals <END> for <START:ggp> gene <END> discovery efforts in <START:disease> human SLE <END> .
Further Evidence for a <START:ggp> Susceptibility Locus <END> on <START:ggp> Chromosome 20q13.11 <END> in <START:organism> Families <END> with <START:bf> Dominant Transmission <END> of <START:disease> Graves Disease <END>

Linkage of <START:disease> Inflammatory Bowel Disease <END> to <START:ggp> Human Chromosome 6p <END> 
<START:disease> Inflammatory bowel disease <END> ( <START:disease> IBD <END> ) is characterized by a <START:bf> chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation <END> .
<START:disease> IBD <END> is subdivided into <START:bf> Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis phenotypes <END> .
Given the <START:bf> immunologic dysregulation <END> in <START:disease> IBD <END> , the <START:ggp> human-leukocyte-antigen region <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 6p <END> is of significant interest.
Previous association and linkage analysis has provided conflicting evidence as to the existence of an <START:ggp> IBD-susceptibility locus <END> in this <START:ggp> region <END> .
Here we report on a two-stage linkage and association analysis of both a <START:organism> basic population <END> of 353 <START:organism> affected sibling pairs <END> ( <START:organism> ASPs <END> ) and an <START:organism> extension <END> of this <START:organism> population <END> to 428 <START:organism> white ASPs <END> of <START:organism> northern European extraction <END> .
Twenty-eight <START:ggp> microsatellite markers <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 6 <END> were genotyped.
A peak multipoint LOD score of 4.2 was observed, at <START:ggp> D6S461 <END> , for the <START:bf> IBD phenotype <END> .
A transmission/disequilibrium test ( TDT ) result of P =.006 was detected for <START:ggp> D6S426 <END> in the <START:organism> basic population <END> and was confirmed in the <START:organism> extended cohort <END> ( P =.004 ; 97 vs.
56 transmissions ).
The <START:bf> subphenotypes of Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and mixed IBD <END> contributed equally to this linkage, suggesting a general role for the <START:ggp> chromosome 6 locus <END> in <START:disease> IBD <END> .
Analysis of five single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the <START:ggp> TNFA <END> and <START:ggp> LTA genes <END> did not reveal evidence for association of these <START:ggp> important candidate genes <END> with <START:disease> IBD <END> .
In summary, we provide firm linkage evidence for an <START:ggp> IBD-susceptibility locus <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 6p <END> and demonstrate that <START:ggp> TNFA <END> and <START:ggp> LTA <END> are unlikely to be <START:ggp> susceptibility loci <END> for <START:disease> IBD <END> .
A Second-Generation Genomewide Screen for <START:ggp> Asthma-Susceptibility Alleles <END> in a <START:organism> Founder Population <END> 
A genomewide screen for <START:ggp> asthma- and atopy-susceptibility loci <END> was conducted, using 563 <START:ggp> markers <END> , in 693 <START:organism> Hutterites <END> who are <START:organism> members <END> of a <START:organism> single 15-generation pedigree <END> , nearly doubling the sample size from the authors' earlier studies.
The resulting increase in power led to the identification of 23 <START:ggp> loci <END> in 18 <START:ggp> chromosomal regions <END> showing evidence for linkage that is, in general, 10-fold more significant ( P <.001 vs.
P <.01 ) than the linkages reported previously in this <START:organism> population <END> .
Moreover, linkages to <START:ggp> loci <END> in 11 <START:ggp> chromosomal regions <END> were identified for the first time in the <START:organism> Hutterites <END> in this report, including five <START:ggp> regions <END> ( <START:ggp> 5p <END> , <START:ggp> 5q <END> , <START:ggp> 8p <END> , <START:ggp> 14q <END> , and <START:ggp> 16q <END> ) showing evidence both of linkage, by the likelihood ratio ( LR ) ? 2 , and of disequilibrium, by the transmission/disequilibrium test.
A <START:ggp> region <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 19 <END> continues to show evidence for linkage, by both tests, in this study.
Studies of 17 <START:ggp> candidate genes <END> provide evidence for association with variation in the <START:ggp> IL4RA gene <END> ( <START:ggp> 16p12 <END> ), the <START:ggp> HLA class II genes <END> ( <START:ggp> 6p21 <END> ), and the <START:ggp> interferon-? gene cluster <END> ( <START:ggp> 9p22 <END> ), but the lack of evidence for linkage in these <START:ggp> regions <END> by the LR ? 2 test suggests that these are <START:ggp> minor susceptibility loci <END> .
A polymorphism in the <START:ggp> CD14 gene <END> is in linkage disequilibrium with an as yet unidentified <START:ggp> susceptibility allele <END> in the <START:ggp> 5q cytokine cluster <END> , a <START:ggp> region <END> showing evidence for linkage among the <START:organism> Hutterites <END> .
Finally, 10 of the <START:ggp> regions <END> showing evidence for linkage in the <START:organism> Hutterites <END> have shown evidence of linkage to <START:bf> related phenotypes <END> in other genome screens, suggesting that these <START:ggp> regions <END> may contain <START:ggp> common alleles <END> that have relatively large effects on <START:bf> asthma and atopy phenotypes <END> in <START:organism> diverse populations <END> .
<START:ggp> Major Genes <END> Regulating <START:bf> Total Serum Immunoglobulin E Levels <END> in <START:organism> Families <END> with <START:disease> Asthma <END> 
<START:ggp> Immunoglobulin E <END> ( <START:ggp> IgE <END> ) has a major role in the <START:bf> pathogenesis of allergic disorders and asthma <END> .
Previous data from 92 <START:organism> families <END> , each identified through a <START:organism> proband <END> with <START:disease> asthma <END> , showed evidence for two <START:ggp> major genes <END> regulating <START:bf> total serum IgE levels <END> .
One of these <START:ggp> genes <END> mapped to <START:ggp> 5q31-33 <END> .
In the current study, the segregation analysis was extended by the addition of 108 <START:organism> probands <END> and their <START:organism> families <END> , ascertained in the same manner.
A mixed recessive model ( i.e., <START:ggp> major recessive gene <END> and residual genetic effect ) was the best-fitting and most-parsimonious one- <START:ggp> locus <END> model of the segregation analysis.
A mixed two- <START:ggp> major-gene <END> model ( i.e., two <START:ggp> major genes <END> and residual genetic effect ) fit the data significantly better than did the mixed recessive one- <START:ggp> major-gene <END> model.
The second <START:ggp> gene <END> modified the effect of the first <START:ggp> recessive gene <END> .
<START:organism> Individuals <END> with the <START:ggp> genotype aaBB <END> ( <START:ggp> homozygous high-risk allele <END> at the first <START:ggp> gene <END> and <START:ggp> homozygous low-risk allele <END> at the second <START:ggp> locus <END> ) had <START:bf> normal IgE levels <END> ( mean 23 IU/ml ), and only <START:organism> individuals <END> with <START:ggp> genotypes aaBb and aabb <END> had <START:bf> high IgE levels <END> ( mean 282 IU/ml ).
A genomewide screening was performed using variance-component analysis.
Significant evidence for linkage was found for a novel <START:ggp> locus <END> at <START:ggp> 7q <END> , with a multipoint LOD score of 3.36 ( P =.00004 ).
A LOD score of 3.65 ( P =.0000 2 ) was obtained after genotyping additional <START:ggp> markers <END> in this <START:ggp> region <END> .
Evidence for linkage was also found for two previously reported <START:ggp> regions <END> , <START:ggp> 5q <END> and <START:ggp> 12q <END> , with LOD scores of 2.73 ( P =.0002 ) and 2.46 ( P =.0004 ), respectively.
These results suggest that several <START:ggp> major genes <END> , plus residual genetic effects, regulate <START:bf> total serum IgE levels <END> .
Evidence for a <START:ggp> susceptibility gene <END> ( <START:ggp> SLEH1 <END> ) on <START:ggp> chromosome 11q14 <END> for <START:organism> systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) families <END> with <START:disease> hemolytic anemia <END> 
<START:disease> Hemolytic anemia <END> is a forme fruste of <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ), being observed months or even years before the onset of other clinical manifestations in some <START:organism> patients <END> .
We hypothesized that <START:disease> hemolytic anemia <END> in those <START:organism> SLE-affected patients <END> would identify a <START:organism> group <END> of <START:organism> SLE pedigrees <END> that share a high degree of genetic homogeneity.
From 160 <START:organism> multiplex SLE pedigrees <END> , we sought evidence for linkage in 35 ( 16 <START:organism> African-American <END> , 17 <START:organism> European-American <END> , and 2 <START:organism> Hispanic <END> ) who had at least one <START:organism> SLE-affected patient <END> with <START:disease> hemolytic anemia <END> .
Significant linkage was present at <START:ggp> 11q14 <END> in the 16 <START:organism> African-American pedigrees <END> , yielding a maximum two-point logarithm of odds ( LOD ) score of 4.5 at <START:ggp> D11S2002 <END> .
The segregation pattern of <START:disease> SLE <END> in these <START:organism> African-American pedigrees <END> suggested a dominant mode of <START:bf> inheritance <END> and, when maximized across penetrance and <START:ggp> disease allele <END> frequencies, produced a multipoint LOD of 4.7.
Multipoint analysis yielded a multipoint heterogeneity LOD score of 3.6 ( ? = 0.63 ), again with maximum LOD at <START:ggp> D11S2002 <END> .
Finally, <START:ggp> markers <END> typed 7 centimorgans to either side of <START:ggp> D11S2002 <END> achieved LOD scores of 3 or better by using the maximized model, supporting linkage to <START:ggp> 11q14 <END> .
Clearly, <START:organism> pedigree <END> ascertainment based on select clinical manifestations is an important tool, capable of revealing otherwise cryptic genetic linkages in <START:disease> complex genetic diseases <END> .
Thus, we show strong evidence for an <START:ggp> SLE susceptibility gene <END> , <START:ggp> SLEH1 <END> , near <START:ggp> D11S2002 <END> in <START:organism> African-American pedigrees <END> multiplex for <START:disease> SLE <END> that have at least one <START:organism> SLE-affected patient <END> with <START:disease> hemolytic anemia <END> .
<START:bf> Immunity <END> and <START:bf> behavior <END> : <START:ggp> Antibodies <END> alter <START:bf> emotion <END> 
<START:disease> Systemic lupus erythematosus <END> is an <START:disease> autoimmune disease <END> in which most <START:organism> patients <END> express <START:ggp> Abs <END> that bind <START:ggp> double-stranded DNA <END> .
Recent work has shown that a subset of <START:ggp> lupus Abs <END> can crossreact with the <START:ggp> NR2A <END> and <START:ggp> NR2B subunits <END> of the <START:ggp> NMDA receptor <END> .
This <START:ggp> receptor <END> is expressed in <START:anatomy> neurons <END> throughout the <START:anatomy> brain <END> but is at highest density within <START:anatomy> cells of the hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus <END> .
The <START:anatomy> neurons <END> in the <START:anatomy> CNS <END> are normally protected from <START:ggp> brain-reactive Abs <END> by the <START:anatomy> blood?brain barrier <END> ( <START:anatomy> BBB <END> ); however, a breach in the <START:anatomy> barrier <END> 's integrity exposes <START:anatomy> neurons <END> to potentially <START:ggp> pathogenic Abs <END> .
Previously, we have shown that <START:organism> mice <END> that are immunized with a <START:ggp> peptide mimetope <END> of <START:ggp> DNA <END> produce <START:ggp> lupus-like Abs <END> that crossreact with <START:ggp> DNA <END> and the <START:ggp> NMDA receptor <END> .
Moreover, after abrogation of the <START:anatomy> BBB <END> by treatment with <START:ched> lipopolysaccharide <END> , the immunized <START:organism> mice <END> display <START:bf> hippocampal neuron damage <END> with ensuing <START:bf> memory impairment <END> .
Given that rises in <START:ched> epinephrine <END> can increase <START:bf> cerebral blood flow <END> and can cause leaks in the <START:anatomy> BBB <END> , we decided to investigate whether <START:ched> epinephrine <END> could act as a permissive agent for <START:bf> Ab-mediated neurotoxicity <END> .
Here, we show that <START:organism> peptide-immunized mice <END> , given <START:ched> epinephrine <END> to open the <START:anatomy> BBB <END> , lose <START:anatomy> neurons <END> in the <START:anatomy> lateral amygdala <END> and develop a <START:bf> behavioral disorder <END> characterized by a <START:bf> deficient response <END> to fear-conditioning paradigms.
Thus, the <START:ched> agent <END> used to open the <START:anatomy> BBB <END> determines which <START:anatomy> brain region <END> is made vulnerable to <START:ggp> neurotoxic Abs <END> , and <START:ggp> Abs <END> that penetrate <START:anatomy> brain tissue <END> can cause changes not only in <START:bf> cognitive competence <END> , but also in <START:bf> emotional behavior <END> .
Prime role for an <START:ggp> insulin epitope <END> in the development of <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> in <START:organism> NOD mice <END> 
A fundamental question about the <START:bf> pathogenesis of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes <END> is whether there are <START:ggp> primary autoantigens <END> .
For <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> it is clear that <START:ggp> multiple islet molecules <END> are the target of <START:bf> autoimmunity <END> in <START:organism> man <END> and <START:organism> animal models 1 , 2 <END> .
It is not clear whether any of the <START:ggp> target molecules <END> are essential for the <START:bf> destruction of islet beta cells <END> .
Here we show that the <START:ggp> proinsulin/insulin molecules <END> have a sequence that is a primary target of the <START:bf> autoimmunity <END> that causes <START:disease> diabetes <END> of the <START:organism> non-obese diabetic ( NOD ) mouse <END> .
We created <START:ggp> insulin 1 <END> and <START:ggp> insulin 2 gene <END> knockouts combined with a mutated <START:ggp> proinsulin transgene <END> ( in which <START:ggp> residue 16 <END> on the <START:ggp> B chain <END> was changed to <START:ggp> alanine <END> ) in <START:organism> NOD mice <END> .
This mutation abrogated the <START:bf> T-cell stimulation <END> of a series of the <START:anatomy> major insulin autoreactive NOD T-cell clones 3 <END> .
<START:organism> Female mice <END> with only the altered <START:ggp> insulin <END> did not develop <START:ggp> insulin autoantibodies <END> , <START:bf> insulitis <END> or <START:disease> autoimmune diabetes <END> , in contrast with <START:organism> mice <END> containing at least one copy of the native <START:ggp> insulin gene <END> .
We suggest that <START:ggp> proinsulin <END> is a <START:ggp> primary autoantigen <END> of the <START:anatomy> NOD mouse <END> , and speculate that <START:bf> organ-restricted autoimmune disorders <END> with marked <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex <END> ( <START:ggp> MHC <END> ) restriction of disease are likely to have specific <START:ggp> primary autoantigens <END> .
A Testing Framework for Identifying <START:ggp> Susceptibility Genes <END> in the Presence of <START:bf> Epistasis <END> 
An efficient testing strategy called the ?focused interaction testing framework? ( FITF ) was developed to identify <START:ggp> susceptibility genes <END> involved in epistatic interactions for <START:organism> case <END> - <START:organism> control <END> studies of <START:ggp> candidate genes <END> .
In the FITF approach, likelihood-ratio tests are performed in stages that increase in the order of interaction considered.
Joint tests of main effects and interactions are performed conditional on significant lower-order effects.
A reduction in the number of tests performed is achieved by prescreening <START:ggp> gene <END> combinations with a goodness-of-fit ? 2 statistic that depends on association among <START:ggp> candidate genes <END> in the pooled <START:organism> case-control group <END> .
Multiple testing is accounted for by controlling false-discovery rates.
Simulation analysis demonstrated that the FITF approach is more powerful than marginal tests of <START:ggp> candidate genes <END> .
FITF also outperformed multifactor dimensionality reduction when interactions involved <START:ggp> additive, dominant, or recessive genes <END> .
In an application to <START:disease> asthma <END> <START:organism> case <END> - <START:organism> control <END> data from the <START:organism> Children <END> ?s Health Study, FITF identified a significant <START:ggp> multilocus <END> effect between the <START:ggp> nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( phosphate ) reduced:quinone oxidoreductase gene <END> ( <START:ggp> NQO1 <END> ), <START:ggp> myeloperoxidase gene <END> ( <START:ggp> MPO <END> ), and <START:ggp> catalase gene <END> ( <START:ggp> CAT <END> ) ( unadjusted P =.00026 ), three <START:ggp> genes <END> that are involved in the <START:bf> oxidative stress pathway <END> .
In an independent data set consisting primarily of <START:organism> African American and Asian American children <END> , these three <START:ggp> genes <END> also showed a significant association with <START:disease> asthma <END> status ( P =.0008 ).
<START:ggp> IL-23 <END> is essential for <START:anatomy> T cell <END> ?mediated <START:disease> colitis <END> and promotes <START:bf> inflammation <END> via <START:ggp> IL-17 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> 
<START:bf> Uncontrolled mucosal immunity <END> in the <START:anatomy> gastrointestinal tract <END> of <START:organism> humans <END> results in <START:disease> chronic inflammatory bowel disease <END> ( <START:disease> IBD <END> ), such as <START:disease> Crohn disease <END> and <START:disease> ulcerative colitis <END> .
In early clinical trials as well as in <START:organism> animal models <END> , <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> has been implicated as a major mediator of these diseases based on the ability of <START:ggp> anti-p40 mAb <END> treatment to reverse <START:bf> intestinal inflammation <END> .
The <START:ggp> cytokine <END> <START:ggp> IL-23 <END> shares the same <START:ggp> p40 subunit <END> with <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> , and the <START:ggp> anti-p40 mAbs <END> used in <START:disease> human and mouse IBD <END> studies neutralized the activities of both <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-23 <END> .
<START:organism> IL-10 ?deficient mice <END> spontaneously develop <START:disease> enterocolitis <END> .
To determine how <START:ggp> IL-23 <END> contributes to <START:bf> intestinal inflammation <END> , we studied the <START:bf> disease susceptibility <END> in the absence of either <START:ggp> IL-23 <END> or <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> in this <START:organism> model <END> , as well as the ability of recombinant <START:ggp> IL-23 <END> to exacerbate <START:disease> IBD <END> induced by <START:bf> T cell transfer <END> .
Our study shows that in these <START:organism> models <END> , <START:ggp> IL-23 <END> is essential for manifestation of <START:bf> chronic intestinal inflammation <END> , whereas <START:ggp> IL-12 <END> is not.
A critical target of <START:ggp> IL-23 <END> is a unique subset of <START:anatomy> tissue-homing memory T cells <END> , which are specifically activated by <START:ggp> IL-23 <END> to produce the <START:ggp> proinflammatory mediators <END> <START:ggp> IL-17 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-6 <END> .
This pathway may be responsible for <START:bf> chronic intestinal inflammation <END> as well as other <START:disease> chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases <END> .
Fine-Mapping <START:ggp> Chromosome 20 <END> in 230 <START:organism> Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Sib Pair and Multiplex Families <END> : Evidence for <START:bf> Genetic Epistasis <END> with <START:ggp> Chromosome 16q12 <END> 
The presence of <START:ggp> systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) susceptibility genes <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 20 <END> is suggested by the observation of genetic linkage in several <START:organism> independent SLE family collections <END> .
To further localize the genetic effects, we typed 59 <START:ggp> microsatellites <END> in the two best <START:ggp> regions <END> , as defined by genome screens.
<START:ggp> Genotypes <END> were analyzed for statistical linkage and/or association with <START:disease> SLE <END> , by use of a combination of nonparametric linkage methods, <START:organism> family <END> -based tests of association ( transmission/disequilibrium and pedigree disequilibrium tests ), and <START:ggp> haplotype <END> -sharing statistics ( <START:ggp> haplotype <END> runs test ), in a set of 230 <START:organism> SLE pedigrees <END> .
Maximal evidence for linkage to <START:disease> SLE <END> was to <START:ggp> 20p12 <END> ( LOD =2.84 ) and <START:ggp> 20q13.1 <END> ( LOD =1.64 ) in the <START:organism> white pedigrees <END> .
Subsetting <START:organism> families <END> on the basis of evidence for linkage to <START:ggp> 16q12 <END> significantly improved the LOD scores at both <START:ggp> chromosome 20 <END> locations ( <START:ggp> 20p12 <END> LOD =5.06 and <START:ggp> 20q13 <END> LOD =3.65 ), consistent with <START:bf> epistasis <END> .
We then typed 162 <START:ggp> single-nucleotide polymorphism markers <END> across a <START:ggp> 1.3-Mb candidate region <END> on <START:ggp> 20q13.1 <END> and identified several SNPs that demonstrated significant evidence for association.
These data provide additional support for linkage and association to <START:ggp> 20p12 <END> and <START:ggp> 20q13.1 <END> in <START:disease> SLE <END> and further refine the <START:ggp> intervals <END> of interest.
These data further suggest the possibility of epistatic relationships among <START:ggp> loci <END> within the <START:ggp> 20q12 <END> , <START:ggp> 20q13 <END> , and <START:ggp> 16q12 regions <END> in <START:organism> SLE families <END> .
The <START:ggp> adipocyte fatty acid?binding protein <END> <START:ggp> aP2 <END> is required in <START:bf> allergic airway inflammation <END> 
The <START:ggp> adipocyte fatty acid?binding protein <END> <START:ggp> aP2 <END> regulates <START:bf> systemic glucose and lipid metabolism <END> .
We report that <START:ggp> aP2 <END> , in addition to being abundantly expressed by <START:anatomy> adipocytes <END> , is also expressed by <START:anatomy> human airway epithelial cells <END> and shows a <START:bf> striking upregulation <END> following stimulation of <START:anatomy> epithelial cells <END> with the <START:ggp> Th2 cytokines <END> <START:ggp> IL-4 <END> and <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> .
<START:bf> Regulation of aP2 mRNA expression <END> by <START:ggp> Th2 cytokines <END> was highly dependent on <START:ggp> STAT6 <END> , a <START:ggp> transcription factor <END> with a major regulatory role in <START:bf> allergic inflammation <END> .
We examined <START:organism> aP2-deficient mice <END> in a model of <START:bf> allergic airway inflammation <END> and found that <START:bf> infiltration of leukocytes <END> , especially <START:anatomy> eosinophils <END> , into the <START:anatomy> airways <END> was highly dependent on <START:ggp> aP2 <END> function.
<START:bf> T cell priming <END> was unaffected by <START:bf> aP2 deficiency <END> , suggesting that <START:ggp> aP2 <END> was acting locally within the <START:anatomy> lung <END> , and analysis of <START:anatomy> bone marrow chimeras implicated non-hematopoietic cells <END> , most likely <START:anatomy> bronchial epithelial cells <END> , as the site of action of <START:ggp> aP2 <END> in <START:bf> allergic airway inflammation <END> .
Thus, <START:ggp> aP2 <END> regulates <START:bf> allergic airway inflammation <END> and may provide a link between <START:bf> fatty acid metabolism <END> and <START:disease> asthma <END> .
I <START:bf> nterferon-inducible gene expression <END> signature in <START:anatomy> peripheral blood cells <END> of <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> severe lupus <END> 
<START:disease> Systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ) is a <START:disease> complex, inflammatory autoimmune disease <END> that affects <START:anatomy> multiple organ systems <END> .
We used global <START:bf> gene expression <END> profiling of <START:anatomy> peripheral blood mononuclear cells <END> to identify distinct patterns of <START:bf> gene expression <END> that distinguish most <START:organism> SLE patients <END> from <START:organism> healthy controls <END> .
Strikingly, about half of the <START:organism> patients <END> studied showed <START:bf> dysregulated expression of genes in the IFN pathway <END> .
Furthermore, this <START:bf> IFN gene expression <END> ?signature? served as a marker for more severe <START:disease> disease <END> involving the <START:anatomy> kidneys <END> , <START:anatomy> hematopoetic cells <END> , and/or the <START:anatomy> central nervous system <END> .
These results provide insights into the <START:bf> genetic pathways <END> underlying <START:disease> SLE <END> , and identify a <START:organism> subgroup <END> of <START:organism> patients <END> who may benefit from therapies targeting the <START:bf> IFN pathway <END> .
<START:ggp> Inducible costimulator <END> is essential for <START:disease> collagen-induced arthritis <END> 
<START:anatomy> CD4 + helper Th cells <END> play a major role in the <START:bf> pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
<START:bf> Th cell activation, differentiation <END> , and immune function are regulated by <START:ggp> costimulatory molecules <END> .
<START:ggp> Inducible costimulator <END> ( <START:ggp> ICOS <END> ) is a novel <START:ggp> costimulatory receptor <END> expressed on activated <START:anatomy> T cells <END> .
We, as well as others, recently demonstrated its importance in <START:bf> Th2 cytokine expression <END> and <START:bf> Ab class switching <END> by <START:anatomy> B cells <END> .
In this study, we examined the role of <START:ggp> ICOS <END> in <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> using a <START:organism> collagen-induced arthritis model <END> .
We found that <START:organism> ICOS knockout mice <END> on the <START:ggp> DBA/1 background <END> were completely <START:bf> resistant to collagen-induced arthritis <END> and exhibited <START:bf> absence of joint tissue inflammation <END> .
These <START:organism> mice <END> , when immunized with <START:ggp> collagen <END> , exhibited <START:bf> reduced anti-collagen IgM Ab?s <END> in the initial stage and <START:ggp> IgG2a Ab?s <END> at the effector phase of <START:disease> collagen-induced arthritis <END> .
Furthermore, <START:ggp> ICOS <END> regulates the in vitro and in vivo <START:bf> expression of IL-17 <END> , a <START:ggp> proinflammatory cytokine <END> implicated in <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
These data indicate that <START:ggp> ICOS <END> is essential for <START:disease> collagen-induced arthritis <END> and may suggest novel means for treating <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
Involvement of <START:ggp> PTEN <END> in <START:disease> airway hyperresponsiveness <END> and <START:bf> inflammation in bronchial asthma <END> 
<START:ggp> Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten <END> ( <START:ggp> PTEN <END> ) is part of a complex signaling system that affects a variety of important cell functions.
<START:ggp> PTEN <END> blocks the action of <START:ggp> PI3K <END> by dephosphorylating the <START:ched> signaling lipid <END> <START:ched> phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate <END> .
We have used a <START:organism> mouse model <END> for <START:disease> asthma <END> to determine the effect of <START:ched> PI3K inhibitors <END> and <START:ggp> PTEN <END> on <START:bf> allergen-induced bronchial inflammation <END> and <START:disease> airway hyperresponsiveness <END> .
<START:ggp> PI3K <END> activity increased significantly after <START:ggp> allergen <END> challenge.
<START:bf> PTEN protein expression <END> and <START:ggp> PTEN <END> activity were decreased in <START:ggp> OVA <END> -induced <START:disease> asthma <END> .
Immunoreactive <START:ggp> PTEN <END> localized in <START:anatomy> epithelial layers around the bronchioles <END> in <START:organism> control mice <END> .
However, this immunoreactive <START:ggp> PTEN <END> dramatically disappeared in <START:anatomy> allergen-induced asthmatic lungs <END> .
The <START:bf> increased IL-4, IL-5, and eosinophil cationic protein levels <END> in <START:anatomy> bronchoalveolar lavage fluids <END> after <START:ggp> OVA <END> inhalation were significantly reduced by the intratracheal administration of <START:ched> PI3K inhibitors <END> or <START:organism> adenoviruses <END> carrying <START:ggp> PTEN cDNA <END> ( <START:organism> AdPTEN <END> ).
Intratracheal administration of <START:ched> PI3K inhibitors <END> or <START:organism> AdPTEN <END> remarkably reduced <START:bf> bronchial inflammation <END> and <START:disease> airway hyperresponsiveness <END> .
These findings indicate that <START:ggp> PTEN <END> may play a pivotal role in the <START:bf> pathogenesis of the asthma phenotype <END> .
A mutation in a <START:ggp> CD44 variant <END> of <START:anatomy> inflammatory cells <END> enhances the mitogenic interaction of <START:ggp> FGF <END> with its <START:ggp> receptor <END> 
<START:anatomy> Synovial fluid cells from joints <END> of <START:organism> rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients <END> express a novel <START:ggp> variant <END> of <START:ggp> CD44 <END> ( designated <START:ggp> CD44vRA <END> ), encoding an <START:ggp> extra trinucleotide <END> ( <START:ggp> CAG <END> ) transcribed from <START:ggp> intronic sequences <END> flanking a <START:ggp> variant exon <END> .
The <START:ggp> CD44vRA mutant <END> was detected in 23 out of 30 <START:organism> RA patients <END> .
<START:anatomy> CD44-negative Namalwa cells <END> transfected with <START:ggp> CD44vRA cDNA <END> or with <START:ggp> CD44v3-v10 ( CD44vRA wild type ) cDNA <END> bound <START:ggp> FGF-2 <END> to an equal extent via their associated <START:ched> heparan sulfate chains <END> .
However, <START:anatomy> Namalwa cells <END> , immobilizing <START:ggp> FGF-2 <END> via their cell surface <START:ggp> CD44vRA <END> , bound substantially more soluble <START:ggp> FGF receptor-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> FGFR-1 <END> ) than did <START:anatomy> Namalwa cells <END> immobilizing the same amount of <START:ggp> FGF-2 <END> via their cell surface <START:ggp> CD44v3-v10 <END> .
The former <START:anatomy> cells <END> stimulated the <START:bf> proliferation of BaF-32 cells <END> , bearing <START:ggp> FGFR-1 <END> , more efficiently than did the latter <START:anatomy> cells <END> .
Finally, isolated <START:anatomy> primary synovial fluid cells <END> from <START:organism> RA patients <END> expressing <START:ggp> CD44vRA <END> bound more soluble <START:ggp> FGFR-1 <END> to their cell surface?associated <START:ggp> FGF-2 <END> than did corresponding <START:anatomy> synovial cells <END> expressing <START:ggp> CD44v3-v10 <END> or <START:anatomy> synovial cells <END> from <START:organism> osteoarthritis patients <END> .
The binding of soluble <START:ggp> FGFR-1 <END> to <START:anatomy> RA synovial cells <END> could be specifically reduced by their preincubation with <START:ggp> Ab?s <END> against the <START:ggp> v3 exon product <END> of <START:ggp> CD44 <END> .
Hence, <START:ggp> FGF-2 <END> attached to the <START:ched> heparan sulfate moiety <END> expressed by the novel <START:ggp> CD44 variant <END> of <START:anatomy> RA synovium cells <END> exhibits an augmented ability to stimulate <START:ggp> FGFR-1 <END> ?mediated activities.
A similar mechanism may foster the <START:bf> destructive inflammatory cascade <END> not only in <START:disease> RA <END> , but also in other <START:disease> autoimmune diseases <END> .
<START:disease> SLE like syndrome <END> and <START:bf> functional deficiency <END> of <START:ggp> C1q <END> in <START:organism> members <END> of a <START:organism> large family <END> .
Two <START:organism> sisters <END> and a <START:organism> brother <END> from one <START:organism> family <END> are described whose <START:anatomy> sera <END> were deficient in <START:ggp> haemolytic complement <END> function.
This defect was restored by addition of purified <START:ggp> C1q <END> .
In their <START:anatomy> sera <END> , <START:ggp> C1q like material <END> was found, whereas <START:ggp> C1r <END> and <START:ggp> C1s <END> were normal or increased in concentration, as were the other <START:ggp> complement components <END> tested.
All three had suffered from <START:disease> glomerulonephritis <END> during childhood.
A renal biopsy in the <START:organism> brother <END> recently disclosed a <START:disease> membranous glomerulopathy <END> stage 1; otherwise, he is apparently healthy.
In both <START:organism> sisters <END> , a <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus like disease <END> became manifest at the age of 20 and 23, respectively, resulting in the <START:bf> death <END> of one of them.
In the <START:anatomy> serum <END> of these three <START:organism> family members <END> , the <START:ggp> C1q like material <END> was antigenically deficient compared with normal <START:ggp> C1q <END> and had, on <START:ched> sucrose <END> gradient analysis, a molecular weight of approximately 65,000 daltons.
It did not bind to <START:ggp> C1r <END> and <START:ggp> C1s <END> .
Binding of the dysfunctional <START:ggp> C1q <END> to aggregated <START:ggp> human gammaglobulin <END> could be demonstrated.
On double immunodiffusion analysis, the abnormal <START:ggp> C1q <END> was identical with reduced and alkylated <START:ggp> C1q <END> .
The possible structure of the abnormal <START:ggp> C1q molecule <END> is discussed.
<START:disease> Congenital complete heart block <END> in the <START:organism> newborn <END> associated with maternal <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> and other <START:disease> connective tissue disorders <END> .
Four <START:organism> babies <END> with <START:disease> complete heart block <END> associated with maternal <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ) are described, together with a 5th <START:organism> baby <END> whose <START:organism> mother <END> had <START:bf> serological abnormalities <END> only.
One <START:organism> baby <END> had a <START:bf> rapidly fatal outcome <END> , one has required <START:ched> digoxin <END> for <START:disease> heart failure <END> , and the remaining 3 are asymptomatic but remain in <START:disease> complete heart block <END> .
Additional manifestations were present in 2 of them.
The spectrum of <START:bf> neonatal abnormalities <END> that may occur in association with maternal <START:disease> SLE <END> and related <START:disease> connective tissue disorders <END> is discussed, together with the possible causes and the prognosis.
We conclude that <START:disease> congenital heart block <END> is more common than had previously been appreciated.
A <START:ggp> Chromosome 8 Gene-Cluster <END> Polymorphism with Low <START:ggp> Human Beta-Defensin 2 Gene <END> Copy Number Predisposes to <START:disease> Crohn Disease <END> of the <START:anatomy> Colon <END> 
<START:ggp> Defensins <END> are <START:ggp> endogenous antimicrobial peptides <END> that protect the <START:anatomy> intestinal mucosa <END> against <START:bf> bacterial invasion <END> .
It has been suggested that <START:bf> deficient defensin expression <END> may underlie the <START:bf> chronic inflammation <END> of <START:disease> Crohn disease <END> ( <START:disease> CD <END> ).
The <START:ggp> DNA <END> copy number of the <START:ggp> beta-defensin gene cluster <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 8p23.1 <END> is highly polymorphic within the <START:organism> healthy population <END> , which suggests that the <START:bf> defective beta-defensin induction <END> in <START:disease> colonic CD <END> could be due to low <START:ggp> beta-defensin?gene <END> copy number.
Here, we tested this hypothesis, using genomewide <START:ggp> DNA <END> copy number profiling by array-based comparative genomic hybridization and quantitative <START:ggp> polymerase <END> -chain-reaction analysis of the <START:ggp> human beta-defensin 2 ( HBD-2 ) gene <END> .
We showed that <START:organism> healthy individuals <END> , as well as <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> ulcerative colitis <END> , have a median of 4 ( range 2?10 ) <START:ggp> HBD-2 gene <END> copies per genome.
In a <START:organism> surgical cohort <END> with <START:disease> ileal or colonic CD <END> and in a <START:organism> second large cohort <END> with <START:disease> inflammatory bowel diseases <END> , those with <START:disease> ileal resections/disease <END> exhibited a normal median <START:ggp> HBD-2 <END> copy number of 4, whereas those with <START:disease> colonic CD <END> had a median of only 3 copies per genome ( P =.008 for the <START:organism> surgical cohort <END> ; P =.032 for the <START:organism> second cohort <END> ).
Overall, the copy number distribution in <START:disease> colonic CD <END> was shifted to lower numbers compared with <START:organism> controls <END> ( P =.002 for both the <START:organism> surgical cohort <END> and the <START:organism> cohort <END> with <START:disease> inflammatory bowel diseases <END> ).
<START:organism> Individuals <END> with 3 copies have a significantly higher risk of developing <START:disease> colonic CD <END> than did <START:organism> individuals <END> with 4 copies ( odds ratio 3.06; 95% confidence interval 1.46?6.45 ).
An <START:ggp> HBD-2 gene <END> copy number of <4 was associated with <START:bf> diminished mucosal HBD-2 mRNA expression <END> ( P =.033 ).
In conclusion, a lower <START:ggp> HBD-2 gene <END> copy number in the <START:ggp> beta-defensin locus <END> predisposes to <START:disease> colonic CD <END> , most likely through <START:bf> diminished beta-defensin expression <END> .
<START:disease> Familial Chilblain Lupus <END> , a Monogenic Form of <START:disease> Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus <END> , Maps to <START:ggp> Chromosome 3p <END> 
<START:disease> Systemic lupus erythematosu <END> s is a prototypic <START:disease> autoimmune disease <END> .
Apart from <START:bf> rare monogenic deficiencies <END> of <START:ggp> complement factors <END> , where l <START:disease> upuslike disease <END> may occur in association with other <START:disease> autoimmune diseases <END> or <START:bf> high susceptibility to bacterial infections <END> , its etiology is multifactorial in nature.
<START:bf> Cutaneous findings <END> are a hallmark of the disease and manifest either alone or in association with <START:disease> internal-organ disease <END> .
We describe a novel <START:disease> genodermatosis <END> characterized by <START:bf> painful bluish-red inflammatory papular <END> or <START:bf> nodular lesions <END> in <START:anatomy> acral locations <END> such as <START:anatomy> fingers <END> , <START:anatomy> toes <END> , <START:anatomy> nose <END> , <START:anatomy> cheeks <END> , and <START:anatomy> ears <END> .
The <START:bf> lesions <END> sometimes appear plaquelike and tend to ulcerate.
Manifestation usually begins in early childhood and is precipitated by cold and wet exposure.
Apart from <START:bf> arthralgias <END> , there is no evidence for <START:disease> internal-organ disease <END> or an <START:bf> increased susceptibility to infection <END> .
Histological findings include a <START:bf> deep inflammatory infiltrate <END> with <START:bf> perivascular distribution and granular deposits of immunoglobulins and complement <END> along the basement membrane.
Some <START:organism> affected individuals <END> show <START:bf> antinuclear antibodies or immune complex formation <END> , whereas <START:ggp> cryoglobulins <END> or <START:ggp> cold agglutinins <END> are absent.
Thus, the findings are consistent with <START:disease> chilblain lupus <END> , a rare form of <START:disease> cutaneous lupus erythematosus <END> .
Investigation of a large <START:organism> German kindred <END> with 18 <START:organism> affected members <END> suggests a <START:bf> highly penetrant trai <END> t with <START:bf> autosomal dominant inheritance <END> .
By single- <START:ggp> nucleotide <END> -polymorphism?based genomewide linkage analysis, the <START:ggp> locus <END> was mapped to <START:ggp> chromosome 3p <END> .
<START:ggp> Haplotype <END> analysis defined the <START:ggp> locus <END> to a <START:ggp> 13.8-cM interval <END> with a LOD score of 5.04.
This is the first description of a monogenic form of <START:disease> cutaneous lupus erythematosus <END> .
Identification of the <START:ggp> gene <END> responsible for <START:disease> familial chilblain lupus <END> may shed light on the <START:bf> pathogenesis <END> of common forms of <START:disease> connective-tissue disease <END> such as <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .
The <START:ggp> thyrotropin receptor autoantigen <END> in <START:disease> Graves disease <END> is the culprit as well as the victim 
<START:disease> Graves disease <END> , a <START:disease> common organ-specific autoimmune disease <END> affecting <START:organism> humans <END> , differs from all other <START:disease> autoimmune diseases <END> in being associated with <START:bf> target organ hyperfunction <END> rather than <START:bf> organ damage <END> .
Clinical <START:disease> thyrotoxicosis <END> is directly caused by <START:ggp> autoantibodies <END> that activate the <START:ggp> thyrotropin receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> TSHR <END> ).
The etiology of <START:disease> Graves disease <END> is multifactorial, with nongenetic factors playing an important role.
Of the latter, there is the intriguing possibility that the molecular structure of the <START:ggp> target antigen <END> contributes to the development of <START:ggp> thyroid-stimulatory autoantibodies <END> ( <START:ggp> TSAb?s <END> ).
Among the <START:ggp> glycoprotein hormone receptors <END> , only the <START:ggp> TSHR <END> undergoes <START:bf> intramolecular cleavage <END> into disulfide-linked <START:ggp> subunits <END> with consequent <START:bf> shedding <END> of some of the extracellular, autoantibody-binding <START:ggp> A subunits <END> .
<START:ggp> Functional autoantibodies <END> do not arise to the noncleaving <START:ggp> glycoprotein hormone receptors <END> .
Recently, <START:ggp> TSAb?s <END> were found to preferentially recognize shed, rather than attached, <START:ggp> A subunits <END> .
Here we use a new <START:organism> adenovirus-mediated animal model <END> of <START:disease> Graves disease <END> to show that <START:disease> goiter <END> and <START:disease> hyperthyroidism <END> occur to a much greater extent when the <START:organism> adenovirus <END> expresses the free <START:ggp> A subunit <END> as opposed to a genetically modified <START:ggp> TSHR <END> that cleaves minimally into <START:ggp> subunits <END> .
These data show that shed <START:ggp> A subunits <END> induce or amplify the <START:bf> immune response <END> leading to <START:disease> hyperthyroidism <END> and provide new insight into the etiology of <START:disease> Graves disease <END> .
<START:disease> Atopic disease <END> and <START:ggp> immunoglobulin E <END> in <START:organism> twins <END> reared apart and together.
Both genetic and environmental influences have been implicated in the etiology of <START:disease> atopic disease <END> and in the determination of <START:bf> serum IgE levels <END> .
To quantify the relative contribution of these influences, we studied the prevalence of <START:disease> asthma <END> and <START:disease> seasonal rhinitis <END> , <START:bf> skin-test response <END> , <START:bf> total serum IgE levels <END> , and <START:ggp> specific IgE <END> , as measured by RAST, in a sample of <START:organism> MZ and DZ twins <END> reared apart or together.
Concordance rates for <START:disease> asthma <END> , <START:disease> rhinitis <END> , positive skin tests, and RAST were calculated.
<START:organism> MZ twins <END> , whether reared apart or together, showed a greater concordance than <START:organism> dizygotic twins <END> reared apart or together.
Maximum-likelihood tests of genetic and environmental components of the variation of <START:bf> total IgE levels <END> revealed a <START:ggp> substantial genetic component <END> and a negligible contribution from common familial environmental effects.
Relative predispositional effects ( RPEs ) of <START:ggp> marker alleles <END> with disease: <START:ggp> HLA-DR alleles <END> and <START:disease> Graves disease <END> .
A method is described to reveal the relative predispositional effects ( RPEs ) ( predisposing, protective, or neutral ) of the <START:ggp> HLA alleles <END> or of any other <START:ggp> marker <END> system that is associated with a disease.
When the disease is associated with two or more <START:ggp> alleles <END> of a <START:ggp> locus <END> , the RPE method identifies the associations sequentially according to their strength; thus the problem that a strong association with one <START:ggp> allele <END> can create misleading deviations in the frequencies of other <START:ggp> alleles <END> is alleviated.
Using this method, we have examined the relative effects of <START:ggp> HLA-DR alleles <END> in <START:bf> susceptibility to Graves disease <END> in the <START:organism> Caucasian population <END> .
The well-established positive association with <START:ggp> DR3 <END> was confirmed as the strongest effect.
In addition, a negative association was found between <START:ggp> DR5 <END> and <START:disease> Graves disease <END> .
The <START:bf> reduced frequency of DR5 <END> among <START:organism> patients <END> is statistically significant and is not a result of the <START:bf> increase in DR3 <END> .
Finally, when <START:organism> patients <END> were divided according to the presence or absence of <START:disease> eye disease <END> , the latter showed a significant <START:bf> increase in the frequency of DR4 <END> .
With <START:organism> family <END> data, linkage to <START:ggp> HLA <END> of <START:disease> Graves disease <END> was established in both <START:organism> Caucasian and Chinese families <END> by the <START:organism> sib-pair <END> method.
Cloning and <START:bf> expression <END> of a novel <START:ggp> human antibody <END> ? <START:ggp> antigen <END> pair associated with <START:disease> Felty's syndrome <END> 
An increasing number of studies suggest the importance of <START:ggp> antibodies <END> in the <START:bf> pathogenesis <END> of most <START:disease> systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases <END> , although there is considerable controversy over the precise role of the <START:ggp> autoantibodies <END> involved.
In <START:organism> humans <END> , a major obstacle to progress is the identification and cloning of the relevant <START:ggp> autoantibodies <END> and <START:ggp> autoantigens <END> .
Here, an approach based on the sequential use of <START:ggp> antibody <END> <START:organism> phage <END> display and <START:bf> antigen expression <END> libraries is developed and applied to a <START:organism> donor <END> suffering from <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:disease> RA <END> ), <START:bf> splenomegaly <END> , and <START:bf> peripheral destruction of neutrophils <END> leading to <START:disease> neutropenia <END> ( <START:disease> Felty's syndrome <END> ).
An <START:ggp> antibody <END> <START:organism> phage <END> display library was constructed from <START:anatomy> bone marrow <END> from the <START:organism> donor <END> and a <START:ggp> high-affinity human mAb <END> , <START:ggp> ANA15 <END> , selected by panning against fresh <START:anatomy> neutrophils <END> and independently by panning against a fixed <START:anatomy> cell line <END> .
The <START:ggp> antibody <END> showed strong staining of <START:anatomy> neutrophils <END> and a number of <START:anatomy> cell lines <END> .
Probing of a <START:organism> ?gt11 <END> <START:bf> expression <END> library from an induced <START:anatomy> myelomonocytic cell line <END> with the <START:ggp> mAb <END> <START:ggp> ANA15 <END> identified the <START:ggp> eukaryotic elongation factor 1A-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> eEF1A-1 <END> ) as a novel <START:ggp> autoantigen <END> .
The specificity of <START:ggp> ANA15 <END> was confirmed by reactivity with both purified and recombinant <START:ggp> eEF1A-1 <END> .
Screening of a large panel of <START:anatomy> sera <END> revealed that 66% of <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> Felty's syndrome <END> had <START:bf> elevated levels of anti-eEF1A-1 antibodies <END> .
The cloning of this <START:ggp> antibody <END> ? <START:ggp> antigen <END> pair should permit rational evaluation of any pathogenicity resulting from the interaction and its significance in <START:disease> neutropenia <END> .
<START:ggp> HLA <END> and disease: predictions for <START:ggp> HLA haplotype <END> sharing in <START:organism> families <END> .
An analysis of published data on the segregation of <START:ggp> HLA haplotypes <END> in <START:organism> families <END> with more than one <START:organism> individual <END> affected with <START:disease> insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus <END> or <START:disease> multiple sclerosis <END> yields three conclusions: ( 1 ) In <START:organism> families <END> with <START:organism> unaffected parents <END> , <START:organism> affected sib pairs <END> are much more often <START:ggp> HLA haplotype <END> identical in sibships with two <START:organism> affected sibs <END> than in sibships with three or four <START:organism> affected sibs <END> ( P less than .01 ).
( 2 ) In <START:organism> families <END> with <START:organism> unaffected parents <END> and <START:organism> HLA half-identical affected sibs <END> , <START:organism> well siblings <END> more often receive the <START:ggp> single haplotype <END> not found in the <START:organism> affected sibs <END> than is expected by chance ( P less than .05 ).
( 3 ) In <START:organism> families <END> with one <START:organism> affected parent <END> , <START:organism> well siblings <END> of <START:organism> affected individuals <END> may share with the <START:organism> affected child <END> a <START:ggp> haplotype <END> from the <START:organism> unaffected parent <END> less than 50% of the time ( P less than .10 ).
These results are consistent with the premise that in some <START:disease> non-Mendelian, familial, HLA-associated disease <END> more than one <START:ggp> gene <END> may contribute to <START:bf> susceptibility to the disorder <END> .
<START:ggp> Human lupus autoantibodies <END> against <START:ggp> NMDA receptors <END> mediate <START:bf> cognitive impairment <END> 
<START:disease> Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus <END> , which often entails <START:bf> cognitive disturbances <END> and <START:bf> memory loss <END> , has become a <START:bf> major complication <END> for <START:organism> lupus patients <END> .
Previously, we developed a <START:organism> murine model <END> of <START:disease> neuropsychiatric lupus <END> based on <START:ggp> Abs <END> that cross-react with <START:ggp> dsDNA <END> and the <START:ggp> NMDA receptor <END> ( <START:ggp> NMDAR <END> ).
We showed that these <START:ggp> murine Abs <END> impair <START:bf> cognition <END> when they access the <START:anatomy> CNS <END> through a breach in the <START:anatomy> blood?brain barrier <END> ( <START:anatomy> BBB <END> ) triggered by <START:ched> lipopolysaccharide <END> .
Because studies show that <START:organism> lupus patients <END> possess <START:ggp> anti-NMDAR Abs <END> in their <START:anatomy> serum <END> and <START:anatomy> cerebrospinal fluid <END> , we decided to investigate whether these <START:ggp> human Abs <END> contribute to <START:bf> cognitive dysfunction <END> .
Here, we show that <START:anatomy> serum <END> with reactivity to <START:ggp> DNA <END> and <START:ggp> NMDAR <END> extracted from <START:organism> lupus patients <END> elicited <START:bf> cognitive impairment <END> in <START:organism> mice <END> receiving the <START:anatomy> serum <END> intravenously and given <START:ched> lipopolysaccharide <END> to compromise the <START:anatomy> BBB <END> integrity.
<START:anatomy> Brain <END> histopathology showed <START:bf> hippocampal neuron damage <END> , and behavioral testing revealed <START:bf> hippocampus-dependent memory impairment <END> .
To determine whether <START:ggp> anti-NMDAR Abs <END> exist in the <START:anatomy> brains <END> of <START:organism> systemic lupus erythematosus patients <END> , we eluted <START:ggp> IgG <END> from a <START:anatomy> patient's brain <END> .
The <START:ggp> IgG <END> bound <START:ggp> DNA <END> and <START:ggp> NMDAR <END> and caused <START:bf> neuronal apoptosis <END> when injected into <START:anatomy> mouse brains <END> .
We examined four more <START:anatomy> brains <END> of <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> neuropsychiatric lupus <END> and found that they displayed endogenous <START:ggp> IgG <END> colocalizing with <START:ggp> anti-NMDAR Abs <END> .
Our results indicate that <START:organism> lupus patients <END> have circulating <START:ggp> anti-NMDAR Abs <END> capable of causing <START:bf> neuronal damage <END> and <START:bf> memory deficit <END> , if they breach the <START:anatomy> BBB <END> , and that the <START:ggp> Abs <END> exist within <START:anatomy> patients' brains <END> .
Which aspects of <START:disease> neuropsychiatric lupus <END> may be mediated by <START:ggp> anti-NMDAR Abs <END> , how often, and in which <START:organism> patients <END> are now important clinical questions.
The <START:organism> affected-pedigree-member <END> method of linkage analysis.
This paper describes a generalization of the <START:organism> affected-sib-pair <END> method of linkage analysis to <START:organism> pedigrees <END> .
By substituting identity-by-state relations for identity-by-descent relations, we develop a test statistic for detecting departures from independent segregation of disease and <START:bf> marker phenotypes <END> .
The statistic is based on the <START:bf> marker phenotypes <END> of affected <START:organism> pedigree members <END> only.
Since it is more striking for <START:organism> distantly affected relatives <END> to share a <START:ggp> rare marker allele <END> than a <START:ggp> common marker allele <END> , the statistic also includes a weighting factor based on <START:ggp> allele <END> frequency.
The distributional properties of the statistic are investigated theoretically and by simulation.
Part of the theoretical treatment entails generalizing Karigl's multiple- <START:organism> person <END> kinship coefficients.
When the test statistic is applied to <START:organism> pedigree <END> data on <START:disease> Huntington disease <END> , the null hypothesis of independent segregation between the <START:ggp> marker locus <END> and the <START:ggp> disease locus <END> is firmly rejected.
In this case, as expected, there is a loss of power when compared with standard lod-score analysis.
However, our statistic possesses the advantage of requiring no explicit assumptions about the mode of <START:bf> inheritance of the disease <END> .
This point is illustrated by application of the test statistic to data on <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
Familial <START:disease> Hashimoto's thyroiditis <END> with <START:bf> kidney impairment <END> .
A <START:organism> 12 year old boy <END> and his two <START:organism> sisters <END> with <START:disease> Hashimoto's thyroiditis <END> and <START:bf> renal impairment <END> were studied.
Three <START:organism> generations <END> of this <START:organism> family <END> had <START:disease> autoimmune thyroid disease <END> : <START:disease> Graves' disease <END> was diagnosed in the <START:organism> first generation <END> , and the <START:organism> second and third generations <END> had <START:bf> thyroid enlargement <END> with <START:bf> abnormal thyroid function <END> and <START:bf> immunological abnormalities <END> .
The disease in this <START:organism> family <END> could not be explained simply by the <START:ggp> types <END> of <START:ggp> human leucocyte antigens <END> found.
<START:disease> Renal disease <END> in <START:disease> autoimmune thyroid disease <END> is uncommon, treatment difficult, and the prognosis unknown.
The <START:bf> proteinuria <END> disappeared in all three <START:organism> children <END> during the three and a half years of follow up, which implies that the <START:bf> renal impairment <END> may be transitory in some <START:organism> patients <END> .
Mutations in the <START:ggp> gene <END> for <START:disease> X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy <END> in <START:organism> patients <END> with different clinical phenotypes.
Recently, the <START:ggp> gene <END> for the most common <START:disease> peroxisomal disorder <END> , <START:disease> X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy <END> ( <START:disease> X-ALD <END> ), has been described encoding a <START:ggp> peroxisomal membrane transporter protein <END> .
We analyzed the entire <START:ggp> protein-coding sequence <END> of this <START:ggp> gene <END> by reverse- <START:bf> transcription <END> PCR, SSCP, and <START:ggp> DNA <END> sequencing in five <START:organism> patients <END> with different clinical expression of <START:disease> X-ALD <END> and in their <START:organism> female relatives <END> ; these clinical expressions were <START:disease> cerebral childhood ALD <END> , <START:disease> adrenomyeloneuropathy <END> ( <START:disease> AMN <END> ), and <START:bf> " Addison disease only " ( ADO ) phenotype <END> .
In the three <START:organism> patients <END> exhibiting the classical picture of severe <START:disease> childhood ALD <END> we identified in the <START:ggp> 5' portion <END> of the <START:ggp> X-ALD gene <END> a 38-bp deletion that causes a frameshift mutation, a 3-bp deletion leading to a deletion of an <START:ggp> amino acid <END> in the <START:ggp> ATP-binding domain <END> of the <START:ggp> ALD protein <END> , and a missense mutation.
In the <START:organism> patient <END> with the clinical <START:bf> phenotype of AMN <END> , a nonsense mutation in <START:ggp> codon 212 <END> , along with a <START:ggp> second site <END> mutation at <START:ggp> codon 178 <END> , was observed.
Analysis of the <START:organism> patient <END> with the <START:bf> ADO phenotype <END> revealed a further missense mutation at a <START:ggp> highly conserved position <END> in the <START:ggp> ALDP <END> / <START:ggp> PMP70 <END> comparison.
The disruptive nature of two mutations ( i.e., the frameshift and the nonsense mutation ) in <START:organism> patients <END> with biochemically proved <START:disease> childhood ALD <END> and <START:disease> AMN <END> further strongly supports the hypothesis that alterations in this <START:ggp> gene <END> play a crucial role in the <START:bf> pathogenesis of X-ALD <END> .
Since the current biochemical techniques for <START:organism> X-ALD carrier <END> detection in <START:organism> affected families <END> lack sufficient reliability, our procedure described for systematic mutation scanning is also capable of improving genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.
Genetic epidemiology of <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
We conducted <START:organism> family <END> studies and segregation analyses of <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:disease> RA <END> ) that were based on <START:organism> consecutive patients <END> with <START:disease> RA <END> ascertained without regard to <START:organism> family <END> history or known risk factors.
<START:organism> First-degree relatives <END> from 135 <START:organism> simplex and 30 multiplex families <END> were included in the analyses.
A <START:ggp> highly penetrant recessive major gene <END> , with a <START:ggp> mutant allele <END> frequency of .005, was identified as the <START:ggp> most parsimonious genetic risk factor <END> .
Significant evidence for heterogeneity in risk for <START:disease> RA <END> was observed for <START:organism> proband <END> gender but not for <START:organism> proband <END> age at onset.
Kaplan-Meier risk analysis demonstrated significant evidence for differences in the distribution of risk among <START:organism> first-degree relatives <END> .
These analyses demonstrated that both <START:organism> proband <END> gender and age at onset are important risk factors but that <START:organism> proband <END> gender appears to be the more important determinant of risk, with <START:organism> relatives <END> of <START:organism> male probands <END> having the greatest cumulative risk for <START:disease> RA <END> .
In addition, log-linear modeling identified <START:organism> proband <END> gender, familiality ( multiplex or simplex ), and an interaction term between these two variables as being adequate to define the distribution of risk in <START:organism> families <END> .
The pattern of risk for <START:disease> RA <END> among <START:organism> susceptible individuals <END> and its <START:bf> inheritance <END> is thus heterogeneous.
For future genetic analyses, <START:organism> families <END> with an excess of <START:organism> affected males <END> having a young age at onset may be the most informative in identifying the putative <START:ggp> recessive gene <END> and its <START:ggp> modifiers <END> .
Two- <START:ggp> locus <END> maximum lod score analysis of a <START:bf> multifactorial trait <END> : joint consideration of <START:ggp> IDDM2 <END> and <START:ggp> IDDM4 <END> with <START:ggp> IDDM1 <END> in <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> .
To investigate the <START:ggp> genetic component <END> of <START:disease> multifactorial diseases <END> such as <START:disease> type 1 ( insulin-dependent ) diabetes mellitus <END> ( <START:disease> IDDM <END> ), models involving the joint action of several <START:ggp> disease loci <END> are important.
These models can give increased power to detect an effect and a greater understanding of etiological mechanisms.
Here, we present an extension of the maximum lod score method of N.
Risch, which allows the simultaneous detection and modeling of two unlinked <START:ggp> disease loci <END> .
Genetic constraints on the identical-by-descent sharing probabilities, analogous to the " triangle " restrictions in the <START:ggp> single-locus <END> method, are derived, and the size and power of the test statistics are investigated.
The method is applied to <START:organism> affected-sib-pair <END> data, and the joint effects of <START:ggp> IDDM1 <END> ( <START:ggp> HLA <END> ) and <START:ggp> IDDM2 <END> ( the <START:ggp> INS VNTR <END> ) and of <START:ggp> IDDM1 <END> and <START:ggp> IDDM4 <END> ( <START:ggp> FGF3 <END> -linked ) are assessed with relation to the development of <START:disease> IDDM <END> .
In the presence of genetic heterogeneity, there is seen to be a significant advantage in analyzing more than one <START:ggp> locus <END> simultaneously.
Analysis of these <START:organism> families <END> indicates that the effects at <START:ggp> IDDM1 <END> and <START:ggp> IDDM2 <END> are well described by a multiplicative genetic model, while those at <START:ggp> IDDM1 <END> and <START:ggp> IDDM4 <END> follow a heterogeneity model.
Evidence for two unlinked <START:ggp> loci <END> regulating <START:bf> total serum IgE levels <END> .
Studies investigating the genetic control of <START:bf> total serum IgE levels <END> are of major importance in understanding basic pathophysiologic mechanisms in <START:disease> atopy <END> and <START:disease> asthma <END> , since <START:bf> IgE levels <END> predict onset and correlate with the clinical expression of these disorders.
Previous analysis of data from 92 <START:organism> families <END> , ascertained through a <START:organism> parent <END> with <START:disease> asthma <END> , showed evidence for <START:bf> recessive inheritance <END> of <START:bf> high IgE levels <END> with linkage to <START:ggp> chromosome 5q <END> .
Since there was significant residual familial correlation in the one- <START:ggp> locus <END> segregation analysis, two- <START:ggp> locus <END> segregation and linkage analyses were performed.
Segregation analyses provided evidence for a second major <START:ggp> locus <END> unlinked to the <START:ggp> locus <END> on <START:ggp> 5q <END> .
Utilization of this two- <START:ggp> locus <END> model corroborates the previous evidence for linkage between this trait and <START:ggp> markers <END> on <START:ggp> 5q31-q33 <END> .
The LODs for the most informative <START:ggp> marker <END> <START:ggp> D5S436 <END> increased from 3.00 at 10% <START:bf> recombination <END> to 4.67 at 9% <START:bf> recombination <END> , when the two- <START:ggp> locus <END> model was used.
Additional linkage studies are needed to map this second <START:ggp> locus <END> .
These results demonstrate the importance of performing multilocus segregation and linkage analyses for <START:bf> quantitative traits <END> that are related to the <START:bf> phenotype of a complex disorder <END> .
This approach has given further insight into the genetics of <START:disease> allergy <END> and <START:disease> asthma <END> by providing evidence for a two- <START:ggp> locus <END> model.
Association of a common <START:ggp> complement receptor 2 haplotype <END> with increased risk of <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> 
A <START:ggp> genomic region <END> on <START:ggp> distal mouse chromosome 1 <END> and its <START:ggp> syntenic human counterpart <END> <START:ggp> 1q23?42 <END> show strong evidence of harboring <START:ggp> lupus susceptibility genes <END> .
We found evidence of linkage at <START:ggp> 1q32.2 <END> in a targeted genome scan of <START:ggp> 1q21?43 <END> in 126 <START:organism> lupus multiplex families <END> containing 151 <START:organism> affected sibpairs <END> ( nonparametric linkage score 2.52, P = 0.006 ).
A <START:ggp> positional candidate gene <END> at <START:ggp> 1q32.2 <END> , <START:organism> complement receptor 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> CR2 <END> ), is also a candidate in the <START:ggp> murine Sle1c lupus susceptibility locus <END> .
To explore its role in <START:disease> human disease <END> , we analyzed 1,416 <START:organism> individuals <END> from 258 <START:organism> Caucasian and 142 Chinese lupus simplex families <END> and demonstrated that a common three-single- <START:ggp> nucleotide <END> polymorphism <START:ggp> CR2 haplotype <END> ( rs3813946, rs1048971, rs17615 ) was associated with <START:bf> lupus susceptibility <END> ( P = 0.00001 ) with a 1.54-fold increased risk for the development of disease.
Single- <START:ggp> nucleotide <END> polymorphism 1 ( rs3813946 ), located in the <START:ggp> 5? untranslated region <END> of the <START:ggp> CR2 gene <END> , altered transcriptional activity, suggesting a potential mechanism by which <START:ggp> CR2 <END> could contribute to the development of <START:disease> lupus <END> .
Our findings reveal that <START:ggp> CR2 <END> is a likely <START:ggp> susceptibility gene <END> for <START:disease> human lupus <END> at <START:ggp> 1q32.2 <END> , extending previous studies suggesting that <START:ggp> CR2 <END> participates in the <START:bf> pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .
Heterozygous Mutations in <START:ggp> TREX1 <END> Cause <START:disease> Familial Chilblain Lupus <END> and <START:disease> Dominant Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome <END> 
<START:ggp> TREX1 <END> constitutes the major <START:ggp> 3??5? DNA exonuclease <END> activity measured in mammalian cells.
Recently, biallelic mutations in <START:ggp> TREX1 <END> have been shown to cause <START:disease> Aicardi-Goutières syndrome <END> at the <START:ggp> AGS1 locus <END> .
Interestingly, <START:disease> Aicardi-Goutières syndrome <END> shows overlap with <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> at both clinical and pathological levels.
Here, we report a heterozygous <START:ggp> TREX1 <END> mutation causing <START:disease> familial chilblain lupus <END> .
Additionally, we describe a de novo heterozygous mutation, affecting a critical <START:ggp> catalytic residue <END> in <START:ggp> TREX1 <END> , that results in typical <START:disease> Aicardi-Goutières syndrome <END> .
<START:ggp> Gene <END> - <START:ggp> Gene <END> and <START:ggp> Gene <END> -Environment Interactions Involving <START:ggp> HLA-DRB1 <END> , <START:ggp> PTPN22 <END> , and Smoking in Two <START:organism> Subsets <END> of <START:disease> Rheumatoid Arthritis <END> 
<START:ggp> Gene <END> - <START:ggp> gene <END> and <START:ggp> gene <END> -environment interactions are key features in the development of <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:disease> RA <END> ) and other <START:disease> complex diseases <END> .
The aim of this study was to use and compare three different definitions of interaction between the two major <START:ggp> genetic risk factors <END> of <START:disease> RA <END> ?the <START:ggp> HLA-DRB1 shared epitope ( SE ) alleles <END> and the <START:ggp> PTPN22 R620W allele <END> ?in three large <START:organism> case <END> - <START:organism> control <END> studies: the Swedish Epidemiological Investigation of <START:ggp> Rheumatoid Arthritis <END> ( EIRA ) study, the North American <START:disease> RA <END> Consortium ( NARAC ) study, and the Dutch Leiden Early <START:disease> Arthritis <END> Clinic study ( in total, 1,977 <START:organism> cases <END> and 2,405 <START:organism> controls <END> ).
The EIRA study was also used to analyze interactions between smoking and the two <START:ggp> genes <END> .
?Interaction? was defined either as a departure from additivity, as interaction in a multiplicative model, or in terms of linkage disequilibrium?for example, deviation from independence of penetrance of two unlinked <START:ggp> loci <END> .
Consistent interaction, defined as departure from additivity, between <START:ggp> HLA-DRB1 SE alleles <END> and the <START:ggp> A allele <END> of <START:ggp> PTPN22 R620W <END> was seen in all three studies regarding <START:disease> anti-CCP?positive RA <END> .
Testing for multiplicative interactions demonstrated an interaction between the two <START:ggp> genes <END> only when the three studies were pooled.
The linkage disequilibrium approach indicated a <START:ggp> gene <END> - <START:ggp> gene <END> interaction in EIRA and NARAC, as well as in the pooled analysis.
No interaction was seen between smoking and <START:ggp> PTPN22 R620W <END> .
A new pattern of interactions is described between the two major known <START:ggp> genetic risk factors <END> and the major environmental risk factor concerning the risk of developing <START:disease> anti-CCP?positive RA <END> .
The data extend the basis for a pathogenetic hypothesis for <START:disease> RA <END> involving genetic and environmental factors.
The study also raises and illustrates principal questions concerning ways to define interactions in <START:disease> complex diseases <END> .
<START:bf> Systemic lupus erythematosus-associated defects <END> in the <START:ggp> inhibitory receptor <END> <START:ggp> Fc?RIIb <END> reduce <START:bf> susceptibility to malaria <END> 
Polygenic <START:disease> autoimmune diseases <END> , such as <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ), are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
In recent years, functionally important genetic polymorphisms conferring <START:bf> susceptibility to SLE <END> have been identified, but the evolutionary pressures driving their retention in the <START:ggp> gene <END> pool remain elusive.
A defunctioning, <START:disease> SLE <END> -associated polymorphism of the <START:ggp> inhibitory receptor <END> <START:ggp> Fc?RIIb <END> is found at an increased frequency in <START:organism> African and Asian populations <END> , broadly corresponding to areas where <START:disease> malaria <END> is endemic.
Here, we show that <START:organism> Fc?RIIb-deficient mice <END> have increased <START:bf> clearance of malarial parasites <END> ( <START:organism> Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi <END> ) and develop less severe disease.
In vitro , the <START:disease> human lupus <END> associated <START:ggp> Fc?RIIb <END> polymorphism enhances <START:bf> phagocytosis of Plasmodium falciparum -infected erythrocytes <END> .
These results demonstrate that <START:ggp> Fc?RIIb <END> is important in controlling the <START:bf> immune response to malarial parasites <END> and suggests that the higher frequency of <START:ggp> human Fc?RIIb <END> polymorphisms predisposing to <START:disease> SLE <END> in <START:organism> Asians <END> and <START:organism> Africans <END> may be maintained because these <START:ggp> variants <END> reduce <START:bf> susceptibility to malaria <END> .
Analysis of <START:ggp> DAX1 <END> ( <START:ggp> NR0B1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> steroidogenic factor-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> SF1 <END> / <START:ggp> Ad4BP <END> , <START:ggp> NR5A1 <END> ) in <START:organism> children <END> and <START:organism> adults <END> with <START:disease> primary adrenal failure <END> : ten years' experience 
Context <START:disease> Primary adrenal failure <END> is a life-threatening condition that can be caused by a range of etiologies, including <START:bf> autoimmune, metabolic, and developmental disorders <END> .
The <START:ggp> nuclear receptors <END> <START:ggp> DAX1 <END> ( <START:ggp> NR0B1 <END> ) and <START:ggp> steroidogenic factor-1 <END> ( <START:ggp> SF1 <END> / <START:ggp> Ad4BP <END> , <START:ggp> NR5A1 <END> ) play an important role in <START:bf> adrenal development <END> and function, and mutations in these <START:ggp> transcription factors <END> have been found in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> adrenal hypoplasia <END> .
Objective To investigate the prevalence of <START:ggp> DAX1 <END> and <START:ggp> SF1 <END> mutations in <START:organism> children <END> and <START:organism> adults <END> with <START:disease> primary adrenal failure <END> of unknown etiology ( i.e., not caused by <START:disease> congenital adrenal hyperplasia <END> , <START:disease> adrenoleukodystrophy <END> , <START:disease> autoimmune disease <END> ).
<START:organism> Patients <END> One-hundred and seventeen <START:organism> patients <END> were included.
Eighty-eight <START:organism> individuals <END> presented in infancy or childhood with <START:disease> adrenal hypoplasia <END> or <START:disease> primary adrenal failure <END> of unknown etiology ( n=64, <START:organism> 46,XY phenotypic males <END> ; n=17, <START:bf> 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis/impaired androgenization <END> ; n=7, <START:organism> 46,XX females <END> ).
Twenty-nine <START:organism> individuals <END> presented in adulthood with ? <START:disease> Addison disease <END> ? of unknown etiology.
Methods Mutational analysis of <START:ggp> DAX1 <END> ( <START:ggp> NR0B1 <END> ) ( including <START:ggp> exon 2?/1A <END> ) and <START:ggp> SF1 <END> ( <START:ggp> NR5A1 <END> ) by direct sequencing.
Results <START:ggp> DAX1 <END> mutations were found in 58% ( 37/64 ) of <START:organism> 46,XY phenotypic boys <END> referred with <START:disease> adrenal hypoplasia <END> , and in all <START:organism> boys <END> ( 8/8 ) with <START:disease> hypogonadotropic hypogonadism <END> and a <START:organism> family <END> history suggestive of <START:disease> adrenal failure <END> in <START:organism> males <END> .
<START:ggp> SF1 <END> mutations causing <START:disease> adrenal failure <END> were found only in two <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:bf> 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis <END> .
No <START:ggp> DAX1 <END> or <START:ggp> SF1 <END> mutations were identified in the <START:organism> adult-onset group <END> .
Conclusions <START:ggp> DAX1 <END> mutations are a relatively frequent cause of <START:disease> adrenal failure <END> in this <START:organism> group <END> of <START:organism> boys <END> .
<START:ggp> SF1 <END> mutations causing <START:disease> adrenal failure <END> in <START:organism> humans <END> are rare and are more likely to be associated with significant underandrogenization and <START:disease> gonadal dysfunction <END> in <START:organism> 46,XY individuals <END> .
<START:disease> Non-Classic Congenital Lipoid Adrenal Hyperplasia <END> : A New <START:bf> Disorder of the Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein <END> With Very Late Presentation and <START:bf> Normal Male Genitalia <END> 
Context <START:disease> Congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia <END> ( <START:disease> lipoid CAH <END> ) is a <START:bf> severe disorder of adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis <END> caused by mutations in the <START:ggp> steroidogenic acute regulatory protein <END> ( <START:ggp> StAR <END> ).
<START:organism> Affected children <END> typically present with <START:disease> life-threatening adrenal insufficiency <END> in early infancy due to a <START:bf> failure of glucocorticoid ( cortisol ) and mineralocorticoid ( aldosterone ) biosynthesis <END> , and <START:organism> 46,XY genetic males <END> have <START:bf> complete lack of androgenization <END> and appear phenotypically <START:bf> female <END> due to <START:bf> impaired testicular androgen secretion <END> in <START:anatomy> utero <END> .
Objective The objective of this study was to investigate whether non-classic forms of this condition exist.
<START:organism> Patients <END> & Methods Sequence analysis of the <START:ggp> gene <END> encoding <START:ggp> StAR <END> was undertaken in three <START:organism> children <END> from two <START:organism> families <END> who presented with <START:disease> primary adrenal insufficiency <END> at 2-4 years of age; the <START:organism> males <END> had <START:bf> normal genital development <END> .
Identified mutants were tested in a series of biochemical assays.
Results <START:ggp> DNA <END> sequencing identified homozygous <START:ggp> StAR <END> mutations Val187Met and Arg188Cys in these two <START:organism> families <END> .
Functional studies of <START:ggp> StAR <END> activity in <START:anatomy> cells <END> and in vitro, and <START:ched> cholesterol <END> -binding assays showed these mutants retained ?20% of <START:ggp> wild type <END> activity.
Conclusions These <START:organism> patients <END> define a new disorder, ? <START:disease> non-classic lipoid CAH <END> ?, and represent a new cause of <START:disease> non-autoimmune Addison disease <END> ( <START:disease> primary adrenal failure <END> ).
<START:ched> Pristane <END> -induced <START:disease> arthritis <END> in <START:organism> rats <END> : a new <START:organism> model <END> for <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> with a <START:disease> chronic disease <END> course influenced by both <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex <END> and <START:ggp> non-major histocompatibility complex genes <END> .
We present a novel <START:organism> animal model <END> for <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> induced with a well defined <START:ched> synthetic adjuvant oil <END> , <START:ched> pristane <END> .
Two weeks after a single intradermal injection of 150 microliters of <START:ched> pristane <END> , the <START:organism> rats <END> developed severe and chronic <START:disease> arthritis <END> .
The <START:bf> inflammation <END> was restricted to the joints and involved <START:bf> pannus formation <END> , <START:bf> major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II expression <END> , and <START:bf> T lymphocyte infiltration <END> .
The initial development as well as the chronic stage of <START:ched> pristane <END> -induced <START:disease> arthritis <END> was ameliorated by treatment with <START:ggp> antibodies <END> to the <START:ggp> alpha beta-T-cell receptor <END> showing that the disease is T cell dependent.
Increased levels of <START:ggp> interleukin <END> in serum was seen after <START:ched> pristane <END> injection but not during the chronic stage of <START:disease> arthritis <END> .
<START:bf> Joint erosions <END> were accompanied by <START:bf> elevated serum levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein <END> .
Comparison of <START:organism> MHC congenic LEW strains <END> showed that the <START:bf> severity <END> and chronicity of <START:disease> arthritis <END> varied among the different <START:ggp> MHC haplotypes <END> .
<START:organism> Rats <END> with <START:ggp> RT1f haplotype <END> showed a <START:bf> significantly higher susceptibility to pristane-induced arthritis <END> .
A strong influence of <START:ggp> non-MHC genes <END> was also suggested by the variability of <START:bf> arthritis susceptibility <END> among <START:organism> different strains <END> with the same <START:ggp> MHC haplotype <END> ; the <START:ggp> most susceptible background <END> was the <START:organism> DA <END> and the least susceptible was the <START:organism> E3 <END> .
<START:disease> Arthritis <END> induced with a well defined <START:ched> nonimmunogenic adjuvant <END> , with a disease course that closely resembles that of <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> , makes a suitable <START:organism> animal model <END> for future studies of the pathology and genetics of <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
<START:ggp> Gene <END> Copy-Number Variation and Associated Polymorphisms of <START:ggp> Complement Component C4 <END> in <START:disease> Human Systemic Lupus Erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ): Low Copy Number Is a Risk Factor for and High Copy Number Is a Protective Factor against <START:bf> SLE Susceptibility <END> in <START:organism> European Americans <END> 
Interindividual <START:ggp> gene <END> copy-number variation ( CNV ) of <START:ggp> complement component C4 <END> and its associated polymorphisms in <START:ggp> gene <END> size ( long and short ) and <START:ggp> protein isotypes <END> ( <START:ggp> C4A <END> and <START:ggp> C4B <END> ) probably lead to different <START:bf> susceptibilities to autoimmune disease <END> .
We investigated the <START:ggp> C4 gene <END> CNV in 1,241 <START:organism> European Americans <END> , including <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ), their <START:organism> first-degree relatives <END> , and <START:organism> unrelated healthy subjects <END> , by definitive genotyping and phenotyping techniques.
The <START:ggp> gene <END> copy number ( GCN ) varied from 2 to 6 for total <START:ggp> C4 <END> , from 0 to 5 for <START:ggp> C4A <END> , and from 0 to 4 for <START:ggp> C4B <END> .
Four copies of total <START:ggp> C4 <END> , two copies of <START:ggp> C4A <END> , and two copies of <START:ggp> C4B <END> were the most common GCN counts, but each constituted only between one-half and three-quarters of the <START:organism> study populations <END> .
<START:ggp> Long C4 genes <END> were strongly correlated with <START:ggp> C4A <END> ( R =0.695 ; P <.0001 ).
<START:ggp> Short C4 genes <END> were correlated with <START:ggp> C4B <END> ( R =0.437 ; P <.0001 ).
In comparison with <START:organism> healthy subjects <END> , <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> SLE <END> clearly had the GCN of total <START:ggp> C4 <END> and <START:ggp> C4A <END> shifting to the lower side.
The risk of <START:bf> SLE disease susceptibility <END> significantly increased among <START:organism> subjects <END> with only two copies of total <START:ggp> C4 <END> ( <START:organism> patients <END> 9.3%; <START:organism> unrelated controls <END> 1.5%; odds ratio [OR] = 6.514; P =.00002 ) but decreased in those with 5 copies of <START:ggp> C4 <END> ( <START:organism> patients <END> 5.79%; <START:organism> controls <END> 12%; OR =0.466 ; P =.016 ).
Both zero copies ( OR =5.267 ; P =.001 ) and one copy ( OR =1.613 ; P =.022 ) of <START:ggp> C4A <END> were risk factors for <START:disease> SLE <END> , whereas 3 copies of <START:ggp> C4A <END> appeared to be protective ( OR =0.574 ; P =.012 ).
<START:organism> Family <END> -based association tests suggested that a specific <START:ggp> haplotype <END> with a single <START:ggp> short C4B <END> in tight linkage disequilibrium with the <START:ggp> ?308A allele <END> of <START:ggp> TNFA <END> was more likely to be transmitted to <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> SLE <END> .
This work demonstrates how <START:ggp> gene <END> CNV and its related polymorphisms are associated with the <START:bf> susceptibility to a human complex disease <END> .
<START:ggp> IRAK-M <END> Is Involved in the <START:bf> Pathogenesis of Early-Onset Persistent Asthma <END> 
<START:disease> Asthma <END> is a <START:disease> multifactorial disease <END> influenced by genetic and environmental factors.
In the past decade, several <START:ggp> loci <END> and >100 <START:ggp> genes <END> have been found to be associated with the disease in at least one <START:organism> population <END> .
Among these <START:ggp> loci <END> , <START:ggp> region 12q13-24 <END> has been implicated in <START:disease> asthma <END> etiology in multiple <START:organism> populations <END> , suggesting that it harbors one or more <START:ggp> asthma susceptibility genes <END> .
We performed linkage and association analyses by transmission/disequilibrium test and <START:organism> case <END> - <START:organism> control <END> analysis in the <START:ggp> candidate region <END> <START:ggp> 12q13-24 <END> , using the <START:organism> Sardinian founder population <END> , in which limited heterogeneity of <START:ggp> pathogenetic alleles <END> for <START:disease> monogenic and complex disorders <END> as well as of environmental conditions should facilitate the study of <START:bf> multifactorial traits <END> .
We analyzed our <START:organism> cohort <END> , using a cutoff age of 13 years at <START:disease> asthma <END> onset, and detected significant linkage to a <START:ggp> portion <END> of <START:ggp> 12q13-24 <END> .
We identified <START:ggp> IRAK-M <END> as the <START:ggp> gene <END> contributing to the linkage and showed that it is associated with <START:disease> early-onset persistent asthma <END> .
We defined <START:ggp> protective and predisposing SNP haplotypes <END> and replicated associations in an <START:organism> outbred Italian population <END> .
Sequence analysis in <START:organism> patients <END> found mutations, including <START:bf> inactivating lesions <END> , in the <START:ggp> IRAK-M coding region <END> .
Immunohistochemistry of <START:anatomy> lung <END> biopsies showed that <START:ggp> IRAK-M <END> is highly expressed in <START:anatomy> epithelial cells <END> .
We report that <START:ggp> IRAK-M <END> is involved in the <START:bf> pathogenesis of early-onset persistent asthma <END> .
<START:ggp> IRAK-M <END> , a negative regulator of the <START:bf> Toll-like receptor/IL-1R pathways <END> , is a master regulator of <START:ggp> NF-?B <END> and <START:bf> inflammation <END> .
Our data suggest a mechanistic link between <START:bf> hyperactivation <END> of the <START:anatomy> innate immune system <END> and <START:bf> chronic airway inflammation <END> and indicate <START:ggp> IRAK-M <END> as a potential target for therapeutic intervention against <START:disease> asthma <END> .
<START:ggp> CEACAM6 <END> acts as a receptor for <START:organism> adherent-invasive E. coli <END> , supporting <START:bf> ileal mucosa colonization <END> in <START:disease> Crohn disease <END> 
The <START:anatomy> ileal mucosa <END> of <START:organism> Crohn disease ( CD ) patients <END> is abnormally colonized by <START:organism> adherent-invasive E. coli <END> ( <START:organism> AIEC <END> ) that are able to adhere to and invade <START:anatomy> intestinal epithelial cells <END> .
Here, we show that <START:organism> CD-associated AIEC strains <END> adhere to the brush border of <START:anatomy> primary ileal enterocytes <END> isolated from <START:organism> CD patients <END> but not <START:organism> controls <END> without <START:disease> inflammatory bowel disease <END> .
<START:bf> AIEC adhesion <END> is dependent on <START:bf> type 1 pili expression <END> on the bacterial surface and on <START:bf> carcinoembryonic antigen?related cell adhesion molecule 6 ( CEACAM6 ) expression <END> on the apical surface of <START:anatomy> ileal epithelial cells <END> .
We report also that <START:ggp> CEACAM6 <END> acts as a receptor for <START:bf> AIEC adhesion <END> and is abnormally expressed by <START:anatomy> ileal epithelial cells <END> in <START:organism> CD patients <END> .
In addition, our in vitro studies show that there is <START:bf> increased CEACAM6 expression <END> in cultured <START:anatomy> intestinal epithelial cells <END> after <START:ggp> IFN-? <END> or <START:ggp> TNF-? <END> stimulation and after <START:disease> infection <END> with <START:organism> AIEC bacteria <END> , indicating that <START:organism> AIEC <END> can promote its own <START:bf> colonization <END> in <START:organism> CD patients <END> .
Genetic linkage of <START:disease> familial granulomatous inflammatory arthritis <END> , <START:bf> skin rash <END> , and <START:disease> uveitis <END> to <START:ggp> chromosome 16 <END> .
<START:disease> Blau syndrome <END> ( MIM 186580 ), first described in a large, <START:organism> three-generation kindred <END> , is an <START:disease> autosomal, dominantly inherited disease <END> characterized by <START:bf> multiorgan, tissue-specific inflammation <END> .
Its clinical phenotype includes <START:disease> granulomatous arthritis <END> , <START:bf> skin rash <END> , and <START:disease> uveitis <END> and probably represents a subtype of a group of clinical entities referred to as " <START:disease> familial granulomatosis <END> .
" It is the sole <START:organism> human model <END> with recognizably <START:bf> Mendelian inheritance <END> for a variety of <START:disease> multisystem inflammatory diseases <END> affecting a significant percentage of the <START:organism> population <END> .
A genomewide search for the <START:ggp> Blau susceptibility locus <END> was undertaken after karyotypic analysis revealed no <START:bf> abnormalities <END> .
Sixty-two of the 74-member <START:organism> pedigree <END> were genotyped with <START:ggp> dinucleotide-repeat markers <END> .
Linkage analysis was performed under a dominant model of <START:bf> inheritance with reduced penetrance <END> .
The <START:ggp> marker <END> <START:ggp> D16S298 <END> gave a maximum LOD score of 3.75 at theta = .04, with two-point analysis.
LOD scores for <START:ggp> flanking markers <END> were consistent and placed the <START:ggp> Blau susceptibility locus <END> within the <START:ggp> 16p12-q21 interval <END> .
<START:ggp> HLA <END> -linked <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
Twenty-eight <START:organism> pedigrees <END> were ascertained through <START:organism> pairs <END> of <START:organism> first-degree relatives <END> diagnosed with <START:disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:disease> RA <END> ).
<START:disease> RA <END> was confirmed in 77 <START:organism> pedigree members <END> including <START:organism> probands <END> ; the absence of disease was verified in an additional 261 <START:organism> pedigree members <END> .
<START:organism> Pedigree members <END> were serologically typed for <START:ggp> HLA <END> .
We used likelihood analysis to statistically characterize the <START:ggp> HLA-linked RA susceptibility locus <END> .
The genetic model assumed tight linkage to <START:ggp> HLA <END> .
The analysis supported the existence of an <START:ggp> HLA-linked RA susceptibility locus <END> , estimated the <START:ggp> susceptibility allele <END> frequency as 2.16%, and estimated the lifetime penetrance as 41% in <START:organism> male homozygotes <END> and as 48% in <START:organism> female homozygotes <END> .
<START:bf> Inheritance <END> was recessive in <START:organism> males <END> and was nearly recessive in <START:organism> females <END> .
In addition, the analysis attributed 78% of the variance within <START:ggp> genotypes <END> to genetic or environmental effects shared by <START:organism> siblings <END> .
The genetic model inferred in this analysis is consistent with previous association, linkage, and familial aggregation studies of <START:disease> RA <END> .
The inferred <START:ggp> HLA-linked RA susceptibility locus <END> accounts for approximately one-half of <START:disease> familial RA <END> , although it accounts for only approximately one-fifth of the <START:disease> RA <END> in the <START:organism> population <END> .
Although other <START:ggp> genes <END> may account for the remaining <START:disease> familial RA <END> , a large portion of <START:organism> RA cases <END> may occur sporadically.
<START:ggp> Variants <END> in a Novel <START:ggp> Epidermal Collagen Gene <END> ( <START:ggp> COL29A1 <END> ) Are Associated with <START:disease> Atopic Dermatitis <END> 
<START:disease> Atopic dermatitis <END> ( <START:disease> AD <END> ) is a <START:disease> common chronic inflammatory skin disorder <END> and a major manifestation of <START:disease> allergic disease <END> .
<START:disease> AD <END> typically presents in early childhood often preceding the onset of an <START:disease> allergic airway disease <END> , such as <START:disease> asthma <END> or <START:disease> hay fever <END> .
We previously mapped a <START:ggp> susceptibility locus <END> for <START:disease> AD <END> on <START:ggp> Chromosome 3q21 <END> .
To identify the <START:organism> underlying disease gene <END> , we used a dense map of <START:ggp> microsatellite markers <END> and single <START:ggp> nucleotide <END> polymorphisms, and we detected association with <START:disease> AD <END> .
In concordance with the linkage results, we found a <START:bf> maternal transmission <END> pattern.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that the same <START:organism> families <END> contribute to linkage and association.
We replicated the association and the maternal effect in a large <START:organism> independent family cohort <END> .
A <START:ggp> common haplotype <END> showed strong association with <START:disease> AD <END> ( p = 0.000059 ).
The <START:ggp> associated region <END> contained a single <START:ggp> gene <END> , <START:ggp> COL29A1 <END> , which encodes a novel <START:ggp> epidermal collagen <END> .
<START:ggp> COL29A1 <END> shows a specific <START:bf> gene expression <END> pattern with the highest transcript levels in <START:anatomy> skin <END> , <START:anatomy> lung <END> , and the <START:anatomy> gastrointestinal tract <END> , which are the major sites of <START:disease> allergic disease <END> manifestation.
<START:bf> Lack of COL29A1 expression <END> in the <START:anatomy> outer epidermis <END> of <START:organism> AD patients <END> points to a role of <START:ggp> collagen XXIX <END> in epidermal integrity and function, the breakdown of which is a clinical hallmark of <START:disease> AD <END> .
Escape from <START:bf> tolerance <END> in the <START:disease> human X-linked autoimmunity?allergic disregulation syndrome <END> and the <START:organism> Scurfy mouse <END> 
<START:disease> XLAAD <END> is an <START:disease> X-linked disease <END> that presents early in life with a syndrome of <START:bf> autoimmunity <END> , <START:disease> allergy <END> , and <START:bf> failure to thrive <END> .
It was first described as an <START:disease> X-linked immunodeficiency syndrome <END> associated with <START:disease> polyendocrinopathy <END> ( <START:disease> type 1 diabetes mellitus <END> and <START:disease> autoimmune thyroiditis <END> ), <START:disease> hemolytic anemia <END> , <START:bf> chronic diarrhea <END> ( autoimmune ), and <START:bf> eczema <END> ( 3 , 4 ).
While the <START:bf> autoimmune manifestations <END> are prominent, <START:organism> children <END> with <START:disease> XLAAD <END> also suffer from <START:bf> allergic manifestations <END> with <START:bf> severe eczema <END> , <START:bf> elevated IgE levels <END> , <START:disease> eosinophilia <END> , and <START:disease> food allergy <END> ( 3 ).
As <START:organism> Chatila <END> et al.
( 1 ) show, activated <START:anatomy> PBMCs <END> from <START:organism> affected individuals <END> are skewed toward the <START:bf> Th2 phenotype <END> , expressing <START:bf> high levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 <END> , but <START:bf> low levels of IFN-? <END> .
Indeed, even the resting <START:anatomy> cells <END> from <START:organism> affected individuals <END> are activated compared to those from <START:organism> normal individuals <END> , as measured by their <START:bf> expression of Th2 cytokines <END> .
Genetic pleiotropy between <START:disease> asthma <END> and <START:bf> obesity <END> in a <START:organism> community-based sample <END> of <START:organism> twins <END> 
Background <START:disease> Asthma <END> and <START:bf> obesity <END> are common conditions that are strongly associated.
This association might be due to shared genetic or environmental causes.
Objective We sought to determine whether a <START:ggp> shared genetic cause <END> is responsible for the association between <START:disease> asthma <END> and <START:bf> obesity <END> and to estimate the magnitude of <START:ggp> shared genetic cause <END> .
Methods The analyses were performed with 1001 <START:organism> monozygotic and 383 dizygotic same-sex twin pairs <END> within the University of Washington <START:organism> Twin <END> Registry.
The presence of <START:disease> asthma <END> was determined by self-report of a <START:organism> physician <END> diagnosis of <START:disease> asthma <END> , and body mass index ( BMI ) was calculated by using self-reported <START:bf> height <END> and <START:organism> weight <END> .
<START:bf> Obesity <END> was defined as a BMI of 30 or greater.
The association between <START:disease> asthma <END> and BMI was assessed by means of mixed-effects ordinal regression.
<START:organism> Twin <END> correlations examined the association of <START:disease> asthma <END> and <START:bf> obesity <END> .
Univariate and bivariate structural equation models estimated the components of variance attributable to genetic and environmental effects.
Results A strong association between <START:disease> asthma <END> and BMI was identified in the <START:organism> sample population <END> ( P < .001 ).
Substantial heritability was detected for <START:disease> asthma <END> ( 53% ) and <START:bf> obesity <END> ( 77% ), which is indicative of additive genetic influences on each disorder.
The best-fitting model of shared components of variance indicated that 8% of the <START:ggp> genetic component <END> of <START:bf> obesity <END> is shared with <START:disease> asthma <END> .
Conclusion The covariation between <START:bf> obesity <END> and <START:disease> asthma <END> is predominantly caused by <START:ggp> shared genetic risk factors <END> for both conditions.
The <START:ggp> cation efflux transporter <END> <START:ggp> ZnT8 <END> ( <START:ggp> Slc30A8 <END> ) is a <START:ggp> major autoantigen <END> in <START:disease> human type 1 diabetes <END> 
<START:disease> Type 1 diabetes <END> ( <START:disease> T1D <END> ) results from <START:bf> progressive loss of pancreatic islet mass <END> through <START:bf> autoimmunity <END> targeted at a diverse, yet limited, series of <START:ggp> molecules <END> that are expressed in the <START:anatomy> pancreatic ? cell <END> .
Identification of these <START:ggp> molecular targets <END> provides insight into the <START:bf> pathogenic process <END> , diagnostic assays, and potential therapeutic agents.
<START:ggp> Autoantigen candidates <END> were identified from microarray <START:bf> expression <END> profiling of <START:anatomy> human and rodent pancreas and islet cells <END> and screened with radioimmunoprecipitation assays using <START:anatomy> new-onset T1D and prediabetic sera <END> .
A high-ranking <START:ggp> candidate <END> , the <START:ggp> zinc transporter <END> <START:ggp> ZnT8 <END> ( <START:ggp> Slc30A8 <END> ), was targeted by <START:ggp> autoantibodies <END> in 60?80% of new-onset <START:disease> T1D <END> compared with <2% of <START:organism> controls <END> and <3% <START:organism> type 2 diabetic <END> and in up to 30% of <START:organism> patients <END> with other <START:disease> autoimmune disorders <END> with a <START:disease> T1D <END> association.
<START:ggp> ZnT8 antibodies <END> ( <START:ggp> ZnTA <END> ) were found in 26% of <START:organism> T1D subjects <END> classified as <START:ggp> autoantibody <END> -negative on the basis of existing <START:ggp> markers <END> [ <START:ggp> glutamate decarboxylase <END> ( <START:ggp> GADA <END> ), <START:ggp> protein tyrosine phosphatase IA2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IA2A <END> ), <START:ggp> antibodies <END> to <START:ggp> insulin <END> ( <START:ggp> IAA <END> ), and <START:ggp> islet cytoplasmic autoantibodies <END> ( <START:ggp> ICA <END> )].
<START:organism> Individuals <END> followed from birth to <START:disease> T1D <END> showed <START:ggp> ZnT8A <END> as early as 2 years of age and <START:bf> increasing levels <END> and prevalence persisting to disease onset.
<START:ggp> ZnT8A <END> generally emerged later than <START:ggp> GADA <END> and <START:ggp> IAA <END> in <START:disease> prediabetes <END> , although not in a strict order.
The combined measurement of <START:ggp> ZnT8A <END> , <START:ggp> GADA <END> , <START:ggp> IA2A <END> , and <START:ggp> IAA <END> raised <START:bf> autoimmunity <END> detection rates to 98% at disease onset, a level that approaches that needed to detect <START:disease> prediabetes <END> in a <START:organism> general pediatric population <END> .
The combination of bioinformatics and molecular engineering used here will potentially generate other <START:ggp> diabetes autoimmunity markers <END> and is also broadly applicable to other <START:disease> autoimmune disorders <END> .
Protection from Experimental <START:disease> Asthma <END> by an <START:ched> Endogenous Bronchodilator <END> 
Mechanisms that protect against <START:disease> asthma <END> remain poorly understood.
<START:ched> S -nitrosoglutathione <END> ( <START:ched> GSNO <END> ), an <START:ched> endogenous bronchodilator <END> , is depleted from <START:anatomy> asthmatic airways <END> , suggesting a protective role.
We report that, following <START:ched> allergen <END> challenge, <START:organism> wild-type mice <END> exhibiting <START:disease> airway hyperresponsivity <END> have increased <START:bf> airway levels of the enzyme GSNO reductase <END> ( <START:ggp> GSNOR <END> ) and are depleted of <START:bf> lung S -nitrosothiols <END> ( <START:ched> SNOs <END> ).
In contrast, <START:organism> mice <END> with genetic deletion of <START:ggp> GSNOR <END> exhibit increases in <START:bf> lung SNOs <END> and are protected from <START:disease> airway hyperresponsivity <END> .
Our results indicate that <START:ched> endogenous SNOs <END> , governed by <START:ggp> GSNOR <END> , are critical regulators of <START:bf> airway responsivity <END> and may provide new therapeutic approaches to <START:disease> asthma <END> .
Clustering of <START:ggp> non-major histocompatibility complex susceptibility candidate loci <END> in <START:disease> human autoimmune diseases <END> 
<START:disease> Human autoimmune diseases <END> are thought to develop through a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors.
Genome-wide linkage searches of <START:disease> autoimmune and inflammatory/immune disorders <END> have identified a large number of <START:ggp> non-major histocompatibility complex loci <END> that collectively contribute to <START:bf> disease susceptibility <END> .
A comparison was made of the linkage results from 23 published <START:disease> autoimmune or immune-mediated disease <END> genome-wide scans.
<START:disease> Human diseases <END> included <START:disease> multiple sclerosis <END> , <START:disease> Crohn?s disease <END> , <START:disease> familial psoriasis <END> , <START:disease> asthma <END> , and <START:disease> type-I diabetes <END> ( <START:disease> IDDM <END> ).
<START:disease> Experimental animal disease <END> studies included <START:disease> murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis <END> , <START:disease> rat inflammatory arthritis <END> , <START:disease> rat and murine IDDM <END> , <START:ched> histamine <END> sensitization, <START:bf> immunity to exogenous antigens <END> , and <START:disease> murine lupus <END> ( <START:disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ; <START:disease> SLE <END> ).
A majority ( ?65% ) of the <START:organism> human <END> positive linkages map nonrandomly into 18 distinct clusters.
Overlapping of <START:ggp> susceptibility loci <END> occurs between different <START:disease> human immune diseases <END> and by comparing <START:ggp> conserved regions <END> with <START:organism> experimental autoimmune/immune disease models <END> .
This nonrandom clustering supports a hypothesis that, in some cases, clinically distinct <START:disease> autoimmune diseases <END> may be controlled by a <START:ggp> common set <END> of <START:ggp> susceptibility genes <END> .
The <START:ggp> HLA-DQ2 gene <END> dose effect in <START:disease> celiac disease <END> is directly related to the magnitude and breadth of <START:bf> gluten-specific T cell responses <END> 
In <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> celiac disease <END> , <START:bf> inflammatory T cell responses <END> to <START:ggp> HLA-DQ2-bound gluten peptides <END> are thought to cause disease.
Two types of <START:ggp> HLA-DQ2 molecules <END> exist, termed <START:ggp> HLA-DQ2.5 <END> and <START:ggp> HLA-DQ2.2 <END> .
Whereas <START:ggp> HLA-DQ2.5 <END> predisposes to <START:disease> celiac disease <END> , <START:ggp> HLA-DQ2.2 <END> does not.
We now provide evidence that the disease-associated <START:ggp> HLA-DQ2.5 molecule <END> presents a <START:ggp> large repertoire <END> of <START:ggp> gluten peptides <END> , whereas the non-disease-associated <START:ggp> HLA-DQ2.2 molecule <END> can present only a <START:ggp> subset <END> of these.
Moreover, <START:bf> gluten presentation <END> by <START:anatomy> HLA-DQ2 homozygous antigen-presenting cells <END> was superior to presentation by <START:anatomy> HLA-DQ2/non-DQ2 heterozygous antigen-presenting cells <END> in terms of <START:bf> T cell proliferation <END> and <START:bf> cytokine secretion <END> .
<START:bf> Gluten presentation <END> by <START:anatomy> HLA-DQ2.5/2.2 heterozygous antigen-presenting cells <END> induced <START:bf> intermediate T cell stimulation <END> .
These results correlated with <START:ggp> peptide <END> binding to the <START:anatomy> antigen-presenting cells <END> .
Finally, we demonstrate that <START:ggp> HLA-DQ trans dimers <END> formed in <START:organism> HLA-DQ2.5/2.2 heterozygous individuals <END> have properties identical with <START:ggp> HLA-DQ2.5 dimers <END> .
Our findings explain the strongly increased risk of disease development for <START:organism> HLA-DQ2.5 homozygous and HLA-DQ2.2/2.5 heterozygous individuals <END> , and they are indicative of a quantitative model for disease development, where <START:bf> HLA-DQ expression <END> and the available number of <START:ggp> T cell-stimulatory gluten peptides <END> are critical limiting factors.
This model may have important implications for disease prevention.
<START:ggp> Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I?Recognizing Receptors <END> Are <START:ggp> Disease Risk Genes <END> in <START:disease> Rheumatoid Arthritis <END> 
<START:disease> Rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:disease> RA <END> ) is a <START:disease> heterogeneous syndrome <END> of which a <START:organism> subset <END> of <START:organism> patients <END> develops <START:bf> vascular inflammation <END> .
The genetic determinants that confer risk for <START:disease> rheumatoid vasculitis <END> are not known, but <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:bf> vascular complications <END> are known to have an <START:bf> expansion of CD4 + CD28 null T cells <END> , a cell population potentially involved in <START:bf> endothelial damage <END> .
<START:anatomy> CD4 + CD28 null T cell clones <END> isolated from <START:organism> RA patients <END> with <START:disease> vasculitis <END> were found to express <START:ggp> killer cell immunoglobulin?like receptors <END> ( <START:ggp> KIRs <END> ) with the stimulatory <START:ggp> KIR2DS2 <END> often present in the absence of opposing <START:ggp> inhibitory receptors <END> with related specificities.
To test the hypothesis that the <START:ggp> KIR2DS2 gene <END> is involved in the development of <START:disease> vasculitis <END> , association studies were performed.
The <START:ggp> KIR2DS2 gene <END> was significantly enriched among <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> rheumatoid vasculitis <END> compared with <START:organism> normal individuals <END> ( odds ratio 5.56, P = 0.001 ) and <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> RA <END> but no <START:disease> vasculitis <END> ( odds ratio 7.96, P = 0.001 ).
Also, the distribution of <START:ggp> human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen ( HLA )-C <END> , the putative <START:ggp> ligand <END> for <START:ggp> KIRs <END> , was significantly different in <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> rheumatoid vasculitis <END> in comparison with the <START:organism> control populations <END> .
These data suggest that <START:ggp> HLA class I?recognizing receptors <END> and <START:ggp> HLA class I genes <END> are genetic risk determinants that modulate the pattern of <START:bf> RA expression <END> .
Specifically, <START:ggp> KIR2DS2 <END> in conjunction with the appropriate <START:ggp> HLA-C ligand <END> may have a role in <START:bf> vascular damage <END> by regulating <START:anatomy> CD4 + CD28 null T cells <END> .
<START:ggp> Epidermal Transglutaminase <END> ( <START:ggp> TGase 3 <END> ) Is the <START:ggp> Autoantigen <END> of <START:disease> Dermatitis Herpetiformis <END> 
<START:bf> Gluten sensitivity <END> typically presents as <START:disease> celiac disease <END> , a <START:disease> common chronic small intestinal disorder <END> .
However, in certain <START:organism> individuals <END> it is associated with <START:disease> dermatitis herpetiformis <END> , a <START:disease> blistering skin disease <END> characterized by <START:bf> granular IgA deposits <END> in the <START:anatomy> papillary dermis <END> .
While <START:ggp> tissue transglutaminase <END> has been implicated as the major <START:ggp> autoantigen <END> of <START:disease> gluten sensitive disease <END> , there has been no explanation as to why this condition appears in two distinct forms.
Here we show that while <START:anatomy> sera <END> from <START:organism> patients <END> with either form of <START:disease> gluten sensitive disease <END> react both with <START:ggp> tissue transglutaminase <END> and the <START:ggp> related enzyme <END> <START:ggp> epidermal ( type 3 ) transglutaminase <END> , <START:ggp> antibodies <END> in <START:organism> patients <END> having <START:disease> dermatitis herpetiformis <END> show a markedly higher avidity for <START:ggp> epidermal transglutaminase <END> .
Further, these <START:organism> patients <END> have an <START:ggp> antibody population <END> specific for this <START:ggp> enzyme <END> .
We also show that the <START:ggp> IgA <END> precipitates in the <START:anatomy> papillary dermis <END> of <START:organism> patients <END> with <START:disease> dermatitis herpetiformis <END> , the defining signs of the disease, contain <START:ggp> epidermal transglutaminase <END> , but not <START:ggp> tissue transglutaminase <END> or <START:ggp> keratinocyte transglutaminase <END> .
These findings demonstrate that <START:ggp> epidermal transglutaminase <END> , rather than <START:ggp> tissue transglutaminase <END> , is the dominant <START:ggp> autoantigen <END> in <START:disease> dermatitis herpetiformis <END> and explain why <START:bf> skin symptoms <END> appear in a proportion of <START:organism> patients <END> having <START:disease> gluten sensitive disease <END> .
The <START:bf> Intestinal T Cell Response <END> to <START:ggp> ?-Gliadin <END> in <START:disease> Adult Celiac Disease <END> Is Focused on a Single Deamidated <START:ggp> Glutamine <END> Targeted by <START:ggp> Tissue Transglutaminase <END> 
The <START:organism> great majority <END> of <START:organism> patients <END> that are <START:bf> intolerant of wheat gluten protein <END> due to <START:disease> celiac disease <END> ( <START:disease> CD <END> ) are <START:bf> human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen ( HLA )-DQ2 + <END> , and the remaining few normally express <START:ggp> HLA-DQ8 <END> .
These two <START:ggp> class II molecules <END> are chiefly responsible for the presentation of <START:ggp> gluten peptides <END> to the <START:ggp> gluten <END> -specific <START:anatomy> T cells <END> that are found only in the <START:anatomy> gut <END> of <START:organism> CD patients <END> but not of <START:organism> controls <END> .
Interestingly, <START:bf> tissue transglutaminase ( tTG )-mediated deamidation <END> of <START:ggp> gliadin <END> plays an important role in <START:bf> recognition of this food antigen <END> by <START:anatomy> intestinal T cells <END> .
Here we have used <START:ggp> recombinant antigens <END> to demonstrate that the <START:bf> intestinal T cell response to ?-gliadin <END> in <START:disease> adult CD <END> is focused on two <START:ggp> immunodominant, DQ2-restricted peptides <END> that overlap by a <START:ggp> seven-residue fragment <END> of <START:ggp> gliadin <END> .
We show that <START:ggp> tTG <END> converts a <START:ggp> glutamine residue <END> within this <START:ggp> fragment <END> into <START:ched> glutamic acid <END> and that this process is critical for <START:bf> T cell recognition <END> .
<START:ggp> Gluten <END> -specific <START:anatomy> T cell lines <END> from 16 different <START:organism> adult patients <END> all responded to one or both of these deamidated <START:ggp> peptides <END> , indicating that these <START:ggp> epitopes <END> are highly relevant to <START:bf> disease pathology <END> .
Binding studies showed that the deamidated <START:ggp> peptides <END> displayed an increased affinity for <START:ggp> DQ2 <END> , a <START:ggp> molecule <END> known to preferentially bind <START:ggp> peptides <END> containing negatively charged <START:ggp> residues <END> .
Interestingly, the modified <START:ggp> glutamine <END> is accommodated in different <START:ggp> pockets <END> of <START:ggp> DQ2 <END> for the different <START:ggp> epitopes <END> .
These results suggest <START:bf> modifications of anchor residues <END> that lead to an improved affinity for <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex <END> ( <START:ggp> MHC <END> ), and altered conformation of the <START:ggp> peptide?MHC complex <END> may be a critical factor leading to <START:bf> T cell responses to gliadin <END> and the <START:bf> oral intolerance of gluten <END> found in <START:disease> CD <END> .
<START:ggp> Common Variants <END> within <START:ggp> MECP2 <END> Confer Risk of <START:disease> Systemic Lupus Erythematosus <END> 
<START:disease> Systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ) is a <START:disease> predominantly female autoimmune disease <END> that affects <START:anatomy> multiple organ systems <END> .
Herein, we report on an <START:ggp> X-chromosome gene <END> association with <START:disease> SLE <END> .
<START:ggp> Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> MECP2 <END> ) is located on <START:ggp> chromosome Xq28 <END> and encodes for a <START:ggp> protein <END> that plays a critical role in <START:bf> epigenetic transcriptional regulation <END> of <START:ggp> methylation-sensitive genes <END> .
Utilizing a <START:ggp> candidate gene <END> association approach, we genotyped 21 SNPs within and around <START:ggp> MECP2 <END> in <START:organism> SLE patients <END> and <START:organism> controls <END> .
We identify and replicate association between <START:disease> SLE <END> and the <START:ggp> genomic element <END> containing <START:ggp> MECP2 <END> in two <START:organism> independent SLE cohorts <END> from two <START:organism> ethnically divergent populations <END> .
These findings are potentially related to the <START:bf> overexpression of methylation-sensitive genes <END> in <START:disease> SLE <END> .
Loss of <START:organism> Bardet?Biedl syndrome proteins <END> alters the morphology and function of motile cilia in <START:anatomy> airway epithelia <END> 
Mutations in a <START:ggp> group <END> of <START:ggp> genes <END> that contribute to ciliary function cause <START:disease> Bardet?Biedl syndrome <END> ( <START:disease> BBS <END> ).
Most studies of <START:disease> BBS <END> have focused on primary, sensory cilia.
Here, we asked whether loss of <START:ggp> BBS proteins <END> would also affect motile cilia lining the <START:anatomy> respiratory tract <END> .
We found that <START:ggp> BBS genes <END> were expressed in <START:anatomy> human airway epithelia <END> , and <START:ggp> BBS2 <END> and <START:ggp> BBS4 <END> localized to cellular structures associated with motile cilia.
Although <START:ggp> BBS proteins <END> were not required for <START:bf> ciliogenesis <END> , their loss caused <START:bf> structural defects <END> in a fraction of cilia covering <START:anatomy> mouse airway epithelia <END> .
The most common abnormality was <START:bf> bulges filled with vesicles <END> near the tips of cilia.
We discovered this same misshapen appearance in <START:ggp> airway <END> cilia from <START:organism> Bbs1 , Bbs2 , Bbs4 , and Bbs6 mutant mice <END> .
The <START:bf> structural abnormalities <END> were accompanied by <START:bf> functional defects <END> ; ciliary beat frequency was reduced in <START:organism> Bbs mutant mice <END> .
Previous reports suggested <START:disease> BBS <END> might increase the incidence of <START:disease> asthma <END> .
However, compared with <START:organism> wild-type controls <END> , neither <START:bf> airway hyperresponsiveness nor inflammation <END> increased in <START:organism> Bbs 2 ?/? or Bbs 4 ?/? mice <END> immunized with <START:ggp> ovalbumin <END> .
Instead, these <START:organism> animals <END> were partially protected from <START:bf> airway hyperresponsiveness <END> .
These results emphasize the role of <START:ggp> BBS proteins <END> in both the structure and function of motile cilia.
They also invite additional scrutiny of <START:bf> motile cilia dysfunction <END> in <START:organism> patients <END> with this disease.
A Genome-Wide Association Study of <START:disease> Psoriasis <END> and <START:disease> Psoriatic Arthritis <END> Identifies New <START:ggp> Disease Loci <END> 
A genome-wide association study was performed to identify <START:ggp> genetic factors <END> involved in <START:bf> susceptibility to psoriasis ( PS ) and psoriatic arthritis ( PSA ), inflammatory diseases of the skin and joints <END> in <START:organism> humans <END> .
223 <START:organism> PS cases <END> ( including 91 with <START:disease> PSA <END> ) were genotyped with 311,398 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ), and results were compared with those from 519 <START:organism> Northern European controls <END> .
Replications were performed with an <START:organism> independent cohort <END> of 577 <START:organism> PS cases <END> and 737 <START:organism> controls <END> from the U.S., and 576 <START:organism> PSA patients <END> and 480 <START:organism> controls <END> from the U.K..
Strongest associations were with the <START:ggp> class I region <END> of the <START:ggp> major histocompatibility complex <END> ( <START:ggp> MHC <END> ).
The most highly associated SNP was rs10484554, which lies 34.7 kb upstream from <START:ggp> HLA-C <END> ( P = 7.8×10 ?11 , GWA scan; P = 1.8×10 ?30 , replication; P = 1.8×10 ?39 , combined; U.K.
PSA: P = 6.9×10 ?11 ).
However, rs2395029 encoding the G2V polymorphism within the <START:ggp> class I gene HCP5 <END> ( combined P = 2.13×10 ?26 in U.S. cases ) yielded the highest ORs with both <START:disease> PS <END> and <START:disease> PSA <END> ( 4.1 and 3.2 respectively ).
This <START:ggp> variant <END> is associated with low viral set point following <START:disease> HIV infection <END> and its effect is independent of rs10484554.
We replicated the previously reported association with <START:ggp> interleukin 23 receptor <END> and <START:ggp> interleukin 12B <END> ( <START:ggp> IL12B <END> ) polymorphisms in <START:organism> PS and PSA cohorts <END> ( <START:ggp> IL23R <END> : rs11209026, U.S.
<START:disease> PS <END> , P = 1.4×10 ?4 ; U.K.
<START:disease> PSA <END> : P = 8.0×10 ?4 ; <START:ggp> IL12B <END> :rs6887695, U.S.
<START:disease> PS <END> , P = 5×10 ?5 and U.K.
<START:disease> PSA <END> , P = 1.3×10 ?3 ) and detected an independent association in the <START:ggp> IL23R region <END> with a SNP 4 kb upstream from <START:ggp> IL12RB2 <END> ( P = 0.001 ).
Novel associations replicated in the U.S.
<START:organism> PS cohort <END> included the <START:ggp> region <END> harboring <START:ggp> lipoma HMGIC fusion partner <END> ( <START:ggp> LHFP <END> ) and <START:ggp> conserved oligomeric golgi complex component 6 ( COG6 ) genes <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 13q13 <END> ( combined P = 2×10 ?6 for rs7993214; OR = 0.71 ), the <START:ggp> late cornified envelope gene cluster <END> ( <START:ggp> LCE <END> ) from the <START:ggp> Epidermal Differentiation Complex <END> ( <START:ggp> PSORS4 <END> ) ( combined P = 6.2×10 ?5 for rs6701216; OR 1.45 ) and a <START:ggp> region <END> of LD at <START:ggp> 15q21 <END> ( combined P = 2.9×10 ?5 for rs3803369; OR = 1.43 ).
This <START:ggp> region <END> is of interest because it harbors <START:ggp> ubiquitin-specific protease-8 <END> whose processed <START:ggp> pseudogene <END> lies upstream from <START:ggp> HLA-C <END> .
This <START:ggp> region <END> of <START:ggp> 15q21 <END> also harbors the <START:ggp> gene <END> for <START:ggp> SPPL2A <END> ( <START:ggp> signal peptide peptidase like 2a <END> ) which activates <START:ggp> tumor necrosis factor alpha <END> by cleavage, triggering the <START:bf> expression of IL12 <END> in <START:anatomy> human dendritic cells <END> .
We also identified a novel <START:ggp> PSA ( and potentially PS ) locus <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 4q27 <END> .
This <START:ggp> region <END> harbors the <START:ggp> interleukin 2 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL2 <END> ) and <START:ggp> interleukin 21 ( IL21 ) genes <END> and was recently shown to be associated with four <START:disease> autoimmune diseases <END> ( <START:disease> Celiac disease <END> , <START:disease> Type 1 diabetes <END> , <START:disease> Grave's disease <END> and <START:disease> Rheumatoid Arthritis <END> ).
A genome-wide association study for <START:disease> celiac disease <END> identifies <START:ggp> risk variants <END> in the <START:ggp> region <END> harboring <START:ggp> IL2 <END> and <START:ggp> IL21 <END> 
We tested 310,605 single-nucleotide polymorphisms for association in 778 <START:organism> celiac disease cases <END> and 1422 <START:organism> controls <END> .
Outside the <START:ggp> HLA <END> , the most significant finding ( rs13119723, P=2.0 × 10 ?7 , empirical genome-wide significance P=0.045 ) was in the <START:ggp> KIAA1109 <END> / <START:ggp> Tenr <END> / <START:ggp> IL2 <END> / <START:ggp> IL21 <END> linkage disequilibrium block.
Association was independently confirmed in two <START:organism> further collections <END> ( strongest at rs6822844, <START:ggp> 24kB 5' <END> of <START:ggp> IL21 <END> , meta-analysis P=1.3 × 10 ?14 , OR 0.63 ), suggesting genetic variation in this <START:ggp> region <END> predisposes to <START:disease> celiac disease <END> .
Novel Association in <START:ggp> Chromosome 4q27 Region <END> with <START:disease> Rheumatoid Arthritis <END> and Confirmation of <START:disease> Type 1 Diabetes <END> Point to a <START:ggp> General Risk Locus <END> for <START:disease> Autoimmune Diseases <END> 
Recently, association of <START:disease> celiac disease <END> with <START:ggp> common single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) variants <END> in an extensive linkage-disequilibrium block of <START:ggp> 480 kb <END> containing the <START:ggp> KIAA1109 <END> , <START:ggp> Tenr <END> , <START:ggp> IL2 <END> , and <START:ggp> IL21 genes <END> has been demonstrated in three <START:organism> independent populations <END> ( rs6822844 P combined =1.3×10 -14 ).
The <START:ggp> KIAA1109/Tenr/IL2/IL21 <END> block corresponds to the <START:ggp> Idd3 locus <END> in the <START:organism> nonobese diabetic mouse model <END> of <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> ( <START:disease> T1D <END> ).
This block was recently found to be associated with <START:disease> T1D <END> in a genomewide association study, although this finding lacks unequivocal confirmation.
We therefore aimed to investigate whether the <START:ggp> KIAA1109/Tenr/IL2/IL21 region <END> is involved in <START:bf> susceptibility to multiple autoimmune diseases <END> .
We tested SNP rs6822844 for association with disease in 350 <START:organism> T1D-affected <END> and 1,047 <START:organism> rheumatoid arthritis ( RA )?affected Dutch patients <END> and in 929 <START:organism> controls <END> .
We replicated the association with <START:disease> T1D <END> ( P =.0006 ; OR 0.64 [95% CI 0.50?0.83] ), and revealed a similar novel association with <START:disease> RA <END> ( P =.0002 ; OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.61?0.86] ).
Our results replicate and extend the association found in the <START:ggp> KIAA1109/Tenr/IL2/IL21 gene region <END> with <START:disease> autoimmune diseases <END> , implying that this <START:ggp> locus <END> is a general risk factor for multiple <START:disease> autoimmune diseases <END> .
<START:ggp> Interleukin 9 <END> : A <START:ggp> candidate gene <END> for <START:disease> asthma <END> 
<START:disease> Asthma <END> is a <START:disease> complex heritable inflammatory disorder <END> of the <START:anatomy> airways <END> associated with clinical signs of <START:disease> atopy <END> and <START:disease> bronchial hyperresponsiveness <END> .
Recent studies localized a major <START:ggp> gene <END> for <START:disease> asthma <END> to <START:ggp> chromosome 5q31-q33 <END> in <START:organism> humans <END> .
Thus, this <START:ggp> segment <END> of the genome represents a <START:ggp> candidate region <END> for <START:ggp> genes <END> that determine <START:bf> susceptibility to bronchial hyperresponsiveness and atopy <END> in <START:organism> animal models <END> .
<START:ggp> Homologs <END> of <START:ggp> candidate genes <END> on <START:ggp> human chromosome 5q31-q33 <END> are found in four <START:ggp> regions <END> in the <START:organism> mouse <END> genome, two on <START:ggp> chromosome 18 <END> , and one each on <START:ggp> chromosomes 11 and 13 <END> .
We assessed <START:disease> bronchial responsiveness <END> as a <START:bf> quantitative trait <END> in <START:organism> mice <END> and found it linked to <START:ggp> chromosome 13 <END> .
<START:ggp> Interleukin 9 <END> ( <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> ) is located in the linked <START:ggp> region <END> and was analyzed as a <START:ggp> gene candidate <END> .
The <START:bf> expression of IL-9 <END> was markedly reduced in <START:organism> bronchial hyporesponsive mice <END> , and the level of <START:bf> expression <END> was determined by sequences within the <START:ggp> qualitative trait locus <END> ( <START:ggp> QTL <END> ).
These data suggest a role for <START:ggp> IL-9 <END> in the <START:bf> complex pathogenesis <END> of <START:disease> bronchial hyperresponsivenes <END> s as a risk factor for <START:disease> asthma <END> .
Genome scan of <START:disease> human systemic lupus erythematosus <END> : Evidence for linkage on <START:ggp> chromosome 1q <END> in <START:organism> African-American pedigrees <END> 
<START:disease> Systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ) is an <START:disease> autoimmune disorder <END> characterized by <START:bf> production of autoantibodies against intracellular antigens <END> including <START:ggp> DNA <END> , <START:ggp> ribosomal P <END> , <START:ggp> Ro <END> ( <START:ggp> SS-A <END> ), <START:ggp> La <END> ( <START:ggp> SS-B <END> ), and the <START:ggp> spliceosome <END> .
Etiology is suspected to involve genetic and environmental factors.
Evidence of genetic involvement includes: associations with <START:ggp> HLA-DR3 <END> , <START:ggp> HLA-DR2 <END> , <START:ggp> Fc? receptors ( Fc?R ) IIA and IIIA <END> , and <START:bf> hereditary complement component deficiencies <END> , as well as familial aggregation, <START:organism> monozygotic twin <END> concordance >20%, ? s > 10, purported linkage at <START:ggp> 1q41?42 <END> , and <START:organism> inbred mouse strains <END> that consistently develop <START:disease> lupus <END> .
We have completed a genome scan in 94 <START:organism> extended multiplex pedigrees <END> by using model-based linkage analysis.
Potential [log 10 of the odds for linkage ( lod ) > 2.0] <START:ggp> SLE loci <END> have been identified at <START:ggp> chromosomes 1q41 <END> , <START:ggp> 1q23 <END> , and <START:ggp> 11q14?23 <END> in <START:organism> African-Americans <END> ; <START:ggp> 14q11 <END> , <START:ggp> 4p15 <END> , <START:ggp> 11q25 <END> , <START:ggp> 2q32 <END> , <START:ggp> 19q13 <END> , <START:ggp> 6q26?27 <END> , and <START:ggp> 12p12?11 <END> in <START:organism> European-Americans <END> ; and <START:ggp> 1q23 <END> , <START:ggp> 13q32 <END> , <START:ggp> 20q13 <END> , and <START:ggp> 1q31 <END> in all <START:organism> pedigrees <END> combined.
An effect for the <START:ggp> Fc?RIIA candidate <END> polymorphism ) at <START:ggp> 1q23 <END> ( lod = 3.37 in <START:organism> African-Americans <END> ) is syntenic with linkage in a <START:organism> murine model <END> of <START:disease> lupus <END> .
<START:organism> Sib-pair <END> and multipoint nonparametric analyses also support linkage ( P < 0.05 ) at nine <START:ggp> loci <END> detected by using two-point lod score analysis ( lod > 2.0 ).
Our results are consistent with the presumed complexity of <START:bf> genetic susceptibility to SLE <END> and illustrate racial origin is likely to influence the specific nature of these genetic effects.
A genome-wide search for <START:ggp> susceptibility genes <END> in <START:organism> human systemic lupus erythematosus sib-pair families <END> 
<START:disease> Systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:disease> SLE <END> ) is an <START:disease> autoimmune multisystem inflammatory disease <END> characterized by the <START:bf> production of pathogenic autoantibodies <END> .
Previous genetic studies have suggested associations with <START:ggp> HLA Class II alleles <END> , <START:bf> complement gene deficiencies <END> , and <START:ggp> Fc receptor <END> polymorphisms; however, it is likely that other <START:ggp> genes <END> contribute to <START:bf> SLE susceptibility and pathogenesis <END> .
Here, we report the results of a genome-wide <START:ggp> microsatellite marker <END> screen in 105 <START:organism> SLE sib-pair families <END> .
By using multipoint nonparametric methods, the strongest evidence for linkage was found near the <START:ggp> HLA locus <END> ( <START:ggp> 6p11-p21 <END> ) [ <START:ggp> D6S257 <END> , logarithm of odds ( lod ) = 3.90, P = 0.000011] and at three additional <START:ggp> regions <END> : <START:ggp> 16q13 <END> ( <START:ggp> D16S415 <END> , lod = 3.64, P = 0.000022 ), <START:ggp> 14q21?23 <END> ( <START:ggp> D14S276 <END> , lod = 2.81, P = 0.00016 ), and <START:ggp> 20p12 <END> ( <START:ggp> D20S186 <END> , lod = 2.62, P = 0.00025 ).
Another nine <START:ggp> regions <END> ( <START:ggp> 1p36 <END> , <START:ggp> 1p13 <END> , <START:ggp> 1q42 <END> , <START:ggp> 2p15 <END> , <START:ggp> 2q21?33 <END> , <START:ggp> 3cent-q11 <END> , <START:ggp> 4q28 <END> , <START:ggp> 11p15 <END> , and <START:ggp> 15q26 <END> ) were identified with lod scores ?1.00.
These data support the hypothesis that multiple <START:ggp> genes <END> , including one in the <START:ggp> HLA region <END> , influence <START:bf> susceptibility to human SLE <END> .
Robust associations of four new <START:ggp> chromosome regions <END> from genome-wide analyses of <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> 
The Wellcome Trust <START:organism> Case <END> <START:organism> Control <END> Consortium ( WTCCC ) primary genome-wide association ( GWA ) scan 1 on seven diseases, including the <START:disease> multifactorial, autoimmune disease <END> , <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> ( <START:disease> T1D <END> ), shows significant association ( P < 5 × 10 ?7 between <START:disease> T1D <END> and six <START:ggp> chromosome regions <END> : <START:ggp> 12q24 <END> , <START:ggp> 12q13 <END> , <START:ggp> 16p13 <END> , <START:ggp> 18p11 <END> , <START:ggp> 12p13 <END> and <START:ggp> 4q27 <END> .
Here, we attempted to validate these and six other top findings in 4,000 <START:organism> individuals <END> with <START:disease> T1D <END> , 5,000 <START:organism> controls <END> and 2,997 <START:organism> family trios <END> that were independent of the WTCCC study.
We confirmed unequivocally the associations of <START:ggp> 12q24 <END> , <START:ggp> 12q13 <END> , <START:ggp> 16p13 <END> and <START:ggp> 18p11 <END> ( P follow-up ? 1.35 × 10 ?9 ; P overall ? 1.15 × 10 ?14 ), leaving eight <START:ggp> regions <END> with small effects or false-positive associations with <START:disease> T1D <END> .
We also obtained evidence for <START:ggp> chromosome 18q22 <END> ( P overall = 1.38 × 10 ?8 ) from a genome-wide association study of nonsynonymous SNPs.
Several <START:ggp> regions <END> , including <START:ggp> 18q22 <END> and <START:ggp> 18p11 <END> , showed association with <START:disease> autoimmune thyroid disease <END> .
This study increases the number of <START:ggp> T1D loci <END> with compelling evidence from six to at least ten.
High-Density Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Genome-Wide Linkage Scan for <START:ggp> Susceptibility Genes <END> for <START:disease> Diabetic Nephropathy <END> in <START:disease> Type 1 Diabetes <END> 
OBJECTIVE? Epidemiological and <START:organism> family <END> studies have demonstrated that <START:ggp> susceptibility genes <END> play an important role in the etiology of <START:disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> , defined as <START:bf> persistent proteinuria <END> or <START:disease> end-stage renal disease <END> ( <START:disease> ESRD <END> ) in <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS? To efficiently search for <START:ggp> genomic regions <END> harboring <START:ggp> diabetic nephropathy genes <END> , we conducted a scan using 5,382 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms on 100 <START:organism> sibpairs <END> concordant for <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> but discordant for <START:disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> .
In addition to being powerful for detecting linkage to <START:disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> , this design allows linkage analysis on <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> via traditional <START:organism> affected sibpair <END> ( <START:organism> ASP <END> ) analysis.
In weighing the evidence for linkage, we considered maximum logarithm of odds score ( maximum likelihood score [MLS] ) values and corresponding allelic sharing patterns, calculated and viewed graphically using the software package SPLAT.
RESULTS? Our primary finding for <START:disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> , broadly defined, is on <START:ggp> chromosome 19q <END> ( MLS = 3.1 ), and a secondary peak exists on <START:ggp> chromosome 2q <END> ( MLS = 2.1 ).
Stratification of <START:organism> discordant sibpairs <END> based on whether disease had progressed to <START:disease> ESRD <END> suggested four tertiary peaks on <START:ggp> chromosome 1q <END> ( <START:disease> ESRD <END> only ), <START:ggp> chromosome 20p <END> ( <START:bf> proteinuria <END> only ), and <START:ggp> chromosome 3q <END> ( two loci 58 cm apart, one for <START:disease> ESRD <END> only and another for <START:bf> proteinuria <END> only ).
Additionally, analysis of 130 <START:organism> ASPs <END> for <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> confirmed the linkage to the <START:ggp> HLA region <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 6p <END> ( MLS = 9.2 ) and <START:ggp> IDDM15 <END> on <START:ggp> chromosome 6q <END> ( MLS = 3.1 ).
CONCLUSIONS? This study identified several novel <START:ggp> loci <END> as <START:ggp> candidates <END> for <START:disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> , none of which appear to be the sole genetic determinant of <START:disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> in <START:disease> type 1 diabetes <END> .
In addition, this study confirms two previously reported <START:ggp> type 1 diabetes loci <END> .
Syndromes of <START:disease> Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus <END> 
<START:disease> Ketosis-prone diabetes <END> ( <START:disease> KPD <END> ) is a <START:disease> widespread, emerging, heterogeneous syndrome <END> characterized by <START:organism> patients <END> who present with <START:disease> diabetic ketoacidosis <END> or unprovoked <START:disease> ketosis <END> but do not necessarily have the <START:bf> typical phenotype of autoimmune type 1 diabetes <END> .
Multiple, severe forms of <START:bf> ?-cell dysfunction <END> appear to underlie the <START:bf> pathophysiology of KPD <END> .
Until recently, the syndrome has lacked an accurate, clinically relevant and etiologically useful classification scheme.
We have utilized a large, <START:organism> longitudinally followed, heterogeneous, multiethnic cohort <END> of <START:organism> KPD patients <END> to identify four <START:organism> clinically and pathophysiologically distinct subgroups <END> that are separable by the presence or absence of <START:bf> ?-cell autoimmunity <END> and the presence or absence of <START:anatomy> ?-cell <END> functional reserve.
The resulting ?A?? classification system of <START:disease> KPD <END> has proven to be highly accurate and predictive of such clinically important outcomes as glycemic control and insulin dependence, as well as an aid to biochemical and molecular investigations into novel causes of <START:bf> ?-cell dysfunction <END> .
In this review, we describe the current state of knowledge in regard to the natural history, <START:bf> pathophysiology <END> , and treatment of the subgroups of <START:disease> KPD <END> , with an emphasis on recent advances in understanding their immunological and genetic bases.
Highly significant linkage to <START:ggp> chromosome 3q13.31 <END> for <START:disease> rhinitis <END> and <START:disease> related allergic diseases <END> 
Background <START:disease> Allergic diseases <END> such as <START:disease> asthma <END> and <START:disease> rhinitis <END> have <START:bf> closely related phenotypes <END> and often occur with <START:disease> atopy <END> .
They show strong familial and intra? <START:organism> individual <END> clustering, suggesting overlapping disease aetiology.
Various <START:ggp> loci <END> and <START:ggp> candidate genes <END> have been suggested to underlie <START:disease> allergy <END> .
Many or all are still inconclusive.
Following genome?wide scans on multiple phenotypes, we previously suggested that <START:ggp> chromosome 3q13.12?q21.2 <END> harbours an <START:ggp> allergy locus <END> .
Objective To identify <START:ggp> candidate loci <END> in the <START:organism> Danish population <END> , two <START:organism> additional independent sets <END> of <START:organism> sib?pair families <END> were fine?scale mapped in <START:ggp> candidate regions <END> showing maximum likelihood scores ( MLS ) 1.5 in the genome?wide scans.
Results Twenty eight <START:ggp> microsatellite markers <END> in a denser map on <START:ggp> chromosome 3q <END> were analysed in 236 <START:organism> allergy sib?pair families <END> including 125 <START:organism> sib pairs <END> with <START:disease> rhinitis <END> .
We report significant evidence for linkage to <START:ggp> chromosome 3q13.31 <END> for <START:disease> rhinitis <END> ( MLS 5.55, identity by descent ( IBD ) 63.9% ) and <START:disease> atopy <END> ( increased specific <START:ggp> immunoglobulin E <END> ) ( MLS 3.71, IBD 61.7% ).
We obtained an MLS of 5.1 ( IBD 67.3% ) at <START:ggp> 3q13.31 <END> when <START:organism> sib pairs <END> with both <START:disease> rhinitis <END> and <START:disease> atopy <END> were analysed.
Conclusion This study reports the first statistically significant evidence for a <START:ggp> genetic susceptibility locus <END> for <START:disease> rhinitis <END> and to our knowledge shows the most significant evidence to date of linkage for any <START:bf> allergy phenotype <END> .
<START:bf> Innate immunity <END> and intestinal microbiota in the development of <START:disease> Type 1 diabetes <END> 
<START:disease> Type 1 diabetes <END> ( <START:disease> T1D <END> ) is a debilitating <START:disease> autoimmune disease <END> that results from <START:bf> T cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing ? cells <END> .
Its incidence has increased during the past several decades in developed countries 1 , 2 , suggesting that changes in the environment ( including <START:organism> human <END> microbial environment ) may influence <START:bf> disease pathogenesis <END> .
The incidence of spontaneous <START:disease> T1D <END> in <START:organism> non-obese diabetic ( NOD ) mice <END> can be affected by the microbial environment in the animal housing facility 3 or by exposure to microbial stimuli, such as injection with <START:organism> mycobacteria <END> or various <START:ched> microbial products <END> 4 , 5 .
Here we show that <START:organism> specific-pathogen free ( SPF ) NOD mice <END> lacking <START:ggp> MyD88 protein <END> ( an adaptor for <START:ggp> multiple innate immune receptors <END> that recognize microbial stimuli ) do not develop <START:disease> T1D <END> .
The effect is dependent on commensal <START:organism> microbes <END> as <START:organism> germ-free ( GF ) MyD88-negative NOD mice <END> develop robust <START:disease> diabetes <END> , whereas colonization of these <START:organism> GF NOD.MyD88-negative mice <END> with a defined microbial consortium ( representing bacterial phyla normally present in <START:anatomy> human gut <END> ) attenuates <START:disease> T1D <END> .
We also find that <START:bf> MyD88-deficiency <END> changes the composition of the distal <START:anatomy> gut <END> microbiota, and that exposure to the microbiota of <START:organism> SPF NOD.MyD88-negative donors <END> attenuates <START:disease> T1D <END> in <START:organism> GF NOD recipients <END> .
Together, these findings indicate that interaction of the <START:organism> intestinal microbes <END> with the <START:anatomy> innate immune system <END> is a critical epigenetic factor modifying <START:bf> T1D predisposition <END> .
Persistent activation of an <START:anatomy> innate immune axis <END> translates <START:disease> respiratory viral infection <END> into <START:disease> chronic lung disease <END> 
To understand the <START:bf> pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disease <END> , we analyzed an <START:organism> experimental mouse model <END> of a <START:disease> chronic lung disease <END> that resembles <START:disease> asthma <END> and <START:disease> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> ( <START:disease> COPD <END> ) in <START:organism> humans <END> .
In this <START:organism> model <END> , <START:disease> chronic lung disease <END> develops after <START:disease> infection <END> with a <START:organism> common type <END> of <START:organism> respiratory virus <END> is cleared to trace levels of <START:organism> noninfectious virus <END> .
Unexpectedly, the <START:disease> chronic inflammatory disease <END> arises independently of an <START:bf> adaptive immune response <END> and is driven by <START:ggp> IL-13 <END> produced by <START:anatomy> macrophages <END> stimulated by CD1d-dependent TCR-invariant <START:anatomy> NKT cells <END> .
This <START:anatomy> innate immune axis <END> is also activated in the <START:anatomy> lungs <END> of <START:organism> humans <END> with <START:disease> chronic airway disease <END> due to <START:disease> asthma <END> or <START:disease> COPD <END> .
These findings provide new insight into the <START:bf> pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disease <END> with the discovery that the transition from <START:disease> respiratory viral infection <END> into <START:disease> chronic lung disease <END> requires persistent activation of a novel <START:anatomy> NKT cell-macrophage innate immune axis <END> .
Dissecting the Genetic Complexity of the Association between <START:anatomy> Human Leukocyte Antigens <END> and <START:disease> Rheumatoid Arthritis <END> 
<START:disease> Rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:disease> RA <END> ) is an <START:disease> inflammatory disease <END> with a complex genetic component.
An association between <START:disease> RA <END> and the <START:anatomy> human leukocyte antigen <END> ( <START:anatomy> HLA <END> ) complex has long been observed in many different populations, and most studies have focused on a direct role for the <START:ggp> HLA-DRB1 <END> âshared epitopeâ
We have performed an extensive <START:ggp> haplotype <END> analysis, using 54 markers distributed across the entire <START:anatomy> HLA <END> complex, in a set of 469 multicase families with <START:disease> RA <END> .
The results show that, in addition to associations with the <START:ggp> DRB1 alleles <END> , at least two additional genetic effects are present within the major histocompatibility complex.
One of these lies within a 497-kb region in the central portion of the <START:anatomy> HLA <END> complex, an interval that excludes <START:ggp> DRB1 <END> .
This genetic risk factor is present on a segment of a highly conserved ancestral <START:ggp> A1-B8-DRB1*03 ( 8.1 ) haplotype <END> .
Additional risk genes may also be present in the <START:anatomy> HLA <END> class I region in a subset of <START:ggp> DRB1*0404 haplotypes <END> .
These data emphasize the importance of defining <START:ggp> haplotypes <END> when trying to understand the <START:anatomy> HLA <END> associations with disease, and they clearly demonstrate that such associations with <START:disease> RA <END> are complex and cannot be completely explained by the <START:ggp> DRB1 <END> locus.
A new model for <START:disease> dermatitis herpetiformis <END> that uses <START:organism> HLA-DQ8 transgenic NOD mice <END> 
<START:disease> Dermatitis herpetiformis <END> ( <START:disease> DH <END> ) is an <START:disease> autoimmune blistering skin disorder <END> that is associated with <START:ched> gluten <END> sensitivity.
It presents as a <START:bf> papulovesicular rash <END> and is often associated with <START:anatomy> enteropathy <END> .
The <START:bf> rash <END> resolves when the <START:organism> patient <END> is placed on a <START:ched> gluten <END> -free diet and/or <START:ched> dapsone <END> .
<START:disease> DH, <END> as well as <START:disease> celiac disease <END> , is tightly associated with <START:ggp> DQ2 <END> and <START:ggp> DQ8 <END> .
A novel <START:organism> mouse <END> model for <START:disease> DH <END> is described that utilizes the NOD background and the <START:ggp> HLA-DQ8 <END> transgene.
The addition of <START:ggp> DQ8 <END> contributes sensitivity to <START:ched> gliadin <END> , and the addition of the NOD background contributes to <START:bf> autoimmunity <END> and <START:bf> pathogenesis <END> .
Fifteen <START:organism> NOD DQ8+ mice <END> of 90 that were sensitized to <START:ched> gluten <END> developed <START:bf> blistering <END> pathology similar to that seen in <START:disease> DH <END> .
<START:bf> Neutrophil infiltration of the dermis <END> , <START:bf> deposition of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction <END> , and a <START:bf> complete reversal of the blistering phenomenon <END> with the administration of a <START:ched> gluten <END> -free diet with or without <START:ched> dapsone <END> were observed.
None of the 3 <START:organism> blistering mice <END> examined had <START:anatomy> small-bowel <END> pathology.
This animal model of <START:disease> DH <END> will be useful to determine the specificity of the <START:bf> IgA deposits <END> , as well as the pathogenic mechanisms that occur in the <START:anatomy> skin <END> as a result of <START:ched> gluten <END> ingestion.
